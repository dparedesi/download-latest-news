The Shiba Inu (SHIB) community is ramping up efforts to advocate for a SHIB-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF), calling on major asset management firms like BlackRock and Grayscale Investments to take action. Momentum behind the initiative has been growing rapidly, with a Change.org petition directed at Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein surpassing 16,666 signatures as of press time. Meanwhile, influential SHIB group “Shibzens” have recently outlined compelling reasons why SHIB deserves ETF status, drawing parallels to the recent success of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. As per the group, one of the strongest arguments for a SHIB ETF is the cryptocurrency’s massive and highly engaged community. With millions of holders actively participating in the SHIB ecosystem, it argued that the token enjoys a loyal user base that could drive demand, liquidity, and long-term price stability, key factors for a successful ETF. Shiba Inu’s Layer-2 blockchain, Shibarium, further strengthens its case. Since its launch in August 2023, the group emphasized that Shibarium has introduced real-world utility by powering decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, gaming projects, and payment solutions. The network also supports ecosystem tokens like BONE, used for gas fees, and TREAT, which could be incorporated into a diversified SHIB ETF, expanding its investment appeal. Another major factor is affordability. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, which can be expensive for small investors, SHIB’s low price per token makes it an accessible entry point for retail traders. This inclusivity allows a broader investor base to gain crypto exposure, while SHIB’s high trading volume and strong liquidity provide a solid foundation for institutional ETF products. A SHIB ETF could also align with Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investment strategies. The Shib Karma Foundation, a philanthropic initiative within the SHIB ecosystem, highlights the community’s commitment to social good. Additionally, SHIB’s growing adoption across industries, including gaming and payments, demonstrates its increasing real-world relevance and utility. This push comes amid significant political and institutional shifts that signal a growing acceptance of cryptocurrency, further strengthening the case for a SHIB ETF. Former U.S. President Donald Trump recently acknowledged major digital assets like XRP, Solana, and Cardano, fueling speculation that increased regulatory clarity could benefit altcoins like SHIB. On Friday, the President hosted the first-ever White House Crypto Summit, bringing together key figures in the crypto industry. Among them was Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, a well-known advocate for meme-based assets whose involvement has further bolstered optimism. The SHIB community led by lead developer Shytoshi Kusama have expressed optimism that Tenev could play a role in advocating for the inclusion of meme coins like SHIB and Dogecoin in the discussions. That said, while BlackRock and Grayscale have yet to submit a formal application for a SHIB ETF, the precedent set by Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs proves that crypto-based investment products are viable. With strong community backing, increasing adoption, and favorable market trends, Shibizens believe SHIB is next in line.

AVAX’s rapid user growth in 2025 highlights potential for a breakout. And yet, it’s largely overlooked. Avalanche [AVAX] has been quietly gaining momentum, with new user sign-ups surging in Q1 2025. While the market often fixates on Ethereum’s L2 boom and Bitcoin ETFs, Avalanche’s rapid adoption has been overlooked somewhat. In fact, history suggests that user growth often precedes major price shifts. With DeFi and GameFi activity accelerating, could Avalanche be positioning itself as the next breakout L1? Avalanche’s new user growth has seen clear fluctuations over the past two years, with periodic cycles of rapid expansion followed by cooling-off periods. In fact, the latest surge in early 2025 was one of the strongest spikes since mid-2023. It saw monthly new users exceeding 600,000 and average daily sign-ups surpassing 6,000 at its peak. This seemed to be in stark contrast to mid-to-late 2024, when user acquisition stagnated below 200,000 per month. Source: X The pattern suggested that Avalanche tends to experience bursts of adoption, likely triggered by key ecosystem developments or broader market conditions. If this trend continues, the Q1 2025 spike could signal renewed investor and developer interest, potentially setting the stage for sustained growth. Avalanche’s recent surge can be attributed to a $250 million investment in December 2024, led by Galaxy Digital and Dragonfly Capital, aimed at expanding its ecosystem. Additionally, the Avalanche9000 upgrade, launched on 16 December, reduced transaction fees by 75% – Driving a 38% hike in daily transactions and further boosting network activity. Institutional adoption has been rising too, with major players like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton leveraging Avalanche for tokenized funds. Despite its surge in new users, Avalanche remains largely absent from mainstream crypto discussions. Much of the market’s attention is focused on Ethereum’s L2 expansion and Bitcoin ETF inflows, leaving Avalanche’s growth relatively overlooked. Media coverage has also been skewed, with Ethereum roll-ups and Solana’s memecoin frenzy dominating headlines. Another factor contributing to its relative silence is the lack of high-profile endorsements. Unlike Solana, which benefits from outspoken backers like Visa and Jump Crypto, Avalanche is yet to secure a similarly visible champion. However, this under-the-radar momentum might create an opportunity for early adopters positioning themselves ahead of a broader market realization. Source: IntoTheBlock IntoTheBlock data indicated that AVAX’s price action has closely followed whale activity, with occasional spikes in large transactions aligning with price movements. This suggested that institutional and whale investors remain engaged, though sustained accumulation might be uncertain. Source: IntoTheBlock Finally, there is a correlation between active addresses in profit and AVAX’s price cycles. Historically, sharp increases in profitable addresses have often preceded local price tops, while periods of underwater holders have set the stage for recoveries. If these patterns hold, AVAX could see further upside in 2025, provided demand remains strong and broader market conditions are favorable.

UPDATED 10:58 EST / MARCH 08 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Since the generative artificial intelligence awakening, we’ve said consistently that Nvidia Corp. and Broadcom Inc. are the No. 1 and No. 2 AI plays in tech. Since peaking in mid-December of last year, Broadcom shares have been under pressure, down on sympathy with other semiconductor stocks and the general confusion about the economy, tariffs, inflation, jobs, geopolitics, debt and more. Broadcom’s fiscal first-quarter results were impressive and support our base case for the company. They also calmed some investor concerns, at least for now. At one point the night after the earnings print, Broadcom’s stock was up 15% from its previous close, and finished up nearly 9% on Friday, despite a down day in tech. Market transitions such as the one we’re in now often bring confusion and market volatility as the new high-growth sectors are not big enough to offset the slowdown in the larger declining markets. Nvidia doesn’t have this problem because it is at the mainspring of the new wave. Broadcom is facing a similar but different situation in that its traditional businesses are ones that are extremely durable. Moreover, we see two relatively new dynamics coming into play for Broadcom: 1) Multiple high-volume hyperscalers are coming to Broadcom to enable their custom AI accelerators; and 2) Broadcom’s VMware strategy is working, lifting the company to new software heights. In this Breaking Analysis, we pivot off of Broadcom’s Q1 earnings to revisit our thesis on the company. That premise has centered on the idea that connectivity both within the XPU complex and across distributed clusters remains a massive opportunity for Broadcom, combined with a radically new strategy for VMware that is delivering results much in the way as we projected. We initiated our Broadcom coverage in earnest on Breaking Analysis about three years ago, triggered by the VMware acquisition. Several of our research notes are shown below, tracking the company’s semiconductor and expanding software business. Let’s start by looking at how Broadcom applied its ethos to VMware. Broadcom’s acquisition strategy for VMware — initiated several years ago — has been executed in almost exact alignment with leadership’s publicly stated plans. Initially, industry observers were skeptical about Broadcom’s ability to “tame the VMware beast,” given VMware’s historically broad portfolio and aspirational visions. The subsequent narrowing of VMware’s focus, increased attention to core products, and elevated pricing strategy all confirm that Broadcom is following a well-defined operational model. Specifically, we expected Broadcom to focus research and development to prioritize core value areas, shed non-performing assets and push customers toward bundled subscription offerings. Though this tactic has created frustration among longtime VMware users accustomed to perpetual licensing structures, it has also driven measurable gains in revenue and profitability. This shift forces customers onto higher-value contract models, which in turn boosts average deal sizes. Notably, many critics attribute the changes to “price hikes,” although Broadcom characterizes them as “increased value.” There is legitimate merit to Broadcom’s assertions, despite the forced move to bundling. We documented this on theCUBE with Broadcom’s Drew Nielsen last summer at VMware Explore. We found the economic analysis to be fair and defensible, with the fundamental and controversial assumption that customers go “all in” on the VCF bundle. In our opinion, one of Broadcom CEO Hock Tan’s defining traits is a high “do:say” ratio. By closely examining past statements, we find that Broadcom’s strategic moves consistently align with Tan’s predictions. Our research suggests that customers — though often uncomfortable with the forced transition to subscription and bundled packages — benefit from a company that reliably executes on its roadmap. This level of predictability resonates with financial stakeholders, despite short-term challenges in the customer and partner ecosystems. Broadcom’s operational philosophy was highlighted last year at MWC, better known as Mobile World Congress, during discussions with the company’s semiconductor chief, Charlie Kawwas. The consistent message emphasized Broadcom’s ability to drive durable business outcomes and navigate new frontiers such as AI, all while applying the same methodical, profit-oriented approach. We believe these insights reinforce a unified corporate ethos — one that systematically applies proven processes to each new acquisition and market challenge. Though critics may continue to voice concerns about Broadcom’s vision for VMware’s combined offerings and licensing approaches, our research indicates that Broadcom’s results and track record of fulfilling stated goals cannot be dismissed. Customers that have long enjoyed perpetual licenses are being pushed toward subscriptions, often experiencing sticker shock in the process. Nonetheless, our data suggests that many of these organizations are willing to absorb the transition if they see tangible returns and ongoing product innovation. In our view, this dynamic underscores the importance of aligning cost structures with demonstrated value. Despite market chatter about negative customer experiences, Broadcom’s consistent execution has validated its strategic plan and strengthened its reputation on Wall Street. We believe the transition to a subscription-based model — though abrupt for some — reinforces Broadcom’s broader ambition of extracting higher margins and focusing on profitable, core technology areas. Our research indicates that VMware’s licensing and pricing changes — initiated under Broadcom’s stewardship — have triggered noticeable market backlash, which is reflected in the Enterprise Technology Research data. This data illustrates customer sentiments and spending intentions across several hundred VMware accounts, spanning various product lines. In our view, the most striking evidence of this negative reaction lies in the shift in Net Score — a metric similar to a Net Promoter Score except Net Score applies to spending intentions. Below we show the ETR methodology applied to VMware. Net Score tracks the percent of more than 700 VMware customers in the ETR survey within the following categories as shown above: Collectively, we see Net Score, which subtracts the red from the green and is reflected in the blue line, dipping from the mid-20s into negative territory, suggesting that VMware is experiencing real pressure in the market. The pervasion metric — VMware’s percentage of overall customers in the ETR survey — also declined, reinforcing the narrative that some organizations are walking away from or reducing their VMware footprints. One would look at these results and come to the conclusion that VMWare is in real trouble. But that conclusion is not correct. On the chart above the vertical axis is Net Score or spending momentum, what we just explained in the previous chart, and you can see the dot plots for VMware over time. VMware’s Net Score went from around 20% down to the negative territory. It kept steadily tumbling since January of 2023. We’ve plotted Nutanix, Ubuntu, and Red Hat, picking three target platforms that potentially people would migrate to. We left Microsoft out because it always skews the data. One would look at this data and think it’s really bad news for VMware, but the reality is that this doesn’t reflect revenue — it’s an account-based metrics. In our opinion, these trends reflect a combination of higher costs, forced migrations to subscription bundles, and significant shifts in VMware’s operating model post-acquisition. VMware’s large installed base suggests that Broadcom is comfortable with the negative impact of abrupt pricing changes, reduced flexibility and low margin customer defections. The evidence shows that many customers continue to invest in VMware solutions, suggesting that the company retains a measure of loyalty, albeit forced, and a core foundation on which it can rebuild. Going forward, we believe it will be critical for VMware to strike a balance between monetization and customer satisfaction. This means a continued investment in core functionality and innovation, including supporting AI workloads with what VMware terms “Private AI” — that is, on-premises workloads. In our view, the driving rationale behind Broadcom’s evolving business model is shown below and describes the pressures facing traditional hardware infrastructure — specifically server, storage and networking. These segments are increasingly squeezed by advances in silicon, cloud economics and software, which continue to take value from the middle of the stack. As a result, Broadcom has systematically repositioned itself, participating more aggressively in two key value-creation areas: Last year at MWC 2024, Kawwas underscored the crucial role of networking in AI workloads. When scaling beyond single XPUs, interconnecting massive clusters becomes paramount. According to Kawwas, the inability to scale up to thousands of XPUs effectively — without the right networking strategy — diminishes performance and efficiency. In our view, Broadcom’s approach highlights its capacity to integrate hardware and software solutions that address the full scope of AI’s demands. [Kawwas explains the changes to connectivity required by AI workloads.] When you talk AI, everything has changed because with AI, you have these elephant workloads that cannot run on a single processor, whether it’s a GPU, TPU, NPU, the flavor of the day, let’s call them for the next 15 minutes XPUs. If you take these XPUs, and you take some of these elephant workloads, you can’t run them on a single XPU. You can’t even run them on eight CPUs or XPUs or GPUs, you have to now scale into the thousands today, thousands of these. In order to do that, you’ve transcended now a single system where you’ve scaled up. Now you have to scale out to many, many of these systems and racks, and you have to interconnect them. And guess what? If you don’t have the right network strategy and connectivity strategy, this will not work, this will not scale up. – Charlie Kawwas, Broadcom The conversation around AI also surfaces a notable duopoly in the networking space with only two company’s truly able to excel at connectivity within the chip and across large-scale clusters: We believe competition will intensify as AI expands beyond traditional data center workflows, but the massive market for flexible, high-performance network fabrics is booming. Though each player differentiates via proprietary versus more open approaches, the rapidly growing size of the AI market suggests headroom for both to thrive. Overall, we believe Broadcom’s strategy of balancing semiconductor innovation with infrastructure software is well-positioned to address the next wave of high-performance, AI-driven workloads. The one area we’ve felt was lacking for VMware has been its lack of a clear data strategy. It appears VMware generally will leave the data piece to its customers and others in the ecosystem to sort out. In reviewing Broadcom’s performance from May 2022 to March 2025, the numbers paint a vivid picture of how the VMware acquisition has fundamentally altered the company’s profile. The most striking theme is the accelerating shift toward software: Our analysis indicates that, while some legacy VMware customers are exiting due to price hikes or dissatisfaction with forced subscriptions, Broadcom remains focused on high-value customers willing to adopt its full VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) stack. According to Broadcom, approximately 70% of its top 10,000 customers have migrated to VCF, driving improvements in gross and operating margins. Those customers no longer aligned with Broadcom’s direction are effectively being pruned from the portfolio. Beyond VMware, Broadcom continues to leverage the surge in AI-driven workloads: One of the few negatives in Broadcom’s financial picture is free cash flow as a percentage of revenue, down from over 50% to around 40%. Management attributes the decline to several factors: Despite these headwinds, investors appear willing to tolerate near-term pressures in light of Broadcom’s operating discipline and rapid revenue expansion. Critics often liken Broadcom to a private equity firm, arguing it narrows R&D investment and focuses on near-term extraction. However, from our perspective, Broadcom employs a deliberate approach to concentrate R&D on core technologies (for example, Tomahawk switches, SerDes, custom silicon for hyperscalers). While it curtails broad experimentation, it invests heavily in targeted areas with strong returns — contributing to robust margins and a notable market valuation surge. Looking ahead, Broadcom’s strong orientation toward software, AI and custom silicon positions it to regain the trillion-dollar market-cap mark if current momentum continues. The TAM expansion signaled by Tan ($60 billion to $90 billion excluding the four new design wins), coming from hyperscaler demand for XPUs and AI infrastructure, further bolsters the bullish case. The chart above, developed by David Floyer, depicts total data center spending worldwide — including servers, storage, networking, power and cooling, and also hyperscale infrastructure. After years of relative flatness and even contraction in 2020, the market has entered a super cycle fueled by “extreme parallel processing” or EPP, or what Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang often calls accelerated computing. Overall, the data center market is entering an era where parallel processing becomes the default architecture for emerging workloads, driving unprecedented growth and reshaping vendor strategies. From an investor perspective, companies enabling EPP — particularly in the areas of specialized compute, high-speed networking and AI acceleration — stand to capture significant new value as the market rockets toward a trillion dollars and beyond. Broadcom and Nvidia in our view are two of the most well-positioned “picks and shovel” companies that will benefit from the growth of this market. Broadcom now counts three primary hyperscalers (Meta, Google, ByteDance) plus two additional disclosed, plus two more unnamed design wins. In our view, these design wins anchor Broadcom’s strategy of mixing custom and merchant silicon, complemented by a robust software business. Broadcom’s durable approach — projects lasting 10 years or more — mirrors its history of building deep moats and reliable profit engines. The company highlights a $60 billion to $90 billion SAM by 2027 for its AI-related offerings, excluding the potential upside from the newly added “+2” hyperscalers. According to company statements, Broadcom’s AI business currently operates at a $16 billion run rate, growing at 40% to 50% (with a notable 77% spike in the latest quarter). These figures underscore a trajectory that could elevate Broadcom to a scale comparable to other top AI enablers such as Nvidia. Despite Broadcom’s positive momentum, regulatory questions loom. Hock Tan has been queried on how AI export restrictions and technology diffusion rules might impede sales to Chinese hyperscalers (for example, ByteDance and Alibaba). Though Broadcom can partially tailor its silicon to comply with controls (for example, down-tuning certain features), it ultimately cannot dictate geopolitical policy. The company’s ability to navigate these evolving restrictions will be crucial for sustaining future growth. Broadcom stands out as a durable, highly profitable enterprise, enjoying both near-term gains in AI networking and longer-term expansions of its custom silicon customer base. Though there are real risks — especially around export controls and an uncertain geopolitical environment — the company’s diversified approach, deep moats and robust margin profile suggest a compelling story for investors. Whether one is bullish, bearish or neutral likely depends on risk tolerance for regulatory issues and belief in Broadcom’s capacity to execute on its design wins. What do you think? Is Broadcom’s software strategy forcing you to rethink your on-prem infrastructure partners? Or are you staying the course and sticking with VMware, defecting or taking a hybrid approach?

However, from our perspective, Broadcom employs a deliberate approach to concentrate R&D on core technologies (for example, Tomahawk switches, SerDes, custom silicon for hyperscalers). While it curtails broad experimentation, it invests heavily in targeted areas with strong returns — contributing to robust margins and a notable market valuation surge. Looking ahead, Broadcom’s strong orientation toward software, AI and custom silicon positions it to regain the trillion-dollar market-cap mark if current momentum continues. The TAM expansion signaled by Tan ($60 billion to $90 billion excluding the four new design wins), coming from hyperscaler demand for XPUs and AI infrastructure, further bolsters the bullish case. The chart above, developed by David Floyer, depicts total data center spending worldwide — including servers, storage, networking, power and cooling, and also hyperscale infrastructure. After years of relative flatness and even contraction in 2020, the market has entered a super cycle fueled by “extreme parallel processing” or EPP, or what Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang often calls accelerated computing. Overall, the data center market is entering an era where parallel processing becomes the default architecture for emerging workloads, driving unprecedented growth and reshaping vendor strategies. From an investor perspective, companies enabling EPP — particularly in the areas of specialized compute, high-speed networking and AI acceleration — stand to capture significant new value as the market rockets toward a trillion dollars and beyond. Broadcom and Nvidia in our view are two of the most well-positioned “picks and shovel” companies that will benefit from the growth of this market. Broadcom now counts three primary hyperscalers (Meta, Google, ByteDance) plus two additional disclosed, plus two more unnamed design wins. In our view, these design wins anchor Broadcom’s strategy of mixing custom and merchant silicon, complemented by a robust software business. Broadcom’s durable approach — projects lasting 10 years or more — mirrors its history of building deep moats and reliable profit engines. The company highlights a $60 billion to $90 billion SAM by 2027 for its AI-related offerings, excluding the potential upside from the newly added “+2” hyperscalers. According to company statements, Broadcom’s AI business currently operates at a $16 billion run rate, growing at 40% to 50% (with a notable 77% spike in the latest quarter). These figures underscore a trajectory that could elevate Broadcom to a scale comparable to other top AI enablers such as Nvidia. Despite Broadcom’s positive momentum, regulatory questions loom. Hock Tan has been queried on how AI export restrictions and technology diffusion rules might impede sales to Chinese hyperscalers (for example, ByteDance and Alibaba). Though Broadcom can partially tailor its silicon to comply with controls (for example, down-tuning certain features), it ultimately cannot dictate geopolitical policy. The company’s ability to navigate these evolving restrictions will be crucial for sustaining future growth. Broadcom stands out as a durable, highly profitable enterprise, enjoying both near-term gains in AI networking and longer-term expansions of its custom silicon customer base. Though there are real risks — especially around export controls and an uncertain geopolitical environment — the company’s diversified approach, deep moats and robust margin profile suggest a compelling story for investors. Whether one is bullish, bearish or neutral likely depends on risk tolerance for regulatory issues and belief in Broadcom’s capacity to execute on its design wins. What do you think? Is Broadcom’s software strategy forcing you to rethink your on-prem infrastructure partners? Or are you staying the course and sticking with VMware, defecting or taking a hybrid approach?

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, March 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: RKLB) and reminds investors of the April 28, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Rocket Lab’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Title: I’ve spent a week taking on fighting game competitors with the Turtle Beach Victrix Pro KO and it's the game-changer that might finally convert me from a fight stick

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The Turtle Beach Victrix Pro KO is one of the most customizable leverless fighting game controllers yet, while still retaining the comfortable ergonomics of its flagship fight sticks. It will still take many more hours of mental rewiring if you're used to a traditional joystick, but with additional customizable buttons to suit your playstyle, there's no better way to transition over to this fighting game meta. Customizable button placements right out of the box Thin, light design but still with a comfortable wrist slope on the surface Switching out buttons is very easy More affordable than the standard Victrix stick Bulkier than other leverless options Leverless controls take time to adjust Why you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you’re buying the best. Find out more about how we test. The Turtle Beach Victrix Pro KO is the latest premium take on the leverless all-button controllers that have been transforming the fighting game community's meta in recent years, built for the current generation of consoles while still backwards compatible with last-gen consoles at the click of a switch (while the controllers are also compatible with PC, you will need to buy separate controllers for PlayStation and Xbox consoles). It's a much sleeker build than Victrix's previous attempt at a leverless controller while retaining similar features, such as customizable LED lights, a three-meter braided USB-C cable, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and a comfortable ergonomic 6.28-degree wrist slope on its surface to prevent fatigue. It also includes L3 and R3 buttons that the Pro FS models lacked, while naturally including a tournament lock switch to disable all the other buttons on the top bar. Where the Pro KO really stands out from the other contenders vying to be one of the best fight sticks is just how customizable its buttons are, with the space for 16 mappable and movable buttons compared to the default 12 of other leverless controllers. With spare buttons provided within the shell of the controller, an easy-to-pop-open cover, and tweezers that make changing buttons accessible straight out of the box, it's an easily customizable controller where you can add and program new buttons that are most comfortable to reach for your play style. Being available at a better comparable price to similar options at launch makes it an excellent choice for players looking to convert to a leverless control style. While fighting pros will praise leverless controllers as more precise and immediate compared to a traditional arcade stick, it's still not the superior option without retraining muscle memory and getting used to the layout, even if being able to add a different place for the up / jump button can help with the adjustment. But for those prepared to put in the work and make the transition, the Pro KO is the best leverless controller to make that move. Launching in December 2024, the price point of the Victrix Pro KO is about right for other leverless controllers right now. It's much cheaper than the Victrix Pro FS-12 and better priced than its closest competitor the Razer Kitsune, which launched at $299, making it a relative bargain considering the wealth of additional customization offered out of the box. For pad players looking to take their fighting game prowess to the next level, the Victrix Pro KO is definitely a better price choice than shelling out for its premium arcade stick equivalent the Victrix Pro FS, which is among the most expensive fight sticks at the moment (it is however still my stick of choice). Stock is unfortunately in short supply for the PlayStation model currently, with Amazon taking orders but warning that shipping can take anywhere from three to six months. It's likely because PS5 consoles have largely been the preferred platform for tournaments, but if you're predominantly playing on PC then you might be better off going for the Xbox version, which is more widely available. Price $249.99 / £229.99 / AU$399.95 Dimensions 13.35 x 9.23 x 0.8in / 23.5 x 33.53 x 2.24cm Weight 2.7lbs / 1.225kg Compatibility PS5, PS4, PC or Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC Connection type Wired (USB-C) Buttons Cheery MX Speed Silver RGB Customization Buttons Software N/A Compared to Victrix's previous attempt at a leverless controller with the Pro FS-12, which essentially kept the same bulk and weight of its Pro FS arcade stick, the Pro KO is a substantial improvement, leveraging the leverless controller's strength as a lighter and more compact option. While its dimensions are still larger than competitors like the Razer Kitsune, it's still a comfortable size for taking to tournaments, slipping neatly into my laptop bag, or the strap bars on the side give you the option to add shoulder straps. The extra real estate is important for your hands though, as the surface incorporates a 6.28° wrist slope just like with Victrix's Pro FS models, which does wonders for preventing fatigue when playing for lengthy sessions. There are also more buttons on the top including dedicated L3 and R3 buttons while the PlayStation version includes the DualSense touchpad on the top left corner, all of which can be disabled with a tournament lock switch on the top-right corner to prevent accidentally pressing them during a heated tournament match. The 24-millimeter buttons are smaller than typical arcade sticks but the same size as other leverless designs, along with the single 30-millimeter button for the up / jump button that's designed to be within reach of your thumb, similar to a space bar. It's not the only comparison to a keyboard as the buttons are also comprised of Cherry MX Speed Silver RGB switches used in mechanical keyboards, making these buttons just as tactile and responsive as Sanwa Denshi buttons favored by professional fighting game players. While the controller has 12 buttons by default, what you'll notice are four other indents (one to the left of the directional buttons, two below the usual command buttons, and one to the left of the up/jump button) where other buttons can be added. These aren't optional extras, for when you pop out the top cover, by flicking the four switches beneath the controller base, you'll find that it snugly fits four spare buttons and switches, as well as a pair of tweezers that make it easy to remove the round caps and then add new buttons, or even replace a faulty button. Once added, you simply need to hold the function button on the top bar and then choose the button you want to map the new button to. It's just as easy to customize the color lighting for the button rings, while also adjusting the mode from static to breathing, prismatic, or you can simply turn them off if you prefer. When it comes down to it, the reason to own the Victrix Pro KO is because of how much more responsive and reliable just tapping directional inputs is than with a stick. In Street Fighter 6, instead of fumbling two-quarter circles to perform a super, I just need to tap down, forward, down forward, while a charge attack is more immediate if you're just tapping the button instead of moving the stick and back and forth, which may all seem like tiny fractions of milliseconds of a difference, but in any competitive environment, those all count. Arcade purists may sniff at these controllers, which had also caught controversy for being potentially too advantageous, leading to a few instances of leverless controllers being banned at some tournaments, not to mention that the Victrix Pro KO lacks Sanwa Denshi parts that the Pro FS-12 has. Yet in terms of tactility, the Cherry switches were every bit as clickable and responsive in my testing. If you're very new to leverless controllers, however, you shouldn't take them as an immediately superior controller compared to other existing options. Using buttons for directions intrinsically requires different muscle memory from using a stick - it's about the placement of your fingers and thumb over all the directional inputs rather than your thumb on a pad or your whole arm when using a stick. Personally, I still find it difficult to adjust to having the up / jump button located at the bottom, even though it's actually where you would expect a space bar to be, and so I found myself less capable of utilizing aerial moves. While there is arguably more precision in button inputs, that's only without factoring in pressure during an actual match. It's one thing to flawlessly execute supers in training mode but against an online opponent, I would still find myself tapping the inputs too fast incorrectly in the same way I can fluff the same inputs with a joystick. Nonetheless, as far as it goes to learning leverless controls, I found the Victrix Pro KO's button layout better than when I had previously tried the Razer Kitsune, which was a little more spread out and caused my left hand to cramp when trying to keep each digit over a respective directional button. The customizable button placements also greatly help with the adjustment. In my case, adding another jump button further to the left felt more reachable for my thumb, while adding another button just under the other attack buttons meant I could program a one-button parry that's far easier to reach. Ultimately, while I see myself improving in leverless controls the more I'm using the Victrix Pro KO, I'm still not confident in having it replace my Victrix Pro FS stick as my controller of choice at the next local tournament. After swapping back to a stick, I was simply more comfortable with a mix of air-to-air follow-ups that my brain had been struggling to compute with buttons- alone. If you however don't already have decades of arcade fighting game experience lodged in your brain and are also used to playing games with a keyboard, then going leverless is likely going to feel like a natural progression. You want one of the most customizable leverless controllers aroundLeverless controllers are already touted for their more responsive performance you have an even greater advantage by being able to easily add and program more buttons right out of the box. You want the same features as the Victrix sticks but with a lighter form factorThe Victrix Pro KO has a lighter and sleeker form factor comparable to other leverless controllers but still has the same great features as its fellow Victrix sticks such as the ergonomic wrist slope and the option to add a shoulder strap for carrying it around. You're expecting a superior controller overnightLeverless controllers may offer more precise and responsive inputs in theory but it also requires a lot of practice and mental rewiring if you've been used to arcade sticks or gamepads for many years.

Just be warned of its weight, size, and the need to spend more on extra compatible cables. For more information, check out our full Octopus Arcade Stick review With Street Fighter 6 being my regular fighting game fixture on the PS5, I swapped out my dependable Victrix Pro FS for the Victrix Pro KO for a week, though occasionally swapping back to get a comparison on the different feel of each controller. Firstly practicing offline with the newly added character Mai I gradually took the courage to adapt to leverless controls against other online opponents, getting my fair share of wins but also plenty of defeats, and making note of where I felt an improvement in using this controller and what felt like new limitations. I also played some matches while using the controller's audio jack with my Corsair Virtuoso Pro wired headset. On my gaming PC, I was able to test it out on the newly released Virtua Fighter 5 REVO, where I also started with some practice in arcade mode before attempting to take it online and making some progress in ranked matches. This was however an easier adjustment from Street Fighter 6 owing to fewer inputs while the up button is used less for jumping and more for side-stepping. Overall, I played around 8-10 hours with the Victrix Pro KO between both games, though arguably more so on Street Fighter 6 because it really is the best.

Title: Pile into Persian rugs: Peter Linden collection at Adam’s

Antique rugs and carpets often don’t get the attention they deserve at auctions, yet these incredibly detailed decorative furnishings carry a rich heritage of highly skilled craftwork and symbolic imagery inspired by nature, mythology and world religions. That said, the exotic patterns and geographical origins of handwoven Persian rugs have captivated collectors for centuries. With natural dyes made from berries, insects, minerals and seeds, the dye recipes and weaving techniques in different regions were often carefully guarded secrets. In Ireland, the Swedish-born Per Lindfors (aka Peter Linden) was an acclaimed expert on antique carpets, rugs kilims and tapestries. From a young age, he soaked up knowledge of Persian rugs from his father – an avid collector – and his connections with Persian rug experts in Stockholm. And when he moved to Ireland, he ran the Peter Linden Gallery in Blackrock from 1979 until 2006. Thereafter, he continued to work at antique fairs and advise private clients worldwide on the provenance of antique carpets and rugs. His death in July 2024 marked the end of an era. In an interview with The Irish Times in 2019, Lindfors advised buyers to be alert to carpets, which have a darker colour at the root of the pile, as this indicates the dye is inferior quality. It may also mean that it has been given an antique wash, ie a chemical bath and left to age in the sun afterwards to make it look much older. Carpets are considered to be antique when they are 100 years old. Now, Adam’s – who previously sold much of the contents of the Peter Linden gallery in 2006- are selling the remaining stock, alongside some of his personal collection which he enjoyed with his wife, Celine, in their Dublin home. Some striking examples, from the auction of 94 lots, include: an antique Milas prayer rug from 1850, its border decorated with Solomon stars and blossoms (€3,500-€5,000); a Tree-of-Life Isfahan rug circa 1890-1900 decorated with elaborate foliage and birds framing a central vase (€700-€1,000); and an old Dobag carpet, hand knotted in Turkey 1995 (€3,500-€4,500). The Dobag project was a co-operative movement which started in the 1990s in Turkey to revive the handspun, natural dying techniques of antique rugs, but is no longer. The online auction, which also includes Lindfors’s library of reference books, finishes on Wednesday, March 12th, with viewing today/tomorrow from 1pm-5pm and on Monday/Tuesday from 10am-5pm. Also at Adam’s next week, is their spring jewellery online auction on Tuesday, March 11th, at 11am. Charming seasonal pieces include: a floral basket Giardinetto bouquet brooch (€2,000-€3,000); and two diamond bee brooches (€500-€700/€400-€600); and a diamond ballerina brooch in the style of the French jewellery house, Van Cleef & Arpels (€5,000-€6,000). Another more unusual piece is a sapphire and diamond ring, which unfolds to form a bracelet (€600-€800). Meanwhile, a collector of silver is selling his entire collection at Matthews Auction Rooms in Kells, Co Meath. The collection includes everything from silver tea sets to bowls, salvers, cutlery, boxes, novelty items (such as the Vesta case in the shape of a lying cow, at €40-€70), silver cased pocket watches and sets of silver coins. “The sets of 25 coins with original bank packaging are all pure silver, as are the one-kilo bars,” says Damien Matthews, who believes they will be well sought after. “They are all in mint condition and all way estimated below their scrap value.” The Matthews auction also has a series of three gold coins commemorating the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising. The 1oz gold coin has an estimate of €2,500-€3,500, while the ½oz gold coin has an estimate of €1,250-€2,250, and the ¼oz gold coin is priced as €800-€1,200. The seven hundred lots of jewellery contains a treasure trove of rings, bracelets, necklaces of various vintage and priced with plenty to suit all tastes. Natasha Bernon, from O’Reilly’s Auction Rooms, agrees that buying silver or gold jewellery can be a good way to invest. “The price of gold is at an all-time high [gold peaked at$2,956.15 on February 24th], which is encouraging people to put their money into something tangible,” she says. An eastern style set of two 21ct gold bangles (€800-€1,200), is one such example of gold jewellery on offer at the O’Reilly’s online fine jewellery sale, which ends on Wednesday, March 12th.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, March 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Merck & Co., Inc. (“Merck” or the “Company”) (NYSE: MRK) and reminds investors of the April 14, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that Merck’s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil’s demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei. Such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Merck’s securities at artificially inflated prices. On February 4, 2025, before the market opened, Merck filed a current report on Form 8-K with the SEC. In the current report, Merck announced their fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 financial results, in which it stated that “GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 [s]ales [d]eclined 3% to $8.6 Billion.” In addition, the current report stated Merck’s “decision to temporarily pause shipments of GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 into China beginning February 2025 through at least mid-year.” On this news, Merck’s stock price fell $9.05 per share, or 9.1%, to close at $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Merck’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Title: Ireland v France: Live updates from crunch Six Nations clash at the Aviva

That’s all from us for today. A disappointing result but them’s the breaks. Before we go, Scotland are after beating Wales 35-29 (read the report from Murrayfield here). So that just leaves England v Italy tomorrow (kick-off 3pm). We’ll be back here this day next week for Super Saturday. Until then, take it easy. And Gerry Thornley’s piece from the Ireland press conference is in: It’s been a long, long time since an Irish team has been rolled over in such a lopsided manner, especially at home. The home team and the home crowd, who were even more comprehensively second best, were left reeling as France scored 34 unanswered points in a blue blur of power and pace. Unbeaten at home in the Six Nations since France won here behind closed doors in 2021, Ireland had seemed relatively well set, or at any rate highly competitive, when Dan Sheehan’s 43rd-minute try and Sam Prendergast’s touchline conversion put them 13-8 ahead. Even interim head coach Simon Easterby felt so. “We felt like going in at half-time 8-6 down we were well in the game, and we were confident that if we started well – which we did – in the second half, we could kick on and make them pay, in terms of our fitness and our ability to go well in second halves, which we have done in previous games. “But, unfortunately, we probably didn’t take enough of our opportunities in their 22, and vice versa, we conceded too easily ourselves.” Read Gerry’s full piece from the press conference here We’re back, and as promised we’ve some post-match reaction for you. First up: Fabien Galthié. Malachy Clerkin sat in on the France head coach’s press conference, and seemingly had to whip out the old English-French dictionary: Fabien Galthié was in no mood afterwards. The France coach pointedly didn’t take any questions in English but you didn’t need Duolingo to understand that he had a bone to pick. Losing Antoine Dupont to a serious knee injury midway through the first half coloured his reaction to everything. His captain was in tears in the dressingroom, Pierre-Louis Barassi didn’t make it through a HIA. Galthié was annoyed on both counts. “Our players did not return to the pitch,” he said. “We would like to understand why. On this issue, we are angry. We want to protect our players. There are means, [there are] rules. The [citing] commissioner must study the actions that are reprehensible or not. Neither Antoine nor Pierre-Louis returned to the pitch. One for a cleaning, the other for a contact. “For Antoine, there is suspicion of a fairly serious knee injury. I won’t go into details due to medical confidentiality, but Antoine is suffering. We have cited players to appear before the [Six Nations disciplinary] committee – Tadhg Beirne and Andrew Porter. Calvin Nash has also been summoned before the committee, for Pierre-Louis Barassi because he did not respond favourably to the protocol. “We feel bad for [Antoine]. In terms of the action, in my opinion it was reprehensible, and there are ways to study and analyse it. We feel for him today. He is suffering and we are suffering with him.” Read Malachy’s full piece from the press conference here Gerry Thornley’s dispatches from Simon Easterby’s press conference will be with us shortly. Thank you all for your company but hang tough, that reaction is coming. We will have more port match reaction from Gerry Thornley on Simon Easterby’s press conference and Malachy Clerkin who is looking after all things French. Midi Olympique give Yoram Moefana (8.5) and Francois Cros (8.5) to top their player ratings while two-try hero, Louis Bielle-Biarrey gets an eight. 🎥 Un bijou signé Louis Bielle-Biarrey 💎An absolute beauty from Louis Bielle-Biarrey 💎#FRAIRL | #SixNationsRugby pic.twitter.com/vKe4oI4dcv On the incident that saw Dupont suffer a knee injury Easterby said: “I think it’s just a rugby incident where Tadhg (Beirne) cleans out someone in front of Antoine Dupont and he gets hit on the back of that. This happens. We definitely have moved away and players have a real awareness now of cleaning out on the lower limb of the player, which would create that type of injury that might happen today, but that wasn’t the case. “He was securing his own ball and not making contact with Dupont and unfortunately that happens. I’ll probably have to look back at it again. We feel like the right decision was made there.” Ireland head coach Simon Easterby: “Disappointing, obviously. We felt like when we went in at half-time 8-6 down, we were well in the game and we were confident that if we started well, which we did in the second half, that we could kick on and make them pay in terms of our fitness and our ability to go well in the second half, which we’ve done in previous games in the tournament. But unfortunately, we probably just didn’t take enough of our opportunities throughout the game in their 22 and vice versa, we conceded too easily ourselves. STATE OF THE NATION Ireland’s pursuit of a third successive victory in the Six Nations is no longer in their hands following their 42-27 defeat to France at the Aviva Stadium. Fabien Galthié‘s side are now two points ahead of Ireland in the table going into the final round of fixtures. On the last day, the French host Scotland at the Stade de France (8.0, Irish time). They have a 93-point advantage over Ireland – they travel to Rome to take on Italy – going into next weekend. A victory of any nature for France against the Scots in their last match would ensure that Ireland could not catch them. At the very least Ireland would need the Scots to win before any mathematics comes into play. The chances of a ‘three-peat’ of wins in the tournament are remote. If teams finish level on points, then the standings are decided by points differential. England can overtake Ireland in the table if they beat Italy with a four try, bonus point at Twickenham in Sunday’s game. They would put England second (15 points) behind France (16) with Ireland (14) in third place. England are away to Wales on the final weekend. The Scots have a four try, bonus point racked up already in the first half of their game with Wales but would go into the final weekend on 11 points. Essentially Ireland are looking for favours from their Celtic brothers Scotland and Wales, while also requiring a win in Rome. What about the lies, damn lies and statistics. Well Ireland had more attacking minutes 16.8 to 15.1, carried for more metres 886 to 744, beat more defenders 21-19 and had more offloads 9-8 while the French made more line-breaks 6-4, fewer handling errors 11-17 and fewer turnovers 7-11. France made 196 tackles and missed 21 while Ireland made 97 and missed 19. France conceded 13 penalties to Ireland’s six. Ireland had two yellow cards. Gerry Thornley’s match report is in. He wrote: “France put Ireland to the sword and utterly obliterated hopes of a Grand Slam, also ending any realistic designs on a historic three-peat next weekend. What’s more, France did so despite losing their talisman early in the piece, so shredding any notion that they might be overly dependent on Antoine Dupont. “Despite one of their battery of backrowers also playing much of the second half in midfield, France’s 7-1 split reaped a rich dividend as their amalgam of power and pace shredded Ireland in the third quarter. Ireland just do not have finishers like the jet-heeled Louis Bielle-Biarrey and Damian Penaud. “Their defence also smashed Ireland in the collisions, and the injection of the Bomb Squad did not dilute this in any way. Their backrow were immense, particularly Paul Boudehent.” You can read the rest of his report here Johnny Watterson’s player ratings are in, three Irish players get seven, the highest mark, one of which is captain, Caelan Doris. Johnny wrote: “The lineout worked and he was a good Irish option there. Made some big tackles, notably on Thomas Ramos in the first half, and ground away in the engine room.” You can read the rest of the ratings here.

He’s been chewing on the top of the red pen. 🗣 "That last 35 minutes is as bad as Ireland have played in some time. It could be damaging for them."🗣 "France played brilliantly!"Rob Kearney and Matt Williams react to Ireland 27-42 France.#IREvFRA | #GuinnessM6N pic.twitter.com/mtcKbmCip6 That was a chastening afternoon for Ireland, the first in a very long time. Forget about the late salvo that yielded 14-points and tries for replacements Cian Healy and Jack Conan. It won’t console players of Irish supporters. The home side received a lesson today in how to ruthlessly finish off opportunities. France did this without captain, Antoine Dupont whom they lost to a knee injury in the first half, centre Pierre-Louis Barassi (HIA) in the second and ended with up replacement and try scorer Oscar Jegou, a flanker playing in the centre. Louis Bielle-Biarrey demonstrated why he is one of the best players in the world with a brace of tries, Damian Penaud’s breakaway effort saw him equal the French try scoring record held by Serge Blanco. French head coach Fabien Galthié‘s decision to opt for a 7-1 split on the bench, despite the injuries to two backs, proved to be a masterstroke as the arrival of the front five pack replacements had a significant impact on the outcome. Fulltime: Ireland 27 France 42 80(+1) CONAN TRY. Prendergast with a quick tap penalty and Conan grabs a second Irish try in three minutes. Prendergast lands the conversion but it’s nothing more than window dressing on the scoreboard. France were stunning for half an hour in the second half, played glorious rugby and were worthy winners. Ireland can and will have no complaints. Ireland 27 France 42 77 mins: TRY HEALY. In his 137th game for Ireland and the final one at the Aviva Stadium, grabs a try. It’s a lovely personal moment. Prendergast converts. Ireland 20 France 42 72 mins: Prendergast with a couple of chips through that he might like over again but Ireland are at least showing character. There accuracy though in the French 22 is seriously lacking. Right on cue Prendergast’s pass six metres from the French line was intercepted by Ramos and he released Penaud who races 75 metres to score under the posts. Ramos converts. Ireland 13 France 42 69 mins: Ireland with a great try scoring chance but Robbie Henshaw steps back inside rather than looking at the man outside. Conor Murray then gets over the line but replacement prop Cyril Baille gets underneath him and denies him a try. Ireland 13 France 35 68 mins: Cian Healy, Rob Herring and Conor Murray are on for Porter, Sheehan and Gibson-Park. 64 mins: RAMOS PENALTY: Doris goes off for a HIA. Van der Flier back on. Prendergast on a wrap around but he tries to take the space and gets collared by Jegou. The pass might have been the better option there. France are utterly dominant. Ireland penalised again at a ruck. Ramos points at the points. Ireland 13 France 35 France have scored 29-points from seven visits to the Ireland 22. France have scored 24 points in second half 12 minutes and claimed a four try bonus point. 58 mins: TRY JEGOU. The impact of the French bench and Ireland going down to 14 players has resulted in the visitors running riot. They’ve been breathtaking in the rugby they’ve played. Ireland 13 France 32 56 mins: Nash is back on, Ireland are back to 15 players. The damage has been done. James Ryan is on for McCarthy. 55 mins: RAMOS PENALTY. A blue tidal wave. France back on the attack and they are within metres of the Irish line when Doris is pinged for playing the nine, Lucu. Alldritt turns to Ramos to kick the penalty and the French fullback duly obliges. Jack Crowley is on for Ireland; he’ll play in the centre. Aki is off. Ireland 13 France 25 48 mins: Nash is in the sin bin under review for his yellow card. Decision is in. It’ll remain a yellow. Barassi is undergoing a HIA. Jack Conan is on for O’Mahony who receives a huge ovation in his last game at the Aviva Stadium. Ryan 49 mins: TRY Bielle-Biarrey. France on a sweeping counter-attack go down the wing where Nash would have been - he’s still in the bin - work the ball wide to Bielle-Biarrey, the wing hits the afterburners, grubbers and wins the footrace. Ramos kicks the conversion. The French make four changes to their pack. Ireland 13 France 22 46 mins: TRY BOUDEHENT. France on penalty advantage power their way forward, winning each collision and eventually, Ireland run out of numbers and Boudehent forces his way over. The visitors were on penalty advantage. The TMO, Ian Tempest, comes in to draw attention to a head collision. Nash receives a yellow card for his head clash on Barassi. They look at an incident in the build-up but Gardner on review says that a clear-out on O’Mahony was legal. He awards the try and Ramos kicks the conversion. Barassi is off for a HIA. Oscar Jegoum, a flanker is on in the midfield. Ireland 13 France 15 Whatever was said by Ireland coach Simon Easterby has worked nicely. Ireland were bright again from the opening whistle. 43 mins: TRY SHEEHAN. Ireland kick the penalty to the corner. Beirne with the take and the Irish maul is well-crafted, moves forward, and then Sheehan breaks off the back and drives through the tackle of Lucu for a fine try. Prendergast lands the touchline conversion, a lovely kick. Ireland 13 France 8 42 mins: Ireland bought a penalty there after sustained pressure, Bielle-Biarrey caught offside. Looked at the Dupont incident. The French scrumhalf was trying to jackal when Tadhg Beirne, propelled by those behind him, looked to clear out legitimately and drove Dupont backwards at an angle. 26mins IRE 0-5 FRAFrance with the opening score of the match as Louis Bielle-Biarrey goes over in the corner following a well-worked line-out. Conversion was missed.📱 Follow live https://t.co/YNToX44WC0📺 Watch on @RTE2 and @RTEPlayer📻 Listen Saturday sport @RTEradio1 pic.twitter.com/wAEx82FrBa 10 - @FranceRugby's Louis Bielle-Biarrey has now been directly involved in 10 @SixNationsRugby tries this year (6 tries, 4 assists), the first player ever to reach double figures in a single edition of the men's Championship – his six tries are also the most by any French player… pic.twitter.com/IfqZ3Kk42d Where to start. Ireland dominate the first 20-minutes only to fall to a sucker punch score on virtually the first occasion that France get into their 22. French wing Louis Bielle-Biarrey scores a try for the seventh time in the last seven Tests. Ireland lost Joe McCarthy to a yellow card for a silly pull back on Thomas Ramos. It was during his absence that France scored, the launchpad a lineout maul, where McCarthy’s power was missed. The visitors lost captain Antoine Dupont to what looked like a knee injury, when he was cleared-out at the ruck. Twice subsequently Dupont’s successor as captain, Alldritt, went to match referee Angus Gardner to ask him to get the officials to have a look at the incident. Prendergast, who had earlier hit an upright with a penalty, landed his next opportunity but Ireland then conceded a similiar opportunity, a ridiculously harsh decision. Ramos kicked it but in first half injury time Prendergast landed a monster penalty from the halfway line. Half-time: Ireland 6 France 8 40(+1) mins: Ireland are claiming that there was a head shot on Porter. Referee is unmoved rightly pointing out that if there was it will be called. The home side have a penalty on the halfway line. Prendergast thumps it over. Superb strike. Ireland 6 France 8 35 mins: That’s another questionable decision. Osborne brilliant on kick-chase, nabs Penaud eight metres from the French line. Pierre-Louis Barassi clears Doris out from the side but France get a scrum, knock-on is the ruling. Ireland 3 France 8 35 mins: RAMOS PENALTY: That’s a ridiculous decision. France giving a penalty for alleged interference from kickoff by Andrew Porter. He did nothing to obstruct Damian Penaud. The French wing bought that penalty. Ramos makes not mistake. That’ll stick in the Irish gut. Ireland 3 France 8 33 mins: PRENDERGAST PENALTY: Ireland go on to attack again, get a lucky ricochet from a kick which Nash collects, two rucks later, Henshaw grubbers through on penalty advantage from a tackle off the ball by Paul Boudehent. Prendergast makes no mistake. Ireland 3 France 5 31 mins: Gardner and Doris are having a long dialogue about keeping distance. Alldritt is back to Gardner about the injury that ended Dupont’s participation. The Australian referee is having none of it. Ireland 0 France 5 27 mins: Ireland under pressure again. Referee Angus Gardner is fighting a running battle with Ireland about wishing to speed up lineout and play on. He’s ignoring any injury issues. Then he wants to play on when Dupont is injured. Dupont is gone. France complaining about the clear-out. Alldritt wants him to look at it again. Gardner says that they have and it’s just a rugby collision/injury. Maxime Lucu is on. France now have seven forwards left on the bench. Gamble doesn’t pay off. Bielle-Biarrey with a chip through. He claims that he is tackled late. No one else agrees though. McCarthy is back on the pitch. Ireland get the 22 drop out. Five points conceded in the 22 minutes that McCarthy was off. Ireland 0 France 5 TRY: Bielle-Biarrey. France get their maul going forward and two passes down the short-side send Bielle-Biarrey over in the corner. That comes off Ireland having 70 percent possession. The visitors show them how to be ruthless in the scoring zone. Ramos misses the conversion. Ireland 0 France 5 19 mins: France counterattack, Bielle-Biarrey chips and chases but McCarthy’s actions in pulling back a support player, think it was Thomas Ramos, gets him a yellow card. Silly, silly. France kick to the corner. YELLOW CARD: McCarthy. Ireland 0 France 0 18 mins: Great rip by Osborne but France regain possession only for Doris to win it back. Ireland clear long, France respond in kind before Prendergast finds touch in the French half. Doris is having a huge game. Ireland 0 France 0 14 mins: Ireland attack the short-side through Jamie Osborne, Ireland continue to pummel away inside the French 22, but a knock-on from Joe McCarthy and then a penalty at a ruck allows France to get into the Irish half for the first time. Ireland 0 France 0 13 mins: Good aggressive defence from the French forces Ireland to lose possession which culminates with Dupont racing under the Irish posts but there are two French knocks-on in the build-up. A scrum on the French 22 is the upshot. Ireland 0 France 0 11 mins: France penalised on the double, one for an arm hook at a lineout and the other for offside after a great break from Keenan. Prendergast kicks into the French 22. Peter O’Mahony off the top to Joe McCarthy on the peel, then Doris, then Sheehan, as Ireland inch towards the French line. Brilliant tackle by Louis Bielle-Biarrey on Keenan. 9 mins: Superb work by Doris to win a ruck penalty but Sam Prendergast sees his kick from the French 10-metre line hits the left hand upright. Ireland 0 France 0 7 mins: Superbly direct from Ireland, Josh van der Flier and Aki making some serious yards deep inside French 22 but the visitors win a turnover penalty at a ruck. Gregory Alldritt. 4 mins: First scrum, Ireland put-in. Re-set. Ireland get free-kick for early engagement. Ireland win a penalty after Dupont is penalised for offside. Prendergast kicks into French 22. Tadhg Beirne wins lineout. Dan Sheehan breaks off, grounded short. Dupont offside again and Ireland get a penalty. That’s three penalties and a free kick that France have conceded. Sheehan with a quick tap and Caelan Doris gets held up over the line. Goal-line drop out. Ireland 0 France 0 1 min: Great start for Calvin Nash, super chase and take of Jamison Gibson-Park’s high ball. That’s nice width and change-up from Ireland. Nash involved again but the move peters out with a handling error. Bundee Aki receives treatment after receiving a ball to the face. Ireland 0 France 0 There’s no doubting the emotion of the occasion for several of the Irish line-up, exemplified by Peter O’Mahony and Cian Healy. Time for kickoff. The teams are out for the anthems. 10 minutes to kickoff. There will be a minute’s silence for the former Irish international late Dr Bill Mulcahy. Lowe suffered a back spasm. Ireland’s two first choice wings, Hansen and Lowe miss out. Over to Osborne and Nash. JAMES LOWE IS OUT. CALVIN NASH IN AND WILL WEAR 11 JERSEY. Murray Kinsella caught the on-pitch treatment. Calvin Nash has his bib off and is running on the right wing in the warm-up with Jamie Osborne switching to the left wing. James Lowe seems to be in a fair bit of pain. pic.twitter.com/iLgqOdiaY9 IRELAND INJURY ALERT: James Lowe has just limped down the tunnel. Received treatment to his hip and looks in a lot of discomfort. The French Rugby Federation (FFR) estimate that there are 10,000 French supporters in Dublin although walking around the city there seems to be a great deal more. In the the Six Nations (2000–present), Ireland have played France on 25 occasions, Ireland winning 11, France 12 and two matches have been drawn. One of Ireland’s 50-cappers, Finlay Bealham, gets interviewed. Finlay Bealham chatted Roy about haircuts, food and life in the front row! Thanks to everyone at @IrishRugby for having us.Catch Ireland v France on @RTE2 & @RTEplayer from 1.15pm, Online with @RTEsport and tune in to @RTERadio1. #IrishRugby #TeamOfUs #SixNations #IREvFRA #RTÉ pic.twitter.com/U2Lw2zdUe0 Late tee time Saturday means morning watching Ireland v France 💪🏻☘️ @IrishRugby @SixNationsRugby Antoine Dupont (France): “Ireland have lost very few matches, they have a very rigorous system that we know. They’re (strong) attacking and defending. They have very clear processes that allow them to win matches against all the teams in the world. “They’re doing a very good job - it also pushes us to be at our best level to be able to compete with this kind of team. It will be up to us to be the master of our game, not to make mistakes, not to give the opportunity to the Irish to attack us with penalties. “We know when it’s like that they’re hard to stop. We see all the games played on their defence, they almost always manage to slow down the ball. It’s a very well done job. “We see that they know the laws very well and that they are at the limit of being penalised – they’re not always at the limit, they’re very good at it. “So, it’s up to us to do our best to get fast ball, and if they are at the limit, we hope we’ll do very well. We’ll play fair, but we’re not worried about it.” A word from the captains. Ireland’s Caelan Doris: “We’re very much aware of the threat France pose and the quality they’ve got individually, but what they can do collectively as well. “We’ve seen that with some of the scorelines they’ve put down against some other quality teams, and we’ve experienced it first-hand as well a number of times too so we’re definitely aware that we’re going to need to be at our best. “But there’s excitement to go there and to have our best performance yet. Some of the fixtures against France in the past are up there with my favourite games that I’ve been involved in. “Marseille last year was a special venue to play in, very cool. Thinking back to the Aviva in ‘23, unbelievable atmosphere, very good game. “One of the highest ball-in-play times I think that we’ve had. So, it’s two teams with an attacking mindset and attacking desire, and hopefully it will make for a good watch.” Gerry Thornley had a look at the two best scrumhalves in the world, Jamison Gibson-Park and Antoine Dupont. Here are his thoughts. A bunch of Savoyards I met in Temple Bar. There won’t be a goat milked in the French Alps tonight. #IREvFRA pic.twitter.com/rJqRgbGv5y Romain Ntamack started all five games in France’s most recent Grand Slam (2022) but only once was in the run-on team since then in a Six Nations match, against Wales, the opening game in the tournament a game in which he was sent off. He’s back today following that suspension, partnering Antoine Dupont for the 29th time. Fun fact number one courtesy of Ryle Nugent who’s sitting across from me. Ireland have trailed twice in this season’s Six Nations at half-time, against Wales and England and came back to win both games. If they were to trail against France at the interval this afternoon and win the game, it is the first time to accomplish that in Dublin since 1928. A notable occasion for six Irish players. Peter O’Mahony, Conor Murray and Cian Healy, who are retiring from international rugby at the end of the Guinness Men’s Six Nations, will lead out the teams ahead of today’s game. They will be followed by Caelan Doris, Jack Conan and Finlay Bealham, who are winning their 50th caps. Conor Murray will be accompanied by his nephew, Theo Cooper. I spoke to Ian McKinley, Ian Keatley, Michael Kearney and Paddy ‘Rala’ O’Reilly who know Healy, Murray and O’Mahony. You can read it here. Lets have a look at the teams and officials. IRELAND: Hugo Keenan (UCD RFC/Leinster); Jamie Osborne (Naas RFC/Leinster), Robbie Henshaw (Buccaneers RFC/Leinster), Bundee Aki (Galwegians RFC/Connacht), James Lowe (Leinster); Sam Prendergast (Lansdowne FC/Leinster), Jamison Gibson-Park (Leinster); Andrew Porter (UCD RFC/Leinster), Dan Sheehan (Lansdowne FC/Leinster), Finlay Bealham (Galway Corinthians RFC/Connacht), Joe McCarthy (Dublin University FC/Leinster), Tadhg Beirne (Lansdowne FC/Munster), Peter O’Mahony (Cork Constitution FC/Munster), Josh van der Flier (UCD RFC/Leinster), Caelan Doris (St. Mary’s College RFC/Leinster) (capt). Replacements: Rob Herring (Ballynahinch RFC/Ulster), Cian Healy (Clontarf FC/Leinster), Thomas Clarkson (Blackrock College RFC/Leinster), James Ryan (UCD RFC/Leinster), Jack Conan (Old Belvedere RFC/Leinster), Ryan Baird (Dublin University FC/Leinster), Conor Murray (Garryowen FC/Munster), Jack Crowley (Cork Constitution FC/Munster). FRANCE: Thomas Ramos (Toulouse); Damian Penaud (Bordeaux-Bègles), Pierre-Louis Barassi (Toulouse), Yoram Moefana (Bordeaux-Bègles), Louis Bielle-Biarrey (Bordeaux-Bègles); Romain Ntamack (Toulouse), Antoine Dupont (Toulouse) (capt); Jean-Baptiste Gros (Toulon), Peato Mauvaka (Toulouse), Uini Atonio (La Rochelle), Thibaud Flament (Toulouse), Mickaël Guillard (Lyon), Francois Cros (Toulouse), Paul Boudehent (La Rochelle), Grégory Alldritt (La Rochelle). Replacements: Julien Marchand (Toulouse), Cyril Baille (Toulouse), Dorian Aldegheri (Toulouse), Emmanuel Meafou (Toulouse), Hugo Auradou (Pau), Oscar Jegou (La Rochelle), Anthony Jelonch (Toulouse), Maxime Lucu (Bordeaux-Bègles). Referee: Angus Gardner (Australia) Assistant Referees: Matthew Carley, Christophe Ridley (both England) TMO: Ian Tempest (England) FPRO: Andrew Jackson (England) Speaking of benches, France head coach Fabien Galthié has opted for a 7-1 split with scrumhalf Maxime Lucu the only back listed. Flanker Paul Boudehent has previously played in the centre. The Springboks were pioneers of this strategy, including employing it against Ireland in the World Cup, which Andy Farrell’s side won, again in the final itself and most recently against Scotland in November. France opted for this alignment in the victory over Italy last time out. Where to start? Well maybe a quick look at the teams. Mack Hansen is injured (quad), Garry Ringrose is suspended, Jamie Osborne switches to right wing, Hugo Keenan returns at fullback, Finlay Bealham returns to tighthead while captain, Caelan Doris has shrugged off a knee injury to lead the team. Rob Herring is back on the bench, Jack Conan has recovered from a back injury, while Ireland have opted for a six-two split on the bench with Conor Murray and Jack Crowley the backline cover. The superstars of Ireland and France will need to be at the peak of their powers to claim victory in 'The Dublin Decider' - #IRLFRA @SixNationsRugby @IrishRugby #rtesport @RTE2 @RTEplayer pic.twitter.com/NrrMmZpDlN Salut mes copains and copines to our French readers on this warm-ish, dry-ish Irish afternoon in Dublin. Hello and welcome to the Irish Times rugby blog. John O’Sullivan here, and at no further expense I will be keeping you up to date pre, during, and after Ireland’s seminal Six Nations Championship clash against France at the Aviva Stadium. It’s a mouthwatering clash between two sides that have occupied to the top two placings in the tournament for the past two campaigns. Indeed, France have finished second in four of the last five stagings. The French finished runners up to England in 2020, runners-up to Wales in 2021, won the Grand Chelem – that’s my bilingual nod – in 2022, second to Ireland in 2023, second to Ireland in 2024. Johnny Watterson will be evaluating the Ireland players. He’s got new red and green pens. Gerry Thornley’s match report will be available shortly after the game. Malachy Clerkin will be man-marking Antoine Dupont with a rigour of which the Ireland team would be proud. There is a huge French presence around the Ballsbridge area and the Marseillaise was belted out by a group of 30 as they walked down Lansdowne Road. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: 3 major risks could send the stock market tumbling even further
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-crash-major-risks-sp500-tariffs-ai-inflation-recession-2025-3
Time Published: 2025-03-08T10:50:01Z
Full Content:
Stocks have endured a bumpy period over the last few weeks amid a chaotic start to President Donald Trump's second term. Since February 19, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 are down 6.1% and 8.8%, respectively. Most Wall Street estimates remain positive, but investors worry that three key risks could send stocks tumbling even further. Fears that the US economy is heading toward a recession have resurfaced in recent weeks. After a false alarm in 2022 and 2024, signals of potential labor market softening have again fueled worries of a downturn. "Both WARN and Challenger data point to a further rise in private sector layoffs to come in March, and growing anxiety in the consumer confidence surveys about the future health of the labor market usually is a reliable sign of rising joblessness to come too," said Samuel Tombs, Chief US Economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, in a note on Friday. Neil Dutta, the chief US economist at Renaissance Macro, also said in a client note on Friday that the weakness is likely to continue. One reason for this is that state and local government spending on salaries is dipping sharply, as is spending on construction wages, a leading indicator. Spending in these areas has fallen during prior downturns. "I don't see an end unless the Fed takes steps to lift demand," he said in a note on Friday. Investors were tuned into February's non-farm payroll report on Friday morning for clues about where the labor market is headed. They didn't get much insight as the US economy added 151,000 jobs, near expectations, and the unemployment rate unexpectedly inched up to 4.1%. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on Friday that the US economy remains solid, sending stocks climbing. But Trump's on-and-off implementation of tariffs has added another level of uncertainty to economic growth, Wall Street banks say. Firms like Apollo, BCA Research, and TD Cowen have all warned of the rising likelihood of recession thanks to tariffs. Goldman Sachs on Friday also raised its recession odds for the next 12 months from 15% to 20% due to tariffs, but acknowledged the import fees could be reversed. "We have raised it by only a limited amount at this point because we see policy changes as the key risk, and the White House has the option to pull back if the downside risks begin to look more serious," Jan Hatzius, the bank's chief US economist, said in a note. "If policy headed in the direction of our risk scenario or if the White House remained committed to its policies even in the face of much worse data, recession risk would rise further." On the flip side of tariff-related recession worries are concerns that the import taxes will drive up consumer goods prices. So, even if the economy is resilient, rising prices could lead the Fed to hike rates again, creating downward pressure on stocks and on consumers. Or an even worse situation could arise: prices could surge due to tariffs while the economy continues to weaken. "Tariffs are a self-inflicted stagflationary policy for the U.S. economy that was otherwise poised to continue growing at a solid pace," said Phill Colmar, managing partner and global strategist at MRB Partners, in a note Friday. "The U.S. exceptionalism theme will continue to unwind, and U.S. equities are not yet priced for downside growth risks." Inflation has seen a slight resurgence in recent months, rising from 2.4% in September to 3% in January. The Fed is expected to implement two 25-basis-point rate cuts this year. Outside of the shaky macroeconomic picture, the mega-cap AI stocks that drive broader stock-market indexes could continue to suffer. That's because their strategy of pouring billions into AI infrastructure has come into question after the release of a cheaper and more energy-efficient chatbot from Chinese firm Deepseek. Investors have suddenly been made to wonder if the valuations these stocks have commanded on the promise of impressive future growth are justified. The paradigm shift has been painful for US AI stocks. Year-to-date, shares of Nvidia are down 18.5%, Microsoft is down 6%, Amazon is down 9.5%, and Alphabet has dropped 7.8%. Meanwhile, Chinese AI stocks have rallied: shares of Alibaba, who also released a relatively inexpensive chatbot, are up 65% year-to-date, while JD.com and Tencent have risen 23% and 28%, respectively. "AI is here to stay, and if anything, DeepSeek reinforces that. However, the latest developments do also show that investment approaches that are too concentrated or overly passive can be risky, as value can quickly shift within the AI ecosystem," said Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a January 28 note. "An active and diversified approach is a better way to gain exposure to AI, in our view." Jump to

What caught my eye this week. Nobody asked for it and now it’s here – the new Monevator shop is open, offering in-joke themed investing T-shirts and vaguely punny sweatshirts to all. Perhaps you’ve already spotted Monevator members striding about town sporting fancy wares like this: Yes, those cool cats got early access. Thanks to everyone who bought something and so beta-tested the new store for us. Now to repeat what I said to them, being a Monevator member is by far the best way to support the site. The margins on digital products are unbeatable – after the taxman has taken his share most of the money goes to us. This helps to keep the lights on and us publishing, week after week. In particular, please don’t buy anything from the shop if you think there’s a chance you’ll return it. The margins are terrible and returns will wipe them out. We’re only really doing this for strategic brand-building mindshare capture mutual fun. There’s an FAQ. Our merch is made by print-on-demand giant Printful, and all payments are securely handled by the globe-spanning Shopify. Finally, you’ll also find a digital bookshop (it links to Amazon) of our 24 favourite investing books. Hope to see you at an investing conference or under a Canary Wharf skyscraper – or failing that at the gym – in a Monevator hoodie soon! Have a great weekend.

Or peruse a few of our best articles. Congrats on getting the “merch” up and running. I hadn’t realised that you had given members early access: was that in a email/newsletter? Note that I intentionally killed off emails/newsletters as I prefer to read posts on this website, so may have missed the alert this way. @Curlew — Yes, besides it being a little membership perk I introduced the shop to members in stages to stagger any support issues if anything didn’t work and also to stop our working capital getting overwhelmed with demand (because we have to pay up front for the merch to be made) Needn’t have overly worried on either score 😉 Boom. In like Flynn for a DNFS t shirt to wear in the gym. Great way to be able to support a fantastic resource. Free shipping too! You spoil us. @TI Thanks for the clarification. Note that I couldn’t find anywhere in the account settings to turn on/off newsletters/emails…I had to resort to the blunt instrument of creating an email rule to delete to anything from you, no offence 🙂 Moreover, after signing up to membership I never received newsletters at all (which was fine) but after a few months they suddenly started appearing in my inbox. Odd. Hence why I tried to find a way of stopping them. You could have caps, like Make Investing Great Again caps… Typoette “Michael Sheen writes of £1m of debt …..” With regards to Kindle books…. I keep getting YT videos and article links about the removal of a download option from 26/02 onwards, see example below https://www.theverge.com/news/612898/amazon-removing-kindle-book-download-transfer-usb On the subject of filling in missing years of NI, has anyone tried to model the expected marginal payoff of one additional year of contributions vs investing the money (eg LifeStrategy 60 Acc) I tried it this week and found that for my case it was preferable to invest, but it obviously varies with a few parameters and some soft factors that are not straightforward to predict (eg means testing potentially being introduced one day) .ls. “arbdn” sh..ld b. abrdn sh..ld .t n.t 🙂 @Factor – you missed Dali/Dalio @Rob (8) That’s like comparing the certainty of an annuity with the vagaries of drawdown. The drawdown option would probably pay off but there are no guarantees. Everything I’ve heard suggests that buying missing years of NI contributions is a bargain for the near-certain guaranteed income it buys. This should remain at least CPI-inflation-protected even if the triple lock does not survive. Of course, it is important to ensure that the extra years you buy will actually improve your state pension. If you will reach 35 years anyway before SPA it will not help, and you have to be very careful about filling in gaps before 2016. Thanks for the orders guys — and for the typo spots! (I’m embarrassed about missing the Dalio ‘o’ but I’m absolutely letting myself off the abrdn SNAFU 😉 ) @Rob It’s currently £17.45 for a class 3 stamp (per week) State pension is £6.32 for each of the 35 required stamp years. £221.20 pw for 24/25 with 35 years ) If I was a 66 year old the annuity rate would be 36% v current open market annuity rates of about 4%. To me it looks close to the best investment one could make. The best being class 2 Ni £3.45 per week. Paying for extra year a long time before retirement may change the numbers but surely not enough to be worth not buying the extra year. I think Ermine has some thoughts on one of his posts @Rob #8 has anyone tried to model the expected marginal payoff of one additional year of contributions vs investing the money (eg LifeStrategy 60 Acc) I tried it this week and found that for my case it was preferable to invest Perhaps you have the gift of exceptional youth and hence a long appreciation time, but it’s really hard to beat a over 100% annuity rate at Class II rates – my old post on the SP has been overtaken by some changes but the principle is still there. Provisos are that it is rational to make up missing years later in your working life rather than earlier (you must make them before reaching SPA) because you don’t know your career path. Early retirees by definition have a shorter working life than most. You need 35 qualifying years – my working life was 30 so I was 5 years short. I bought an extra SP annuity for ~£900 what it would have cost me 23k on the open market. You run, not walk, towards that sort of proposition. Early retirees ought to be able to swing the Class II NI by declaring self employment and earning pin money. You don’t actually have to make any money, and you are usually in self-assessment anyway due to investments. I’d certainly say double check your working and I’d be intrigued as to how you come to that conclusion, assuming you do not have any reason to expect a shorter life expectancy than usual. @Pinch #7 > With regards to Kindle books…. I keep getting YT videos and article links about the removal of a download option from 26/02 onwards, see example below Normal users won’t notice any difference and if your Kindle breaks you can register the replacement to your Amazon account and get your old stuff, barring rare edge cases. Amazon are doing this to stiff people who break the DRM’d books out of the digital rights management. So they can read the books on other ereaders or their computers. I will investigate alternative suppliers because I reject monopolist’s rights to control what I do with my stuff and my equipment. At any rate I will buy fewer books form them and favour secondhand real books, even if I give them away after reading. But it’s not a problem if you are a normal consumer 😉 @ermine – 14 Last I read was that making investments left you eligible for Class 2 NICs, regardless of earning pin money, or am I missing something? https://www.gov.uk/self-employed-national-insurance-rates talks about “people who make investments for themselves or others – but not as a business and without getting a fee or commission” @ermine Books… I’ve been giving Amazon the heave ho for quite some time. I mostly use World of Books, they operate on a circular economy model, and authors receive something on the sale of s/h books. I use the WoB website, rather than on Ebay. Cheaper that way. Thanks for the useful replies about NI contributions. I would reach SPA in 2046 (as things stand currently) and expect to have 25/35 years completed by 2033. I have the option to make class 3 contributions at slightly reduced rate for five missing years. If I can make class 2 voluntary contributions from 2033 then I should reach full record not long before I would be eligible to receive state pension. I was not aware that making investments for myself qualified for class 2 contributions, that changes the calculation enormously. There is always the risk that the system is changed somewhat by then but this seems the best bet for now. I’m surprised that there has been little or no discussion on Monevator around the talk of possible changes to the rules relating to cash ISAs and the possible reduction to a £4k annual limit. @Rob #18 >investments Yeah, but do make sure your profits are < 6,725 pa else you’re paying 6% marginal NI tax on top of any other taxes 😉 I’d be wary of using investments for that reason. Even if it were in your ISA it would be a pity to make your ISA taxable! You do need to register as self-employed for the year, and make sure it is the entire tax year. Being in self-assessment (SA) is not enough. Self-employment requirements are pretty lax. I once declared a £50 profit for running the PA for an event, that was enough. You don’t even need to make a profit to be self-employed. Sell something on ebay, but do not take the £1000 trading allowance in your SA form if you want to pay class II NI. Certainly agree it’s irrational to pay now if you will have 13 years post-retirement in 2033 to make up 10 years. All sorts of things can change in the next 8 years, you may need to work longer, or not, those 8 years the capital could be used to invest. The point I was querying is that compared to investment this was a poor deal – but it still makes sense to defer buying the years later where it makes no difference, you may as well use the money in the meantime! There have been rumblings about canning Class II NI since forever, the post-GFC coalition gov made a lot of noise about that and I was frightened of that disappearing in 2012. Never happened. There was talk of it post-covid as the Covid bung for the self-employed caused some reflection. Didn’t happen. Even at Class III rates it’s a steal compared to an open market annuity rate. Still worth keeping a watch on the space for rule changes. @ermine #20 > make sure your profits are < 6,725 pa else you’re paying 6% marginal NI tax on top of any other taxes I’d be wary of using investments for that reason If you are registered as a self employed investor (people who make investments for themselves or others – but not as a business and without getting a fee or commission) then you are on special rules where you have the option of paying voluntary class 2 contributions. But how would you calculate profit for class 4? My understanding of the rules is that in that category your profit is zero as you are not “getting a fee or commission”. Hence them giving you the option of paying voluntary class 2. If you had any profit to make you pay compulsory class 4 then the special regime would not be necessary. This is the same for example for another profession in that list of special rules, “ ministers of religion who do not receive a salary or stipend”. No salary, no profit, no class 4. @Grumpy Tortoise — We were on this ages ago, see the following post from early Feb and comments that follow: https://monevator.com/weekend-reading-surely-not-cash-isas/ Returning to it would just be speculation and clickbait really. We’ll certainly cover it again if there’s concrete legislation, or solid confirmation! 🙂 https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/national-insurance-manual/nim74250 I’m not convinced FIRE style home investors qualify for class 2 ni , the discussion (tldr) on landlords seems to err on needing to begainfully employed on the activity rather than bring passive etc. Happy to be wrong I’ve got my 35. Means testing and country bankruptcy are my bigger concerns Class 3 is still too generous- perhaps Rachel will spot it Market mini crash mini special/Naughty corner Active Antics: 1). Verdad x 2: a). kurtosis + skewness so important, yet undercovered; b). Land of rising sun shows promise in SC space (overweight both Jap SC and Value, and looking for options for Jap micro/nano caps and SCV). 2). FT x 3: a). can’t see why investors would avoid UK SCs and ITs. There’s opportunity there. b). The big picture (5 yr+) on US large cap’s always looks good: https://www.tker.co/p/stock-market-performance-after-down-days But I’ve a bad feeling about this. The SPY and the S&P momentum index now both at/below 200 DSMA (latter for 1st time since 2023). With the orange emperor in charge and set on tariffs, valuations stretched, GPT 4.5 flopping, hyperscalars forgoing more power generation (a bad demand signal regardless of DeekSeek efficiencies): things looking less than rosy in the US large/mega cap space. A crash, if it comes, could be a good long term (decades view) entry point though. @Boltt #23 Thanks for that link, shame it only seems to be able to give landlording examples. I can see how managing a portfolio for you and your partner perhaps does not qualify as “gainfully employed for self-employed NICs purposes” unless it involves lots of active trading. But then I wonder what HMRC’s view would be on “a £50 profit for running the PA for an event” for a whole tax year. That can’t possibly be “gainfully employed for self-employed NICs purposes” either. @Delta Hedge — Well, the house Monevator view is of course “who knows”. Stranger things have happened than the market rallying on the back of a arsonist administration apparently wanting to bring back the 1930s quite wilfully, in terms at least of the Great Depression via tariffs and who knows what else besides. Maybe if the market sniffs out hyperinflation, though stagflation would seem likelier if they really do enact these announced tariffs and the same on Europe.

Title: The great climate deception: How the environmental movement was hijacked by elites

Full Content:
The modern climate change narrative originated with the establishment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1988. Despite the IPCC's influence on global climate policy, nearly 2,000 scientists and professionals have signed a declaration stating there is no climate emergency. Critics argue that the climate has always been changing due to natural cycles, citing the end of the Little Ice Age in 1850 as an example. They point out that there is no statistical evidence linking global warming to intensifying natural disasters and that the IPCC's models have significantly over-predicted warming. Policies like the UN's Agenda 2030 and the Paris Agreement, aimed at reducing CO2 emissions, are seen as potentially harmful to the global economy, particularly for developing nations. The push for a "green economy" is viewed as a means for central banks and mega-corporations to consolidate wealth and power. The environmental movement, once focused on genuine issues like pollution and deforestation, is portrayed as having been co-opted by powerful elites. Whistleblowers and critics argue that figures with vested interests have used environmentalism as a cover to control the Earth's resources and redistribute global wealth, undermining the original goals of the movement.

Whistleblowers and critics argue that figures with vested interests have used environmentalism as a cover to control the Earth's resources and redistribute global wealth, undermining the original goals of the movement. For decades, the world has been told that human activity, specifically carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, is driving catastrophic climate change. The United Nations has sounded the alarm, warning of impending doom unless drastic measures are taken to reduce CO2 levels. But what if the narrative weâve been fed is not only exaggerated but fundamentally flawed? What if the real environmental movement has been hijacked by powerful interests with ulterior motives? According to a growing chorus of scientists and experts, this is precisely what has happened. According toÂ Mark Keenan, a former scientist, there is ampleÂ evidence and testimony from renowned scientists that there is no âCO2-inducedâ Climate emergencyÂ and he shares some of it in his new book, titled âClimate CO2 Hoax â How Bankers Hijacked the Environment Movement.â The origins of the climate panic The modern climate change narrative can be traced back to the establishment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1988 by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The IPCC was tasked with providing scientific advice on climate change and formulating response strategies. Its first assessment report became the foundation for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which has since shaped global climate policy. However, not everyone agrees with the IPCCâs conclusions. In fact, nearly 2,000 scientists and professionals from over 30 countries have signed a declaration stating that there is no climate emergency and that the UNâs claims about man-made climate change are unfounded. Among these signatories is Marc Morano, a former scientist at the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change and a former staff member at United Nations Environment. Morano argues that while real pollution exists, CO2 is not the problem. Instead, he points to industrial globalization, which has introduced thousands of new chemical compounds, toxins and genetically modified organisms (GMOs) into the environment. The flawed science behind the hysteria One of the key arguments against the mainstream climate narrative is that the climate has always been changing. The geological record shows that Earth has experienced natural cycles of warming and cooling for millions of years. The Little Ice Age, for example, ended as recently as 1850, and the current warming period is part of a natural cycle. According to the Climate Intelligence (CLINTEL) foundation, there is no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying hurricanes, floods, or droughts. In fact, the world has warmed significantly less than predicted by the IPCCâs models. Dr. Nils-Axel MÃ¶rner, a former chairman of the UN IPCCâs sea level committee, has been particularly vocal in his criticism. âSolar activity is the dominant factor in climate, not CO2,â he stated. âSomething is basically sick in the blame-CO2 hypothesis. It was launched more than 100 years ago, and almost immediately, excellent physicists demonstrated that the hypothesis did not work.â Dr. Mototaka Nakamura, a climate scientist with a doctorate from MIT, has also criticized the data underpinning global warming science. âOur models are mickey-mouse mockeries of the real world,â he said. âGlobal mean temperatures before 1980 are based on untrustworthy data.â The hidden agenda: Control and profit So, if the science is flawed, why has the climate change narrative gained such traction? According to Morano and other critics, the answer lies in the financial and political interests behind the movement. The UNâs Agenda 2030 and the Paris Agreement aim to reduce CO2 emissions by 7% annually until 2030. While this may sound noble, the reality is that such policies would cripple the global economy, particularly in developing nations that rely heavily on fossil fuels. The financialization of the global economy is now based on a ânet-zeroâ greenhouse gas emissions strategy. Central banks and mega-corporations are driving this agenda, with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) creating the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) in 2015. This task force represents $118 trillion in assets and includes key players like JP Morgan Chase, BlackRock and HSBC. The push for a âgreen economyâ is less about saving the planet and more about consolidating wealth and power. Dr. Otmar Edenhofer, former co-chair of the IPCCâs Working Group III, admitted as much in a 2010 interview. âOne must say clearly that we redistribute de facto the worldâs wealth by climate policy,â he said. âOne has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy. This has almost nothing to do with environmental policy anymore.â The hijacking of the environmental movement The environmental movement, once focused on real issues like pollution and deforestation, has been hijacked by powerful elites. Whistleblower George Hunt, who served as an official host at a key environmental meeting in 1987, revealed that figures like David Rockefeller and Baron Edmund de Rothschild were present. According to Hunt, the 1992 UN Earth Summit was less about environmental protection and more about consolidating control over the Earthâs resources. âThe same world order that tricked third-world countries to borrow funds and rack up enormous debtsâ¦ and purposely creating war and debt to bring societies into their control,â Hunt said. âThe world order crowd are not a nice group of people.â A call for real environmentalism The climate change narrative, as promoted by the UN and its allies, is not based on sound science but on flawed models and ulterior motives. The real environmental movement, which once sought to protect the planet from genuine threats, has been subverted by powerful interests seeking to control the global economy. Itâs time to reject the climate hysteria and focus on real solutions to real problems. As Patrick Moore, co-founder of Greenpeace, aptly put it, âThe whole climate crisis is not only fake news, itâs fake science.â The truth is out there, but itâs up to us to seek it out and demand accountability from those who have hijacked the environmental movement for their own gain.

Among these signatories is Marc Morano, a former scientist at the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change and a former staff member at United Nations Environment. Morano argues that while real pollution exists, CO2 is not the problem. Instead, he points to industrial globalization, which has introduced thousands of new chemical compounds, toxins and genetically modified organisms (GMOs) into the environment. The flawed science behind the hysteria One of the key arguments against the mainstream climate narrative is that the climate has always been changing. The geological record shows that Earth has experienced natural cycles of warming and cooling for millions of years. The Little Ice Age, for example, ended as recently as 1850, and the current warming period is part of a natural cycle. According to the Climate Intelligence (CLINTEL) foundation, there is no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying hurricanes, floods, or droughts. In fact, the world has warmed significantly less than predicted by the IPCCâs models. Dr. Nils-Axel MÃ¶rner, a former chairman of the UN IPCCâs sea level committee, has been particularly vocal in his criticism. âSolar activity is the dominant factor in climate, not CO2,â he stated. âSomething is basically sick in the blame-CO2 hypothesis. It was launched more than 100 years ago, and almost immediately, excellent physicists demonstrated that the hypothesis did not work.â Dr. Mototaka Nakamura, a climate scientist with a doctorate from MIT, has also criticized the data underpinning global warming science. âOur models are mickey-mouse mockeries of the real world,â he said. âGlobal mean temperatures before 1980 are based on untrustworthy data.â The hidden agenda: Control and profit So, if the science is flawed, why has the climate change narrative gained such traction? According to Morano and other critics, the answer lies in the financial and political interests behind the movement. The UNâs Agenda 2030 and the Paris Agreement aim to reduce CO2 emissions by 7% annually until 2030. While this may sound noble, the reality is that such policies would cripple the global economy, particularly in developing nations that rely heavily on fossil fuels. The financialization of the global economy is now based on a ânet-zeroâ greenhouse gas emissions strategy. Central banks and mega-corporations are driving this agenda, with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) creating the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) in 2015. This task force represents $118 trillion in assets and includes key players like JP Morgan Chase, BlackRock and HSBC. The push for a âgreen economyâ is less about saving the planet and more about consolidating wealth and power. Dr. Otmar Edenhofer, former co-chair of the IPCCâs Working Group III, admitted as much in a 2010 interview. âOne must say clearly that we redistribute de facto the worldâs wealth by climate policy,â he said. âOne has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy. This has almost nothing to do with environmental policy anymore.â The hijacking of the environmental movement The environmental movement, once focused on real issues like pollution and deforestation, has been hijacked by powerful elites. Whistleblower George Hunt, who served as an official host at a key environmental meeting in 1987, revealed that figures like David Rockefeller and Baron Edmund de Rothschild were present. According to Hunt, the 1992 UN Earth Summit was less about environmental protection and more about consolidating control over the Earthâs resources. âThe same world order that tricked third-world countries to borrow funds and rack up enormous debtsâ¦ and purposely creating war and debt to bring societies into their control,â Hunt said. âThe world order crowd are not a nice group of people.â A call for real environmentalism The climate change narrative, as promoted by the UN and its allies, is not based on sound science but on flawed models and ulterior motives. The real environmental movement, which once sought to protect the planet from genuine threats, has been subverted by powerful interests seeking to control the global economy. Itâs time to reject the climate hysteria and focus on real solutions to real problems. As Patrick Moore, co-founder of Greenpeace, aptly put it, âThe whole climate crisis is not only fake news, itâs fake science.â The truth is out there, but itâs up to us to seek it out and demand accountability from those who have hijacked the environmental movement for their own gain.

Sources include: ClimateDepot.com GlobalResearch.ca Amazon.com So, if the science is flawed, why has the climate change narrative gained such traction? According to Morano and other critics, the answer lies in the financial and political interests behind the movement. The UNâs Agenda 2030 and the Paris Agreement aim to reduce CO2 emissions by 7% annually until 2030. While this may sound noble, the reality is that such policies would cripple the global economy, particularly in developing nations that rely heavily on fossil fuels. The financialization of the global economy is now based on a ânet-zeroâ greenhouse gas emissions strategy. Central banks and mega-corporations are driving this agenda, with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) creating the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) in 2015. This task force represents $118 trillion in assets and includes key players like JP Morgan Chase, BlackRock and HSBC. The push for a âgreen economyâ is less about saving the planet and more about consolidating wealth and power. Dr. Otmar Edenhofer, former co-chair of the IPCCâs Working Group III, admitted as much in a 2010 interview. âOne must say clearly that we redistribute de facto the worldâs wealth by climate policy,â he said. âOne has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy. This has almost nothing to do with environmental policy anymore.â The hijacking of the environmental movement The environmental movement, once focused on real issues like pollution and deforestation, has been hijacked by powerful elites. Whistleblower George Hunt, who served as an official host at a key environmental meeting in 1987, revealed that figures like David Rockefeller and Baron Edmund de Rothschild were present. According to Hunt, the 1992 UN Earth Summit was less about environmental protection and more about consolidating control over the Earthâs resources. âThe same world order that tricked third-world countries to borrow funds and rack up enormous debtsâ¦ and purposely creating war and debt to bring societies into their control,â Hunt said. âThe world order crowd are not a nice group of people.â A call for real environmentalism The climate change narrative, as promoted by the UN and its allies, is not based on sound science but on flawed models and ulterior motives.

Title: Prof Aoife McLysaght: ‘Mum just said, do what you love and the job will follow. Which is very optimistic and brave advice’

Aoife McLysaght recalls how she heard about her first job in genetics. It was the summer after second year in Trinity College Dublin, and she was working in her father’s wholesale nursery in Blackrock, Co Dublin. “Everybody worked there, including me”, starting with filling pots with soil from an early age. “I remember my sister running out into the nursery and going, ‘There’s some professor on the phone for you’.” McLysaght had apparently impressed genetics professor David McConnell in a problem-solving exam, and he offered her a summer research job. Turned out this involved learning about, then designing, a bioinformatics course, using computers to analyse biological information, then a new field. “It became the thing I ended up really loving and working in, basically computational biology.” She’s now evolutionary genetics professor at Trinity. But what tickles her, “the mental connection”, is that that day when her sister ran out, “I was sowing sweet pea”. Peas are critical to genetics. By crossing pea plants, the Austrian scientist Gregor Mendel “basically figured out what genes are, how things are inherited”. While “you can’t unmix paint”, red-flowered and white-flowered parent plants can beget pink, red or white flowers. [ Summer of sweet peas: the struggle is worth itOpens in new window ] This week, ahead of today’s International Women’s Day, An Post launched two new stamps to acknowledge the achievements of women in Stem (science, technology, engineering and maths) and the challenges they face. One features McLysaght; the other has astrophysicist Jocelyn Bell Burnell. In January, McLysaght started her new job as Government science adviser. New science advice structures, department-based – Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science – for the first time, will inform responses to complex and challenging policy issues. It’s a “60 per cent secondment” from Trinity, where she’ll pause teaching and administration but continue research. She’s led a research team there since 2003, managing €5.5m-plus budgets. As a student in 2001 she was part of the international consortium publishing the draft human genome sequence; she was first discovering novel human-specific genes in 2009, identified links between gene duplication patterns and human disease, and has significantly contributed to our understanding of genomes. Based at the department three days a week, at assistant secretary general level, she’s assembling a new national science advice forum of experts to provide advice. Continuing research is important (or “you lose momentum, you lose touch with the field”) and the 60/40 split is considered a good model for government science advisers, so “you retain your independence. You don’t become a civil servant who’s interested in promotion. You’re not in any way incentivised to please the people around you.” Today we’re sitting by the fireplace of Trinity’s gracious Common Room. She gestures to ”Liz” looking down; a portrait of England’s Elizabeth I. This university is her turf since she was an undergrad (graduating in genetics in 1998, PhD in 2002), aside from a postdoc in University of California, Irvine. She’s full of knowledge and enthusiasm, humorous, easy, insightful, likable. She laughs a lot. “I’m the one who never left college.” She grins. Arriving in Trinity, “I felt very quickly I’d found my place”. Genetics’ department culture was and is “very supportive and welcoming of students. We were just treated as people who were earlier in their career. You’d have these really good interactions and conversations with the professors. That’s very motivating.” She describes professors, undergrads, post-grads and post-docs mixing in the building’s atrium, eating lunch, chatting. International science adviser counterparts tell her “the relationships are so important”. She observes “as a scientist or an academic, you might think you’re going to convince people because of this amazing data. You’ll just whip out a graph, and they’ll go, ‘wow, now I see it’. But actually, what’s more likely is you’ll convince them because they trust you”. Having a foot in both civil service and academia is interesting for her. As an academic she’s hired for “the knowledge and discretion and insight to choose” what to teach or research. “In academia, the huge privilege we have is to follow your curiosity.” Civil service involves more procedures “for very, very good reasons”. In this new world, “I’m sitting in on management meetings, business planning meetings, and I’m constantly impressed by the amazing people around me” with vast knowledge, and “very good at knowing how to be effective in getting something done, at reading people, picking up on the slightest things, that I was in the room for but didn’t notice”. The department’s new unit comprises McLysaght and a principal officer. “He’s like my subtitles in every conversation. He’s helping so much in figuring out how to structure things. “I took on this job because I want to do something interesting and meaningful with it, not because I needed to fill my time. I had a full-time job, which I really enjoy. The first line of my application was: I love my job.” A vaccine for cancer. That’s amazing. That some people try to undermine that is depressing Her paternal grandfather, genealogist Edward MacLysaght, died aged 99 when she was 10. She recalls him sitting in the garden, “his beautiful books”, the photo of him with de Valera on the mantelpiece, and his trick holding a coin between his eyebrow and cheek (“we’d roar laughing”). Her grandparents lived in “a little house, basically up the back of the garden in Blackrock” and a relative, barrister Charles Lysaght, told them he’d died, then “rang The Irish Times and RTÉ. Minutes later I heard it on radio. I thought this was normal.” Theirs was not a science family. “I never knew a scientist. I didn’t know you could be a scientist.” But it was her favourite school subject, fuelled by teacher Nick Frewin at Andrew’s in Booterstown. Looking back, she realises, within “the rather constrained Leaving Cert curriculum, he managed to emulate one of the joys of science, which is figuring things out.” She enjoyed genetics, because it involved “understanding principles and figuring things out, rather than remembering stuff. Labelling the parts of the eye. That’s just dull. Genetics was exciting, because it was about ideas and concepts.” She worried about jobs. “My mum just said, do what you love and the job will follow. Which is very optimistic advice, isn’t it, and very brave advice.” These days, talking to school groups, especially girls, “I’m not in the business of persuading anybody to do something they don’t want to do. Science worked for me. It doesn’t mean it’ll work for somebody else. All I want to do is let people know the door is open, if they care to walk through it. That’s all I needed.” There’s a perception she was young to be appointed full professor in 2020. But she was 44, “older than many of my male colleagues”. She was, however, youngish becoming assistant professor at 27; she laughs about managing “to straddle that ambiguity of, is she a student or staff?”. She spells out the startling drop-off of women before reaching academia’s higher levels. Biology doesn’t have the “systemic stereotyping” of maths, but even there, while women comprise 50 per cent of undergraduates right up to postdoctoral research, getting top grades, the percentage of women drops as soon as you get “steady conditions, no longer precarious employment”. She says “too many people thought it was a legacy problem that would fix itself over time. They were kind of passive about it.” She married in her 20s, had her first child at 28, within a year of assistant-professorship, “when I should have been knuckling down and impressing everybody! I didn’t do the correct career thing.” She laughs. “I don’t know if I’d call it a gamble, but I decided, my life decisions and career decisions are separate.” It helped that academic careers are “judged in the round. Are you getting your job done? You organise your own time”. As science adviser, “I don’t want to give the impression I think nobody uses evidence and I’m coming in to save the day.” But she foresees “smaller cultural shifts” in better integrating evidence into decision-making, making it “more habitual”. Climate change has “the most urgency, and the longer we leave it untackled, the more urgent and bigger the challenge.” It’s cross-government: “it’s energy, agriculture, transport, skills and education. All infrastructure.” McLysaght is fascinating company, knowledgeable beyond her speciality and about the bigger picture. She chats away, fired up. “I can keep you here for 10 hours, if you have the time!” We’ve moved and are looking out over Trinity’s Front Square. She talks about her “fortuitous” involvement in the genome project, how “we knew it was something momentous, we were part of the team that was analysing the human genome first”, and the significance of discovering genome duplication in human ancestors 500 million years ago, thus creating “this extra capacity for enormous diversity” and with implications for human health. [ Gene editing opens door to new treatments for inherited retinal diseasesOpens in new window ] McLysaght stresses “scientists are human beings. Of course we can make mistakes. People think scientists know everything. Of course we don’t. We just know a lot about a very narrow thing. People think science is fixed, never changes, but actually we’re always updating it”, what a friend calls “trying to be less wrong than yesterday”. And while scientists can have “reasonable and plausible disagreement”, when there isn’t 100 per cent certainty on detail, “we know the extent of our uncertainty”, and there are “discussions and disagreements, constantly moving closer to the truth. You can categorically say, this is untrue, while not being 100 per cent certain of something else within that.” While this concept can be confusing, it’s important for trust in, and public understanding of, science, she says. The false assertion that vaccines cause autism is a good example. “It’s been thoroughly investigated. It is absolutely not true, thoroughly debunked.” But it “created mistrust in vaccines, which have been extraordinarily powerful in eliminating and controlling very significant childhood diseases.” Australia has eradicated cervical cancer because of HPV uptake. “A vaccine for cancer. That’s amazing. That some people try to undermine that is depressing.” [ ‘Extremely impressive’: melanoma jab trial results excite doctorsOpens in new window ] Talking about science is important, she says, “so people understand how we know things, and what you do when you’re trying to develop new scientific knowledge. You don’t just build something and hope it works. There’s steps and investigation along the way. We are our own first critics. When I’m trying to demonstrate something, the first thing I try to do is disprove it. “What I’m interested in is that things work well, that science is valued as part of decision-making. What I’m not interested in is any kind of personal recognition. It’s more important to me that this thing is done and done well, than anybody getting credit for it. I don’t think I have a big ego. Maybe everybody does somewhat, but it’s not what motivates me.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Mayo women winemakers: ‘Everything in life is harder as a woman; you always have to prove yourself a bit more’

From Ballyhaunis, Roisín Curley celebrates 10 years making wine in Burgundy this year. She still works part-time as a pharmacist in the family business. “I have one foot in Burgundy and one in Ballyhaunis” she says. “I love both. I spend August to November in France and visit every month too.” In 2023 she made 14 different wines. “I am a workaholic and I love it.” She says she also has “a spinal cord of loyal close family and friends who help make it happen”. Did she find it difficult as a woman and foreigner to be accepted in Burgundy, a very traditional winemaking region? “I thought it would be a challenge, but everyone has been so nice and so helpful. Being a woman, it is harder. But everything in life is harder as a woman; you always have to prove yourself a little bit more.” Formerly a sommelier in top restaurants straddling three continents, during lockdown Brigid O’Hora moved from Dublin to Achill Island with her young triplets where she began her hugely successful Bridey’s Wine Chats profile on Instagram. Last year her book The Home Sommelier was published. “Our family home is in Achill, so I have been going down there since I was a child. To be honest, I tired of the rat race. We were originally here for six months to save for a house but after three months something in me said ‘no, I’m staying here'.” “I fell pregnant and that’s when I started online. I now work with an importer but I’m still doing my own stuff promoting the book and doing Instagram. It keeps me in touch with everyday people, which is what I love.” Originally from Co Down, Sinéad Cabot moved to Westport 20 years ago. Since then, with her husband Liam, she has been running a firm of wine importers in Mayo, while growing grapes and making critically acclaimed wine in Slovenia. “I’ve worked in wine for 25 years: from retailing to importing to winemaking in Slovenia. I can start the day wearing wellies in the vineyard and end it by wearing high heels at an event presenting our wines. It’s a great life. As well as a certain amount of physicality, winemaking calls for intuition, multitasking and a holistic approach – things we women have in spades.” Like many people, Maureen O’Hara didn’t set out to pursue a career in wine. “The closest connection Killala has with wine is that French ships landed there in 1798. At the last minute, I chose a business degree rather than home economics teacher training. I think part of me wanted to see the bright lights of Dublin.

Wine courses gave me confidence dealing with customers and suppliers. In 2010, I set up Premier Wine Training. One aspect I really enjoy is food and wine pairing. My initial love of food and teaching has come together. “I love the fact that wine education empowers people to do their job well. Students have gone on to run wineries, write wine articles, and everything in between. When I set up Premier Wine Training, some were sceptical that I could earn a living from it. Wine education is stronger now than ever. I could do more but would need a suitable partner.” Sinéad Cabot: “A wine that both energises and soothes.

March 07, 2025 19:58 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, March 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ: RKLB) between November 12, 2024 and February 25, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important April 28, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Rocket Lab securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Rocket Lab class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=36018 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 28, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Rocket Lab’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about Rocket Lab’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Rocket Lab class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=36018 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: Panama Maritime Authority to Review CK Hutchison-BlackRock Port Deal

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Marshall Is. CL YINGDU oil/chemical tanker transits through the Miraflores Locks at the Panama Canal, on the outskirts of Panama City, Panama December 18, 2023. REUTERS/Roberto Cisneros By Elida Moreno and Marianna Parraga PANAMA CITY, March 7 (Reuters) – The Panama Maritime Authority, which oversees shipping and port infrastructure in the country, will request all legal and financial documents from a key transaction between CK Hutchison and a consortium backed by BlackRock, minister to presidency Juan Carlos Orillac said on Friday. U.S. BlackRock announced this week that a group of investors, including Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment, agreed to buy most of the port business of Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison, including its 90% stake in Panama Ports Company, which operates the Balboa and Cristobal terminals under a 25-year concession. The maritime authority is expected to analyze the transaction, which gives control of the two ports strategically located near the Panama Canal to the BlackRock-backed group, at the cabinet’s request, to ensure that public interest in the terminals will be protected, Orillac added in a release. A separate audit of CK Hutchison’s port concession, which was renewed in 2021, is yet to be completed by Panama’s Comptroller General office. The CK Hutchison-BlackRock broad deal involves the Hong-Kong firm’s 80% stake in Hutchison Ports with an equity value of $14.21 billion. However, the conglomerate will receive more than $19 billion following repayment of some shareholder loans. Some U.S. lawmakers have said that CK Hutchison’s control of the Panama ports represents a security risk that might jeopardize the Panama Canal’s operations, backing up President Donald Trump’s threat on taking over the waterway, which was returned by the U.S. to Panama in 1999 under a neutrality treaty. The ports are not part of the canal nor needed for vessels to pass through the interoceanic way, which is mostly used by ships departing from or heading to the U.S. The Panama-owned canal is operated by an autonomous entity, while Panama’s Maritime Authority oversees the ports and Panama’s vessel registry. “My administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we’ve already started doing it,” Trump told the U.S. Congress on Tuesday, following the deal. Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino said Trump was “once again lying” in a social media post on Wednesday. “The Panama Canal is not in the process of being reclaimed … the Canal is Panamanian and will continue to be Panamanian!” The head of Panama’s business chamber Consejo Empresarial Logistico, Daniel Isaza, said the CK Hutchison-BlackRock deal might encourage the expansion of port infrastructure in Panama. “The administration of the Balboa port opposed the construction of other ports in the Pacific and introduced multiple lawsuits that halted the construction of the Corozal port,” he said. “A new administration capable of making new investments to increase port offer is positive for the country.” (Reporting by Elida Moreno and Marianna ParragaEditing by Marguerita Choy) Join the gCaptain Club for curated content, insider opinions, and vibrant community discussions.

Title: Bitcoin Price Crash Incoming? Why A Fall To $63,000 Is Possible If This Resistance Holds
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crash-incoming/

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. The recent Bitcoin price crash below $90,000 came as a shock to the broader crypto community, especially amid expectations of a continued bull market rally. Despite the volatility and ongoing declines, a crypto analyst projects an even greater crash, suggesting that Bitcoin could fall as low as $63,000 if a certain resistance level holds. TradingView crypto analyst Alixjey has declared that the Bitcoin price must break past $99,500 to continue moving higher. He highlights that if this resistance holds and Bitcoin fails to break it, the pioneer cryptocurrency will likely face a steeper price decline to new lows of $63,000. The last time Bitcoin was around the $60,000 range was during its massive price rally in 2024 after the launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Considering that Bitcoin has risen as high as $104,000 at one point this year, a crash toward $60,000 would be a devastating blow to investors and its market. During its price highs, many retail investors were likely unable to buy Bitcoin due to its increasing cost. Most accumulations were from whales who had purchased millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin in one swoop. Alixjey has also labeled his projected $60,000 – $65,000 downturn as the last chance to re-enter the Bitcoin market, emphasizing that it was a prime HODLing point for potential profits in Q3 and Q4 of 2025. This implies that the analyst anticipates a price rebound in Bitcoin later in the year. Moving on, the TradingView expert highlighted two liquidity levels in the 4-hour timeframe that are likely to be cleared soon. He also acknowledged that he was solely bearish on Bitcoin’s price outlook, indicating that his projected short-term pullback will not be invalidated unless the cryptocurrency crosses the resistance between $94,000 and $98,000. Other factors that could contribute to Bitcoin’s already heightened volatility are the Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) data. AlixJey predicts that once released, this data could lead to high volatility in both stocks and crypto. He urges investors and traders to be cautious, as major economic reports often influence market movements. Due to Bitcoin’s recent declines, many analysts have shared bearish projections of the cryptocurrency, expecting a severe price correction before a potential recovery. One such analyst is Herbert Sim, the Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) of AICean. Sim projects that Bitcoin will crash to new lows, especially with the recent approval of a crypto reserve in the United States (US). He expects a crash to $40,000 but highlights that it will be short-lived, spanning from weeks, months, and possibly years. However, the AICean CMO suggested that investors who can HODL for the long-term are likely to see more profits once BTC rebounds from bearish trends.

By Sherisse Pham Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing's CK Hutchison Holdings sold its Panama ports business to a group of investors led by BlackRock. What does this episode tell us about Hong Kong today? JUANA SUMMERS, HOST: A Hong Kong company that operates ports on both ends of the Panama Canal said this week that it had agreed to sell its business there. CK Hutchison announced it had a deal with a group of investors led by a U.S. company. The sale looks like a win for President Trump, who has repeatedly stated that he wants the U.S. to reclaim control of the Panama Canal. Reporter Sherisse Pham has more from northwest Hong Kong.SHERISSE PHAM: I'm here at CK Hutchison's Logistics Center in Kwai Tsing Container Port, one of the busiest container ports in the world.(SOUNDBITE OF MACHINERY RUNNING)PHAM: I see miles and miles of goods and shipping containers and trucks. Everything is stacked like LEGO pieces, ready to be boarded on a ship and transported around the world.But this week, the company announced that it's selling the bulk of its ports business to a group of buyers led by BlackRock. Among the assets being sold - two ports operated by CK Hutchison in the Panama Canal that had come under fire by the Trump administration.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we've already started doing it.(APPLAUSE)PHAM: That was President Trump on Tuesday. He earlier accused China of operating the Panama Canal, an unfounded claim. Beijing called it, quote, "pure lies." CK Hutchison maintains its operations are strictly commercial.The company traces its roots back to when Hong Kong was under British rule. It was founded by billionaire Li Ka-shing, who's now 96 years old. CK Hutchison is a sprawling international conglomerate, operating everything from retail shops to telecommunications.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR #1: Life needs a big network.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "LEAN ON ME")BILL WITHERS: (Singing) I'll help you...(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR #1: Three.PHAM: The company had operated ports for decades, but it was an opportune time to exit a business that had come under geopolitical pressure, according to Dan Baker, senior analyst with Morningstar, a U.S. financial services company.DAN BAKER: My view is, if you get a really good price for it, why not?PHAM: Morningstar estimates Hutchison's ports business was worth about $10 billion. The company sold it to the BlackRock group for nearly double that.BAKER: Given there has been, as of just recently, some geopolitical concerns with some of those businesses - particularly the ones in Panama - they're probably worth more in the buyer's hands than they are in Hutchison's hands.PHAM: But George Chen, Hong Kong managing director of the D.C. consulting firm The Asia Group, argues that CK Hutchison's decision to sell the ports business in Panama is a blow to Hong Kong's reputation as an independent financial center.GEORGE CHEN: On one hand, I think it shows, you know, Li Ka-shing - you know, he's a businessman, and he treats this more as a business decision. But on the other hand, I don't think the deal really makes Hong Kong looks good.PHAM: Chen says CK Hutchison striking this deal so quickly indicates Hong Kong companies nowadays really can't afford to get caught up in geopolitical storms. In a statement, a CK Hutchison spokesperson says the deal is, quote, "purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama ports."(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR #2: CK Hutchison enters the dawn of a new season, building on a firm foundation of its past.PHAM: Hong Kong companies like CK Hutchison once had the best of both worlds, operating in a freer financial system separate from Communist China while still having easy access to China's vast markets. But after Beijing imposed a national security law on Hong Kong in 2020, the region has increasingly been lumped together with Mainland China. Even this deal, analysts say, appears to reflect that lack of distinction.CK Hutchison is now selling dozens of ports in more than 20 countries, but it isn't exiting the business entirely. It will continue to own and operate ports in just two territories, Hong Kong and Mainland China.For NPR News, I'm Sherisse Pham in Hong Kong.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright © 2025 NPR.

A Hong Kong company that operates ports on both ends of the Panama Canal said this week that it had agreed to sell its business there. CK Hutchison announced it had a deal with a group of investors led by a U.S. company. The sale looks like a win for President Trump, who has repeatedly stated that he wants the U.S. to reclaim control of the Panama Canal. Reporter Sherisse Pham has more from northwest Hong Kong.SHERISSE PHAM: I'm here at CK Hutchison's Logistics Center in Kwai Tsing Container Port, one of the busiest container ports in the world.(SOUNDBITE OF MACHINERY RUNNING)PHAM: I see miles and miles of goods and shipping containers and trucks. Everything is stacked like LEGO pieces, ready to be boarded on a ship and transported around the world.But this week, the company announced that it's selling the bulk of its ports business to a group of buyers led by BlackRock. Among the assets being sold - two ports operated by CK Hutchison in the Panama Canal that had come under fire by the Trump administration.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we've already started doing it.(APPLAUSE)PHAM: That was President Trump on Tuesday. He earlier accused China of operating the Panama Canal, an unfounded claim. Beijing called it, quote, "pure lies." CK Hutchison maintains its operations are strictly commercial.The company traces its roots back to when Hong Kong was under British rule. It was founded by billionaire Li Ka-shing, who's now 96 years old. CK Hutchison is a sprawling international conglomerate, operating everything from retail shops to telecommunications.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR #1: Life needs a big network.(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "LEAN ON ME")BILL WITHERS: (Singing) I'll help you...(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR #1: Three.PHAM: The company had operated ports for decades, but it was an opportune time to exit a business that had come under geopolitical pressure, according to Dan Baker, senior analyst with Morningstar, a U.S. financial services company.DAN BAKER: My view is, if you get a really good price for it, why not?PHAM: Morningstar estimates Hutchison's ports business was worth about $10 billion. The company sold it to the BlackRock group for nearly double that.BAKER: Given there has been, as of just recently, some geopolitical concerns with some of those businesses - particularly the ones in Panama - they're probably worth more in the buyer's hands than they are in Hutchison's hands.PHAM: But George Chen, Hong Kong managing director of the D.C. consulting firm The Asia Group, argues that CK Hutchison's decision to sell the ports business in Panama is a blow to Hong Kong's reputation as an independent financial center.GEORGE CHEN: On one hand, I think it shows, you know, Li Ka-shing - you know, he's a businessman, and he treats this more as a business decision. But on the other hand, I don't think the deal really makes Hong Kong looks good.PHAM: Chen says CK Hutchison striking this deal so quickly indicates Hong Kong companies nowadays really can't afford to get caught up in geopolitical storms. In a statement, a CK Hutchison spokesperson says the deal is, quote, "purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama ports."(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR #2: CK Hutchison enters the dawn of a new season, building on a firm foundation of its past.PHAM: Hong Kong companies like CK Hutchison once had the best of both worlds, operating in a freer financial system separate from Communist China while still having easy access to China's vast markets. But after Beijing imposed a national security law on Hong Kong in 2020, the region has increasingly been lumped together with Mainland China. Even this deal, analysts say, appears to reflect that lack of distinction.CK Hutchison is now selling dozens of ports in more than 20 countries, but it isn't exiting the business entirely. It will continue to own and operate ports in just two territories, Hong Kong and Mainland China.For NPR News, I'm Sherisse Pham in Hong Kong.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright © 2025 NPR.

The company sold it to the BlackRock group for nearly double that.BAKER: Given there has been, as of just recently, some geopolitical concerns with some of those businesses - particularly the ones in Panama - they're probably worth more in the buyer's hands than they are in Hutchison's hands.PHAM: But George Chen, Hong Kong managing director of the D.C. consulting firm The Asia Group, argues that CK Hutchison's decision to sell the ports business in Panama is a blow to Hong Kong's reputation as an independent financial center.GEORGE CHEN: On one hand, I think it shows, you know, Li Ka-shing - you know, he's a businessman, and he treats this more as a business decision. But on the other hand, I don't think the deal really makes Hong Kong looks good.PHAM: Chen says CK Hutchison striking this deal so quickly indicates Hong Kong companies nowadays really can't afford to get caught up in geopolitical storms. In a statement, a CK Hutchison spokesperson says the deal is, quote, "purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama ports."(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED NARRATOR #2: CK Hutchison enters the dawn of a new season, building on a firm foundation of its past.PHAM: Hong Kong companies like CK Hutchison once had the best of both worlds, operating in a freer financial system separate from Communist China while still having easy access to China's vast markets. But after Beijing imposed a national security law on Hong Kong in 2020, the region has increasingly been lumped together with Mainland China. Even this deal, analysts say, appears to reflect that lack of distinction.CK Hutchison is now selling dozens of ports in more than 20 countries, but it isn't exiting the business entirely. It will continue to own and operate ports in just two territories, Hong Kong and Mainland China.For NPR News, I'm Sherisse Pham in Hong Kong.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) Copyright © 2025 NPR.

Title: Uranium is in the crosshairs of the US-Canada tariff battle

Nuclear power plants in the US get a lot of uranium from Canada and prices could rise with tariffs. Nuclear power plants in the US get a lot of uranium from Canada and prices could rise with tariffs. by Justine Calma If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. President Donald Trump’s tariff threats could raise the price of uranium used to fuel US nuclear reactors, which could have ripple effects on a tenuous nuclear renaissance spurred by the growth of energy-hungry data centers. The US gets more than a quarter of its uranium from Canada, more than from any other country. The Trump administration imposed new tariffs on uranium and other goods on Canada this week, which he soon paused after a stock market drop and sell-off. It could play into efforts to build up a domestic uranium supply It’s too soon to know what the exact impact would be on the US’s nuclear energy industry if tariffs move forward. It could play into efforts to build up a domestic uranium supply, which has gotten bipartisan support and interest from major tech companies. But in the near term, the US still relies on its northern neighbor to keep reactors running. Trump proposed a 10 percent tariff on energy products from Canada, but he announced yesterday that it would be paused until at least April 2nd. Canada-based Cameco, one of the world’s biggest uranium producers, warned that the tariffs would inevitably lead to higher prices. “It’s kind of Econ 101 to figure out what the impact of tariffs are in this situation,” Cameco CFO Grant Isaac said in a February 20th earnings call. A 10 percent tariff would lead to a 10 percent rise in uranium prices, Isaac said, whether that’s from Canada or elsewhere. “History tells us non-tariff countries will simply increase their offer prices to just under 10 percent,” he said. When reached for comment this week, a spokesperson for Cameco said Isaac’s comments on the call still hold. The Nuclear Energy Institute, a trade association based in Washington, DC, was coy when asked about how the tariffs might affect the US nuclear energy industry. “We agree in principle that actions should be taken to unleash America’s energy dominance and protect our national security, while also creating a robust economy that spurs job creation. However, these measures could hinder growth and innovation in the energy sector and the nations’ ability to achieve energy dominance,” Doug True, senior vice president of technical and regulatory services and chief nuclear officer, said in an emailed statement. Uranium prices have risen dramatically in recent years, with growing interest in nuclear energy — including from Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta seeking out nuclear energy to power new AI data centers. Higher uranium prices incentivized the resurgence of uranium mining in the US, with the first mine to open in nearly a decade starting up near the Grand Canyon last year. The Russia-Ukraine war is another factor, with the Biden administration banning uranium imports from Russia, another major supplier, last year. “Why are we dependent on foreign nations when the US has the capability, has the resources, has the technology to actually become energy independent, especially in nuclear?” says Jay Yu, president of LIS Technologies, a US-based laser uranium enrichment company. But even if the US builds up its domestic supply chain, it’s still constrained by geography. The US only holds about 1 percent of the world’s uranium reserves, while Canada holds about 10 times as much. “Tariffs would threaten uranium supply at a time when the United States is seeking to expand its nuclear dominance,” Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote in a late January analysis. The emergence of DeepSeek’s AI models in China, which can ostensibly use much less energy than US rivals, has also made the future of data center energy use and nuclear energy more uncertain. Nuclear energy is still a touchy subject that’s created some strange bedfellows. Unlike coal and gas power plants, nuclear reactors don’t generate greenhouse gas emissions. That’s put it on the table as an alternative to fossil fuels that some climate hawks champion. But someone has to mine the uranium for those nuclear reactors, which some environmental groups and Indigenous activists are fighting fervently. The US has a history of uranium mines contaminating water resources on Navajo Nation land. Trump, a big fan of the fossil fuel industry that dumped tens of millions of dollars into his campaign, has essentially tried to eradicate action on the climate crisis in the US. He could carve out exceptions for nuclear energy technologies that have garnered support from extractive industries and Big Tech. He tapped Chris Wright to lead the Energy Department; Wright was previously the CEO of a major oil and gas service provider and sat on the board of directors for a company developing advanced nuclear reactors with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Uranium sits at the nexus of many different power plays in the US, and tariffs could raise the stakes for everyone with something to lose or gain.

Title: JPMorgan Chase Is Oversold

ByDividend Channel ByDividend Channel , Contributor. The DividendRank formula at Dividend Channel ranks a coverage universe of thousands of dividend stocks, according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics — strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive. JPMorgan Chase presently has an excellent rank, in the top 25% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most "interesting" ideas that merit further research by investors. 10 Oversold Dividend Stocks » But making JPMorgan Chase & Co an even more interesting and timely stock to look at, is the fact that in trading on Friday, shares of JPM entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $240.55 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30. In the case of JPMorgan Chase, the RSI reading has hit 28.5 — by comparison, the universe of dividend stocks covered by Dividend Channel currently has an average RSI of 43.7. A falling stock price — all else being equal — creates a better opportunity for dividend investors to capture a higher yield. Indeed, JPM's recent annualized dividend of 5/share (currently paid in quarterly installments) works out to an annual yield of 2.03% based upon the recent $246.54 share price. A bullish investor could look at JPM's 28.5 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. Among the fundamental datapoints dividend investors should investigate to decide if they are bullish on JPM is its dividend history. In general, dividends are not always predictable; but, looking at the history chart below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.

Friday, March 7th, 2025 Canadian tariff drama, fears of OPEC+ production returning to markets, Trump’s maximum pressure on Iran, and a US-China trade war – this week seemed to have it all. Oil prices tumbled through the week but then started to recover early on Friday morning. With flattening backwardation prompting the Saudis to cut prices, the initial shock of Trump’s first month is giving way to a more nuanced approach with ICE Brent futures trading around the $71 per barrel mark. Trump Delays Mexico Tariffs for A Month. In contrast to worsening US-Canada relations, the White House has postponed tariffs on most imports from Mexico until 2 April following President Trump’s call with his Mexican peer Claudia Sheinbaum, allowing US refiners to continue their heavy crude imports. Iraq’s Kurdish Dream Has Failed Again. Baghdad’s political push to restart pipeline flows from Kurdish-controlled regions to Turkey’s port of Ceyhan has run aground again, after Iraq’s $16 per barrel price offered to oil companies currently drilling in Kurdistan failed to entice sufficient interest. BlackRock Buys the Panama Canal. US investment giant BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) agreed to buy two major ports on the Panama Canal and ancillary infrastructure from Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison for $22.8 billion, in line with President Trump’s demands that Panama cut Chinese influence at the canal. Chinese Oil Imports Slump as Sanctions Affect Buying. Chinese crude oil imports averaged 10.38 million b/d in January-February 2025, marking a 5% year-over-year decrease, as recent US sanctions on Iranian and Russian tankers disrupted deliveries to the northeastern Shandong province. Venture Global Doubles Down on Plaquemines. US LNG developer Venture Global (NYSE:VG) said it would expand the aggregate production capacity of its 27 mtpa Plaquemines LNG plant in Louisiana to 45 mtpa, eyeing additional 24 trains in the project’s third expansion phase at a cost of 18 billion. Saudi Arabia Drops April Oil Prices. Saudi Aramco (TADAWUL:2222), the world’s largest oil exporter, cut its formula prices for April-loading cargoes into Asia with Arab Light now priced at $3.50 per barrel above Dubai, the first downward move in three months as the market anticipates the unwinding of OPEC+ cuts. US Withdraws from Coal Divestment Alliance. As announced by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the United States will withdraw from the International Partners Group, a global coal divestment initiative, leaving South Africa with a more than $1 billion financing gap to decommission coal plants. Copper Soars to 4-Month High. Copper prices gained this week after US President Trump waived carmakers from tariffs and China’s National Congress doubled down on stimulus measures, sending the LME three-month contract to its highest since early November 2024, above $9,700 per metric tonne. Ireland Eyes First LNG Terminal. The government of Ireland has approved a plan to develop an emergency LNG import facility, to be used as a floating strategic gas reserve, less than two years after Dublin rejected an application to build an LNG terminal on climate grounds. Trump Administration Flags $20 Billion SPR Spree. Whilst touring the Plaquemines LNG facility in Louisiana, US Secretary of Energy Chris Wright stated that he plans to seek up to $20 billion in congressional funding to refill the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve, equivalent to 295 million barrels. Defying Trump Fears, Canada Wants More US Pipes. Canada’s midstream giant Enbridge (NYSE:ENB) has allocated $1.4 billion to boost the throughput capacity of its main US-bound oil conduit Mainline by an additional 300,000 b/d over the next three years, with 2024 flows averaging 3.1 million b/d. Indonesia Dreams Up Refining Boost. The government of Indonesia announced its plan to build a new 530,000 b/d refinery at a cost of $12.5 billion, seeking to end a protracted period of import dependence as Jakarta is not being able to cover roughly 40% of oil and 42% of products demand. Russia Plays Down OPEC+ Expectations. Monday’s OPEC+ meeting where output-cutting members reiterated their plans to unwind production curbs from April shed some $3/bbl from oil prices this week, prompting Russian Deputy Prime Minister Novak to state that OPEC+ could reverse the unwinding after April. East African Nations Crave More Drilling. Tanzania announced it would launch its 5th oil and gas licensing round in May, offering 26 exploration blocks most of which would be located offshore in the Indian Ocean, seeking to build on past discoveries that built some 57 Tcf of natural gas reserves.

Title: Corporate NZ is ‘doubling down’ on diversity, equity and inclusion, Global Women’s new CEO says

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Global Women CEO Katie Bhreatnach. A rollback of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies at Government and corporate institutions in the United States is not deterring the new New Zealand head of the Global Women initiative, nor its corporate partners. “Companies that I get to work with in this role at Global Women, I don’t see them stepping back, I actually see them doubling down,” Katie Bhreatnach told the Herald ahead of International Women’s Day on March 8. “Businesses here understand that inclusion drives performance.” Global Women’s biggest partners included PwC New Zealand, Toyota New Zealand, Air New Zealand, ANZ Bank, Westpac bank, One NZ (formerly Vodafone), Spark, Fletcher Building, Fonterra, Infratil, NZX and KiwiRail among others. “[But,] globally, we’re seeing rolling back of DEI initiatives and most notably in the US.” Bhreatnach said while New Zealand was not immune to global trends, she suggested New Zealanders could choose to follow them or not. “New Zealand’s always had a unique approach, where we’ve got a history of trailblazers, and we’re always trying to drive that change and challenge ourselves to think about how we can do things differently.” She cited US President Donald Trump’s executive order to terminate DEI targets in the federal workforce’s hiring and promoting processes as a move that undermined decades worth of progress. Yesterday New Zealand First introduced a similar bill to “ensure employment decisions in the public service are based on merit and not on forced woke ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ targets,” leader and Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters posted on X. “There are some companies [globally] that are using the current context as an opportunity to backtrack,” Bhreatnach said. “We’ve seen companies like the CEO from BlackRock, Larry Fink, go from saying DEI must be embedded into everything, to there being no references to DEI.” Meta, owner of Facebook and Instagram, Alphabet, parent company of Google, Amazon, Goldman Sachs and McDonald’s were reportedly among companies in the US that had reduced or scrapped diversity initiatives. But some companies had maintained their diversity stance, Bhreatnach pointed out. “We’ve also seen attempts from shareholders to get the Apple board to abandon its DEI policies fail. “They [Apple] put a lot of effort into creating a culture of collaboration where those diverse perspectives come together and create the magic. That is the success for their company.” While the Apple shareholder proposal was rejected, CEO Tim Cook did suggest some of the technology company’s policies may require adjustment for legal reasons. “As the legal landscape around this issue evolves, we may need to make some changes to comply, but our north star of dignity and respect for everyone and our work to that end will never waiver,” Cook said at Apple’s annual shareholder meeting last week. Domestically, Bhreatnach was optimistic New Zealand business leaders would follow Cook’s lead. “I think that New Zealand leaders are smart, and they will see that DEI is actually about ensuring talent has the opportunity to thrive. “The businesses I engage with ... they see DEI not as a compliance exercise that takes away from business strategy. Rather, they see it as a strategic advantage.” When asked at what priority level business executives and board members should place DEI, amid their core business, profitability, safety and climate priorities, she said DEI should be considered key. “Having a great culture and talent, and also future talent strategy, I would suggest, is a key pillar for any successful business. “Every organisation I’ve worked in has structured them differently. “What really matters is the commitment to the clarity of your strategy and vision, and the commitment to executing it and driving it forward.” Bhreatnach said organisations she had worked with previously had flexible work policies, pay equity targets and leadership programmes in place. She was a director of the Global Women organisation for two years before becoming its chief executive in January 2025. Her other roles included chair of The Trusts Arena, director of Dunedin Airport and council member at the tertiary education provider Te Wānanga o Aotearoa. “In all those roles I’ve always bought a passion and commitment to uplifting, and accelerating diverse leadership,” she said of her career. “Fundamentally, I want to be a good ancestor, and leave the world in a better place than how I inherited it. “And so all of my roles, I’ve bought a drive to challenge the status quo.” Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.

Title: Stock investors are hovering near a make-or-break level in the market

The stock market has entered the danger zone as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 hover near their 200-day moving averages. Both indexes are trading at the key technical support level after a 6% decline in the S&P 500 and a 9% sell-off in the Nasdaq 100 since mid-February. The 200-day moving average is a closely watched technical indicator that helps identify the long-term direction of a trend. When securities fall below their 200-day moving average, it sends a warning to traders that the prior uptrend in price could be on the verge of reversing course and establishing a downtrend. The Nasdaq 100 closed below its 200-day moving average on Thursday for the first time since March 2023, while the S&P 500 tested the level multiple times this week for the first time since October 2023. As of Friday morning, the S&P 500 is trading at 5,728.90, just a few points below its 200-day moving average of 5,732, while the Nasdaq 100 is trading at 20,056.35, below its 200-day moving average of 20,246.83. It's a potentially make-or-break moment for the stock market as traders assess the impact of President Donald Trump's tariff policies. According to technical analyst Katie Stockton of Fairlead Strategies, the S&P 500 needs to stage a decisive bounce above this technical level to prevent further downside. "Our short-term indicators suggest it will act as a staging ground for a brief oversold bounce," Stockton told clients in a note on Friday. "Nevertheless, a close below 5,783 today would leave a breakdown pending confirmation next Friday." Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group, told Business Insider that he wouldn't be surprised if big-money buyers started to enter the market. "These longer-term trendlines can be used by institutions to buy up shares, so we'd expect to see some type of potential buying down around here," Detrick said, adding that this correction in the stock market is perfectly normal, especially after the back-to-back years of 20%+ gains in 2023 and 2024. "We remain overweight equities and would use it as an opportunity to accumulate solid companies at a discount. After gaining 20% two years in a row, some consolidation early this year makes a lot of sense," Detrick said. Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, highlighted in a note this week that an index that equally weights the Magnificent Seven mega-cap tech stocks — Nvidia, Apple, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla — is also trading at its 200-day moving average. If it falls below the threshold, it would suggest investors should look elsewhere for leadership in the stock market. "A violation of the 200-dma would imply that the Mag Seven's leadership status has been revoked," Turnquist said. For David Keller, chief strategist at Sierra Alpha Research, traders should be on watch for a more painful decline in stock prices. Keller told BI that a confirmed breakdown below the 5,700 level in the S&P 500 would suggest that the index could test support at 5,500, representing potential downside of about 4% from current levels.

Title: Lancaster County residents, businesses feel the pressure of high egg prices

Two pastors sitting in a sunny window booth were contemplating a serious question: eggs or no eggs? Angelo Rodriguez and Wendell Yorkman met for breakfast on Monday at The Pancake Farm in Manheim Township. On the front door, a sign told customers a $1.50 upcharge would be added to any egg dish, due to the high cost of eggs. Yorkman was debating whether to get pancakes instead. “But then I remembered, my friend was paying,” he said. Rodriguez usually adds a third egg to his breakfasts, but this morning was weighing the upcharge. He recently went to pick up a few groceries for his daughter and looked at the price of a dozen eggs. “It was $8.75 and I said, you know what? She’ll be all right,” he said. Dr. Wendell Yorkman, of Mountville, left, and Pastor Angelo Rodriguez, of Lancaster, chat over breakfast at The Pancake Farm in Manheim Township on Monday, March 3, 2025. Local restaurants, bakeries and grocery stores are feeling the heat from rising egg prices aggravated by the ongoing avian flu outbreak that has taken a toll on the nationwide egg supply. As businesses scramble to keep up with soaring costs, consumers are left to decide if they are willing to spend extra for a breakfast staple and ingredient in many favorite recipes. One booth over from Rodriguez and Wendell, Robyn Weidner said she hasn’t been going out to breakfast as much because of price increases. Even at home, she’s eating less eggs. She was eating a lot of them as a source of protein while she’s in training for a half-marathon. Now she’s turning to other high-protein alternatives like oatmeal and chia seed pudding. “I'm not going out and spending $7.99 on a dozen eggs, I can guarantee you that,” Weidner said. “I'm a single mom, so absolutely not, no way.” READ: Trump opens the door to exempting eggs from tariffs levied on Canada and Mexico READ: Egg prices could jump 41% this year, USDA says, as Trump's bird flu plan is unveiled The average price of one dozen eggs nationwide has risen 96% from $2.52 in January 2024 to $4.95 in January this year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. But that’s just an average. What Lancaster County residents are seeing can be much higher. Avian flu is a factor. In January 2022, before the outbreak started, one dozen grade A, large eggs cost $1.93 on average, nationwide. In its most recent egg markets overview report, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Marketing Service said there are still inadequate egg supplies because of the ongoing avian flu outbreak, but there are signs the situation may be starting to improve. The USDA said the pace of the outbreak is slowing and the national egg inventory rose slightly at the end of February. The USDA said bird flu outbreaks in commercial table egg layer flocks in the first two months of this year resulted in the death of 30.1 million birds, 74% of which lived in conventional caged systems and produce the most common eggs that hit grocery store shelves. Following is the average price of a dozen grade A large eggs in the United States from January 2024 to this past January: Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Pennsylvania egg production during January totaled 681.8 million, a 4% decrease from the same time last year, according to the USDA. The state’s population of layer chickens was 6% lower in January, compared to the previous year. Since Feb. 6, more than 136,000 birds in Lancaster County have been affected by avian flu, according to the USDA, but none of them egg layers. Pennsylvania lost 1.9 million laying hens in Dauphin County and more than 85,000 in Lebanon County in early February. Shannon Powers, press secretary for the state Department of Agriculture, said the Shapiro Administration is working to keep costs down for consumers through a Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Recovery Fund, which helps farmers increase biosecurity measures and recover losses. She said the state’s investment in testing and a coordinated response to outbreaks also help farmers minimize the cost to their operations and protect against future harm. Powers said Pennsylvania ranks fourth in the nation in egg production and first in organic egg production. Eggs and other poultry products fall among Pennsylvania’s largest exports, worth $155.6 million. Many factors determine the cost of eggs, Powers said. “Canada and Mexico are two of our largest trading partners. Any negative changes to international trade could impact poultry farmers and the price of eggs,” she said. READ: Here's how Pa. is handling the latest outbreak of bird flu in Lancaster County The Pancake Farm owner Javier Camacho said prices are affecting his business. He said customer traffic is down around 25%. Camacho decided to add the $1.50 upcharge to egg meals a few weeks ago to deal with volatile prices, which he said was a hard decision. “Prices are changing every day,” Camacho said. “If we place an order today and a dozen is $8.25, tomorrow will be $8.75 a dozen.” Camacho said the restaurant uses up to 190 dozen eggs per week. He doesn’t want customers to think he’s using the eggs as an excuse to bring in more money; he said he has to think of his employees and business costs. The upcharge doesn’t apply to every meal. The pancake batter contains eggs, but pancakes don’t get the upcharge because, Camacho said, “they are our main thing.” A price increase on pancakes would be “devastating,” he said. Keith Thompson, of Reading, types in the table information so Marshmellow the mechanical helper knows where to take an order of poached eggs and chipped beef at The Pancake Farm in Manheim Township on Monday, March 3, 2025. Not everyone at The Pancake Farm is concerned. Most diners still have plates of eggs in front of them. “If I need eggs, I buy eggs,” said Nancy Sarley, who had just ordered poached eggs. “I'm just happy to wake up in the morning, I'm not looking at dirt, I’m not worried about the price of eggs,” said David Sarley. At Quarryville Family Restaurant, managing partner Andrew Morgan is torn on how to handle the price of eggs. The restaurant goes through 300 dozen of them per week. He hasn’t changed prices in about 10 months, he said, because he doesn’t want to upset his customers. A meal of two eggs, home fries, toast and bottomless coffee is $5.50 at the restaurant. “We have an awesome group of customers who are very loyal, who say, ‘you got to do what you got to do.’ But we also want to provide value for their hard-earned dollar,” Morgan said. An old purchase order put the issue in stark perspective for Morgan. He said the order shows he paid $31.39 for 30 dozen eggs three years ago. Today he is paying $250.59 for the same amount. “That’s a 700% increase,” he said. READ: Would tariffs hurt Lancaster County businesses, consumers? Here's what we know Brad Milliken, of Lititz, had a breakfast of bacon, eggs and hash browns at The Pancake Farm in Manheim Township on Monday, March 3, 2025. While grocery shopping, customers have to decide how important eggs are to them. At the Dutch-Way Farm Market in Ephrata Township, Kami Miller of Rothsville put one dozen eggs in her cart. “One dozen, that’s all I can afford,” she said, laughing. Miller said, since she moved to Rothsville about a year and a half ago, she’s watched the price of a dozen eggs jump from $1.99 to $5.99. She said she never really watched egg prices until now, and she’s been baking a lot less because of it. Larry Kauffman of East Lampeter Township wasn’t bothered much by the price. He said he always keeps eggs in the house. “I hate to see what they’ll be by Easter,” he said. Frances Eberly of Lititz glanced over the egg display before pushing her cart away. She said she had some eggs at home, so she didn’t need to buy more. Plus, she has a source outside the grocery store; a friend with chickens will sell her a dozen eggs for $3. “I guess if I needed them, I would pay that price,” she said. Eberly said eggs are in so many baked goods that she has cut back on baking because of the price. Scott Petersen, dairy manager at Dutch-Way Farm Market in Ephrata Township, stocks the egg display at the grocery store on Monday, March 3, 2025. Jordan Snader, a partner at Dutch-Way, said the market’s relationship with a local farm lets them keep a steady supply of eggs at a better price than some competitors. One dozen large white eggs were on sale for $5.99 as of Monday. Snader said customers are changing their patterns as egg prices rise, but he said they generally understand that it’s a nationwide problem. Some customers have turned to specialty eggs over commercial white eggs. Dave Dietz, produce and dairy manager at Lemon Street Market in Lancaster city, said it’s been a little challenging to keep eggs in stock. He said egg sales are up 40%-50% over last year. That’s likely because the market has high standards for eggs, Dietz said, usually offering pastured and organic varieties. Prices for specialty eggs haven’t jumped as dramatically as commercial white eggs. For example, Eagle Road brand brown, large eggs from non-GMO fed, pastured hens are priced at $5.49 per dozen, the cheapest eggs at Lemon Street Market. Prices range up to $9.99 per dozen for Alderfer brand brown, jumbo, organic eggs. READ: Middle Creek visitors must change their plans this snow geese season It’s one thing to skip eggs for breakfast. But eggs are a critical ingredient in many baked goods. Laura Wu, co-owner of Hello Mango Asian Bakery in Manheim Township, said she can no longer afford eggs from the wholesale company she was working with. Now she’s hunting for eggs at Costco, Restaurant Depot, and farm markets. It’s not just the price. “It is also difficult to find more eggs,” Wu said. “Everywhere has limits.” The bakery has had to raise prices by $2 for a 6-inch cake and $4 for an 8-inch cake. Wu said she is hoping prices drop in the spring. Erica Wolgemuth-Johnson is experimenting with using less eggs in some of her products at Erica Joy Bakes Gluten Free Creations in Lititz. She has experience baking without eggs; her shop specializes in vegan treats. “I was joking the other day that we’ll just go fully vegan,” Wolgemuth-Johnson said. But she said there are egg-heavy recipes that she will keep, because she created the recipes, like her honey-almond-lavender cake. She hasn’t raised prices so far, since gluten-free products are already a little more expensive and she doesn’t want to price people out. Wolgemuth-Johnson is avoiding making egg-heavy bakes for the shop’s display case. “I’m not going to make it just in the hopes someone comes in and buys it,” she said. Success!

The Trump administration believes a renewed emphasis on biosecurity can help in the battle against bird flu and ease egg prices. The Agriculture Department predicts the current record prices are going to get much worse this year. It’s also not clear how much more farmers can do to keep the virus out. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins offered the first new details about her bird flu plan Wednesday. The USDA predicted this week that egg prices will soar more than 41% this year on top of the record average price of $4.95 per dozen.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, March 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) and reminds investors of the March 25, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that the true state of Novo’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” On December 20, 2024, during pre-market hours, Novo announced headline results for its REDEFINE-1 trial, which determined CagriSema had achieved a weight loss average of only 22.7% after 68 weeks. The Company attributed this diminished result, in part, on the previously undisclosed “flexible” nature of the protocol. This flexibility resulted in less than 60% of patients apparently completing the dose escalation period and thus being treated with “2.4 mg cagrilintide and 2.4 mg semaglutide once-weekly,” the maximum dosage of CagriSema contemplated by the trial, during the 52-week maintenance period in the manner outlined by the published protocol for the REDEFINE-1 study. Investors and analysts reacted immediately to Novo’s revelation. The price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $103.44 per share on December 19, 2024, Novo’s stock price fell to $85.00 per share on December 20, 2024, a decline of about 17.83% in the span of just a single day. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Novo Nordisk’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Title: The tariff fight is far from over

Happy Friday! If you're grabbing an Uber or Lyft this weekend and a Tesla shows up, do yourself a favor and don't bring up Elon Musk. Whether you love him or hate him, chances are your driver doesn't want to talk about it. (And if you insist on doing it, they'll probably just say what they think will get them the best tip.) In today's big story, tariffs against Canada and Mexico have been mostly delayed by a month in yet another turnaround in the ongoing trade war. What's on deck Markets: One betting market has the odds of a US recession at 32%. Tech: Microsoft is talking up a massive quantum-computing breakthrough. Amazon execs aren't buying it. Business: Some senators want to take a closer look at X's advertising tactics. But first, another postponement. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. So, about those tariffs… Two days after implementing a 25% tax on Mexican and Canadian goods, President Donald Trump is pulling a U-turn. The president announced a one-month pause on tariffs for both countries' imports that fall under an agreement called USMCA. If you're a bit rusty on your global trade regulations, USMCA was the trade deal that Trump negotiated between the US, Canada, and Mexico to replace NAFTA. The trade pact covers most goods, making Trump's announcement almost equivalent to the monthlong pause on tariffs he initiated in February. The offer didn't extend to the other target of Trump's tariffs, China, which has issued retaliatory tariffs. There's long been speculation that Trump's tariffs were merely a negotiation tactic to get better trade terms from other countries. And the president's willingness to issue another reprieve from his trade taxes could be proof of that. But the market's willingness to accept the ongoing uncertainty might only extend so far. Investors are already on edge as fears of a potential recession start to bubble up. Stocks rebounded on Wednesday after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick hinted a resolution to the tariff situation could be coming. But despite the official announcement on Thursday, stocks finished down considerably. The S&P 500 closed 1.78% lower, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.61%. Trump's flip-flopping may not pay off in the long term. That's according to supply chain and conflict resolution scholars, who said his tariff tensions are eroding the US's relationships with its allies. Things aren't likely to calm down in the meantime. The February jobs report comes out this morning. It will help inform the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates on March 19, which is less than two weeks away. And the fight over tariffs is far from over. Canada and Mexico's postponement is only until April 2. That also coincides with the kickoff of more tariffs. This time they're targeting foreign agricultural goods and other products. Trump also mentioned South Korea, India, and the European Union over what he said were unfair trade relations. There's no shortage of experts weighing in on what it all means. If you want to sound smart about the Trump tariffs, here are some of the best thinkers to follow. Sorry, American firms, the AI trade has moved to China. 1. Economists and betting markets agree: Odds of a recession are rising. The chance of a US recession jumped to 32% on Thursday on Polymarket, up 23% from late February. Wall Street economists say the reason is Trump-shaped — the administration's unpredictable policy moves could shake consumer confidence to the core. 2. Inside "Project Voyage," Goldman Sachs' grand plan to thin its ranks, cut costs. In addition to moving the bank's annual culling of underperformers up the calendar, CEO David Solomon plans to relocate employees from New York City to lower-cost areas like Dallas and Salt Lake City, people familiar with the program told BI. One former employee said Project Voyage is a multi-year plan, and you can expect these divisions to be the most impacted. 3. How much do investment bankers really make? As Wall Street waits to see if a dealmaking rebound will fully materialize this year, recruiting firm Prospect Rock Partners heard from over 900 investment bankers on how much they earned in 2024. Check out some of the survey's highlights. 1. The petition to standardize closed captions. BI's Katie Notopoulos has a bone to pick with streaming services: Captions are too hard to figure out. Every streamer has a different interface, posing a challenge for the 63% of Americans under 30 who prefer subtitles. Maybe you're swiping up, but what if it's actually down? Perhaps you accidentally click the dreaded "Play from the Beginning" button in the process. She thinks it's all too much, and it's also an accessibility issue. 2. Amazon calls BS on Microsoft's quantum-computing claims. In an email to CEO Andy Jassy, Amazon's head of quantum tech expressed doubts that Microsoft's Majorana 1 quantum computing chip could do all it was hyped up to do, according to a copy of the email obtained by BI. Industry experts said tech companies might be generating more hype than substance in their attempts to outdo each other in the field. 3. The shortcut for cheap AI. Distillation — using one model to improve another — has more potential today than ever, thanks to the plethora of open-source models that can serve as "teachers." While some developers celebrate the concept, the big AI companies behind foundation models need to justify and protect their pricey offerings. 1. These senators want an investigation into Elon Musk's X. Democratic senators Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Richard Blumenthal, Adam Schiff, and Chris Van Hollen are calling for a DOJ probe into X. Specifically, they want to know if X is leveraging Musk's political status to pressure companies into advertising on the social media platform, referencing an article from The Wall Street Journal article last month. Read the letters they sent to the DOJ and the FTC. 2. Playing dress up with an AI twist. Fashion app Doji uses AI to help users virtually try on clothes, and early beta testers are loving it. One fan is none other than Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian, who's also backing it through his venture capital firm Seven Seven Six. 3. Social Security employees can't read news sites at work anymore. As the Trump administration continues restructuring the Social Security Administration, a recent agency-wide email announced new browsing restrictions for employees' work computers. Restrictions prohibit workers from checking the news, online shopping, and visiting sports sites. According to the email, the goal is to limit risk and protect sensitive information. I tried ChatGPT's new Deep Research. It was worth the extra wait of up to 30 minutes for its reports. The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

A combination of OPEC+ supply hikes, trade war escalations, and weak demand indicators has kept oil bulls at bay, reinforcing a bearish outlook for the market. While a short-term technical rebound was observed, the broader downtrend remains intact. OPEC+ Production Hike Adds to Bearish Sentiment OPEC+ surprised the market with its decision to raise production quotas for the first time since 2022, adding 138,000 barrels per day (bpd) to supply starting in April.

Some analysts believe political motivations may be at play, with former U.S. President Donald Trump reportedly favoring lower oil prices. This shift in OPEC+ strategy has forced traders to reassess supply expectations, adding to volatility in crude markets. U.S. Tariffs and Retaliatory Measures Threaten Demand Growth New U.S. tariffs on Canadian and Mexican crude oil imports have injected further uncertainty into the market, exacerbating fears of weaker demand. The U.S. imposed a 10% duty on Canadian energy exports, with reports suggesting it may soon be lifted for select products. Mexico’s status remains unclear, adding another layer of concern for Gulf Coast refiners who rely on Mexican crude for blending. China, another major oil consumer, responded to U.S. tariffs by increasing levies on American agricultural products and restricting U.S. company operations. The escalating trade war has raised concerns about slowing global economic growth, which in turn could reduce energy demand. Goldman Sachs warned that while tariffs do not directly impact crude prices, they create headwinds for economic activity, dampening industrial fuel consumption. U.S. Crude Inventories Build as Refinery Demand Softens The latest data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) revealed a larger-than-expected build in crude oil inventories, with stockpiles rising by 3.6 million barrels last week. The increase was largely attributed to seasonal refinery maintenance, which led to lower processing rates. Refineries operated at 85.9% capacity, down from the previous week. Despite the rise in crude stocks, gasoline and distillate fuel inventories declined, suggesting stronger refined product demand. However, the broader inventory trends reinforce concerns that oil markets are still oversupplied, particularly in light of additional OPEC+ barrels hitting the market in April. Geopolitical Risks Remain, but Demand Concerns Dominate While geopolitical risks persist, their impact on crude prices has been overshadowed by bearish fundamentals. Reports suggest the White House may ease sanctions on Russian oil exports following a shift in U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine. If sanctions relief materializes, it could further pressure oil prices by allowing more Russian crude to reach global markets. Meanwhile, the U.S. has ramped up sanctions on Iran, aiming to curb its oil exports and disrupt its economy. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed that Washington is reviewing all existing waivers that provide Iran with economic relief, signaling a more aggressive stance. However, analysts believe spare capacity in the market could offset any supply disruptions from Iran, making demand-side risks the greater concern for oil prices. Weekly Light Crude Oil Futures Trend Indicator Analysis The main trend is up according to the weekly swing chart, however, momentum is trending lower with the market trading on the bearish side of the 52-week moving average at $71.23. This is new resistance along with a pair of pivots at $69.53 and $70.78. The downside momentum indicates traders have their eyes on three key bottoms, $64.75, $61.58 and $59.52. Weekly Technical Forecast The direction of the Weekly Light Crude Oil Futures market the week ending March 14 is likely to be determined by trader reaction to $71.23. Bullish Scenario A sustained move over $71.23 will signal the presence of strong buyers. If this creates enough near-term momentum, we could see a possible retest of $72.32. This move will be difficult to achieve from current price levels, which means the market is in a bearish position. Although it won’t create a bullish scenario, per se, a steep plunge int $64.75 to $59.52 could bring in the bottom-pickers, which may fuel a strong short-covering rally. Bearish Scenario A sustained move under $69.53 will indicate the presence of counter-trend sellers. The weekly chart indicates there is plenty of room to the downside with the first target $64.75, followed by $61.58 and $59.52. Market Outlook: Further Downside Risk with Limited Upside Potential The crude oil market remains biased to the downside, with multiple headwinds keeping a lid on price gains. OPEC+ supply increases, ongoing trade tensions, and weak refinery demand have reinforced bearish sentiment. While a short-term rebound was observed, technical resistance is likely to cap any sustained rally. If crude prices break below key support levels, further selling pressure could accelerate, exposing lower technical targets. Unless a major bullish catalyst emerges, such as a significant demand rebound or a shift in OPEC+ policy, traders should expect continued volatility with a bearish tilt in the near term. Technically, light crude oil futures are trading on the weakside of the 52week average $71.23, which should be enough to call it bearish. Our work suggests the market is headed toward $64.75 to $59.52, where aggressive countertrend buyers could be waiting. We could be nearing the liquidation phase of this current selloff, which means we could see freefalling prices into the former support levels at $64.75, $61.58 and $59.52. The cause of any steep liquidation next week is likely to be “margin call” selling. During a massive break in the stock market, hedge funds are often forced to liquidate other positions to meet the market call. Crude oil could be one of those markets that they sell.

Title: Tokenized Assets Soar To $50 Billion—Is $2 Trillion Inevitable?

Time Published: 2025-03-07T13:30:08Z

There is a substantial demand for tokenized bonds and real estate. The market for tokenized assets is rapidly growing, with a value that has surpassed $50 billion. Real estate comprises a substantial portion, with tokenized properties totaling $30 billion. Financial analysts anticipate that this figure will continue to increase, with projections indicating that the market could surpass $2 trillion by 2030. Debt tokenization is also on the rise, particularly in Europe. Deutschland is the pioneer in tokenized bond issuance, accounting for nearly 60% of the total. The European Investment Bank, for instance, issued a €100 million digital bond on Ethereum. With clear regulations in place, European financial institutions seem ready to explore tokenized finance even further. According to Brickken’s recent paper, “RWA Tokenization: Key Trends and 2025 Market Outlook,” the market for tokenized assets of all types has now topped $50 billion, with tokenized real estate accounting for $30 billion of that total. This transition is receiving considerable attention from major financial institutions. BlackRock, Ripple, and Coinbase Asset Management are big names that are entering the space and offering tokenized investment products. Another industry participant, Glasstower, is also expanding its services to accommodate the increasing demand. Tokenization offers advantages that conventional finance cannot replicate. It enables the division of assets into smaller, more affordable units, thereby increasing the accessibility of investing. It also enhances the speed and transparency of transactions by utilizing blockchain networks. This configuration appears to be well-received by investors, and companies are striving to remain competitive. Better regulatory support is one factor contributing to the rapid expansion of tokenized assets. In particular, Europe has implemented regulations that facilitate the operation of institutions in this domain. The legal framework of the European Union has provided financial institutions with the assurance necessary to introduce new products and services that are associated with blockchain technology. In the United States, regulatory discussions are continuing. Some companies are being cautious, waiting for firmer standards before fully committing. Despite this, tokenized funds, real estate, and bonds remain popular among investors seeking innovative methods to hold and build their capital. Many believe that tokenization will become a standard feature of the financial industry, with a projected value of $2 trillion by 2030. More banks, financial institutions, and tech firms are expected to enter the market and offer investors new services. Debt securities and tokenized real estate demonstrate how blockchain technology is revolutionizing the way people invest.

Title: Indonesia’s Gas Demand Rising as LNG Starts to Replace Diesel for Power

More Info Indonesia has started replacing diesel as a fuel in dozens of power plants with LNG, which is set to boost demand for natural gas in one of the world’s top LNG exporters. Following a decade of delays, Indonesia finally launched a $1.5 billion project to distribute LNG on a small scale to power dozens of plants that currently run on diesel, Reuters reports. PLN EPI, a fuel procurement and transportation operator for Indonesia’s largest power company, PLN, is leading the project. Last year, Japan’s JERA signed a collaboration agreement with PLN EPI to collaborate in LNG procurement, optimization, and the development and operation of LNG receiving terminals in anticipation of growing demand for LNG in Indonesia. By utilizing JERA’s LNG expertise, JERA and PLN EPI will establish an LNG value chain for the power segment in Indonesia, the companies said. The project will need more LNG supply in the future, and could lead to Indonesia turning to LNG imports later this decade, according to estimates reported by Reuters. “We are obliged to provide the LNG ... And we are keen on securing more domestic LNG for the project,” Rakhmad Dewanto, director of fuels and gas at PLN EPI, told Reuters. Early this year, Indonesia reportedly asked its buyers to accept delays to Indonesian LNG cargo exports this year, as the Southeast Asian country looks to meet rising domestic energy and gas demand. Indonesia has one major LNG project planned for later this decade. Japan’s oil and gas producer Inpex owns 65% of the Abadi gas project and plans a final investment decision (FID) for the $20-billion Abadi LNG project by 2027. Abadi LNG has seen years of delays as it has had to change design concepts and then reorganize after supermajor Shell withdrew from the project nearly two years ago. The Abadi LNG project in Indonesia has received interest from potential buyers to purchase gas from the facility in volumes exceeding the facility’s design capacity, according to Inpex.

Title: Elon Musk's wealth tanks by $102 billion in 2 months as Tesla stock hits the skids

Elon Musk's net worth has tumbled by $102 billion this year following a sharp decline in Tesla stock. That figure is about the same as the United Parcel Service's entire market value. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO's wealth has shrunk by about 24% in under 10 weeks to $330 billion at Thursday's close, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Musk is still comfortably the world's richest person, with a roughly $108 billion lead over second-place Jeff Bezos, despite being the biggest wealth loser this year. He's well ahead of Michael Dell, whose net worth is down $20 billion. Musk's fortune has been hit by a 35% plunge in Tesla's share price this year, from about $404 to $263. The sell-off has cut its market value by more than $400 billion to under $900 billion. Investors have dumped the automaker's stock for several reasons. Musk spent more than $250 million to help Donald Trump get reelected, stumped at the Republican candidate's rallies, and marshaled his X followers to vote for Trump in November's election. The tech billionaire has remained a close advisor since Trump's victory, spearheading efforts to streamline federal spending with his White House DOGE office. The combination of his divisive politics, concerns about his new role distracting from his CEO duties, and reports of Tesla sales declines in several countries have weighed on the company's shares. Several other members of the $100 billion club have taken a hit to their fortunes from the recent slump in stocks, which has been fueled by worries that Trump's tariffs and government cuts will cool economic growth or even cause a recession. Oracle's Larry Ellison has had $19 billion wiped off his wealth, reducing it to $173 billion. Similarly, Nvidia's Jensen Huang and Amazon's Bezos have each had about $17 billion erased from their respective net worths this year. Bezos is now tied with Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg on $222 billion; Zuckerberg has added $14 billion to his wealth in 2025, while the Amazon founder has shed almost $17 billion. Jump to

UPDATED 06:33 EST / MARCH 07 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 82 – Why Apple Could be the Key to Intel’s Future – The latest Arm Neoverse announcement further cements our opinion that its architecture, business model and ecosystem execution are defining a new era of computing; and leaving Intel in its dust. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explain why and how Apple could hold a key to saving Intel’s (and America’s) semiconductor industry leadership position. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 81 – A Digital Skills Gap Signals Rebound in IT Services Spend – Recent survey data from ETR shows that enterprise tech spending is tracking with projected U.S. GDP growth at 6% to 7% this year. Many markers continue to point the way to a strong recovery including hiring trends and the loosening of frozen IT project budgets. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR, who will share fresh data, perspectives and insights from the latest survey data.

Episode 79 – Moore’s Law is Accelerating and AI is Ready to Explode – Moore’s Law is dead right? Think again. While the historical annual CPU performance improvement of ~40% is slowing, the combination of CPUs packaged with alternative processors is improving at a rate of more than 100% per annum. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is going to unveil some data that suggests we’re entering a new era of innovation where inexpensive processing capabilities will power an explosion of machine intelligence applications. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 78 – Arm Lays Down the Gauntlet at Intel’s Feet – Exactly one week after Pat Gelsinger unveiled plans to reinvent Intel, Arm announced version 9 of its architecture and put forth its vision for the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / MARCH 07 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade.

It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well.

In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis.

In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings. The company beat consensus earnings on both top line and EPS last quarter. But Investors didn’t like Oracle’s tepid guidance and the stock pulled back..but is still well above its pre-Barron’s article price. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 74 – Breaking Analysis: NFTs, Crypto Madness & Enterprise Blockchain – When a piece of digital art sells for $69.3M, more than has ever been paid for works by Paul Gauguin or Salvador Dali, making its creator the third most expensive living artist in the world, one can’t help but take notice and ask: “What is going on?” The latest craze around NFTs may feel a bit “bubblicious,” but it’s yet another sign that the digital age is now fully upon us. In this Breaking Analysis Dave wants to take a look at some of the trends that may have observers and investors scratching their heads, but we think still offer insight to the future — and possibly some opportunities for young investors. And we’ll briefly touch on how these trends may relate to enterprise tech. Watch the full video analysis.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / MARCH 07 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries.

Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade.

Title: Trump Bitcoin Price ‘Game-Changer’ Spurs Huge $10 Trillion Prediction

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough , Senior Contributor. U.S. president Donald Trump has signed an executive order, calling for the establishment of a U.S bitcoin strategic reserve and stockpile of other cryptocurrencies, following through on a campaign promise that some think could push the bitcoin price sharply higher. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price dipped after it was revealed Trump had signed the order, falling as traders expressed their disappointment it doesn’t commit the U.S. to buying more bitcoin or crypto (and following a “foolish” crypto price warning from Elon Musk). Now, as the bitcoin and crypto market braces for a BlackRock earthquake, traders are scrambling to get ahead of other countries rushing to follow the U.S. into bitcoin—with one analyst predicting a $10 trillion bitcoin market capitalization by 2028. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. president Donald Trump has signed a flurry of executive orders, including one to establish a ... [+] bitcoin strategic reserve—predicted by some to trigger a bitcoin price boom. "Incredible execution from the Trump administration and a historic moment for bitcoin and crypto," Coinbase chief executive Brian Armstrong posted to X. "I expect many of the G20 to take notice, and eventually follow America’s leadership." The bitcoin reserve "will be capitalized with bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings," David Sacks, Trump's crypto czar, posted to X alongside a video showing Sacks calling the reserve a "digital Fort Knox" and promising it "won't cost taxpayers a dime." Some have speculated that China is weighing creating its own bitcoin reserve to rival the U.S. after Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund revealed last month it’s betting on bitcoin, kicking off a global adoption “race." “There have been rumours about China and South Korea exploring their own bitcoin strategic reserves,” Danny Scott, the chief executive at crypto platform CoinCorner, said in emailed comments. “It goes without saying now that all countries around the world will be paying attention and be looking at how they make their move," adding: "It's going to happen globally." Trump’s bitcoin reserve executive order follows the announcement over the weekend that the U.S. will create a diverse crypto stockpile, cheered by the market as a “game-changer.” “This week’s announcement—as imperfect as it is—marks the first time the U.S. has ever said that bitcoin is a strategic asset,” Bitwise’s chief investment officer Matt Hougan wrote in a blog post. “As long as that stays intact, it feels like a game-changer to me.” Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price shot higher following the election of Donald Trump, with the bitcoin price ...

Hougan said other countries would likely be watching the U.S. and considering following suit in creating bitcoin reserves. “If you are Honduras, Mexico, or Guatemala, and you’re watching El Salvador and now the U.S. acquire bitcoin, can you really afford to be at zero?” Hougan asked. “If you’re Dubai, Qatar, or Saudi Arabia, are you comfortable with Abu Dhabi and the U.S. taking the lead? What about Russia? China?” Excitement over a potential global race toward bitcoin adoption has added to expectations of increased crypto regulatory clarity in the U.S. under the Trump administration. "That should add to that medium term, top-side potential, which for me is bitcoin up to $200,000 this year, and $500,000 before Trump leaves office,” Standard Chartered Bank’s Geoffrey Kendrick told CNBC, which would give bitcoin a market capitalization of around $10 trillion.

Title: STEVE FORBES: Truth or consequences: what happens when businesses end DEI

Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Target is the latest in a string of retail giants who have taken a stance against the wildly unpopular diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs afflicting corporate America. Target’s move comes in the wake of similar action by other big-name companies, including Meta, Walmart, Amazon and Tractor Supply Co., which have all scaled back their DEI policies in recent months. The shift is a welcome sign that companies may finally be listening to their customers and shareholders, who have grown weary of paying the high price for businesses’ capitulation to the woke agenda. Walmart investors recently sent a letter to company leadership applauding them for rolling back their anti-business DEI policies and encouraging them to maintain their position despite far-left pushback. TARGET FACES 40-DAY BOYCOTT FOR ROLLING BACK DEI INITIATIVES Indeed, DEI policies and force-fed corporate moralism have been wildly unpopular with the American public since their inception. When Tractor Supply’s DEI policies came to light last year, they drew massive attention on social media and inspired customers to boycott the company, resulting in an 8% decrease in its stock price ($2.8 billion in market loss) over just five days. Continued exposure of corporate DEI programs caused other large companies like Ford, Google and Lowe’s to preemptively shut down their policies and avoid similar backlash and financial loss. Target said it is taking aim at DEI, one of several major companies to do so. (Google Maps) Additionally, large companies have faced consistent warnings of potential legal action from state attorneys general, private organizations and shareholders over what amounted to discriminatory DEI hiring practices in the wake of the Supreme Court’s 2023 Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and Fellows of Harvard College (SFFA) decision. And back in 2016, when Target first announced its bathroom policy allowing customers to use restrooms based on gender identity, it triggered a massive backlash and boycotts. They could not have been more out of touch with the American public. These efforts, as well as the larger campaign by angry DEI supporters to "blackout" Amazon, Walmart, Nestle and other large corporations, represent just how far the Democrat party has come from reflecting the views of the American people. Even their own pundits and politicians agree. Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg recently blasted the comical DNC Chair election and went as far as jabbing at DEI, which he described as often "making people sit through a training that looks like something out of ‘Portlandia.’" Virginia Democratic Senator Mark Warner also admitted that his party’s "over-the-top-wokeism" has hurt their political prospects. Longtime Democratic Party strategist James Carville lamented his party’s self-destruction over essentially meaningless, in his words "stunningly stupid," policies, including the Democratic National Committee’s woke gender rules implemented in February. The shift is a welcome sign that companies may finally be listening to their customers and shareholders, who have grown weary of paying the high price for businesses’ capitulation to the woke agenda. And former White House press secretary Jen Psaki recently decried the Democrats’ approach to dialogue with the public, noting how detached they are from everyday citizens and the issues that matter most to them. The truth is corporate moralism has damaged American consumers, and they know it. DEI, alongside environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives, have unnecessarily raised the prices of energy, food, transportation, and housing. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Americans want businesses to get back to focusing on their bottom line: delivering reliable, affordable, and high-quality products to customers. DEI policies are simply bad for the economy, bad for the consumer, and bad for the moral fabric of this country. Walmart is one of several major retailers that have backed off of its DEI efforts. FILE: Walmart in Beavercreek, Ohio (Google Maps) Government, social groups and companies should not evangelize consumers with the left’s woke agenda – such tactics are ineffective, unprofitable and off-putting. Amid the progressive left’s cries for social justice and a corporate facade of diversity, equity and inclusion, the true purpose of business in a free society has been lost. Businesses do not provide moral or political guidance, nor should they. They exist to facilitate an exchange of goods and services and to compete with other companies for a profit by making themselves more appealing, whether through better quality or lower cost. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Thankfully, American businesses are waking up to this reality, and the huge house of cards of corporate DEI may be on its way to a final, fatal fall. At the very least, we seem to be seeing an encouraging shift and a step in the right direction. Let’s hope the trend continues, and at long last, American companies can finally get back to business.

The stock market tariff tantrum of the past few weeks has seen the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 give up all their gains since the early November election victory of Donald Trump even as bitcoin (BTC) remains in positive territory. Both equity gauges are now more than 2% lower, while bitcoin is up over 20% in the same time frame. Market leader Nvidia (NVDA), whose chips are in demand for uses in AI, for instance, is lower by more than 20% since Trump's triumph. On the flip side, Meta Platforms (META) is the stand out stock in the so-called magnificent seven technology companies having gained about 10%. While bitcoin buyer Strategy (MSTR) is down over 50% from its all-time high in November, it remains up 20% since the election. Though bitcoin bulls are surely disappointed in the price performance of late — the world's largest cryptocurrency has slumped about 20% from $109,000 the day before Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20 — the current price of $88,000 is still up roughly 20% from its level just prior to the November election.

March 07, 2025 02:00 ET | Source: Alliance Witan PLC Alliance Witan PLC Alliance Witan PLC (‘the Company’)LEI: 213800SZZD4E2IOZ9W55 7 March 2025 A landmark year Annual results for the year ended 31 December 2024 Highlights Dean Buckley, Chair of Alliance Witan, commented: “The Company delivered strong outright gains for shareholders in 2024, although in common with most active global equity strategies, we underperformed our benchmark index, MSCI ACWI, where performance was concentrated in a handful of the largest US companies. Even so, the Company’s longer-term performance remains competitive, and demand for our shares was healthy last year, with the Company's discount narrowing, bucking the industry trend towards widening discounts. We also increased our dividend for the 58th consecutive year. “Thanks to the support of both sets of shareholders, we achieved a historic combination with Witan, which places the Company in a strong position to realise economies of scale and offer better liquidity for our shares. With solid performance and a refreshed brand, supported by a marketing campaign that will continue in 2025, the Board is confident that the Company is well placed to continue delivering attractive returns for shareholders”. About Alliance Witan PLC Alliance Witan aims to be a core investment that beats inflation over the long term through a combination of capital growth and rising dividend. The Company invests in global equities across a wide range of different sectors and industries to achieve its objective. Alliance Witan’s portfolio uses a distinctive multi-manager approach. We blend the top stock selections of some of the world’s best active managers into a single diversified portfolio designed to outperform the market while carefully managing risk. Alliance Witan is an AIC Dividend Hero with 58 consecutive years of rising dividends. https://www.alliancewitan.com For more information, please contact: 1. Alternative Performance Measure. Share Price Total Return is the return to shareholders through share price capital returns and dividends paid by the Company and re-invested.

Source: Morningstar and Juniper Partners Limited (‘Juniper’). Chair’s Statement 2024 was a landmark year for your Company. I would like to begin by thanking you for your support for the combination of Alliance Trust and Witan to form Alliance Witan and by welcoming all shareholders who have joined us as a result. This was a pivotal moment in our history, achieving economies of scale and elevating the Company to the FTSE 100. Now, as one of the industry’s leaders, this status will provide better liquidity for our shares and, with good long term investment performance and a strong brand, help us attract new investors. We made a number of commitments to investors as part of the proposals, for example in respect of dividends and costs, and you will see as you read through the Annual Report how we have achieved each of these. As I mentioned in the Interim Report for the six months ended 30 June 2024, there has been no change to the Company’s investment strategy, just a larger pool of assets for our Investment Manager, WTW, to manage with the same professionalism that it has brought to the job since April 2017. 1. https://www.theaic.co.uk/aic/news/press-releases/top-20-best-performing-investment-trusts-for-your-isa Investment Performance It was another good year for global equity markets, and your Company delivered strong absolute returns. NAV Total Return was 13.3% and, due to a narrowing of the discount, Share Price Total Return was 14.3%. However, we lagged our benchmark index, the MSCI All Country World Index (‘MSCI ACWI’ or ‘Index’), which returned 19.6%. We also marginally underperformed our peers in the AIC Global Sector, which is disappointing, but we were slightly ahead of the much wider, more representative Morningstar peer group of open and closed-ended global equity funds. Simply put, our relative performance in 2024 suffered from not having enough exposure to the small number of very large companies that dominated market returns, especially in the US. The narrowness of returns from global equity markets has been a common problem for all active managers in recent years, and we take comfort from the fact that, despite this persistent headwind, we are ahead of the Index and have significantly outperformed both peer groups over three years. You can read more about the contributors/detractors to the Company’s investment performance during 2024 in the Investment Manager’s Report on page 9 of the Annual Report. Dividend increased for the 58th consecutive year The Board declared a fourth interim dividend of 6.73p per share on 28 January 2025, resulting in a full year dividend of 26.70p, an increase of 6.0% on the prior year. This fulfils the promise we made at the time of the combination of Alliance Trust and Witan to increase dividends for the legacy shareholders of both companies. 2024’s increase marks the 58th consecutive annual increase, which is one of the longest track records in the investment trust industry. Dividends are well supported by revenue and reserves, and the Board is confident annual dividend increases can continue well into the future. Due to our steady approach, the Company has received a ‘Dividend Hero’ investment company award from the Association of Investment Companies (‘AIC’). Narrowing discount Many investment trusts continued to trade on large discounts to NAV throughout 2024, with the industry average widening to 14.7% from 12.7%.1 I am pleased to report that your Company fared better than most, with its average discount falling to 4.7% from 5.4% over the year. This compared favourably with the average discount for the AIC Global Sector of 7.9%. Your Board remains committed to the maintenance of a stable discount. We will continue to use share buybacks as appropriate and invest in promotional activity to widen our shareholder base, to support the management of the discount. During 2024, the Company bought back 4.7 million shares (1.2% of shares in issue2), versus 8.6 million repurchased in 2023. The shares bought back during the year were placed in Treasury. This level of buybacks was significantly below that of our peers, in a year in which industry-wide buybacks hit a record level of £7.5 billion3. The shares held in Treasury can be reissued by the Company at a premium to estimated NAV when there is market demand. Board changes Following the completion of the combination of Alliance Trust with Witan, we welcomed four new Non-Executive Directors to the Board: Andrew Ross, Rachel Beagles, Shauna Bevan and Jack Perry, all of whom were former directors of Witan. Clare Dobie, having served for almost nine years, is retiring as a Director at the conclusion of this year’s Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’), as is Jack Perry, reducing the size of the Board to eight members. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Clare and Jack for their contributions. Annual General Meeting The Board looks forward to being able to meet shareholders again at this year’s AGM, which will be held at the Apex City Quay Hotel in Dundee on 1 May 2025. For those shareholders who are not able to attend in person, we will be live streaming the event. As well as the formal business of the meeting, there will be an investor forum afterwards featuring two of our Stock Pickers, Jennison and EdgePoint, as well as members of WTW’s investment team. There will be another in-person investor forum in London in the autumn. In addition, shareholders can engage with the Company and its Stock Pickers via online presentations during the year. Further details of how to attend all these events can be found on the website. The Board would strongly encourage shareholders to use the opportunity to have their say and use their vote at the AGM. Further information on the arrangements for the AGM, including information on how to vote either directly through the Registrar or though different platforms, is on pages 134 and 135 of the Annual Report. Keep up-to-date In these unusual times, the website will provide timely updates to shareholders. Therefore, I would encourage you to visit the website which contains a vast amount of information on investment performance, details of shareholder meetings and investor forums, monthly factsheets, quarterly newsletters, and Stock Picker updates, as well as the Annual and Interim Reports. As always, the Board welcomes communication from shareholders and I can be contacted through Juniper Partners (‘Juniper’), the Company Secretary at investor@alliancewitan.com. Outlook Since the start of President Trump’s second term of office in January, tariffs have created uncertainty about the outlook for equities. Diplomatic tensions over efforts to end the war in Ukraine and conflict in Gaza have also raised geopolitical risks. Furthermore, European bond markets are adjusting to the prospect of increased borrowing to fund higher levels of defence and infrastructure spending. While there is a risk that heightened levels of uncertainty will impact on business and consumer confidence, global growth and corporate earnings forecasts are currently healthy, giving some grounds for cautious optimism, about further gains for shareholders, especially if there is a broadening out of market leadership. While the Index is highly concentrated, your portfolio has broader exposure to many good businesses that have not yet received the market recognition our Stock Pickers believe they deserve. The portfolio will not always outperform the market in every discrete period, but we believe it will continue to add significant value for shareholders in the long run. I look forward to meeting as many of you as possible at the AGM in Dundee or the next investor forum in London. 1. Weighted average discount (excluding 3i Group). Source: Winterflood. 2.

Dean BuckleyChair6 March 2025 Combination with Witan The most significant development during the year under review was the combination of the Company with Witan. Background Following a comprehensive review of management arrangements, the Witan Board concluded that a combination with the Company was in the best interests of Witan’s shareholders. Amongst other things this allowed them continued exposure to a successful multi-manager approach. The combination was undertaken by way of a scheme of reconstruction and members’ voluntary liquidation of Witan. The scheme required the approval of both the Company and Witan’s shareholders and took effect on 10 October 2024. It resulted in the Company acquiring approximately £1,539 million of net assets from Witan in consideration for the issue of new ordinary shares to Witan shareholders. The name of the Company became Alliance Witan and the stock exchange ticker ALW. Outcome The combination was expected to result in substantial benefits for all shareholders and future investors. The outcomes of the key elements of the proposals include: Portfolio Transition Investment Manager’s Report Market backdrop: equities untroubled by politics For the second year running, global equities delivered strong returns in 2024, with economics trumping politics. Despite a record number of elections, conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine reaching new heights, and a scary moment in Japan when the Nikkei Index of the top 225 blue-chip shares plunged 12% in a day at the beginning of August, investors focused on resilient global growth, falling inflation and interest rates, and healthy corporate profitability. Hence, our benchmark index, the MSCI ACWI, returned 19.6% in 2024 following a return of 15.3% in 2023. Since 1987, the Index has returned an average of 8.4% per annum1, so returns of this magnitude in two consecutive years are rare. The ebullient mood of equity investors was reflected in a surge in the prices of less established assets, such as cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin reaching all-time highs of over $100,000. Peanut the Squirrel Coin, a cryptocurrency named after the eponymous pet that New York environmental authorities seized and euthanised on 30 October 2024, at one point commanded a market cap of $1.7 billion. However, regional equity market performance was mixed. US markets once again led the way, with the S&P 500 delivering a 27% return when measured in British pounds. Chinese equities rallied briefly following government stimulus, but concerns over the country’s property market and trade tensions persisted. Together with a strong US dollar, these worries led to more subdued returns from emerging markets, which rose about 9%. In Japan, August’s technically driven decline proved temporary, and the Nikkei resumed its ascent to close the year at a record high, although the yen’s depreciation reduced returns for UK-based investors when converted into British pounds. The UK and European markets were more muted, with the FTSE All Share Index and the MSCI Europe ex UK Index returning 9.5% and 1.9% respectively. Gains driven by US tech giants Giant US technology related stocks were the standout performers, fuelled by investor excitement about generative artificial intelligence (‘AI’) and, from November onwards, hopes that Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential election would weaken regulatory scrutiny. The share prices of the so called “Magnificent Seven” – Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, NVIDIA and Tesla – increased by 60% on average and were responsible for 43% of MSCI ACWI’s gains. This was less than 2023 when they contributed 53%, but still a huge number emphasising the extreme concentration of index returns in a small number of companies. Even so, from mid-year onwards, returns were no longer quite as skewed to the performance of a handful of shares. Although NVIDIA and Tesla returned a massive 176% and 65% respectively, giant tech was not the only game in town. Financial stocks returned 26.5%, and returns from the consumer discretionary, industrial and utility sectors were also well into double figures, pointing to the potential broadening out of market returns as stock-specific drivers came to the fore. 1. https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/8d97d244-4685-4200-a24c-3e2942e3adeb Portfolio performance: strong absolute gains but lagged benchmark index Our portfolio’s NAV Total Return was a robust 13.3% but, as with most active managers, it lagged the Company’s benchmark index. The portfolio does, however, remain ahead of the Index over three years (28.0% vs 26.8%), albeit behind over five years (64.7% vs 70.8%). Disappointing though it was not to beat the MSCI ACWI in 2024, we were not alone. AJ Bell calculated that, to the end of November, just 18% of active global equity funds outperformed their passive peers, largely due to their inability to match high Index weightings in the “Magnificent Seven”. The sheer size of these companies in the Index is mind boggling. NVIDIA, Microsoft and Apple, for example, represent 13% of the MSCI ACWI as at 31 December 2024 and, together, are bigger than the entire stock markets of several sizeable countries. The skew of the Index towards mega-cap companies has been a challenge, to varying degrees, since the start of our multi-manager strategy in April 2017. As a broadly diversified strategy, with capital spread between 8-12 Managers, all with different approaches to investing, our portfolio naturally has a structural bias away from stocks that on rare occasions represent such a large proportion of our global benchmark. While we have some exposure to most of the “Magnificent Seven”, it would require a lot of the Managers to choose them as one of their best ideas for us to be at Index weight, never mind be overweight. The Index may have been hard to beat in recent years, but market concentration poses significant risks for passive strategies. At the end of 2024, the Index on average allocated around 150 times as much capital to each of Apple, NVIDIA and Microsoft as it did to the average stock, akin to us placing about 95% of the portfolio in one manager’s hands and 0.5% each in the other ten. We do not believe this is the right way to manage risk for shareholders, bearing in mind that index trackers are not investing lots of money in these companies because they are good businesses trading at good valuations, but because they are very big. If US large-cap stocks continue to dominate, tracker funds may continue to outperform active funds. But if sentiment on the technology sector turns sour, passive funds with big stakes will be hit much harder. Not owning enough NVIDIA was painful The strong outperformance of our portfolio versus our benchmark in 2023 continued into the first quarter of 2024, when the biggest contribution came from not owning, at that time, poorly performing Tesla and Apple. But thereafter stock selection became more challenging, particularly within the “Magnificent Seven”. Although we benefitted from owning Amazon and Microsoft, we moved from an overweight to an underweight position in NVIDIA in the first quarter after its extraordinary outperformance, which then made it our biggest single detractor last year as that outperformance continued. Having helped us in the first quarter, the lack of exposure to Tesla and Apple, which both recovered strongly as the year progressed, counted against us from then on. Overall, our positions in the “Magnificent Seven” accounted for a third of the portfolio’s underperformance versus the Index in 2024. The remainder of the portfolio’s underperformance came from a combination of being underweight in large-cap stocks in general and stock specific issues elsewhere, in some cases due to partial reversals of performance in 2023. For example, stock selection in financials detracted in large part due to our relative lack of exposure to strongly performing US banks such as JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs. In the consumer discretionary sector, the share price of UK-based drinks company Diageo, owned by Veritas Asset Management (‘Veritas’) and Metropolis Capital (‘Metropolis’), continued to suffer from a post-Covid cyclical downturn, falling 8.5%, although both Managers believe the company will eventually recover lost ground when structural trends reassert themselves. Novo Nordisk, the Danish weight loss drugs company, was another notable detractor, as its shares fell 14% after disappointing test results. Our Stock Pickers see this as a temporary decline in a growing market in which Novo Nordisk has a leading position. Hence, it was one of our biggest purchases in 2024 (see table below). Indeed, our Stock Pickers express a high degree of confidence in the latent value of many of their holdings. By far the most important long run ingredient underpinning share price performance is strong fundamentals, such as market-leading products or services, solid profit margins, plentiful cashflow and strong management. Top 10 purchases and sales Source: Juniper. The purchases and sales are calculated by taking the net value of all transactions (buy and sells) for each holding held within the portfolio over the period. The tables exclude any non-equity holdings such as ETFs and any transfers from the combination with Witan. Even so, in the short run, market sentiment can have a larger impact on share prices than fundamentals. When we break down the portfolio performance against the Index into fundamentals and sentiment, the portfolio’s strong absolute performance has been mainly as a result of company fundamentals, whereas the Index’s absolute performance has been more driven by market sentiment. A full breakdown of the contributors to our Total Return in 2024 is shown in the following table. Contribution analysis Source: Performance and attribution data sourced from WTW, Juniper, MSCI Inc, FactSet and Morningstar as at 31 December 2024. Percentages may not add due to rounding. In the table below, we also list the top five contributors and detractors to portfolio performance during the year relative to the portfolio’s benchmark. Sands, Vulcan and Lyrical were the top performers As we would expect from such a diverse line up, performance among our Managers was mixed. This is by design, as we do not want the portfolio to be biased towards any one approach of investing, which might make returns vulnerable to a sudden switch from one style to another. This happened in 2022 when growth stocks began to suffer significantly as central banks raised interest rates to combat inflation. Sands Capital (‘Sands’), Vulcan Value Partners (‘Vulcan’), and Lyrical Asset Management (‘Lyrical’) were the top performers last year. Sands and Vulcan both benefitted from owning tech giants. Sands held NVIDIA while Vulcan held Amazon, but Sands’ largest contributor to relative performance was Axon Enterprise, an industrial business which makes tasers, body cameras and other software products. Its share price surged by 134% last year. Top five stock contributors to performance Bottom five stock detractors to performance Source: WTW. The tables above illustrate the top five contributors and detractors to returns relative to benchmark in 2024. It aims to explain at a stock level which companies drove relative returns. For example, the Alliance Witan portfolio was underweight relative to benchmark in NVIDIA, Broadcom, Tesla and Apple. These stocks had very strong returns, which hurt our portfolio’s relative performance. Conversely, not having an exposure to Nestle helped our relative performance given the stock was held in the benchmark and was down over the year. Our overweight position in Amazon, Axon Enterprise, Salesforce and NRG Energy contributed positively to relative returns given their strong performance. The average active weight is the arithmetic simple average weight of the stock in the portfolio minus the arithmetic simple average weight of the stock in the benchmark over the period. Vulcan’s largest contributor to our performance was KKR, the US-based private equity group, which returned 82%, prompting Vulcan to take profits. Its holding in Salesforce also did well, rising nearly 30%. Lyrical, a deep-value style investor, benefitted from owning several less talked-about US-based companies, which all rebounded from cheap valuations. These included NRG Energy, Ameriprise Financials and eBay. Of our Managers, the most notable laggard was Sustainable Growth Advisors (‘SGA’), which was disappointing given its focus on large cap growth stocks which, as a group, had the strongest price momentum. SGA suffered from holding Novo Nordisk, and two of its other positions, ICON and Synopsys also stood out as detractors. The recent poor performance of SGA follows a long period of outperformance, so returns since we appointed SGA remain strong. Value Managers Metropolis and ARGA Investment Management (‘ARGA’), the latter replacing Jupiter Asset Management (‘Jupiter’) in April, also struggled in the recent market environment, which has generally favoured growth managers. Portfolio changes: two new Managers added after combination with Witan As well as adding ARGA for Jupiter in the first half of the year, following Ben Whitmore’s decision to leave Jupiter to set up his own business, there were two further changes to the Manager line-up during the integration of Witan’s portfolio. Altogether, this contributed to an unusually high level of turnover of 98.5% of the portfolio in 2024. Both Alliance Trust and Witan already had GQG Partners (‘GQG’) and Veritas in common, which meant that there were some in-specie transfers of stocks. Additionally, the combination of Alliance and Witan presented us with an opportunity to introduce Jennison Associates (‘Jennison’) to the portfolio at a low cost. Based in the US, Jennison specialises in investing in innovative, fast-growing businesses. It had been one of Witan’s most successful managers and blending it with our other Managers increased the diversity of holdings in growth companies. We also took the opportunity to replace Black Creek Investment Management (‘Black Creek’) with EdgePoint Investment Group (‘EdgePoint’), while we were using a transition manager to keep costs down to a minimum. This change was prompted by succession planning at Black Creek. We had been monitoring Black Creek for some time due to the departure of a senior team member for health reasons and the uncertainty surrounding the timing of founder Bill Kanko’s retirement. With a similar investment style to Black Creek, EdgePoint seeks to buy good, undervalued businesses and hold them until the market fully realises their potential. Through the combination, we inherited a small number of investment trust and private equity fund holdings, representing less than 3% of the combined portfolio. These are specialist funds with portfolios focused on, among other things, early-stage life sciences, valuable intellectual property, innovative internet platforms and renewable infrastructure assets. Collective investments such as these are not normally part of our investment strategy. However, they are all trading at prices we believe are well below their intrinsic value, so rather than sell them at a loss, we will hold them until we can achieve attractive values. Beyond that, the combination did not lead to any change in our investment approach. We retain high conviction in our line-up of Managers and their ability to pick winning stocks, although we keep them under constant review for any red flags and have access to a deep bench of talented replacements should these be needed. Gearing: remaining cautious Our gross gearing stood at 8.4% at the end of 2024 (4.9% net of underlying Manager and central cash), slightly above the level of 7.1% at the start of the year, reflecting the improving outlook for equities as the year progressed. However, given the strong performance from equity markets, it is still towards the lower end of the typical range of 7.5 to 12.5%. Market outlook: multiple risks warrant diversification As 2025 began, the mood among investors was upbeat, with many hoping President Trump’s promises of deregulation and tax cuts would be supportive of equity markets. If returns can spread beyond a narrow group of highly valued US mega-cap technology stocks, it could provide firmer foundations for another good year for shares. The strong start to the year for European equities certainly offered hope for geographical diversification. However, on-off tariffs and geopolitical tensions loom large, creating considerable uncertainty. This was reflected in an increase in equity market volatility in February. In the first 2 months of 2025, the benchmark index rose by 2.2% suggesting that investors were still willing to look through some of the risks while forecast global growth and corporate earnings remain healthy. But confidence is fragile and, with valuations in the US still close to a record high despite February’s pullback, the market is vulnerable to setbacks. In this environment, we believe bottom-up stock picking, based on company fundamentals, should be a more reliable way to add value for shareholders in the long term than making bold, top-down market calls. So, we will continue to position the portfolio to maintain balanced regional, sector and style exposures, that are similar to the Index weightings by periodically adjusting Manager allocations. This should provide stability and reduce risk, while we rely on our Managers to add value by seeking out the best companies in each market segment. While retaining some exposure to US mega-cap tech stocks that may continue delivering attractive returns, our portfolio is not reliant on them. It also contains many stocks that have remained in the shadows but have been performing well operationally and have excellent prospects not yet reflected in their share prices. Hidden gems: stock picks with high potential We asked our eleven Stock Pickers for examples of strong but underappreciated companies in the portfolio Lyrical highlighted five of its US holdings that have underperformed the S&P 500 Index since the start of 2024 but, at the same time, have grown their forecast earnings per share by more than the Index. These are healthcare providers Cigna and HCA, WEX and Global Payments, which both provide business-to-business payment technology, and Gen Digital, which is a leading provider of cyber security and identity protection. “Interestingly, even on this list there is inconsistency by the market,” says Lyrical. “Cigna has the worst stock performance, but the second-best earnings per share (‘EPS’) growth. Gen Digital has the slowest EPS growth in the group, but the best performance”. ARGA cited Accor, the global hotel business, which has transitioned to an “asset light” business model by selling most of its hotels, while maintaining the lucrative franchise and management agreements attached to these properties. While Sands Capital sees potential in the share prices of Sika, a maintenance and building refurbishment specialist. “Investment results have been weak despite solid fundamental results,” says Sands. “We believe that investors have focused on slower than historical organic growth, caused by several factors, including the real estate crisis in China, slowdown in electric vehicle production, and a pause in green building incentives.” Sands Capital also mentioned Roper Technologies, a diversified industrial technology company, and Keyence, a leading designer of high-end factory automation based in Japan, as attractive businesses with share price appreciation potential. Vulcan highlighted CoStar Group, an information provider to the commercial and residential real estate industries, and Everest Group, a global insurance and reinsurance business, while GQG mentioned the UK-based pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, the Brazil-based oil and gas company Petrobras, Bank Mandiri in Indonesia, and the Indian tobacco company ITC. SGA backed Danaher, the US industrial group, Intuit, which provides do-it-yourself accounting software for small businesses, and HDFC Bank in India. Jennison highlighted Reddit, the online social media platform. “Reddit is targeting 49% growth in the third quarter of 2024 and consensus is at 41% in Q4, but then market estimates are fading down to around 20% in 2025, which we think is overly conservative and creates an opportunity for investment today.” Veritas’s nominations for underappreciated businesses were Amadeus, the Spanish software company focusing on air travel, The Cooper Companies, which makes contact lenses, and Thermo Fisher Scientific, the world’s largest scientific equipment provider. Japan specialist Dalton’s best stocks included Bandai Namco, a multinational that publishes video games and makes toys, Shimano, the bicycle equipment manufacturer, and Rinnai, one of the global leaders in water heaters. Metropolis highlighted Andritz, the Austrian headquartered business supplying industrial equipment to the pulp and paper, metals and hydropower industries, Crown Holdings, which makes aluminium drinks cans, and Admiral, the UK insurer. Finally, EdgePoint, the newest addition to our Manager line-up, pointed to Dayforce, a global human resources software company, Nippon Paints Holdings in Japan, Franco-Nevada, a gold-focused royalty company in Canada, and Qualcomm, which invented significant pieces of the underlying technology required for mobile phones. “The market looks at Qualcomm as a handset supplier and the stock moves in relation to expected handset sales over the following quarters,” says EdgePoint. “We consider Qualcomm to be one of the world’s leading designers of energy-efficient processors at a point in time when demand for energy-efficient processing is growing rapidly across a wide range of industries. Some of the major opportunities for Qualcomm over the next 5 years include artificial intelligence, automobiles, personal computers and smartphones.” Altogether, these fundamentally strong businesses combine with others to create a robust, multi-manager portfolio that offers attractive long-term growth with lower risk than a single manager strategy, and therefore a more comfortable ride through the ups and downs of the market. Such companies may have remained below the radar in 2024, when investors became giddy with the stellar returns from the US technology shares, but we look forward to their attributes receiving the recognition from the market that they deserve.

Dividend We have paid our shareholders a rising dividend for 58 consecutive years. Providing that level of reliability is something of which we are extremely proud. We carefully manage the Company’s dividend. For instance, should there be a year in which income is unexpectedly high, we may retain some of that income to help fund future dividends. Due to our steady approach, the Company has received a ‘Dividend Hero’ investment company award from the Association of Investment Companies (‘AIC’). Our dividend policy Subject to market conditions and the Company’s performance, financial position and outlook, the Board will seek to pay a dividend that increases year on year. The Company expects to pay four interim dividends per year, on or around the last day of June, September, December and March, and will not, generally, pay a final dividend for a particular financial year. While shareholders are not asked to approve a final dividend, given the timing of the payment of the quarterly payments, each year they are given the opportunity to share their views when they are asked to approve the Company’s Dividend Policy. Fourth interim dividend As previously announced, a fourth interim dividend of 6.73p per ordinary share will be paid on 31 March 2025 to those shareholders who were on the register at close of business on 28 February 2025. Increased dividend The Company has increased its total dividend for the year ended 31 December 2024 to 26.7p per ordinary share (2023: 25.2p), a 6.0% increase on the previous year. Reserves It is the Board’s intention to utilise distributable reserves as well as portfolio income to fund dividend payments. Further details of the dividend payments for the year to 31 December 2024 and information on distributable reserves can be found in notes 7 and 2(b)(x) of the Financial Statements, respectively. Ongoing Charges and Discount Ongoing charges1 The Company’s ongoing charges ratio (‘OCR’) decreased to 0.56% (including the impact of the investment management fee waiver) (2023: 0.62%). Total administrative expenses were £3.9m (2023: £2.9m) and investment management expenses were £18.4m (2023: £16.3m). Further details of the Company’s expenses are provided in note 4 of the Financial Statements on page 90 of the Annual Report. The Company’s costs remain competitive for an actively managed multi-manager global equity strategy. Maintaining a stable discount1 One of the Company’s strategic objectives is to maintain a stable share price discount to NAV. The Company has the authority to buy back its own shares in the market if the discount is widening and to hold these shares in Treasury. During the year under review, the Company’s share price traded at an average discount of 4.7% (2023: 6.0%). As at 31 December 2024, the Company’s share price discount was 4.7% (2023: 5.4%). The average discount (unweighted) for the AIC Global Sector was 7.9%. Share issuance and buybacks As a result of the combination with Witan, 120,949,382 new ordinary shares were issued for assets valued at £1.5bn implying an effective issue price of £12.7459246 per share. The Company bought back 1.2%* (2023: 3.0%) of its issued share capital during the year, purchasing 4,722,000 shares which were placed in Treasury. The total cost of the share buybacks was £57.0m (2023: £86.6m). The weighted average discount of shares bought back in the year was 5.7%. Share buybacks contributed a total of 0.1% to the Company’s NAV performance in the year. 1.

What We Do How WTW manages the portfolio WTW as Investment Manager has overall responsibility for managing the Company’s portfolio. It is the Investment Manager’s job to select a diverse team of expert Stock Pickers, each of whom invest in a customised selection of 10-20 of their ‘best ideas’. WTW then allocates capital to them, relative to the risks the Stock Picker represents. For example, small-cap stocks are typically more risky than large-cap stocks, so on average a small-cap specialist would tend to receive less capital than a Stock Picker who focuses on large-cap stocks. However, the allocations do not remain static; WTW keeps them under constant review and varies them over time according to market conditions, with the goal of keeping our exposures to different parts of global stocks markets well balanced. Stock Pickers are encouraged to ignore the benchmark and only buy a small number of stocks in which they have strong conviction, while WTW manages risk through the Stock Picker allocations. On their own, each of the Stock Picker’s high-conviction mandates has the potential to perform well. This is supported by WTW’s experience of managing high-conviction portfolios and academic evidence1. But concentrated selections of stocks can be volatile and risky, so WTW mitigates these dangers by blending Stock Pickers with complementary investment approaches or styles, which can be expected to perform differently in different market conditions. This smooths out the peaks and troughs of performance associated with concentrated single-manager strategies. Several of the Stock Pickers in the current portfolio have been with the Investment Manager since inception of the multi-manager strategy, though it does actively monitor and rearrange the line-up where necessary. WTW invests a lot of time and effort on identifying skilled Stock Pickers for the Company’s portfolio, undertaking extensive qualitative and quantitative analysis. This due diligence process focuses on: 1. Sebastian & Attaluri, Conviction in Equity Investing, The Journal of Portfolio Management, Summer 2014. The Investment Manager’s views are formed over extended periods from multiple interactions with the Managers, including regular meetings. They look beyond past performance numbers to try to understand the ‘competitive edge’. This involves examining and interrogating processes for selecting stocks, adherence to this process through different market conditions, team dynamics, training and experience. Performance track records are just a single data point, and, without the context of the additional information, they are unlikely to persuade WTW that a Stock Picker is skilled. Once selected, the Investment Manager tends to form long-term partnerships with the Stock Pickers, generally only taking them out of the portfolio if something fundamental changes, such as the departure of a key individual from the business or a change in business strategy or fortunes. With highly active, concentrated portfolios, periods of short-term underperformance are to be expected and are not a reason to doubt a Stock Picker if they are adhering to their philosophy and process. WTW does, however, keep a constant eye out for talent and may bring new Managers into the portfolio at the expense of an incumbent if they are a better fit. Responsible investment WTW believes that Environmental, Social and Governance (‘ESG’) factors have the potential to impact financial risk and return. As long-term investors, WTW aims to incorporate these factors into its investment process. As stewards of the Company’s assets, WTW seeks to integrate responsible investment into its process for managing the portfolio. ESG factors can influence returns, so these risk factors are taken into account in WTW’s investment processes, including assessing how Managers evaluate ESG risk in their decisions over what stocks to purchase. Climate change poses potential significant risks to investment returns from many companies, which is why both WTW and the Company have stated an intention to manage the assets with a goal of achieving Net Zero greenhouse gas emissions from the portfolio by 2050, with an interim intention of reducing portfolio emissions by approximately 50% by 2030, relative to 2019. In 2024, we saw an increase in the portfolio’s weighted average carbon intensity (which measures carbon emissions as a proportion of revenue) from 71.9tCO2e/$M sales to 117. 9tCO2e/$M sales. Over the year, some higher-emitting stocks came into the portfolio including, industrial company Alaska Air and materials company Alcoa Ord, and our allocation to the higher-emitting Utilities sector went up slightly with purchases of companies such as Southern Ord and American Electric Power. We are monitoring our progress against our Net Zero goal, and our Managers and EOS at Federated Hermes (‘EOS’) continue to engage with the companies in the portfolio on climate related issues. Progress towards Net Zero will not be linear. Emissions from the portfolio are dependent on holdings, which can change from year to year as WTW’s Stock Pickers seek value for investors. If companies are perceived as being at higher financial risk by being slow to adapt to a Net Zero world, we expect to use stewardship, such as voting and engagement, to encourage positive changes to business practices. WTW believes this is preferable to excluding companies from the portfolio, since exclusion merely passes the responsibility of ownership to other investors who may be less scrupulous about adherence to ESG standards or regulation. As well as engaging with companies on climate change, WTW’s Stock Pickers, together with stewardship provider EOS, focused on a wide range of other issues last year. Overall, EOS engaged with 97 companies in the portfolio on 515 issues and objectives throughout the year. Key areas of engagement included board effectiveness, climate change, human and labour rights and human capital, biodiversity, digital rights and AI. Of these engagements, the environmental category accounted for 29% of the total number of engagements, with 63% of environmental engagements relating to climate change. Meanwhile the Stock Pickers cast votes at 3,346 resolutions in 2024. Of these resolutions, they voted against company management on 386 and abstained from voting on 38 occasions. How We Manage Our Risks In order to monitor and manage risks facing the Company, the Board maintains and regularly reviews a risk register and heat map. The risk register details all principal and emerging risks thought to face the Company at any given time. The principal risks facing the Company, as determined by the Board, are Investment, Operational and Legal and Regulatory Non-Compliance. As part of its review process, the Board considers input on the principal and emerging risks facing the Company from its key service providers WTW and Juniper. Any risks and their associated risk ratings are then discussed, and the risk register and heat map updated accordingly, with additional measures put in place to monitor, manage and mitigate risks as required. During the period the Board carefully reviewed the risks associated with the implementation of the combination and the post transaction integration risks. Principal risks The principal risks facing the Company, how they have changed during the year and how the Board aims to monitor and manage these risks are detailed below. Emerging risks Emerging risks are typified by having a high degree of uncertainty and may result from sudden events, new potential trends or changing specific risks where the impact and probable effect is hard to assess. As the assessment becomes clearer, the risk may be added to the risk matrix of ‘known’ risks. The Board is currently monitoring a number of emerging risks: geopolitical tension continues to be an emerging risk for the Company due to ongoing conflicts across the world. Along with increased populism and nationalism, these risks may impact individual economies and global markets. Although covered in the operational risk section above, the Board recognises the increased risk that cybercrime and the misuse of AI poses to the Company. Geopolitical events such as the conflicts in the Middle East region, coupled with the potential breakdown of post war alliances and potential new trade tariffs and changes to US economic and international policies introduced by President Trump, could bring uncertainty and fragility to capital markets in 2025, including persistent or reacceleration of inflationary pressures. Stakeholder Engagement – Section 172 Statement The Directors have a number of obligations including those under section 172 of the Companies Act 2006. These obligations relate to how the Board takes account of various factors in making its decisions – including the impact of its decisions on key stakeholders. The Board is focused on the Company’s performance and its responsibilities to stakeholders, corporate culture and diversity, as well as its contributions to wider society, and it takes account of stakeholder interests when making decisions on behalf of the Company. As an externally-managed investment trust, the Board considers the Company’s key stakeholders to be existing and potential new shareholders and its service providers. Full details on the primary ways in which the Board engaged with the Company’s key stakeholders can be found on pages 30 to 35 of the Annual Report. Dean BuckleyChair6 March 2025 Viability and Going Concern Statements Viability Statement The Board has assessed the prospects and viability of the Company beyond the 12 months required by the Going Concern accounting provisions. The Board considered the current position of the Company and its prospects, strategy and planning process as well as its principal and emerging risks in the current, medium and long term, as set out on pages 27 to 29 of the Annual Report. After the year-end but prior to approval of these Accounts, the Board reviewed its performance against its strategic objectives and its management of the principal and emerging risks facing the Company. The Board received regular updates on performance and other factors that could impact on the viability of the Company. The Board has concluded that there is a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due for at least the next five years; the Board expects this position to continue over many more years to come. The Company’s Investment Objective, which was approved by shareholders in April 2019, is to deliver a real return over the long term, through a combination of capital growth and a rising dividend, and the Board regards the Company’s shares as a long-term investment. The Board believes that a period of five years is considered a reasonable period for investment in equities and is appropriate for the composition of the Company’s portfolio. In arriving at this conclusion, the Board considered: Going Concern Statement In view of the conclusions drawn in the foregoing Viability Statements, which considered the resources of the Company over the next 12 months and beyond, the Directors believe that the Company has adequate financial resources to continue in existence for at least the period to 31 March 2026. Therefore, the Directors believe that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the Going Concern basis in preparing the financial statements. Directors’ Responsibilities The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Financial Statements in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and applicable law and regulations. Company law requires the Directors to prepare Financial Statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required to prepare the Financial Statements in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards. Under company law the Directors must not approve the Financial Statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss for that period. In preparing these Financial Statements, the Directors are required to: The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions, and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the Financial Statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. The Directors are responsible for ensuring that the Annual Report and Financial Statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s position, performance, business model and strategy. Website publication The Directors are responsible for ensuring the Annual Report and the Financial Statements are made available on a website. Financial Statements are published on the Company’s website in accordance with legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of Financial Statements, which may vary from legislation in other jurisdictions. The maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website is the responsibility of the Directors. The Directors’ responsibility also extends to the ongoing integrity of the Financial Statements contained therein. Report of Directors and Responsibility Statement The Report of the Directors on pages 36 to 69 of the Annual Report (other than pages 61 to 63 which form part of the Strategic Report) of the Annual Report and Accounts has been approved by the Board. The Directors have chosen to include information relating to future development of the Company and relationships with suppliers, customers and others, and their impact on the Board’s decisions on pages 30 to 35 of the Annual Report. Each of the Directors, who are listed on pages 37 to 40 of the Annual Report, confirm to the best of their knowledge that: On behalf of the Board All revenue and capital items in the above statement derive from continuing operations. The ‘Total’ column of this statement is the profit and loss account of the Company and the ‘Revenue’ and ‘Capital’ columns represent supplementary information prepared under guidance issued by the Association of Investment Companies. The Company does not have any other comprehensive income and hence profit for the year, as disclosed above, is the same as the Company’s total comprehensive income. The £553.6m (2023: £574.6m) of unrealised capital reserve arising on the revaluation of investments is subject to fair value movements and may not be readily realisable at short notice, as such it may not be entirely distributable. The unrealised capital reserve includes unrealised gains on borrowings of £22.8m (2023: £5.5m) and gains on unquoted investments of £3.5m (2023: £nil) which are not distributable. The Financial Statements were approved by the Board of Directors and authorised for issue on 6 March 2025. They were signed on its behalf by: Jo DixonChair of the Audit and Risk Committee The financial information set out above does not constitute the Company's statutory Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2024 or 2023, but is derived from those Financial Statements. Statutory accounts for 2023 have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies and those for 2024 will be delivered following the Company's Annual General Meeting. The auditors have reported on those accounts; their reports were unqualified, did not draw attention to any matters by way of emphasis without qualifying their report and did not contain statements under s498(2) or (3) Companies Act 2006. The same accounting policies, presentations and methods of computation are followed in these Financial Statements as were applied in the Company’s last annual audited Financial Statements, other than those stated in the Annual Report. Basis of accounting The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards (‘IASs’). The Financial Statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except that investments and fixed rate notes are stated at fair value through the profit and loss. The Association of Investment Companies (‘AIC’) issued a Statement of Recommended Practice: Financial Statements of Investment Companies (‘AIC SORP’) in July 2022. The Directors have sought to prepare the Financial Statements in accordance with the AIC SORP where the recommendations are consistent with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’). The Company qualifies as an investment entity. The Company has no securities in issue that could dilute the return per ordinary share. Therefore the basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share are the same. There are amounts of £1,222 (2023: £1,222) and £34,225 (2023: £34,225) owed to AT2006 and The Second Alliance Trust Limited, respectively, at year-end. There are no other related parties other than those noted below. Transactions with key management personnel Details of the Non-Executive Directors are disclosed on pages 37 to 40 of the Annual Report. For the purpose of IAS 24 ‘Related Party Disclosures’, key management personnel comprised the Non-Executive Directors of the Company. Details of remuneration are disclosed in the Remuneration Report on pages 55 to 60 of the Annual Report. ANNUAL REPORT The Annual Report will be available in due course on the Company's website www.alliancewitan.com. It will also be made available to the public at the Company's registered office, River Court, 5 West Victoria Dock Road, Dundee DD1 3JT and at the offices of the Company's Registrar, Computershare Investor Services PLC, Edinburgh House, 4 North St Andrew Street, Edinburgh EH2 1HJ after publication.

Even so, the Company’s longer-term performance remains competitive, and demand for our shares was healthy last year, with the Company's discount narrowing, bucking the industry trend towards widening discounts. We also increased our dividend for the 58th consecutive year. “Thanks to the support of both sets of shareholders, we achieved a historic combination with Witan, which places the Company in a strong position to realise economies of scale and offer better liquidity for our shares. With solid performance and a refreshed brand, supported by a marketing campaign that will continue in 2025, the Board is confident that the Company is well placed to continue delivering attractive returns for shareholders”. About Alliance Witan PLC Alliance Witan aims to be a core investment that beats inflation over the long term through a combination of capital growth and rising dividend. The Company invests in global equities across a wide range of different sectors and industries to achieve its objective. Alliance Witan’s portfolio uses a distinctive multi-manager approach. We blend the top stock selections of some of the world’s best active managers into a single diversified portfolio designed to outperform the market while carefully managing risk. Alliance Witan is an AIC Dividend Hero with 58 consecutive years of rising dividends. https://www.alliancewitan.com For more information, please contact: 1. Alternative Performance Measure. Share Price Total Return is the return to shareholders through share price capital returns and dividends paid by the Company and re-invested. Net Asset Value (NAV) Total Return is a measure of the performance of the Company’s NAV over a specified time period. It combines any change in the NAV and dividends paid.

Source: Morningstar and Juniper Partners Limited (‘Juniper’). Chair’s Statement 2024 was a landmark year for your Company. I would like to begin by thanking you for your support for the combination of Alliance Trust and Witan to form Alliance Witan and by welcoming all shareholders who have joined us as a result. This was a pivotal moment in our history, achieving economies of scale and elevating the Company to the FTSE 100. Now, as one of the industry’s leaders, this status will provide better liquidity for our shares and, with good long term investment performance and a strong brand, help us attract new investors. We made a number of commitments to investors as part of the proposals, for example in respect of dividends and costs, and you will see as you read through the Annual Report how we have achieved each of these. As I mentioned in the Interim Report for the six months ended 30 June 2024, there has been no change to the Company’s investment strategy, just a larger pool of assets for our Investment Manager, WTW, to manage with the same professionalism that it has brought to the job since April 2017. 1. https://www.theaic.co.uk/aic/news/press-releases/top-20-best-performing-investment-trusts-for-your-isa Investment Performance It was another good year for global equity markets, and your Company delivered strong absolute returns. NAV Total Return was 13.3% and, due to a narrowing of the discount, Share Price Total Return was 14.3%. However, we lagged our benchmark index, the MSCI All Country World Index (‘MSCI ACWI’ or ‘Index’), which returned 19.6%. We also marginally underperformed our peers in the AIC Global Sector, which is disappointing, but we were slightly ahead of the much wider, more representative Morningstar peer group of open and closed-ended global equity funds. Simply put, our relative performance in 2024 suffered from not having enough exposure to the small number of very large companies that dominated market returns, especially in the US. The narrowness of returns from global equity markets has been a common problem for all active managers in recent years, and we take comfort from the fact that, despite this persistent headwind, we are ahead of the Index and have significantly outperformed both peer groups over three years. You can read more about the contributors/detractors to the Company’s investment performance during 2024 in the Investment Manager’s Report on page 9 of the Annual Report. Dividend increased for the 58th consecutive year The Board declared a fourth interim dividend of 6.73p per share on 28 January 2025, resulting in a full year dividend of 26.70p, an increase of 6.0% on the prior year. This fulfils the promise we made at the time of the combination of Alliance Trust and Witan to increase dividends for the legacy shareholders of both companies. 2024’s increase marks the 58th consecutive annual increase, which is one of the longest track records in the investment trust industry. Dividends are well supported by revenue and reserves, and the Board is confident annual dividend increases can continue well into the future. Due to our steady approach, the Company has received a ‘Dividend Hero’ investment company award from the Association of Investment Companies (‘AIC’). Narrowing discount Many investment trusts continued to trade on large discounts to NAV throughout 2024, with the industry average widening to 14.7% from 12.7%.1 I am pleased to report that your Company fared better than most, with its average discount falling to 4.7% from 5.4% over the year. This compared favourably with the average discount for the AIC Global Sector of 7.9%. Your Board remains committed to the maintenance of a stable discount. We will continue to use share buybacks as appropriate and invest in promotional activity to widen our shareholder base, to support the management of the discount. During 2024, the Company bought back 4.7 million shares (1.2% of shares in issue2), versus 8.6 million repurchased in 2023. The shares bought back during the year were placed in Treasury. This level of buybacks was significantly below that of our peers, in a year in which industry-wide buybacks hit a record level of £7.5 billion3. The shares held in Treasury can be reissued by the Company at a premium to estimated NAV when there is market demand. Board changes Following the completion of the combination of Alliance Trust with Witan, we welcomed four new Non-Executive Directors to the Board: Andrew Ross, Rachel Beagles, Shauna Bevan and Jack Perry, all of whom were former directors of Witan. Clare Dobie, having served for almost nine years, is retiring as a Director at the conclusion of this year’s Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’), as is Jack Perry, reducing the size of the Board to eight members. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Clare and Jack for their contributions. Annual General Meeting The Board looks forward to being able to meet shareholders again at this year’s AGM, which will be held at the Apex City Quay Hotel in Dundee on 1 May 2025. For those shareholders who are not able to attend in person, we will be live streaming the event. As well as the formal business of the meeting, there will be an investor forum afterwards featuring two of our Stock Pickers, Jennison and EdgePoint, as well as members of WTW’s investment team. There will be another in-person investor forum in London in the autumn. In addition, shareholders can engage with the Company and its Stock Pickers via online presentations during the year. Further details of how to attend all these events can be found on the website. The Board would strongly encourage shareholders to use the opportunity to have their say and use their vote at the AGM. Further information on the arrangements for the AGM, including information on how to vote either directly through the Registrar or though different platforms, is on pages 134 and 135 of the Annual Report. Keep up-to-date In these unusual times, the website will provide timely updates to shareholders. Therefore, I would encourage you to visit the website which contains a vast amount of information on investment performance, details of shareholder meetings and investor forums, monthly factsheets, quarterly newsletters, and Stock Picker updates, as well as the Annual and Interim Reports. As always, the Board welcomes communication from shareholders and I can be contacted through Juniper Partners (‘Juniper’), the Company Secretary at investor@alliancewitan.com. Outlook Since the start of President Trump’s second term of office in January, tariffs have created uncertainty about the outlook for equities. Diplomatic tensions over efforts to end the war in Ukraine and conflict in Gaza have also raised geopolitical risks. Furthermore, European bond markets are adjusting to the prospect of increased borrowing to fund higher levels of defence and infrastructure spending. While there is a risk that heightened levels of uncertainty will impact on business and consumer confidence, global growth and corporate earnings forecasts are currently healthy, giving some grounds for cautious optimism, about further gains for shareholders, especially if there is a broadening out of market leadership. While the Index is highly concentrated, your portfolio has broader exposure to many good businesses that have not yet received the market recognition our Stock Pickers believe they deserve. The portfolio will not always outperform the market in every discrete period, but we believe it will continue to add significant value for shareholders in the long run. I look forward to meeting as many of you as possible at the AGM in Dundee or the next investor forum in London. 1. Weighted average discount (excluding 3i Group). Source: Winterflood. 2.

Dean BuckleyChair6 March 2025 Combination with Witan The most significant development during the year under review was the combination of the Company with Witan. Background Following a comprehensive review of management arrangements, the Witan Board concluded that a combination with the Company was in the best interests of Witan’s shareholders. Amongst other things this allowed them continued exposure to a successful multi-manager approach. The combination was undertaken by way of a scheme of reconstruction and members’ voluntary liquidation of Witan. The scheme required the approval of both the Company and Witan’s shareholders and took effect on 10 October 2024. It resulted in the Company acquiring approximately £1,539 million of net assets from Witan in consideration for the issue of new ordinary shares to Witan shareholders. The name of the Company became Alliance Witan and the stock exchange ticker ALW. Outcome The combination was expected to result in substantial benefits for all shareholders and future investors. The outcomes of the key elements of the proposals include: Portfolio Transition Investment Manager’s Report Market backdrop: equities untroubled by politics For the second year running, global equities delivered strong returns in 2024, with economics trumping politics. Despite a record number of elections, conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine reaching new heights, and a scary moment in Japan when the Nikkei Index of the top 225 blue-chip shares plunged 12% in a day at the beginning of August, investors focused on resilient global growth, falling inflation and interest rates, and healthy corporate profitability. Hence, our benchmark index, the MSCI ACWI, returned 19.6% in 2024 following a return of 15.3% in 2023. Since 1987, the Index has returned an average of 8.4% per annum1, so returns of this magnitude in two consecutive years are rare. The ebullient mood of equity investors was reflected in a surge in the prices of less established assets, such as cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin reaching all-time highs of over $100,000. Peanut the Squirrel Coin, a cryptocurrency named after the eponymous pet that New York environmental authorities seized and euthanised on 30 October 2024, at one point commanded a market cap of $1.7 billion. However, regional equity market performance was mixed. US markets once again led the way, with the S&P 500 delivering a 27% return when measured in British pounds. Chinese equities rallied briefly following government stimulus, but concerns over the country’s property market and trade tensions persisted. Together with a strong US dollar, these worries led to more subdued returns from emerging markets, which rose about 9%. In Japan, August’s technically driven decline proved temporary, and the Nikkei resumed its ascent to close the year at a record high, although the yen’s depreciation reduced returns for UK-based investors when converted into British pounds. The UK and European markets were more muted, with the FTSE All Share Index and the MSCI Europe ex UK Index returning 9.5% and 1.9% respectively. Gains driven by US tech giants Giant US technology related stocks were the standout performers, fuelled by investor excitement about generative artificial intelligence (‘AI’) and, from November onwards, hopes that Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential election would weaken regulatory scrutiny. The share prices of the so called “Magnificent Seven” – Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, NVIDIA and Tesla – increased by 60% on average and were responsible for 43% of MSCI ACWI’s gains. This was less than 2023 when they contributed 53%, but still a huge number emphasising the extreme concentration of index returns in a small number of companies. Even so, from mid-year onwards, returns were no longer quite as skewed to the performance of a handful of shares. Although NVIDIA and Tesla returned a massive 176% and 65% respectively, giant tech was not the only game in town. Financial stocks returned 26.5%, and returns from the consumer discretionary, industrial and utility sectors were also well into double figures, pointing to the potential broadening out of market returns as stock-specific drivers came to the fore. 1. https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/8d97d244-4685-4200-a24c-3e2942e3adeb Portfolio performance: strong absolute gains but lagged benchmark index Our portfolio’s NAV Total Return was a robust 13.3% but, as with most active managers, it lagged the Company’s benchmark index. The portfolio does, however, remain ahead of the Index over three years (28.0% vs 26.8%), albeit behind over five years (64.7% vs 70.8%). Disappointing though it was not to beat the MSCI ACWI in 2024, we were not alone. AJ Bell calculated that, to the end of November, just 18% of active global equity funds outperformed their passive peers, largely due to their inability to match high Index weightings in the “Magnificent Seven”. The sheer size of these companies in the Index is mind boggling. NVIDIA, Microsoft and Apple, for example, represent 13% of the MSCI ACWI as at 31 December 2024 and, together, are bigger than the entire stock markets of several sizeable countries. The skew of the Index towards mega-cap companies has been a challenge, to varying degrees, since the start of our multi-manager strategy in April 2017. As a broadly diversified strategy, with capital spread between 8-12 Managers, all with different approaches to investing, our portfolio naturally has a structural bias away from stocks that on rare occasions represent such a large proportion of our global benchmark. While we have some exposure to most of the “Magnificent Seven”, it would require a lot of the Managers to choose them as one of their best ideas for us to be at Index weight, never mind be overweight. The Index may have been hard to beat in recent years, but market concentration poses significant risks for passive strategies. At the end of 2024, the Index on average allocated around 150 times as much capital to each of Apple, NVIDIA and Microsoft as it did to the average stock, akin to us placing about 95% of the portfolio in one manager’s hands and 0.5% each in the other ten. We do not believe this is the right way to manage risk for shareholders, bearing in mind that index trackers are not investing lots of money in these companies because they are good businesses trading at good valuations, but because they are very big. If US large-cap stocks continue to dominate, tracker funds may continue to outperform active funds. But if sentiment on the technology sector turns sour, passive funds with big stakes will be hit much harder. Not owning enough NVIDIA was painful The strong outperformance of our portfolio versus our benchmark in 2023 continued into the first quarter of 2024, when the biggest contribution came from not owning, at that time, poorly performing Tesla and Apple. But thereafter stock selection became more challenging, particularly within the “Magnificent Seven”. Although we benefitted from owning Amazon and Microsoft, we moved from an overweight to an underweight position in NVIDIA in the first quarter after its extraordinary outperformance, which then made it our biggest single detractor last year as that outperformance continued. Having helped us in the first quarter, the lack of exposure to Tesla and Apple, which both recovered strongly as the year progressed, counted against us from then on. Overall, our positions in the “Magnificent Seven” accounted for a third of the portfolio’s underperformance versus the Index in 2024. The remainder of the portfolio’s underperformance came from a combination of being underweight in large-cap stocks in general and stock specific issues elsewhere, in some cases due to partial reversals of performance in 2023. For example, stock selection in financials detracted in large part due to our relative lack of exposure to strongly performing US banks such as JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs. In the consumer discretionary sector, the share price of UK-based drinks company Diageo, owned by Veritas Asset Management (‘Veritas’) and Metropolis Capital (‘Metropolis’), continued to suffer from a post-Covid cyclical downturn, falling 8.5%, although both Managers believe the company will eventually recover lost ground when structural trends reassert themselves. Novo Nordisk, the Danish weight loss drugs company, was another notable detractor, as its shares fell 14% after disappointing test results. Our Stock Pickers see this as a temporary decline in a growing market in which Novo Nordisk has a leading position. Hence, it was one of our biggest purchases in 2024 (see table below). Indeed, our Stock Pickers express a high degree of confidence in the latent value of many of their holdings. By far the most important long run ingredient underpinning share price performance is strong fundamentals, such as market-leading products or services, solid profit margins, plentiful cashflow and strong management. Top 10 purchases and sales Source: Juniper. The purchases and sales are calculated by taking the net value of all transactions (buy and sells) for each holding held within the portfolio over the period. The tables exclude any non-equity holdings such as ETFs and any transfers from the combination with Witan. Even so, in the short run, market sentiment can have a larger impact on share prices than fundamentals. When we break down the portfolio performance against the Index into fundamentals and sentiment, the portfolio’s strong absolute performance has been mainly as a result of company fundamentals, whereas the Index’s absolute performance has been more driven by market sentiment. A full breakdown of the contributors to our Total Return in 2024 is shown in the following table. Contribution analysis Source: Performance and attribution data sourced from WTW, Juniper, MSCI Inc, FactSet and Morningstar as at 31 December 2024. Percentages may not add due to rounding. In the table below, we also list the top five contributors and detractors to portfolio performance during the year relative to the portfolio’s benchmark. Sands, Vulcan and Lyrical were the top performers As we would expect from such a diverse line up, performance among our Managers was mixed. This is by design, as we do not want the portfolio to be biased towards any one approach of investing, which might make returns vulnerable to a sudden switch from one style to another. This happened in 2022 when growth stocks began to suffer significantly as central banks raised interest rates to combat inflation. Sands Capital (‘Sands’), Vulcan Value Partners (‘Vulcan’), and Lyrical Asset Management (‘Lyrical’) were the top performers last year. Sands and Vulcan both benefitted from owning tech giants. Sands held NVIDIA while Vulcan held Amazon, but Sands’ largest contributor to relative performance was Axon Enterprise, an industrial business which makes tasers, body cameras and other software products. Its share price surged by 134% last year. Top five stock contributors to performance Bottom five stock detractors to performance Source: WTW. The tables above illustrate the top five contributors and detractors to returns relative to benchmark in 2024. It aims to explain at a stock level which companies drove relative returns. For example, the Alliance Witan portfolio was underweight relative to benchmark in NVIDIA, Broadcom, Tesla and Apple. These stocks had very strong returns, which hurt our portfolio’s relative performance. Conversely, not having an exposure to Nestle helped our relative performance given the stock was held in the benchmark and was down over the year. Our overweight position in Amazon, Axon Enterprise, Salesforce and NRG Energy contributed positively to relative returns given their strong performance. The average active weight is the arithmetic simple average weight of the stock in the portfolio minus the arithmetic simple average weight of the stock in the benchmark over the period. Vulcan’s largest contributor to our performance was KKR, the US-based private equity group, which returned 82%, prompting Vulcan to take profits. Its holding in Salesforce also did well, rising nearly 30%. Lyrical, a deep-value style investor, benefitted from owning several less talked-about US-based companies, which all rebounded from cheap valuations. These included NRG Energy, Ameriprise Financials and eBay. Of our Managers, the most notable laggard was Sustainable Growth Advisors (‘SGA’), which was disappointing given its focus on large cap growth stocks which, as a group, had the strongest price momentum. SGA suffered from holding Novo Nordisk, and two of its other positions, ICON and Synopsys also stood out as detractors. The recent poor performance of SGA follows a long period of outperformance, so returns since we appointed SGA remain strong. Value Managers Metropolis and ARGA Investment Management (‘ARGA’), the latter replacing Jupiter Asset Management (‘Jupiter’) in April, also struggled in the recent market environment, which has generally favoured growth managers. Portfolio changes: two new Managers added after combination with Witan As well as adding ARGA for Jupiter in the first half of the year, following Ben Whitmore’s decision to leave Jupiter to set up his own business, there were two further changes to the Manager line-up during the integration of Witan’s portfolio. Altogether, this contributed to an unusually high level of turnover of 98.5% of the portfolio in 2024. Both Alliance Trust and Witan already had GQG Partners (‘GQG’) and Veritas in common, which meant that there were some in-specie transfers of stocks. Additionally, the combination of Alliance and Witan presented us with an opportunity to introduce Jennison Associates (‘Jennison’) to the portfolio at a low cost. Based in the US, Jennison specialises in investing in innovative, fast-growing businesses. It had been one of Witan’s most successful managers and blending it with our other Managers increased the diversity of holdings in growth companies. We also took the opportunity to replace Black Creek Investment Management (‘Black Creek’) with EdgePoint Investment Group (‘EdgePoint’), while we were using a transition manager to keep costs down to a minimum. This change was prompted by succession planning at Black Creek. We had been monitoring Black Creek for some time due to the departure of a senior team member for health reasons and the uncertainty surrounding the timing of founder Bill Kanko’s retirement. With a similar investment style to Black Creek, EdgePoint seeks to buy good, undervalued businesses and hold them until the market fully realises their potential. Through the combination, we inherited a small number of investment trust and private equity fund holdings, representing less than 3% of the combined portfolio. These are specialist funds with portfolios focused on, among other things, early-stage life sciences, valuable intellectual property, innovative internet platforms and renewable infrastructure assets. Collective investments such as these are not normally part of our investment strategy. However, they are all trading at prices we believe are well below their intrinsic value, so rather than sell them at a loss, we will hold them until we can achieve attractive values. Beyond that, the combination did not lead to any change in our investment approach. We retain high conviction in our line-up of Managers and their ability to pick winning stocks, although we keep them under constant review for any red flags and have access to a deep bench of talented replacements should these be needed. Gearing: remaining cautious Our gross gearing stood at 8.4% at the end of 2024 (4.9% net of underlying Manager and central cash), slightly above the level of 7.1% at the start of the year, reflecting the improving outlook for equities as the year progressed. However, given the strong performance from equity markets, it is still towards the lower end of the typical range of 7.5 to 12.5%. Market outlook: multiple risks warrant diversification As 2025 began, the mood among investors was upbeat, with many hoping President Trump’s promises of deregulation and tax cuts would be supportive of equity markets. If returns can spread beyond a narrow group of highly valued US mega-cap technology stocks, it could provide firmer foundations for another good year for shares. The strong start to the year for European equities certainly offered hope for geographical diversification. However, on-off tariffs and geopolitical tensions loom large, creating considerable uncertainty. This was reflected in an increase in equity market volatility in February. In the first 2 months of 2025, the benchmark index rose by 2.2% suggesting that investors were still willing to look through some of the risks while forecast global growth and corporate earnings remain healthy. But confidence is fragile and, with valuations in the US still close to a record high despite February’s pullback, the market is vulnerable to setbacks. In this environment, we believe bottom-up stock picking, based on company fundamentals, should be a more reliable way to add value for shareholders in the long term than making bold, top-down market calls. So, we will continue to position the portfolio to maintain balanced regional, sector and style exposures, that are similar to the Index weightings by periodically adjusting Manager allocations. This should provide stability and reduce risk, while we rely on our Managers to add value by seeking out the best companies in each market segment. While retaining some exposure to US mega-cap tech stocks that may continue delivering attractive returns, our portfolio is not reliant on them. It also contains many stocks that have remained in the shadows but have been performing well operationally and have excellent prospects not yet reflected in their share prices. Hidden gems: stock picks with high potential We asked our eleven Stock Pickers for examples of strong but underappreciated companies in the portfolio Lyrical highlighted five of its US holdings that have underperformed the S&P 500 Index since the start of 2024 but, at the same time, have grown their forecast earnings per share by more than the Index. These are healthcare providers Cigna and HCA, WEX and Global Payments, which both provide business-to-business payment technology, and Gen Digital, which is a leading provider of cyber security and identity protection. “Interestingly, even on this list there is inconsistency by the market,” says Lyrical. “Cigna has the worst stock performance, but the second-best earnings per share (‘EPS’) growth. Gen Digital has the slowest EPS growth in the group, but the best performance”. ARGA cited Accor, the global hotel business, which has transitioned to an “asset light” business model by selling most of its hotels, while maintaining the lucrative franchise and management agreements attached to these properties. While Sands Capital sees potential in the share prices of Sika, a maintenance and building refurbishment specialist. “Investment results have been weak despite solid fundamental results,” says Sands. “We believe that investors have focused on slower than historical organic growth, caused by several factors, including the real estate crisis in China, slowdown in electric vehicle production, and a pause in green building incentives.” Sands Capital also mentioned Roper Technologies, a diversified industrial technology company, and Keyence, a leading designer of high-end factory automation based in Japan, as attractive businesses with share price appreciation potential. Vulcan highlighted CoStar Group, an information provider to the commercial and residential real estate industries, and Everest Group, a global insurance and reinsurance business, while GQG mentioned the UK-based pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, the Brazil-based oil and gas company Petrobras, Bank Mandiri in Indonesia, and the Indian tobacco company ITC. SGA backed Danaher, the US industrial group, Intuit, which provides do-it-yourself accounting software for small businesses, and HDFC Bank in India. Jennison highlighted Reddit, the online social media platform. “Reddit is targeting 49% growth in the third quarter of 2024 and consensus is at 41% in Q4, but then market estimates are fading down to around 20% in 2025, which we think is overly conservative and creates an opportunity for investment today.” Veritas’s nominations for underappreciated businesses were Amadeus, the Spanish software company focusing on air travel, The Cooper Companies, which makes contact lenses, and Thermo Fisher Scientific, the world’s largest scientific equipment provider. Japan specialist Dalton’s best stocks included Bandai Namco, a multinational that publishes video games and makes toys, Shimano, the bicycle equipment manufacturer, and Rinnai, one of the global leaders in water heaters. Metropolis highlighted Andritz, the Austrian headquartered business supplying industrial equipment to the pulp and paper, metals and hydropower industries, Crown Holdings, which makes aluminium drinks cans, and Admiral, the UK insurer. Finally, EdgePoint, the newest addition to our Manager line-up, pointed to Dayforce, a global human resources software company, Nippon Paints Holdings in Japan, Franco-Nevada, a gold-focused royalty company in Canada, and Qualcomm, which invented significant pieces of the underlying technology required for mobile phones. “The market looks at Qualcomm as a handset supplier and the stock moves in relation to expected handset sales over the following quarters,” says EdgePoint. “We consider Qualcomm to be one of the world’s leading designers of energy-efficient processors at a point in time when demand for energy-efficient processing is growing rapidly across a wide range of industries. Some of the major opportunities for Qualcomm over the next 5 years include artificial intelligence, automobiles, personal computers and smartphones.” Altogether, these fundamentally strong businesses combine with others to create a robust, multi-manager portfolio that offers attractive long-term growth with lower risk than a single manager strategy, and therefore a more comfortable ride through the ups and downs of the market. Such companies may have remained below the radar in 2024, when investors became giddy with the stellar returns from the US technology shares, but we look forward to their attributes receiving the recognition from the market that they deserve.

Dividend We have paid our shareholders a rising dividend for 58 consecutive years. Providing that level of reliability is something of which we are extremely proud. We carefully manage the Company’s dividend. For instance, should there be a year in which income is unexpectedly high, we may retain some of that income to help fund future dividends. Due to our steady approach, the Company has received a ‘Dividend Hero’ investment company award from the Association of Investment Companies (‘AIC’). Our dividend policy Subject to market conditions and the Company’s performance, financial position and outlook, the Board will seek to pay a dividend that increases year on year. The Company expects to pay four interim dividends per year, on or around the last day of June, September, December and March, and will not, generally, pay a final dividend for a particular financial year. While shareholders are not asked to approve a final dividend, given the timing of the payment of the quarterly payments, each year they are given the opportunity to share their views when they are asked to approve the Company’s Dividend Policy. Fourth interim dividend As previously announced, a fourth interim dividend of 6.73p per ordinary share will be paid on 31 March 2025 to those shareholders who were on the register at close of business on 28 February 2025. Increased dividend The Company has increased its total dividend for the year ended 31 December 2024 to 26.7p per ordinary share (2023: 25.2p), a 6.0% increase on the previous year. Reserves It is the Board’s intention to utilise distributable reserves as well as portfolio income to fund dividend payments. Further details of the dividend payments for the year to 31 December 2024 and information on distributable reserves can be found in notes 7 and 2(b)(x) of the Financial Statements, respectively. Ongoing Charges and Discount Ongoing charges1 The Company’s ongoing charges ratio (‘OCR’) decreased to 0.56% (including the impact of the investment management fee waiver) (2023: 0.62%). Total administrative expenses were £3.9m (2023: £2.9m) and investment management expenses were £18.4m (2023: £16.3m). Further details of the Company’s expenses are provided in note 4 of the Financial Statements on page 90 of the Annual Report. The Company’s costs remain competitive for an actively managed multi-manager global equity strategy. Maintaining a stable discount1 One of the Company’s strategic objectives is to maintain a stable share price discount to NAV. The Company has the authority to buy back its own shares in the market if the discount is widening and to hold these shares in Treasury. During the year under review, the Company’s share price traded at an average discount of 4.7% (2023: 6.0%). As at 31 December 2024, the Company’s share price discount was 4.7% (2023: 5.4%). The average discount (unweighted) for the AIC Global Sector was 7.9%. Share issuance and buybacks As a result of the combination with Witan, 120,949,382 new ordinary shares were issued for assets valued at £1.5bn implying an effective issue price of £12.7459246 per share. The Company bought back 1.2%* (2023: 3.0%) of its issued share capital during the year, purchasing 4,722,000 shares which were placed in Treasury. The total cost of the share buybacks was £57.0m (2023: £86.6m). The weighted average discount of shares bought back in the year was 5.7%. Share buybacks contributed a total of 0.1% to the Company’s NAV performance in the year. 1.

What We Do How WTW manages the portfolio WTW as Investment Manager has overall responsibility for managing the Company’s portfolio. It is the Investment Manager’s job to select a diverse team of expert Stock Pickers, each of whom invest in a customised selection of 10-20 of their ‘best ideas’. WTW then allocates capital to them, relative to the risks the Stock Picker represents. For example, small-cap stocks are typically more risky than large-cap stocks, so on average a small-cap specialist would tend to receive less capital than a Stock Picker who focuses on large-cap stocks. However, the allocations do not remain static; WTW keeps them under constant review and varies them over time according to market conditions, with the goal of keeping our exposures to different parts of global stocks markets well balanced. Stock Pickers are encouraged to ignore the benchmark and only buy a small number of stocks in which they have strong conviction, while WTW manages risk through the Stock Picker allocations. On their own, each of the Stock Picker’s high-conviction mandates has the potential to perform well. This is supported by WTW’s experience of managing high-conviction portfolios and academic evidence1. But concentrated selections of stocks can be volatile and risky, so WTW mitigates these dangers by blending Stock Pickers with complementary investment approaches or styles, which can be expected to perform differently in different market conditions. This smooths out the peaks and troughs of performance associated with concentrated single-manager strategies. Several of the Stock Pickers in the current portfolio have been with the Investment Manager since inception of the multi-manager strategy, though it does actively monitor and rearrange the line-up where necessary. WTW invests a lot of time and effort on identifying skilled Stock Pickers for the Company’s portfolio, undertaking extensive qualitative and quantitative analysis. This due diligence process focuses on: 1. Sebastian & Attaluri, Conviction in Equity Investing, The Journal of Portfolio Management, Summer 2014. The Investment Manager’s views are formed over extended periods from multiple interactions with the Managers, including regular meetings. They look beyond past performance numbers to try to understand the ‘competitive edge’. This involves examining and interrogating processes for selecting stocks, adherence to this process through different market conditions, team dynamics, training and experience. Performance track records are just a single data point, and, without the context of the additional information, they are unlikely to persuade WTW that a Stock Picker is skilled. Once selected, the Investment Manager tends to form long-term partnerships with the Stock Pickers, generally only taking them out of the portfolio if something fundamental changes, such as the departure of a key individual from the business or a change in business strategy or fortunes. With highly active, concentrated portfolios, periods of short-term underperformance are to be expected and are not a reason to doubt a Stock Picker if they are adhering to their philosophy and process. WTW does, however, keep a constant eye out for talent and may bring new Managers into the portfolio at the expense of an incumbent if they are a better fit. Responsible investment WTW believes that Environmental, Social and Governance (‘ESG’) factors have the potential to impact financial risk and return. As long-term investors, WTW aims to incorporate these factors into its investment process. As stewards of the Company’s assets, WTW seeks to integrate responsible investment into its process for managing the portfolio. ESG factors can influence returns, so these risk factors are taken into account in WTW’s investment processes, including assessing how Managers evaluate ESG risk in their decisions over what stocks to purchase. Climate change poses potential significant risks to investment returns from many companies, which is why both WTW and the Company have stated an intention to manage the assets with a goal of achieving Net Zero greenhouse gas emissions from the portfolio by 2050, with an interim intention of reducing portfolio emissions by approximately 50% by 2030, relative to 2019. In 2024, we saw an increase in the portfolio’s weighted average carbon intensity (which measures carbon emissions as a proportion of revenue) from 71.9tCO2e/$M sales to 117. 9tCO2e/$M sales. Over the year, some higher-emitting stocks came into the portfolio including, industrial company Alaska Air and materials company Alcoa Ord, and our allocation to the higher-emitting Utilities sector went up slightly with purchases of companies such as Southern Ord and American Electric Power. We are monitoring our progress against our Net Zero goal, and our Managers and EOS at Federated Hermes (‘EOS’) continue to engage with the companies in the portfolio on climate related issues. Progress towards Net Zero will not be linear. Emissions from the portfolio are dependent on holdings, which can change from year to year as WTW’s Stock Pickers seek value for investors. If companies are perceived as being at higher financial risk by being slow to adapt to a Net Zero world, we expect to use stewardship, such as voting and engagement, to encourage positive changes to business practices. WTW believes this is preferable to excluding companies from the portfolio, since exclusion merely passes the responsibility of ownership to other investors who may be less scrupulous about adherence to ESG standards or regulation. As well as engaging with companies on climate change, WTW’s Stock Pickers, together with stewardship provider EOS, focused on a wide range of other issues last year. Overall, EOS engaged with 97 companies in the portfolio on 515 issues and objectives throughout the year. Key areas of engagement included board effectiveness, climate change, human and labour rights and human capital, biodiversity, digital rights and AI. Of these engagements, the environmental category accounted for 29% of the total number of engagements, with 63% of environmental engagements relating to climate change. Meanwhile the Stock Pickers cast votes at 3,346 resolutions in 2024. Of these resolutions, they voted against company management on 386 and abstained from voting on 38 occasions. How We Manage Our Risks In order to monitor and manage risks facing the Company, the Board maintains and regularly reviews a risk register and heat map. The risk register details all principal and emerging risks thought to face the Company at any given time. The principal risks facing the Company, as determined by the Board, are Investment, Operational and Legal and Regulatory Non-Compliance. As part of its review process, the Board considers input on the principal and emerging risks facing the Company from its key service providers WTW and Juniper. Any risks and their associated risk ratings are then discussed, and the risk register and heat map updated accordingly, with additional measures put in place to monitor, manage and mitigate risks as required. During the period the Board carefully reviewed the risks associated with the implementation of the combination and the post transaction integration risks. Principal risks The principal risks facing the Company, how they have changed during the year and how the Board aims to monitor and manage these risks are detailed below. Emerging risks Emerging risks are typified by having a high degree of uncertainty and may result from sudden events, new potential trends or changing specific risks where the impact and probable effect is hard to assess. As the assessment becomes clearer, the risk may be added to the risk matrix of ‘known’ risks. The Board is currently monitoring a number of emerging risks: geopolitical tension continues to be an emerging risk for the Company due to ongoing conflicts across the world. Along with increased populism and nationalism, these risks may impact individual economies and global markets. Although covered in the operational risk section above, the Board recognises the increased risk that cybercrime and the misuse of AI poses to the Company. Geopolitical events such as the conflicts in the Middle East region, coupled with the potential breakdown of post war alliances and potential new trade tariffs and changes to US economic and international policies introduced by President Trump, could bring uncertainty and fragility to capital markets in 2025, including persistent or reacceleration of inflationary pressures. Stakeholder Engagement – Section 172 Statement The Directors have a number of obligations including those under section 172 of the Companies Act 2006. These obligations relate to how the Board takes account of various factors in making its decisions – including the impact of its decisions on key stakeholders. The Board is focused on the Company’s performance and its responsibilities to stakeholders, corporate culture and diversity, as well as its contributions to wider society, and it takes account of stakeholder interests when making decisions on behalf of the Company. As an externally-managed investment trust, the Board considers the Company’s key stakeholders to be existing and potential new shareholders and its service providers. Full details on the primary ways in which the Board engaged with the Company’s key stakeholders can be found on pages 30 to 35 of the Annual Report. Dean BuckleyChair6 March 2025 Viability and Going Concern Statements Viability Statement The Board has assessed the prospects and viability of the Company beyond the 12 months required by the Going Concern accounting provisions. The Board considered the current position of the Company and its prospects, strategy and planning process as well as its principal and emerging risks in the current, medium and long term, as set out on pages 27 to 29 of the Annual Report. After the year-end but prior to approval of these Accounts, the Board reviewed its performance against its strategic objectives and its management of the principal and emerging risks facing the Company. The Board received regular updates on performance and other factors that could impact on the viability of the Company. The Board has concluded that there is a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due for at least the next five years; the Board expects this position to continue over many more years to come. The Company’s Investment Objective, which was approved by shareholders in April 2019, is to deliver a real return over the long term, through a combination of capital growth and a rising dividend, and the Board regards the Company’s shares as a long-term investment. The Board believes that a period of five years is considered a reasonable period for investment in equities and is appropriate for the composition of the Company’s portfolio. In arriving at this conclusion, the Board considered: Going Concern Statement In view of the conclusions drawn in the foregoing Viability Statements, which considered the resources of the Company over the next 12 months and beyond, the Directors believe that the Company has adequate financial resources to continue in existence for at least the period to 31 March 2026. Therefore, the Directors believe that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the Going Concern basis in preparing the financial statements. Directors’ Responsibilities The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Financial Statements in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and applicable law and regulations. Company law requires the Directors to prepare Financial Statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required to prepare the Financial Statements in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards. Under company law the Directors must not approve the Financial Statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss for that period. In preparing these Financial Statements, the Directors are required to: The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions, and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the Financial Statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.

Each of the Directors, who are listed on pages 37 to 40 of the Annual Report, confirm to the best of their knowledge that: On behalf of the Board All revenue and capital items in the above statement derive from continuing operations. The ‘Total’ column of this statement is the profit and loss account of the Company and the ‘Revenue’ and ‘Capital’ columns represent supplementary information prepared under guidance issued by the Association of Investment Companies. The Company does not have any other comprehensive income and hence profit for the year, as disclosed above, is the same as the Company’s total comprehensive income. The £553.6m (2023: £574.6m) of unrealised capital reserve arising on the revaluation of investments is subject to fair value movements and may not be readily realisable at short notice, as such it may not be entirely distributable. The unrealised capital reserve includes unrealised gains on borrowings of £22.8m (2023: £5.5m) and gains on unquoted investments of £3.5m (2023: £nil) which are not distributable.

They were signed on its behalf by: Jo DixonChair of the Audit and Risk Committee The financial information set out above does not constitute the Company's statutory Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2024 or 2023, but is derived from those Financial Statements. Statutory accounts for 2023 have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies and those for 2024 will be delivered following the Company's Annual General Meeting. The auditors have reported on those accounts; their reports were unqualified, did not draw attention to any matters by way of emphasis without qualifying their report and did not contain statements under s498(2) or (3) Companies Act 2006.

The Directors have sought to prepare the Financial Statements in accordance with the AIC SORP where the recommendations are consistent with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’). The Company qualifies as an investment entity. The Company has no securities in issue that could dilute the return per ordinary share. Therefore the basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share are the same. There are amounts of £1,222 (2023: £1,222) and £34,225 (2023: £34,225) owed to AT2006 and The Second Alliance Trust Limited, respectively, at year-end.

Even so, the Company’s longer-term performance remains competitive, and demand for our shares was healthy last year, with the Company's discount narrowing, bucking the industry trend towards widening discounts. We also increased our dividend for the 58th consecutive year. “Thanks to the support of both sets of shareholders, we achieved a historic combination with Witan, which places the Company in a strong position to realise economies of scale and offer better liquidity for our shares. With solid performance and a refreshed brand, supported by a marketing campaign that will continue in 2025, the Board is confident that the Company is well placed to continue delivering attractive returns for shareholders”. About Alliance Witan PLC Alliance Witan aims to be a core investment that beats inflation over the long term through a combination of capital growth and rising dividend. The Company invests in global equities across a wide range of different sectors and industries to achieve its objective. Alliance Witan’s portfolio uses a distinctive multi-manager approach. We blend the top stock selections of some of the world’s best active managers into a single diversified portfolio designed to outperform the market while carefully managing risk. Alliance Witan is an AIC Dividend Hero with 58 consecutive years of rising dividends. https://www.alliancewitan.com For more information, please contact: 1. Alternative Performance Measure.

Source: Morningstar and Juniper Partners Limited (‘Juniper’). Chair’s Statement 2024 was a landmark year for your Company. I would like to begin by thanking you for your support for the combination of Alliance Trust and Witan to form Alliance Witan and by welcoming all shareholders who have joined us as a result. This was a pivotal moment in our history, achieving economies of scale and elevating the Company to the FTSE 100. Now, as one of the industry’s leaders, this status will provide better liquidity for our shares and, with good long term investment performance and a strong brand, help us attract new investors. We made a number of commitments to investors as part of the proposals, for example in respect of dividends and costs, and you will see as you read through the Annual Report how we have achieved each of these. As I mentioned in the Interim Report for the six months ended 30 June 2024, there has been no change to the Company’s investment strategy, just a larger pool of assets for our Investment Manager, WTW, to manage with the same professionalism that it has brought to the job since April 2017. 1. https://www.theaic.co.uk/aic/news/press-releases/top-20-best-performing-investment-trusts-for-your-isa Investment Performance It was another good year for global equity markets, and your Company delivered strong absolute returns. NAV Total Return was 13.3% and, due to a narrowing of the discount, Share Price Total Return was 14.3%. However, we lagged our benchmark index, the MSCI All Country World Index (‘MSCI ACWI’ or ‘Index’), which returned 19.6%. We also marginally underperformed our peers in the AIC Global Sector, which is disappointing, but we were slightly ahead of the much wider, more representative Morningstar peer group of open and closed-ended global equity funds. Simply put, our relative performance in 2024 suffered from not having enough exposure to the small number of very large companies that dominated market returns, especially in the US. The narrowness of returns from global equity markets has been a common problem for all active managers in recent years, and we take comfort from the fact that, despite this persistent headwind, we are ahead of the Index and have significantly outperformed both peer groups over three years. You can read more about the contributors/detractors to the Company’s investment performance during 2024 in the Investment Manager’s Report on page 9 of the Annual Report. Dividend increased for the 58th consecutive year The Board declared a fourth interim dividend of 6.73p per share on 28 January 2025, resulting in a full year dividend of 26.70p, an increase of 6.0% on the prior year. This fulfils the promise we made at the time of the combination of Alliance Trust and Witan to increase dividends for the legacy shareholders of both companies. 2024’s increase marks the 58th consecutive annual increase, which is one of the longest track records in the investment trust industry. Dividends are well supported by revenue and reserves, and the Board is confident annual dividend increases can continue well into the future. Due to our steady approach, the Company has received a ‘Dividend Hero’ investment company award from the Association of Investment Companies (‘AIC’). Narrowing discount Many investment trusts continued to trade on large discounts to NAV throughout 2024, with the industry average widening to 14.7% from 12.7%.1 I am pleased to report that your Company fared better than most, with its average discount falling to 4.7% from 5.4% over the year. This compared favourably with the average discount for the AIC Global Sector of 7.9%. Your Board remains committed to the maintenance of a stable discount. We will continue to use share buybacks as appropriate and invest in promotional activity to widen our shareholder base, to support the management of the discount. During 2024, the Company bought back 4.7 million shares (1.2% of shares in issue2), versus 8.6 million repurchased in 2023. The shares bought back during the year were placed in Treasury. This level of buybacks was significantly below that of our peers, in a year in which industry-wide buybacks hit a record level of £7.5 billion3. The shares held in Treasury can be reissued by the Company at a premium to estimated NAV when there is market demand. Board changes Following the completion of the combination of Alliance Trust with Witan, we welcomed four new Non-Executive Directors to the Board: Andrew Ross, Rachel Beagles, Shauna Bevan and Jack Perry, all of whom were former directors of Witan. Clare Dobie, having served for almost nine years, is retiring as a Director at the conclusion of this year’s Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’), as is Jack Perry, reducing the size of the Board to eight members. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Clare and Jack for their contributions. Annual General Meeting The Board looks forward to being able to meet shareholders again at this year’s AGM, which will be held at the Apex City Quay Hotel in Dundee on 1 May 2025. For those shareholders who are not able to attend in person, we will be live streaming the event. As well as the formal business of the meeting, there will be an investor forum afterwards featuring two of our Stock Pickers, Jennison and EdgePoint, as well as members of WTW’s investment team. There will be another in-person investor forum in London in the autumn. In addition, shareholders can engage with the Company and its Stock Pickers via online presentations during the year. Further details of how to attend all these events can be found on the website. The Board would strongly encourage shareholders to use the opportunity to have their say and use their vote at the AGM. Further information on the arrangements for the AGM, including information on how to vote either directly through the Registrar or though different platforms, is on pages 134 and 135 of the Annual Report. Keep up-to-date In these unusual times, the website will provide timely updates to shareholders. Therefore, I would encourage you to visit the website which contains a vast amount of information on investment performance, details of shareholder meetings and investor forums, monthly factsheets, quarterly newsletters, and Stock Picker updates, as well as the Annual and Interim Reports. As always, the Board welcomes communication from shareholders and I can be contacted through Juniper Partners (‘Juniper’), the Company Secretary at investor@alliancewitan.com. Outlook Since the start of President Trump’s second term of office in January, tariffs have created uncertainty about the outlook for equities. Diplomatic tensions over efforts to end the war in Ukraine and conflict in Gaza have also raised geopolitical risks. Furthermore, European bond markets are adjusting to the prospect of increased borrowing to fund higher levels of defence and infrastructure spending. While there is a risk that heightened levels of uncertainty will impact on business and consumer confidence, global growth and corporate earnings forecasts are currently healthy, giving some grounds for cautious optimism, about further gains for shareholders, especially if there is a broadening out of market leadership. While the Index is highly concentrated, your portfolio has broader exposure to many good businesses that have not yet received the market recognition our Stock Pickers believe they deserve. The portfolio will not always outperform the market in every discrete period, but we believe it will continue to add significant value for shareholders in the long run. I look forward to meeting as many of you as possible at the AGM in Dundee or the next investor forum in London. 1. Weighted average discount (excluding 3i Group). Source: Winterflood. 2.

Dean BuckleyChair6 March 2025 Combination with Witan The most significant development during the year under review was the combination of the Company with Witan. Background Following a comprehensive review of management arrangements, the Witan Board concluded that a combination with the Company was in the best interests of Witan’s shareholders. Amongst other things this allowed them continued exposure to a successful multi-manager approach. The combination was undertaken by way of a scheme of reconstruction and members’ voluntary liquidation of Witan. The scheme required the approval of both the Company and Witan’s shareholders and took effect on 10 October 2024. It resulted in the Company acquiring approximately £1,539 million of net assets from Witan in consideration for the issue of new ordinary shares to Witan shareholders. The name of the Company became Alliance Witan and the stock exchange ticker ALW. Outcome The combination was expected to result in substantial benefits for all shareholders and future investors. The outcomes of the key elements of the proposals include: Portfolio Transition Investment Manager’s Report Market backdrop: equities untroubled by politics For the second year running, global equities delivered strong returns in 2024, with economics trumping politics. Despite a record number of elections, conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine reaching new heights, and a scary moment in Japan when the Nikkei Index of the top 225 blue-chip shares plunged 12% in a day at the beginning of August, investors focused on resilient global growth, falling inflation and interest rates, and healthy corporate profitability. Hence, our benchmark index, the MSCI ACWI, returned 19.6% in 2024 following a return of 15.3% in 2023. Since 1987, the Index has returned an average of 8.4% per annum1, so returns of this magnitude in two consecutive years are rare. The ebullient mood of equity investors was reflected in a surge in the prices of less established assets, such as cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin reaching all-time highs of over $100,000. Peanut the Squirrel Coin, a cryptocurrency named after the eponymous pet that New York environmental authorities seized and euthanised on 30 October 2024, at one point commanded a market cap of $1.7 billion. However, regional equity market performance was mixed. US markets once again led the way, with the S&P 500 delivering a 27% return when measured in British pounds. Chinese equities rallied briefly following government stimulus, but concerns over the country’s property market and trade tensions persisted. Together with a strong US dollar, these worries led to more subdued returns from emerging markets, which rose about 9%. In Japan, August’s technically driven decline proved temporary, and the Nikkei resumed its ascent to close the year at a record high, although the yen’s depreciation reduced returns for UK-based investors when converted into British pounds. The UK and European markets were more muted, with the FTSE All Share Index and the MSCI Europe ex UK Index returning 9.5% and 1.9% respectively. Gains driven by US tech giants Giant US technology related stocks were the standout performers, fuelled by investor excitement about generative artificial intelligence (‘AI’) and, from November onwards, hopes that Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential election would weaken regulatory scrutiny. The share prices of the so called “Magnificent Seven” – Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, NVIDIA and Tesla – increased by 60% on average and were responsible for 43% of MSCI ACWI’s gains. This was less than 2023 when they contributed 53%, but still a huge number emphasising the extreme concentration of index returns in a small number of companies. Even so, from mid-year onwards, returns were no longer quite as skewed to the performance of a handful of shares. Although NVIDIA and Tesla returned a massive 176% and 65% respectively, giant tech was not the only game in town. Financial stocks returned 26.5%, and returns from the consumer discretionary, industrial and utility sectors were also well into double figures, pointing to the potential broadening out of market returns as stock-specific drivers came to the fore. 1. https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/8d97d244-4685-4200-a24c-3e2942e3adeb Portfolio performance: strong absolute gains but lagged benchmark index Our portfolio’s NAV Total Return was a robust 13.3% but, as with most active managers, it lagged the Company’s benchmark index. The portfolio does, however, remain ahead of the Index over three years (28.0% vs 26.8%), albeit behind over five years (64.7% vs 70.8%). Disappointing though it was not to beat the MSCI ACWI in 2024, we were not alone. AJ Bell calculated that, to the end of November, just 18% of active global equity funds outperformed their passive peers, largely due to their inability to match high Index weightings in the “Magnificent Seven”. The sheer size of these companies in the Index is mind boggling. NVIDIA, Microsoft and Apple, for example, represent 13% of the MSCI ACWI as at 31 December 2024 and, together, are bigger than the entire stock markets of several sizeable countries. The skew of the Index towards mega-cap companies has been a challenge, to varying degrees, since the start of our multi-manager strategy in April 2017. As a broadly diversified strategy, with capital spread between 8-12 Managers, all with different approaches to investing, our portfolio naturally has a structural bias away from stocks that on rare occasions represent such a large proportion of our global benchmark. While we have some exposure to most of the “Magnificent Seven”, it would require a lot of the Managers to choose them as one of their best ideas for us to be at Index weight, never mind be overweight. The Index may have been hard to beat in recent years, but market concentration poses significant risks for passive strategies. At the end of 2024, the Index on average allocated around 150 times as much capital to each of Apple, NVIDIA and Microsoft as it did to the average stock, akin to us placing about 95% of the portfolio in one manager’s hands and 0.5% each in the other ten. We do not believe this is the right way to manage risk for shareholders, bearing in mind that index trackers are not investing lots of money in these companies because they are good businesses trading at good valuations, but because they are very big. If US large-cap stocks continue to dominate, tracker funds may continue to outperform active funds. But if sentiment on the technology sector turns sour, passive funds with big stakes will be hit much harder. Not owning enough NVIDIA was painful The strong outperformance of our portfolio versus our benchmark in 2023 continued into the first quarter of 2024, when the biggest contribution came from not owning, at that time, poorly performing Tesla and Apple. But thereafter stock selection became more challenging, particularly within the “Magnificent Seven”. Although we benefitted from owning Amazon and Microsoft, we moved from an overweight to an underweight position in NVIDIA in the first quarter after its extraordinary outperformance, which then made it our biggest single detractor last year as that outperformance continued. Having helped us in the first quarter, the lack of exposure to Tesla and Apple, which both recovered strongly as the year progressed, counted against us from then on. Overall, our positions in the “Magnificent Seven” accounted for a third of the portfolio’s underperformance versus the Index in 2024. The remainder of the portfolio’s underperformance came from a combination of being underweight in large-cap stocks in general and stock specific issues elsewhere, in some cases due to partial reversals of performance in 2023. For example, stock selection in financials detracted in large part due to our relative lack of exposure to strongly performing US banks such as JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs. In the consumer discretionary sector, the share price of UK-based drinks company Diageo, owned by Veritas Asset Management (‘Veritas’) and Metropolis Capital (‘Metropolis’), continued to suffer from a post-Covid cyclical downturn, falling 8.5%, although both Managers believe the company will eventually recover lost ground when structural trends reassert themselves. Novo Nordisk, the Danish weight loss drugs company, was another notable detractor, as its shares fell 14% after disappointing test results. Our Stock Pickers see this as a temporary decline in a growing market in which Novo Nordisk has a leading position. Hence, it was one of our biggest purchases in 2024 (see table below). Indeed, our Stock Pickers express a high degree of confidence in the latent value of many of their holdings. By far the most important long run ingredient underpinning share price performance is strong fundamentals, such as market-leading products or services, solid profit margins, plentiful cashflow and strong management. Top 10 purchases and sales Source: Juniper. The purchases and sales are calculated by taking the net value of all transactions (buy and sells) for each holding held within the portfolio over the period. The tables exclude any non-equity holdings such as ETFs and any transfers from the combination with Witan. Even so, in the short run, market sentiment can have a larger impact on share prices than fundamentals. When we break down the portfolio performance against the Index into fundamentals and sentiment, the portfolio’s strong absolute performance has been mainly as a result of company fundamentals, whereas the Index’s absolute performance has been more driven by market sentiment. A full breakdown of the contributors to our Total Return in 2024 is shown in the following table. Contribution analysis Source: Performance and attribution data sourced from WTW, Juniper, MSCI Inc, FactSet and Morningstar as at 31 December 2024. Percentages may not add due to rounding. In the table below, we also list the top five contributors and detractors to portfolio performance during the year relative to the portfolio’s benchmark. Sands, Vulcan and Lyrical were the top performers As we would expect from such a diverse line up, performance among our Managers was mixed. This is by design, as we do not want the portfolio to be biased towards any one approach of investing, which might make returns vulnerable to a sudden switch from one style to another. This happened in 2022 when growth stocks began to suffer significantly as central banks raised interest rates to combat inflation. Sands Capital (‘Sands’), Vulcan Value Partners (‘Vulcan’), and Lyrical Asset Management (‘Lyrical’) were the top performers last year. Sands and Vulcan both benefitted from owning tech giants. Sands held NVIDIA while Vulcan held Amazon, but Sands’ largest contributor to relative performance was Axon Enterprise, an industrial business which makes tasers, body cameras and other software products. Its share price surged by 134% last year. Top five stock contributors to performance Bottom five stock detractors to performance Source: WTW. The tables above illustrate the top five contributors and detractors to returns relative to benchmark in 2024. It aims to explain at a stock level which companies drove relative returns. For example, the Alliance Witan portfolio was underweight relative to benchmark in NVIDIA, Broadcom, Tesla and Apple. These stocks had very strong returns, which hurt our portfolio’s relative performance. Conversely, not having an exposure to Nestle helped our relative performance given the stock was held in the benchmark and was down over the year. Our overweight position in Amazon, Axon Enterprise, Salesforce and NRG Energy contributed positively to relative returns given their strong performance. The average active weight is the arithmetic simple average weight of the stock in the portfolio minus the arithmetic simple average weight of the stock in the benchmark over the period. Vulcan’s largest contributor to our performance was KKR, the US-based private equity group, which returned 82%, prompting Vulcan to take profits. Its holding in Salesforce also did well, rising nearly 30%. Lyrical, a deep-value style investor, benefitted from owning several less talked-about US-based companies, which all rebounded from cheap valuations. These included NRG Energy, Ameriprise Financials and eBay. Of our Managers, the most notable laggard was Sustainable Growth Advisors (‘SGA’), which was disappointing given its focus on large cap growth stocks which, as a group, had the strongest price momentum. SGA suffered from holding Novo Nordisk, and two of its other positions, ICON and Synopsys also stood out as detractors. The recent poor performance of SGA follows a long period of outperformance, so returns since we appointed SGA remain strong. Value Managers Metropolis and ARGA Investment Management (‘ARGA’), the latter replacing Jupiter Asset Management (‘Jupiter’) in April, also struggled in the recent market environment, which has generally favoured growth managers. Portfolio changes: two new Managers added after combination with Witan As well as adding ARGA for Jupiter in the first half of the year, following Ben Whitmore’s decision to leave Jupiter to set up his own business, there were two further changes to the Manager line-up during the integration of Witan’s portfolio. Altogether, this contributed to an unusually high level of turnover of 98.5% of the portfolio in 2024. Both Alliance Trust and Witan already had GQG Partners (‘GQG’) and Veritas in common, which meant that there were some in-specie transfers of stocks. Additionally, the combination of Alliance and Witan presented us with an opportunity to introduce Jennison Associates (‘Jennison’) to the portfolio at a low cost. Based in the US, Jennison specialises in investing in innovative, fast-growing businesses. It had been one of Witan’s most successful managers and blending it with our other Managers increased the diversity of holdings in growth companies. We also took the opportunity to replace Black Creek Investment Management (‘Black Creek’) with EdgePoint Investment Group (‘EdgePoint’), while we were using a transition manager to keep costs down to a minimum. This change was prompted by succession planning at Black Creek. We had been monitoring Black Creek for some time due to the departure of a senior team member for health reasons and the uncertainty surrounding the timing of founder Bill Kanko’s retirement. With a similar investment style to Black Creek, EdgePoint seeks to buy good, undervalued businesses and hold them until the market fully realises their potential. Through the combination, we inherited a small number of investment trust and private equity fund holdings, representing less than 3% of the combined portfolio. These are specialist funds with portfolios focused on, among other things, early-stage life sciences, valuable intellectual property, innovative internet platforms and renewable infrastructure assets. Collective investments such as these are not normally part of our investment strategy. However, they are all trading at prices we believe are well below their intrinsic value, so rather than sell them at a loss, we will hold them until we can achieve attractive values. Beyond that, the combination did not lead to any change in our investment approach. We retain high conviction in our line-up of Managers and their ability to pick winning stocks, although we keep them under constant review for any red flags and have access to a deep bench of talented replacements should these be needed. Gearing: remaining cautious Our gross gearing stood at 8.4% at the end of 2024 (4.9% net of underlying Manager and central cash), slightly above the level of 7.1% at the start of the year, reflecting the improving outlook for equities as the year progressed. However, given the strong performance from equity markets, it is still towards the lower end of the typical range of 7.5 to 12.5%. Market outlook: multiple risks warrant diversification As 2025 began, the mood among investors was upbeat, with many hoping President Trump’s promises of deregulation and tax cuts would be supportive of equity markets. If returns can spread beyond a narrow group of highly valued US mega-cap technology stocks, it could provide firmer foundations for another good year for shares. The strong start to the year for European equities certainly offered hope for geographical diversification. However, on-off tariffs and geopolitical tensions loom large, creating considerable uncertainty. This was reflected in an increase in equity market volatility in February. In the first 2 months of 2025, the benchmark index rose by 2.2% suggesting that investors were still willing to look through some of the risks while forecast global growth and corporate earnings remain healthy. But confidence is fragile and, with valuations in the US still close to a record high despite February’s pullback, the market is vulnerable to setbacks. In this environment, we believe bottom-up stock picking, based on company fundamentals, should be a more reliable way to add value for shareholders in the long term than making bold, top-down market calls. So, we will continue to position the portfolio to maintain balanced regional, sector and style exposures, that are similar to the Index weightings by periodically adjusting Manager allocations. This should provide stability and reduce risk, while we rely on our Managers to add value by seeking out the best companies in each market segment. While retaining some exposure to US mega-cap tech stocks that may continue delivering attractive returns, our portfolio is not reliant on them. It also contains many stocks that have remained in the shadows but have been performing well operationally and have excellent prospects not yet reflected in their share prices. Hidden gems: stock picks with high potential We asked our eleven Stock Pickers for examples of strong but underappreciated companies in the portfolio Lyrical highlighted five of its US holdings that have underperformed the S&P 500 Index since the start of 2024 but, at the same time, have grown their forecast earnings per share by more than the Index. These are healthcare providers Cigna and HCA, WEX and Global Payments, which both provide business-to-business payment technology, and Gen Digital, which is a leading provider of cyber security and identity protection. “Interestingly, even on this list there is inconsistency by the market,” says Lyrical. “Cigna has the worst stock performance, but the second-best earnings per share (‘EPS’) growth. Gen Digital has the slowest EPS growth in the group, but the best performance”. ARGA cited Accor, the global hotel business, which has transitioned to an “asset light” business model by selling most of its hotels, while maintaining the lucrative franchise and management agreements attached to these properties. While Sands Capital sees potential in the share prices of Sika, a maintenance and building refurbishment specialist. “Investment results have been weak despite solid fundamental results,” says Sands. “We believe that investors have focused on slower than historical organic growth, caused by several factors, including the real estate crisis in China, slowdown in electric vehicle production, and a pause in green building incentives.” Sands Capital also mentioned Roper Technologies, a diversified industrial technology company, and Keyence, a leading designer of high-end factory automation based in Japan, as attractive businesses with share price appreciation potential. Vulcan highlighted CoStar Group, an information provider to the commercial and residential real estate industries, and Everest Group, a global insurance and reinsurance business, while GQG mentioned the UK-based pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, the Brazil-based oil and gas company Petrobras, Bank Mandiri in Indonesia, and the Indian tobacco company ITC. SGA backed Danaher, the US industrial group, Intuit, which provides do-it-yourself accounting software for small businesses, and HDFC Bank in India. Jennison highlighted Reddit, the online social media platform. “Reddit is targeting 49% growth in the third quarter of 2024 and consensus is at 41% in Q4, but then market estimates are fading down to around 20% in 2025, which we think is overly conservative and creates an opportunity for investment today.” Veritas’s nominations for underappreciated businesses were Amadeus, the Spanish software company focusing on air travel, The Cooper Companies, which makes contact lenses, and Thermo Fisher Scientific, the world’s largest scientific equipment provider. Japan specialist Dalton’s best stocks included Bandai Namco, a multinational that publishes video games and makes toys, Shimano, the bicycle equipment manufacturer, and Rinnai, one of the global leaders in water heaters. Metropolis highlighted Andritz, the Austrian headquartered business supplying industrial equipment to the pulp and paper, metals and hydropower industries, Crown Holdings, which makes aluminium drinks cans, and Admiral, the UK insurer. Finally, EdgePoint, the newest addition to our Manager line-up, pointed to Dayforce, a global human resources software company, Nippon Paints Holdings in Japan, Franco-Nevada, a gold-focused royalty company in Canada, and Qualcomm, which invented significant pieces of the underlying technology required for mobile phones. “The market looks at Qualcomm as a handset supplier and the stock moves in relation to expected handset sales over the following quarters,” says EdgePoint. “We consider Qualcomm to be one of the world’s leading designers of energy-efficient processors at a point in time when demand for energy-efficient processing is growing rapidly across a wide range of industries. Some of the major opportunities for Qualcomm over the next 5 years include artificial intelligence, automobiles, personal computers and smartphones.” Altogether, these fundamentally strong businesses combine with others to create a robust, multi-manager portfolio that offers attractive long-term growth with lower risk than a single manager strategy, and therefore a more comfortable ride through the ups and downs of the market. Such companies may have remained below the radar in 2024, when investors became giddy with the stellar returns from the US technology shares, but we look forward to their attributes receiving the recognition from the market that they deserve.

Dividend We have paid our shareholders a rising dividend for 58 consecutive years. Providing that level of reliability is something of which we are extremely proud. We carefully manage the Company’s dividend. For instance, should there be a year in which income is unexpectedly high, we may retain some of that income to help fund future dividends. Due to our steady approach, the Company has received a ‘Dividend Hero’ investment company award from the Association of Investment Companies (‘AIC’). Our dividend policy Subject to market conditions and the Company’s performance, financial position and outlook, the Board will seek to pay a dividend that increases year on year. The Company expects to pay four interim dividends per year, on or around the last day of June, September, December and March, and will not, generally, pay a final dividend for a particular financial year. While shareholders are not asked to approve a final dividend, given the timing of the payment of the quarterly payments, each year they are given the opportunity to share their views when they are asked to approve the Company’s Dividend Policy. Fourth interim dividend As previously announced, a fourth interim dividend of 6.73p per ordinary share will be paid on 31 March 2025 to those shareholders who were on the register at close of business on 28 February 2025. Increased dividend The Company has increased its total dividend for the year ended 31 December 2024 to 26.7p per ordinary share (2023: 25.2p), a 6.0% increase on the previous year. Reserves It is the Board’s intention to utilise distributable reserves as well as portfolio income to fund dividend payments. Further details of the dividend payments for the year to 31 December 2024 and information on distributable reserves can be found in notes 7 and 2(b)(x) of the Financial Statements, respectively. Ongoing Charges and Discount Ongoing charges1 The Company’s ongoing charges ratio (‘OCR’) decreased to 0.56% (including the impact of the investment management fee waiver) (2023: 0.62%). Total administrative expenses were £3.9m (2023: £2.9m) and investment management expenses were £18.4m (2023: £16.3m). Further details of the Company’s expenses are provided in note 4 of the Financial Statements on page 90 of the Annual Report. The Company’s costs remain competitive for an actively managed multi-manager global equity strategy. Maintaining a stable discount1 One of the Company’s strategic objectives is to maintain a stable share price discount to NAV. The Company has the authority to buy back its own shares in the market if the discount is widening and to hold these shares in Treasury. During the year under review, the Company’s share price traded at an average discount of 4.7% (2023: 6.0%). As at 31 December 2024, the Company’s share price discount was 4.7% (2023: 5.4%). The average discount (unweighted) for the AIC Global Sector was 7.9%. Share issuance and buybacks As a result of the combination with Witan, 120,949,382 new ordinary shares were issued for assets valued at £1.5bn implying an effective issue price of £12.7459246 per share. The Company bought back 1.2%* (2023: 3.0%) of its issued share capital during the year, purchasing 4,722,000 shares which were placed in Treasury. The total cost of the share buybacks was £57.0m (2023: £86.6m). The weighted average discount of shares bought back in the year was 5.7%. Share buybacks contributed a total of 0.1% to the Company’s NAV performance in the year. 1.

What We Do How WTW manages the portfolio WTW as Investment Manager has overall responsibility for managing the Company’s portfolio. It is the Investment Manager’s job to select a diverse team of expert Stock Pickers, each of whom invest in a customised selection of 10-20 of their ‘best ideas’. WTW then allocates capital to them, relative to the risks the Stock Picker represents. For example, small-cap stocks are typically more risky than large-cap stocks, so on average a small-cap specialist would tend to receive less capital than a Stock Picker who focuses on large-cap stocks. However, the allocations do not remain static; WTW keeps them under constant review and varies them over time according to market conditions, with the goal of keeping our exposures to different parts of global stocks markets well balanced. Stock Pickers are encouraged to ignore the benchmark and only buy a small number of stocks in which they have strong conviction, while WTW manages risk through the Stock Picker allocations. On their own, each of the Stock Picker’s high-conviction mandates has the potential to perform well. This is supported by WTW’s experience of managing high-conviction portfolios and academic evidence1. But concentrated selections of stocks can be volatile and risky, so WTW mitigates these dangers by blending Stock Pickers with complementary investment approaches or styles, which can be expected to perform differently in different market conditions. This smooths out the peaks and troughs of performance associated with concentrated single-manager strategies. Several of the Stock Pickers in the current portfolio have been with the Investment Manager since inception of the multi-manager strategy, though it does actively monitor and rearrange the line-up where necessary. WTW invests a lot of time and effort on identifying skilled Stock Pickers for the Company’s portfolio, undertaking extensive qualitative and quantitative analysis. This due diligence process focuses on: 1. Sebastian & Attaluri, Conviction in Equity Investing, The Journal of Portfolio Management, Summer 2014. The Investment Manager’s views are formed over extended periods from multiple interactions with the Managers, including regular meetings. They look beyond past performance numbers to try to understand the ‘competitive edge’. This involves examining and interrogating processes for selecting stocks, adherence to this process through different market conditions, team dynamics, training and experience. Performance track records are just a single data point, and, without the context of the additional information, they are unlikely to persuade WTW that a Stock Picker is skilled. Once selected, the Investment Manager tends to form long-term partnerships with the Stock Pickers, generally only taking them out of the portfolio if something fundamental changes, such as the departure of a key individual from the business or a change in business strategy or fortunes. With highly active, concentrated portfolios, periods of short-term underperformance are to be expected and are not a reason to doubt a Stock Picker if they are adhering to their philosophy and process. WTW does, however, keep a constant eye out for talent and may bring new Managers into the portfolio at the expense of an incumbent if they are a better fit. Responsible investment WTW believes that Environmental, Social and Governance (‘ESG’) factors have the potential to impact financial risk and return. As long-term investors, WTW aims to incorporate these factors into its investment process. As stewards of the Company’s assets, WTW seeks to integrate responsible investment into its process for managing the portfolio. ESG factors can influence returns, so these risk factors are taken into account in WTW’s investment processes, including assessing how Managers evaluate ESG risk in their decisions over what stocks to purchase. Climate change poses potential significant risks to investment returns from many companies, which is why both WTW and the Company have stated an intention to manage the assets with a goal of achieving Net Zero greenhouse gas emissions from the portfolio by 2050, with an interim intention of reducing portfolio emissions by approximately 50% by 2030, relative to 2019. In 2024, we saw an increase in the portfolio’s weighted average carbon intensity (which measures carbon emissions as a proportion of revenue) from 71.9tCO2e/$M sales to 117. 9tCO2e/$M sales. Over the year, some higher-emitting stocks came into the portfolio including, industrial company Alaska Air and materials company Alcoa Ord, and our allocation to the higher-emitting Utilities sector went up slightly with purchases of companies such as Southern Ord and American Electric Power. We are monitoring our progress against our Net Zero goal, and our Managers and EOS at Federated Hermes (‘EOS’) continue to engage with the companies in the portfolio on climate related issues. Progress towards Net Zero will not be linear. Emissions from the portfolio are dependent on holdings, which can change from year to year as WTW’s Stock Pickers seek value for investors. If companies are perceived as being at higher financial risk by being slow to adapt to a Net Zero world, we expect to use stewardship, such as voting and engagement, to encourage positive changes to business practices. WTW believes this is preferable to excluding companies from the portfolio, since exclusion merely passes the responsibility of ownership to other investors who may be less scrupulous about adherence to ESG standards or regulation. As well as engaging with companies on climate change, WTW’s Stock Pickers, together with stewardship provider EOS, focused on a wide range of other issues last year. Overall, EOS engaged with 97 companies in the portfolio on 515 issues and objectives throughout the year. Key areas of engagement included board effectiveness, climate change, human and labour rights and human capital, biodiversity, digital rights and AI. Of these engagements, the environmental category accounted for 29% of the total number of engagements, with 63% of environmental engagements relating to climate change. Meanwhile the Stock Pickers cast votes at 3,346 resolutions in 2024. Of these resolutions, they voted against company management on 386 and abstained from voting on 38 occasions. How We Manage Our Risks In order to monitor and manage risks facing the Company, the Board maintains and regularly reviews a risk register and heat map. The risk register details all principal and emerging risks thought to face the Company at any given time. The principal risks facing the Company, as determined by the Board, are Investment, Operational and Legal and Regulatory Non-Compliance. As part of its review process, the Board considers input on the principal and emerging risks facing the Company from its key service providers WTW and Juniper. Any risks and their associated risk ratings are then discussed, and the risk register and heat map updated accordingly, with additional measures put in place to monitor, manage and mitigate risks as required. During the period the Board carefully reviewed the risks associated with the implementation of the combination and the post transaction integration risks. Principal risks The principal risks facing the Company, how they have changed during the year and how the Board aims to monitor and manage these risks are detailed below. Emerging risks Emerging risks are typified by having a high degree of uncertainty and may result from sudden events, new potential trends or changing specific risks where the impact and probable effect is hard to assess. As the assessment becomes clearer, the risk may be added to the risk matrix of ‘known’ risks. The Board is currently monitoring a number of emerging risks: geopolitical tension continues to be an emerging risk for the Company due to ongoing conflicts across the world. Along with increased populism and nationalism, these risks may impact individual economies and global markets. Although covered in the operational risk section above, the Board recognises the increased risk that cybercrime and the misuse of AI poses to the Company. Geopolitical events such as the conflicts in the Middle East region, coupled with the potential breakdown of post war alliances and potential new trade tariffs and changes to US economic and international policies introduced by President Trump, could bring uncertainty and fragility to capital markets in 2025, including persistent or reacceleration of inflationary pressures. Stakeholder Engagement – Section 172 Statement The Directors have a number of obligations including those under section 172 of the Companies Act 2006. These obligations relate to how the Board takes account of various factors in making its decisions – including the impact of its decisions on key stakeholders. The Board is focused on the Company’s performance and its responsibilities to stakeholders, corporate culture and diversity, as well as its contributions to wider society, and it takes account of stakeholder interests when making decisions on behalf of the Company. As an externally-managed investment trust, the Board considers the Company’s key stakeholders to be existing and potential new shareholders and its service providers. Full details on the primary ways in which the Board engaged with the Company’s key stakeholders can be found on pages 30 to 35 of the Annual Report. Dean BuckleyChair6 March 2025 Viability and Going Concern Statements Viability Statement The Board has assessed the prospects and viability of the Company beyond the 12 months required by the Going Concern accounting provisions. The Board considered the current position of the Company and its prospects, strategy and planning process as well as its principal and emerging risks in the current, medium and long term, as set out on pages 27 to 29 of the Annual Report. After the year-end but prior to approval of these Accounts, the Board reviewed its performance against its strategic objectives and its management of the principal and emerging risks facing the Company. The Board received regular updates on performance and other factors that could impact on the viability of the Company. The Board has concluded that there is a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due for at least the next five years; the Board expects this position to continue over many more years to come. The Company’s Investment Objective, which was approved by shareholders in April 2019, is to deliver a real return over the long term, through a combination of capital growth and a rising dividend, and the Board regards the Company’s shares as a long-term investment. The Board believes that a period of five years is considered a reasonable period for investment in equities and is appropriate for the composition of the Company’s portfolio. In arriving at this conclusion, the Board considered: Going Concern Statement In view of the conclusions drawn in the foregoing Viability Statements, which considered the resources of the Company over the next 12 months and beyond, the Directors believe that the Company has adequate financial resources to continue in existence for at least the period to 31 March 2026. Therefore, the Directors believe that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the Going Concern basis in preparing the financial statements. Directors’ Responsibilities The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Financial Statements in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and applicable law and regulations. Company law requires the Directors to prepare Financial Statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required to prepare the Financial Statements in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards. Under company law the Directors must not approve the Financial Statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss for that period. In preparing these Financial Statements, the Directors are required to: The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions, and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the Financial Statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. The Directors are responsible for ensuring that the Annual Report and Financial Statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s position, performance, business model and strategy. Website publication The Directors are responsible for ensuring the Annual Report and the Financial Statements are made available on a website. Financial Statements are published on the Company’s website in accordance with legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of Financial Statements, which may vary from legislation in other jurisdictions. The maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website is the responsibility of the Directors. The Directors’ responsibility also extends to the ongoing integrity of the Financial Statements contained therein. Report of Directors and Responsibility Statement The Report of the Directors on pages 36 to 69 of the Annual Report (other than pages 61 to 63 which form part of the Strategic Report) of the Annual Report and Accounts has been approved by the Board. The Directors have chosen to include information relating to future development of the Company and relationships with suppliers, customers and others, and their impact on the Board’s decisions on pages 30 to 35 of the Annual Report. Each of the Directors, who are listed on pages 37 to 40 of the Annual Report, confirm to the best of their knowledge that: On behalf of the Board All revenue and capital items in the above statement derive from continuing operations. The ‘Total’ column of this statement is the profit and loss account of the Company and the ‘Revenue’ and ‘Capital’ columns represent supplementary information prepared under guidance issued by the Association of Investment Companies. The Company does not have any other comprehensive income and hence profit for the year, as disclosed above, is the same as the Company’s total comprehensive income. The £553.6m (2023: £574.6m) of unrealised capital reserve arising on the revaluation of investments is subject to fair value movements and may not be readily realisable at short notice, as such it may not be entirely distributable. The unrealised capital reserve includes unrealised gains on borrowings of £22.8m (2023: £5.5m) and gains on unquoted investments of £3.5m (2023: £nil) which are not distributable. The Financial Statements were approved by the Board of Directors and authorised for issue on 6 March 2025. They were signed on its behalf by: Jo DixonChair of the Audit and Risk Committee The financial information set out above does not constitute the Company's statutory Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2024 or 2023, but is derived from those Financial Statements. Statutory accounts for 2023 have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies and those for 2024 will be delivered following the Company's Annual General Meeting. The auditors have reported on those accounts; their reports were unqualified, did not draw attention to any matters by way of emphasis without qualifying their report and did not contain statements under s498(2) or (3) Companies Act 2006. The same accounting policies, presentations and methods of computation are followed in these Financial Statements as were applied in the Company’s last annual audited Financial Statements, other than those stated in the Annual Report. Basis of accounting The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards (‘IASs’). The Financial Statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except that investments and fixed rate notes are stated at fair value through the profit and loss. The Association of Investment Companies (‘AIC’) issued a Statement of Recommended Practice: Financial Statements of Investment Companies (‘AIC SORP’) in July 2022. The Directors have sought to prepare the Financial Statements in accordance with the AIC SORP where the recommendations are consistent with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’). The Company qualifies as an investment entity. The Company has no securities in issue that could dilute the return per ordinary share. Therefore the basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share are the same. There are amounts of £1,222 (2023: £1,222) and £34,225 (2023: £34,225) owed to AT2006 and The Second Alliance Trust Limited, respectively, at year-end. There are no other related parties other than those noted below. Transactions with key management personnel Details of the Non-Executive Directors are disclosed on pages 37 to 40 of the Annual Report. For the purpose of IAS 24 ‘Related Party Disclosures’, key management personnel comprised the Non-Executive Directors of the Company. Details of remuneration are disclosed in the Remuneration Report on pages 55 to 60 of the Annual Report. ANNUAL REPORT The Annual Report will be available in due course on the Company's website www.alliancewitan.com. It will also be made available to the public at the Company's registered office, River Court, 5 West Victoria Dock Road, Dundee DD1 3JT and at the offices of the Company's Registrar, Computershare Investor Services PLC, Edinburgh House, 4 North St Andrew Street, Edinburgh EH2 1HJ after publication.

Title: Ties between The Trade Desk and key media agencies are weakening
URL: http://digiday.com/media-buying/ties-between-the-trade-desk-and-key-media-agencies-are-weakening/
Time Published: 2025-03-07T05:01:00Z
Full Content:
Join us at the Digiday Publishing Summit from March 24-26 in Vail The Trade Desk (TTD) and media agencies are drifting apart — a conscious uncoupling that crept in slowly but is now moving fast. Agencies say their spending isn’t climbing like it used to, while The Trade Desk is busy chasing direct deals with advertisers. It’s not a full on breakup yet, but both sides are clearly eyeing other options. One holding company media buyer, who exchanged anonymity for candor, told Digiday that rising client investment in CTV — and the many DSPs that can be used to place such spend — meant their agency was becoming less reliant on The Trade Desk over time. “We’ve had — we have — a great relationship with TTD. I just think that the dominance of the inventory that they represent is less and less important,” said the buyer. That sentiment has only grown louder over the past two years as media agencies have taken more control over programmatic ad buying. Once content to let ad tech players like The Trade Desk handle it, agencies have been pushed by advertisers to step up, building out their own tech and services to optimize ad buying. Naturally, that shift pulled them away from The Trade Desk and closer to the other power players in the auction: supply-side platforms, which hold the data and tech agencies need to secure the best ad impressions. In addition, there’s concerns among some media buyers over rising data fees and dwindling transparency around the ways its products work. “Those things add up to the point where it may be less expensive to run [a campaign] through a walled garden or another platform,” said Jonathan D’Souza-Rauto, biddable product lead at agency Kepler. In turn these frustrations are starting to influence where advertisers choose to spend their dollars. Indeed, media agency execs say their dependence on it is slipping as client investments bend toward channels that The Trade Desk doesn’t dominate in, namely CTV where, despite its expertise, there’s competition. Viant, for example, saw overall revenues increased 30% in 2024. According to co-founder and COO Chris Vanderhook, that was due to a “massive tailwind” from CTV demand. It’s a thought not lost on the execs at Amazon Ads, who are using the promise of CTV advertising powered by its rich data as a hook to convince more advertisers to use its own DSP. So far, it appears to be working. The company raked in $17.3 billion in ad revenue last quarter, a 17% rise driven by its DSP’s growth. As Digiday previously reported, it’s beginning to encroach upon established ad tech players and, in time, is expected to provide serious competition for The Trade Desk. “Amazon’s DSP has come a long way, and a lot of that has to do with… their market dominance, their data, their commerce solution, their proprietary inventory,” said one anonymous buyer. “They are coming for The Trade Desk.” These tensions are mounting as The Trade Desk’s grip on ad dollars faces pressure from three sides: a fragmented CTV market, the slow death of third-party cookies that fuel its audience targeting and the looming risk that their disappearance could dent its buying efficiency in key areas. After the firm’s recent earnings brought The Trade Desk its first revenue miss in 33 straight quarters, chief exec Jeff Green told analysts that the company had overhauled its client-facing teams as part of a 15-point plan to regain momentum. That included layoffs (it’s unclear how many precisely) and a reorientation of some teams around clients and business verticals; the company’s jobs board currently includes several openings for director and manager positions focused on managing brand relationships. In addition, Green said TTD planned to pursue more joint business plans (JBPs) — direct arrangements struck with big advertisers. A Trade Desk spokesperson referred Digiday to remarks Green made during TTD’s most recent earnings call in a request for comment — during which, Green claimed that TTD’s brand direct relationships were growing 50% faster than other parts of the business. This not so subtle push to cozy up to agency clients directly might look like a threat, but it’s arguably the least important factor at play. The Trade Desk’s pursuit of more top advertiser partnerships isn’t expected to be an issue, given clients will still typically ask agencies to execute and advise on investments. “JBPs are not a threat to the way agencies work,” said one buyer, who asked to remain anonymous, citing continued existing relationships with The Trade Desk. Even recent structural shake-ups within the company’s agency team aren’t seen as something that will escalate tensions with agencies — at least no higher than they already are. In fact The Trade Desk’s day-to-day relationship with agencies appears to still be relatively healthy, especially those outside the holdco groups, according to five buyers that spoke with Digiday. For instance, at indie shop Wpromote, head of media investment Deanna Mulkeen described TTD’s DSP as “a critical part of our media mix … Nobody is perfect, but I think The Trade Desk has been really strong for us.” And for many advertisers, that’s unlikely to change anytime soon. According to Ryan Eusanio, svp, video and programmatic at Omnicom Media Group, most clients will utilize multiple DSPs according to their media needs. An advertiser focusing on YouTube might adopt DV360 as a “primary” platform and use another as its “secondary”, he said. “A lot of our clients use [The Trade Desk] as a primary DSP. They’ve been an industry leader in the CTV space for a very long time, [and] we’ve built a lot of co-developed capabilities with them,” he explained. The real question, though, is how far that collaboration with agencies will go. The Trade Desk remains the preeminent gateway to the open web for many. But when growth is on the line, partnerships often take a back seat. Nothing is decided yet, but if Coca-Cola does opt for a change then Publicis Groupe is the frontrunner to handle its media dollars in North America, which is reportedly worth close to $1 billion. The Parisian holding company has invested more than $1.5 billion in acquisitions over the past six months. ‘Joint Business Plans’ are a less spoken of but vitally important means of growth for the online ad industry’s middlemen as Darwinism takes hold.

Title: BlackRock’s Vivek Paul explains why India remains strong bet for global investors

BlackRock Investment Institute sees India as a key investment destination despite short-term market fluctuations. Vivek Paul of BlackRock, believes that India presents strong structural growth opportunities that make it a long-term winner."If we were thinking for anybody with an investing horizon 5, 10 years out, we would be building portfolios today using our core IP, where you would hold a greater allocation than a benchmark weight," Paul said in an ET Now interaction.BlackRock maintains an overweight position on both Indian equities and bonds, as the country's demographics and economic positioning remain favorable. Paul remains bullish on India’s economic potential and advises investors to allocate more than the benchmark weight to Indian markets."Structural opportunities are sizable in India. The demographic forces underpinning India are really strong, and the country’s multi-aligned geopolitical stance is likely to benefit it more in the future," said Paul. India is uniquely positioned to capitalize on global economic shifts, particularly in labor markets and geopolitics."Most of the developed markets and China, are going to experience a shortfall in the working age population over the coming 20 years. India is going to experience a big gain in the working age population in the coming years. And you think about the geopolitical dynamics that we are in now, a multi-aligned country such as India is likely to benefit from that sort of environmentt," Paul explained. While short-term economic cycles may create market fluctuations, India’s long-term fundamentals remain strong."We cannot assume that we will never see cyclical dynamics. Liquidity has been constrained, consumption is more challenged, and global uncertainty remains. But once these unwind, attention will shift back to fundamentals," Paul noted.Investors should differentiate between short-term volatility and long-term growth trends to make informed investment decisions. The debate on Indian market valuations continues, but Paul believes that India remains reasonably priced relative to its growth potential."If you think about risk premia associated with Indian stocks, I would argue that it is not particularly expensive in a historical context. Taking into account future earnings growth and different rate cycles, Indian equities remain attractive," Paul stated.While traditional valuation metrics may suggest high stock prices, expected earnings growth and interest rate trends justify India’s market positioning. Paul maintains his positive long-term outlook on India, advising investors to stay invested in large-cap equities and selective bond allocations."International investors will want to tap into India’s opportunities as the focus shifts back to fundamentals," he emphasized.Investors should focus on high-quality Indian stocks with strong earnings potential while maintaining exposure to the bond market for stable returns. Despite short-term market fluctuations, Vivek Paul sees India as a major growth driver for global portfolios."On a structural horizon, there is an opportunity in India. We see strong demographic forces, favorable geopolitical positioning, and long-term economic momentum supporting future growth," Paul said.Paul advises investors to stay invested for the long term, focus on structural growth over cyclical fluctuations, and view India as a key component of a globally diversified portfolio.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

Subscribe Today's print edition Home Delivery Hong Kong's edge as a financial hub will erode further as the city becomes embroiled in China-U.S. tensions, with the flash sale of a Hong Kong-owned global ports business highlighting geopolitical volatility, executives and analysts said. The former British colony is caught in the eye of a storm between Beijing and Washington, underlined by the decision by conglomerate CK Hutchison, controlled by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, to sell its ports network, including assets along the Panama Canal, to a U.S. consortium led by BlackRock. U.S. President Donald Trump, who claimed in January that the Panama Canal was being operated by a Chinese company, has hailed the deal.

The deal was worth $22.8 billion and also involved a few dozen ports around the world. According to a Bloomberg report, it was the head of the banking giant who pitched the idea to the president. Citing unnamed sources familiar with the developments, Larry Fink offered Trump to buy the ports, whose Chinese-linked ownership had concerned the U.S. president. That concern happened to coincide with BlackRock’s ambition to expand globally in search of fresh profit opportunities and the perception that port ownership could present such an opportunity. The finance major paid $19 billion for the ports of Balboa and Cristobal to CK Hutchinson, which is owned by one of Asia’s wealthiest individuals, Hong Kong billionaire investor Li Ka-Shing. Along with the Panama ports, CK Hutchinson will also sell its controlling stakes in 43 other ports in 23 countries, the Wall Street Journal said, quoting an unnamed source close to the seller as saying, “It was a very elegant solution. Li does not like leaving things lingering.” Trump has had his sights on the Panama Canal ever since he won the November vote. “Has anyone ever heard of the Panama Canal?” Trump said in December. “Because we're being ripped off at the Panama Canal like we're being ripped off everywhere else.” “It was given to Panama and the people of Panama, but it has provisions,” the then president-elect went on to say of the Panama Canal. “If the principles, both moral and legal, of this magnanimous gesture of giving are not followed, then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to us, in full, quickly and without question.” Later, the president’s rhetoric toughened further, with him saying he would not exclude the use of force to reclaim U.S. control over the critical waterway that handles U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas to one of its key markets: Asia. The Panama Canal was built by the United States in the early 20th century. Panama granted the U.S. the right to build and operate the canal in exchange for annual payments. Ownership over the infrastructure was passed to the Panamanian government in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. The deal granted control over the Panama Canal to the local government under the obligation of maintaining its neutrality. However, port ownership by a company with links to the Chinese government sparked concern about this neutrality in the new federal government, which is where BlackRock stepped in with a potential solution, according to media reports. Per Bloomberg, KKR and Blackstone were also bidders for the ports. The Panama Canal is the shortest route for U.S. LNG sold in Asia. However, it is not always the cheapest route or the fastest. The Canal authorities charge a fee for passage through the chokepoint, and weather conditions sometimes make it impossible to use it. That happened recently when a two-year drought made navigation through the Canal challenging and led to extended delays in goods delivery. Even so, the Panama Canal remains a key piece of infrastructure for U.S. energy exports, and there have even been discussions in recent years of boosting its capacity to handle an even greater volume of LNG exports. It is not without alternatives, however, which LNG exporters use whenever the economics of using the Panama Canal do not make sense. As Cheniere Energy’s chief operating officer put it last year, during the worst of the drought, “We use the canal when it is economical to do so, right now it is not. Right now the market in the Far East is not supporting it, and the waiting time, with us not being a priority customer, is just not worth us using it right now.” By Charles Kennedy for Oilprice.com More Top Reads From Oilprice.com Back to homepage Previous Post Abu Dhabi’s ADNOC Buys Its First Dubai Crude via Platts Pricing Process Next Post Big Oil Stocks Hammered After OPEC’s Move To Boost Output Charles is a writer for Oilprice.com China Looks To Derail The West’s Strategy To Replace Russian Gas Supplies Refinery Shutdowns, Growing Demand Could Send Fuel Inventories to 25-year Low These Canadian Energy Firms Could Be Among The Hardest Hit By U.S. Tariffs Russian Oil Supply To Czech Republic Cut Amid U.S. Sanctions OPEC+ Caves to Trump Pressure—But Throws Just a Bone ADVERTISEMENT © OilPrice.com The materials provided on this Web site are for informational and educational purposes only and are not intended to provide tax, legal, or investment advice.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, March 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against AppLovin Corporation (“AppLovin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: APP) and reminds investors of the May 5, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding AppLovin’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the AppLovin class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/APP or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

Nvidia (NVDA) stock fell 5.7% on Thursday, bringing its decline this year to more than 17% amid concerns about declines in spending on AI, amid a general selloff in that took the tech-centered Nasdaq 100 down 2.8%. The wider Composite index fell 2.6%. “The decline in Nvidia’s stock price has much less to do with company fundamentals and much more to do with macro considerations, namely uncertainty around tariffs and trade policy,” Will Rhind, CEO and founder of GraniteShares told Quartz in an email. “The company posted very strong Q4 earnings showing they remain at the forefront of the AI technology race.” He suggested that if trade war discussions are mostly noise, this could be an opportunity to buy Nvidia shares at their lowest valuation in a while. Rival chipmakers also fell, with Broadcom (AVGO) plummeting 6.3% ahead of earnings, Micron (MU) about 5.4%, and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) 2.8%. The U.S.-listed shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) dropped 4.6%. Marvell Technology’s (MRVL) shares plunged almost 20% after the semiconductor company’s earnings guidance didn’t impress investors. ON Semiconductor (ON) fell 5.6% after Allegro MicroSystems called “inadequate” ON’s unsolicited acquisition offer of $35.10 a share in cash. Meanwhile, Allegro (ALGM) gained 5.7%, going against the tide. Outside of chipmakers, other tech giants also fell, with Meta (META) down 4.4% and Amazon (AMZN) declining 3.7%. The shares of Apple (AAPL) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) fell by smaller amounts.

Title: Netflix Stock Slides Amid Analyst Forecast of Slowing Sub Growth, Broader Market Turmoil Over Tariffs

By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Shares of Netflix fell 8.5% Thursday as investors reacted to analyst projections for slowing subscriber growth after the streamer’s record gains last year on its password-sharing crackdown. The stock’s decline also came as the wider market dropped on President Trump’s shifting decisions on tariffs imposed on Canada and Mexico. Other media and tech stocks seeing declines Thursday included Spotify (-7.4%), Warner Bros. Discovery (-6.4%), Roku (-6.4%), Disney (-3.6%), Meta (-4.35%) and Amazon (-3.7%). Gainers included Paramount Global (+2.2%) as well as Comcast (+2%) and Sony (+0.3%). Market indexes were down Thursday, with S&P 500 dipping 1.78% and the Nasdaq Composite declining 2.61%. That came after Trump said he would suspend new tariffs on most imports from Mexico and Canada until April 2 — coming just two days after he instigated a trade battle with the two countries by announcing imminent tariffs of 25% on the countries. Related Stories VIP+ Why Hollywood Is Still Struggling to Make the Most of Video Games Box Office: 'Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy' Debuts to $35 Million Overseas, 'Captain America: Brave New World' Nears $200 Million Globally Meanwhile, in a note published Thursday morning, a team of analysts at MoffettNathason led by Robert Fishman pointed out that Netflix had its strongest period of subscriber growth in the second half of 2024 since the pandemic, adding a net 24 million subscribers over that time. While “it is likely Netflix has a few more quarters of strong subscriber growth driven by its content slate and ad-tier,” the analysts said, “we do expect the benefits of the password-sharing crackdown to slow.” Popular on Variety As of the first quarter of 2025, Netflix will no longer report subscriber numbers on a regular basis (and it had already stopped providing quarterly sub forecasts). The company has asserted that financial metrics like engagement and profitability better reflect its overall health and trajectory. MoffettNathanson’s note on Netflix wasn’t a downgrade: The firm reiterated its “neutral” rating on the stock and its $850/share 12-month price target. But it noted that an analysis of Netflix’s total engagement statistics for the second half of 2024 translated to a 6% decline in average daily engagement per global subscriber. That “implies that the elevated level of global subscriber growth for Netflix does not represent as significant an expansion of its user base. Rather, it is leading to Netflix (very successfully) improving the monetization of its existing userbase,” the analysts said. On Wednesday, Netflix CFO Spencer Neumann made upbeat comments at an investor conference, saying he expects content spending to continue to rise as the company attracts more subscribers globally and grows top-line revenue. “We’re not anywhere near a ceiling” with respect to content spending, Neumann said. Netflix has forecast $18 billion in cash content spending this year, which would be up around 11% from $16.2 billion in 2024. A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Title: AST SpaceMobile Touts Europe-Focused Cellular Satellite Amid Elon Chaos

BARCELONA—The satellite-to-phone broadband firm with the biggest to-do list checked off one notable item during MWC when it announced a deal with Vodafone to provide service across Europe. But another task remains: Getting 40 more satellites into low Earth orbit to inaugurate commercial service for partners that include AT&T and Verizon. In a Wednesday interview here, Scott Wisniewski, president and chief strategy officer at AST, walked through the firm's next steps to bring satellite roaming to existing phones. SatCo, the joint venture AST will create with Vodafone, will see that wireless carrier build out a set of ground stations to link AST's satellites with mobile networks across Europe. “We're more deeply integrated into their network than others who are developing add-on tech services,” Wisniewski said. He added that AST will not be making a capital contribution to Vodafone’s work on the ground and plans to split revenue 50/50 with that company. He also noted one bonus for Europeans anxious about the large role of US tech firms on the continent: “One side effect of that is the traffic goes up, the traffic goes down, but it all stays within the country.” From conversations here, those concerns have ratcheted up in just the last month, thanks to the Trump administration’s transactional approach to foreign relations and Elon Musk’s dual roles as SpaceX CEO and White House henchman. Wisniewski acknowledged those concerns but described SatCo as a key step in ensuring broader “European sovereignty.” As he put it: “Political environments come and go, but having a solution that's European is important, and that's what we're trying to create with Vodafone here.” AST is also preparing to follow up on its successful September launch of the first five BlueBird satellites. AST used a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket for that mission, but its next launch will take place in India. It will also use Blue Origin’s large New Glenn rocket to speed up its delivery. “We made contracts in a diversified way,” Wisniewski said of AST's approach to securing launch services. “We're counting on Blue Origin, and they've done a great job so far.” The massive payload fairing of New Glenn, which had a successful debut in January, is particularly appealing to AST because its BlueBird satellites are so large. “It can support up to 8 satellites each,” he said. These spacecraft—some 2,400 square feet each—are designed to support far more devices than SpaceX’s tiny Starlink satellites. AST says that will allow it to begin offering service with 45 in space and reach a first buildout with 60. Wisniewski pushed back against skepticism such as a potshot on X from Ben Longmier, senior director for satellite engineering at SpaceX, who suggested AST customers would have “tens of minutes” between working connections. Wisniewski said those first 45 satellites would allow “continuous service” in latitudes across the US, Europe, and Japan. “We've tested and demonstrated about 20Mbps,” he said of AST’s downloads. Uploads will be “about half as good as the downlink,” which in past testing has supported video calling via space. Sometime over those next 40 satellites, AST plans to cut over to including the custom ASIC (application specific integrated circuit) that it developed to maximize capacity. The simpler processor on earlier-build satellites will allow the same coverage but will leave satellites with about half the network capacity of the ASIC, which he said is “checking out as designed.” In the US, AST may be facing a much larger change to its in-space hardware as a result of a January deal to acquire satellite-specific radio spectrum from the bankrupt firm Ligado Networks. That L-band spectrum doesn’t require new regulatory authorization and could allow AST to sell service direct to customers. But unlike AST’s current offering, this spectrum requires specific hardware in phones (which is why Globalstar’s satellite messaging for iPhones, also delivered via satellite-specific spectrum, only works on recent models) and new hardware in orbit. “It’s the same satellite design, but the active payload is changed a little bit,” Wisniewski said of possible L-band satellites. But first the company has to spin up service for AT&T and Verizon and see those carriers get paying customers. Rob Pegoraro writes about interesting problems and possibilities in computers, gadgets, apps, services, telecom, and other things that beep or blink. He’s covered such developments as the evolution of the cell phone from 1G to 5G, the fall and rise of Apple, Google’s growth from obscure Yahoo rival to verb status, and the transformation of social media from CompuServe forums to Facebook’s billions of users.

NEXT | The Queue: I am a Negative Man The next phase of content for WoW Classic anniversary realms, Phase 3, will go live in game at 3PM pacific time on Thursday March 20, 2025. Phase 3 is actually being split in to two separate releases, with the second half scheduled to drop on Thursday April 3, 2025, also at 3PM pacific time. Based on the previous releases for anniversary realms, this means we can expect some downtime on Tuesday March 18 ahead of the phase rollout. Let’s take a look at what you can expect to go live with the Phase 3 update! March 20, 2025: April 3, 2025: Blackwing Lair is the headline PVE activity in Phase 3 but before players can take on this level 60 raid and the 8 bosses within, they’ll need to complete a short attunement questline that takes them through the Upper Blackrock Spire dungeon. Blackwing Lair rewards the highly sought after Tier 2 set pieces but if in order to complete their sets, players will also need to run Onyxia’s Lair for head pieces and Molten Core for leg pieces. The Darkmoon Faire will also appear in Elwynn Forest and Mulgore on March 20, with associated breadcrumb quests in Stormwind and Orgrimmar. Vendors for the Argent Dawn, Thorium Brotherhood, Timbermaw Hold, Silverwing Sentinels, and the Warsong Outriders will open up their inventories as a reward for progressing through their reputation tracks, allowing you to purchase certain gear, crafting recipes, and consumables. Alliance players will only be able to progress with Silvering Sentinels and the Warsong Outriders will only reward Horde players. Each class has an associated level 50 questline that rewards them with a unique rare-quality reward upon completion. These quests start in different zones based on your class but they all end at the Sunken Temple dungeon. Later, on April 3, the PVP Honor Rank will raise to 14 and the Arathi Basin battleground will open up for players above level 20. Players will also get a recurring battleground holiday event every weekend, running from Thursday at midnight (Friday) and lasting through Tuesday, presumably ending at reset. Each weekend will feature a different map and completing objectives in battlegrounds during this event will yield increased levels of Honor and Faction rewards. The first event is scheduled for April 4 in Arathi Basin. We’ll keep you updated on everything else coming to Classic anniversary realms once we learn about them!

Skip to comments. Posted on 03/06/2025 11:52:42 AM PST by Miami Rebel President Donald Trump convened his Cabinet in person on Thursday to deliver a message: You’re in charge of your departments, not Elon Musk. According to two administration officials, Trump told top members of his administration that Musk was empowered to make recommendations to the departments but not to issue unilateral decisions on staffing and policy. Musk was also in the room. The meeting followed a series of mass firings and threats to government workers from the billionaire Tesla founder, who helms the Department of Government Efficiency, that created broad uncertainty across the federal government and its workforce. DOGE’s actions have faced ferocious resistance in court and criticism from Democratic lawmakers and some Republicans.

Dems attack Elon Musk after DOGE gains access to sensitive data The president’s message represents the first significant move to narrow Musk’s mandate. According to Trump’s new guidance, DOGE and its staff should play an advisory role — but Cabinet secretaries should make final decisions on personnel, policy and the pacing of implementation. Musk joined the conversation and indicated he was on board with Trump’s directive. According to one person familiar with the meeting, Musk acknowledged that DOGE had made some missteps — a message he shared earlier this week with members of Congress. Trump stressed that he wants to keep good people in government and not to eject capable federal workers en masse. But his administration has in recent weeks fired tens of thousands of federal workers across numerous agencies in a series of blanket terminations. A federal judge and the chair of a federal civil service board have both concluded that the terminations were not tied to performance issues — and may have violated civil service laws.

Title: Elon Musk Is Officially $122 Billion Poorer Than His Peak—As Tesla Stock Erases Most All Of Its Election Rally

The world’s richest man Elon Musk, who doubles as President Donald Trump’s chief of cost-cutting, took a sizable hit to his net worth as the stock market shudders at Trump’s tariffs, causing shares of Musk’s multinational car company Tesla to flounder. Elon Musk at the Oval Office last month. Musk’s net worth fell by $8.8 billion Thursday to $342.8 billion, according to Forbes’ real-time estimates. Musk’s fortune is now down $121.2 billion from its end-of-day record of $464 billion set Dec. 17, when Tesla stock closed at an all-time high $480 per share. Down 6% on the day, Tesla stock closed at just above $263, some 45% below its end-of-day record set late last year. Tesla ended Thursday trading at its lowest share price since Election Day. The Tesla slump came as the S&P 500 fell 1.8% to a 2025 low as Trump’s tariffs on Canada, China and Mexico ate into investor sentiment. Musk remains by far the richest person on Earth, leading No. 2 Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta, by more than $120 billion. To put the $121 billion Musk lost in perspective, the 10th-wealthiest person on the planet, former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, has an estimated net worth of $118.9 billion in total. Asia’s wealthiest person, India’s Mukesh Ambani, has an $89.8 billion fortune. 4.8%. That’s how much Tesla shares were up from Election Day to Thursday, a fraction of the 91% rally they enjoyed through Dec. 17. Tesla’s initial post-election surge came as Wall Street bet Musk’s near $300 million donation toward Trump and GOP election efforts would translate into a big win for Tesla, which would especially benefit from lighter regulation for its self-driving initiatives. Musk is still $78 billion wealthier than he was on Election Day, benefiting in part from higher valuations for his private companies SpaceX and xAI. Tesla is particularly sensitive to tariffs as China is the second-largest market for its electric vehicles and the company, like other American automakers, relies on imports from Canada to produce its cars. Tariffs “will have an impact on our business and profitability” considering Tesla is “still very reliant on parts from across the world for all our businesses,” Tesla’s chief financial officer Vaibhav Taneja warned in January. Musk is arguably the most important member of Trump’s administration as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). “Musk's involvement with DOGE and the Trump administration broadly may affect some buyers in the US and Europe, which complicates the setup from a demand perspective,” Baird analyst Ben Kallo wrote in a Thursday note to clients.

Title: Dealmakers Head to New Orleans to Look Beyond ‘Havoc’ in M&A

Full Content:
(Bloomberg) -- Dealmakers gathered at an annual conference in New Orleans this week to catch their breath and try to look for reasons to be optimistic about a mergers and acquisitions market that has disappointed so far in 2025. “People want to do deals,” Audra Cohen, co-managing partner at law firm Sullivan & Cromwell’s general practice group, said during a presentation Thursday at Tulane University’s Corporate Law Institute event. She was speaking against a backdrop of falling deal values, with activity in part impacted by US President’s Donald Trump’s policies on the economy and foreign affairs. “Things like the tariffs give people a little bit of pause because they’re having to look at their business, at the supply chain and trying to figure out what that means,” Cohen said. “Until a little bit of this settles, it’s going to be challenging to get deals done particularly at valuations that people would expect.” Every year around this time, Wall Street’s clubby network of M&A lawyers, bankers and public relations professionals heads to Louisiana to talk shop at Tulane. Many dealmakers began 2025 expecting a banner year under Trump. But they’ve instead crashed into the harsh reality of trade wars and geopolitical clashes. “There’s a lack of predictability right now,” said Scott Barshay, chair of the corporate department at Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison. “Our clients are kind of waiting and seeing right now to see how things sort out. There’s a lot of interest in doing things.” Barshay said that the head of a company that was seeking to pursue a big transaction recently told him that the company plans to “wait a little while,” as it didn’t want to strike a deal only to see the market crater the next day. Barshay said he still expected the year to end on a positive note. “There’s just a little bit of a pause but I don’t think it’s a lot of pause,” he said. “I think we’re going to see over the next few weeks announcements of some bigger deals coming out.” ‘Wreaks Havoc’ Global deal values are down about 16% in 2025 to roughly $485 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Jennifer Muller, co-head of Houlihan Lokey Inc.’s special committee advisory and fairness and solvency opinions practices, said it will be hard for values to hit the $3.5 trillion that many had expected this year. This week’s movement in the VIX Index, a closely watched measure of stock market volatility, is a worry, she said. “In order for M&A and IPOs to flourish, typically market volatility needs to stay below or around 20 on a consistent basis,” Muller said. “Most have predicted that Trump’s actions would create some enhanced volatility and indeed the VIX has been dancing around 20 and yesterday ended around 20. This wreaks havoc with M&A transactions.” Muller said she saw potential for a pickup in activity in deals around artificial intelligence, pharmaceuticals, financial services and oil and gas. Another wrinkle in the M&A market under Trump 2.0 is that the US government could want more of a say in negotiations around deals that it sees as having the potential to impact America’s competitiveness. This week, BlackRock Inc. led one of the biggest acquisitions of the year in a deal that marked both the firm’s expanded reach in infrastructure and a win for Trump, who had raised concerns over control of key ports near the Panama Canal. “Political leaders are getting into the deal process and [asking] for political concessions around the deal,” said Leo Strine Jr., of counsel in the corporate department at Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz. “That’s a new dynamic. If the US is going to involve itself in who does a deal, if the US government has a perspective on a cross-border deal, is the other government going to be involved?” More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: Bitwise enters DeFi through institutional allocation with Maple Finance

Bitwise's investment through Maple Finance highlights the accelerating trend of institutions seeking attractive yields in DeFi markets. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitwise has taken a significant step into DeFi with its first institutional allocation through Maple Finance. This initiative will allow Bitwise to access on-chain credit while maintaining compliance with institutional regulatory standards on Maple’s platform. The firm, which manages over $12 billion in client assets, announced the move in a statement shared with CryptoSlate on March 6. Following the news, Maple Finance’s native SYRUP token increased by almost 10% to $0.145 as of press time. According to the statement, the development highlights the increasing demand for yield-generating opportunities in digital assets, particularly among institutional investors. The firm noted that its move signals a broader trend of institutions expanding beyond traditional fixed-income markets and exploring on-chain lending as a more efficient and scalable alternative. Jeff Park, Head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise, emphasized the growing role of tokenization in institutional adoption. He noted that while many misuse terms like “tokenized securities” and “securitized tokens,” the latter is poised to drive real institutional adoption due to its practical benefits in the crypto ecosystem. Park added: “Private credit on crypto rails remains one of the most immediate opportunities for institutions who are looking to achieve high risk-adjusted yield with the additional benefits of liquidity, transparency, and efficiency that only DeFi can provide. With regulatory clarity that is being unleashed in D.C., it is now only a matter of time.” Meanwhile, the partnership between Bitwise and Maple Finance could pave the way for wider adoption of regulated on-chain lending platforms. Institutional investors are increasingly looking to credit markets as a source of alpha, and Maple’s growing track record positions it as a key player in this space. Nikolai Milutin, an ambassador for Maple, said the move shows that institutional adoption of on-chain credit is now underway. He added: “Bitwise has taken the first step by leveraging DeFi through Maple. This move signals a turning point—other institutions will follow, and it won’t be long before giants like Coinbase, Binance, and BLACKROCK take notice.” Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Shipping Giant MSC Set to Become World’s Largest Terminal Operator in $22.8B Hutchison Ports Deal

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. MSC ships at the Port of Long Beach. Photo courtesy Port of Long Beach In a landmark deal announced on Tuesday, Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison will sell its 80% stake in Hutchison Ports Holding to a Blackrock-TiL consortium, positioning Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC)—already the world’s largest ocean carrier by far—to become the global leader in container terminal operations, according to Drewry’s analysis of the deal. The $22.8 billion transaction, the largest ever in the global container terminal sector, comes amid heightened political scrutiny over Chinese influence in critical maritime infrastructure. Notably, the deal also includes the sale of Hutchison Port Holdings’ 90% interest in Panama Ports Company, which operates the Balboa and Cristobal ports on opposite ends of the Panama Canal. Since December, President Trump has repeatedly criticized alleged Chinese influence over Panama Canal operations and discriminatory practices against the U.S.—claims that the Panamanian government has firmly rejected. “My administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we’ve already started doing it,” Trump said in his address to a joint session of Congress this week. “Just today, a large American company (BlackRock) announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals.” Drewry’s global terminal operator (GTO) rankings show Hutchison Ports currently operates 43 maritime container terminals outside China and Hong Kong, spanning from Australia to the UAE, with a combined capacity exceeding 73 million TEU and throughput of nearly 47 million TEU as of 2023. MSC’s existing portfolio, which includes a 70% stake in Terminal Investment Limited (TiL), full ownership of Africa Global Logistics, and various Italian terminals through Marinvest, handled over 70 million TEU in 2023, according to Drewry. “The proposed deal will see MSC leapfrog other leading GTOs to secure the top spot in the global terminal operator rankings which Drewry produces each year, securing the Swiss-headquartered container carrier a truly global network of container terminals,” points out Eleanor Hadland, Drewry’s Lead Analyst for Ports and Terminals. However, regulatory hurdles may complicate the acquisition. Drewry’s analysis reveals key areas of concern include Panama, where TiL already holds significant interests opposite Hutchison’s operations; Rotterdam, where the deal could affect competition across Northwest Europe; and Spain, where both companies maintain substantial terminal presence. Drewry notes that the partnership leverages a longstanding relationship between MSC and Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), now owned by Blackrock. GIP’s initial 35% stake in TiL, acquired in 2013 and currently at 20%, has proven crucial for TiL’s expansion. “This deal appears to be a major win for MSC, which secures additional capacity in several key markets,” concludes Hadland. “We do however expect the regulatory processes to extend for at least a year, and foresee competition authorities taking a particular interest in the Northwest Europe, Spain and Panama markets.” Join the gCaptain Club for curated content, insider opinions, and vibrant community discussions.

Title: Blackrock reach Leinster Schools Senior Cup final after proving too strong for Roscrea

The traditionalists wouldn’t have it any other way. Brian Walsh and James Browne scored a brace of tries each as Blackrock qualified to meet Terenure in the Leinster Schools Senior Cup final at Tallaght Stadium on St Patrick’s Day. Roscrea almost got the perfect start. Rob Carney made a strong carry, taking a number of would-be tacklers with him, but Sam Cusack couldn’t quite take the offload. Blackrock hit back straight away. Harry O’Neil and Michael O’Sullivan made dents but Aiden Vetjens was rattled by Keelan Dunne for a knock-on. No matter, ‘Rock props Ben Guerin and Sam Bishti straightened an attack. The ball found Johnny O’Sullivan knifing through for Paddy Clancy to convert in the 11th minute. From a scrum, the ‘Rock boys then moved wide for Johnny O’Sullivan to eat up metres. Brian Walsh took Geoff Wall’s flat ball for a try, converted by Clancy for 14-0 in the 15th minute. Still, Roscrea’s maul was starting to gather momentum and Eoin Naughton claimed a confidence-boosting try. Jack Deegan converted. When Johnny O’Sullivan made his next incursion, Albert Lindner looked a racing certainty to make the line until Sam Cusack caused a spill in the act of grounding. [ Michael Smyth grabs hat-trick as Terenure see off St Fintan’s to book final slotOpens in new window ] Nevertheless, the Williamstown school was slipping through the gears. Something had to give and it would be Roscrea’s fringe defence off a maul. Number eight Walsh peeled off for his second try, converted by Clancy for 21-7 at half-time. Roscrea, however, were not quite ready to accept their fate and Deegan kicked a penalty to narrow the deficit early in the second half. But ‘Rock stormed back and, following a Vetjens interception, Johnny O’Sullivan sent Browne over in the corner for 26-10 in the 39th minute. Roscrea still had an ace to play. A smooth lineout was moved to Deegan, whose venomous in-to-out movement ended beside the posts where he converted for 26-17 in the 50th minute. Another interception, by Bernard Whyte this time, put Blackrock back where they wanted to be deep in Roscrea territory. Fionn Carney prevented a try by Vetjens, but Bishti couldn’t be stopped. Clancy converted for 33-17 in the 65th minute. That was the ball game. There was still time for Michael O’Sullivan’s break and sound handling to see Browne into the right corner to clinch a day with destiny.

Title: Software engineers at Google, Microsoft, and more share their best tips for landing a coding job in tech

Working as a software engineer isn't what it used to be — but those working in the industry have some tips for getting ahead in the increasingly crowded job market. The software engineering industry is going through a major shift driven by the adoption of AI, which has led to fewer job postings, layoffs, and evolving responsibilities for those still working in the field. In early to mid-2022, there were three times as many software engineering roles listed on Indeed. This chart shows just how much the opportunity landscape has changed. As AI coding tools like GitHub Copilot or Replit have become more prominent, a large part of the job has become automated. In Salesforce's most recent earnings call, its CEO Marc Benioff said the company is seeing a "30% productivity increase in engineering" and won't "hire any new engineers this year" in the wake of those gains. Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in an earnings call in 2024 that over a quarter of the company's code is generated by AI before being checked by employees. A manager at Microsoft similarly shared that AI reduced 70% of the time he used to spend on coding, although he noted that his daily workload hasn't been reduced. That's because software engineers do more than just code. For newer entrants to the field, though, the opportunities are narrowing, and some have struggled to get the foundational skills needed to move up. Some recent software engineering grads have said they sent hundreds of job applications with minimal responses. That's led some to pursue a "panic Master's" degree to put off the hunt. It's not all doom and gloom, though. Automating coding tasks has increased the demand for developers to leverage their creativity and experience. Here's some of the advice from industry veterans and tech CEOs on how to improve your odds of getting a job in the field — and success stories from those who have done it. Jump to

(NYSE: MRK). Shareholders who purchased shares of MRK during the class period listed are encouraged to contact the firm regarding possible lead plaintiff appointment. Appointment as lead plaintiff is not required to partake in any recovery. CONTACT US HERE: https://securitiesclasslaw.com/securities/merck-co-inc-loss-submission-form/?id=134090&from=3 CLASS PERIOD: February 3, 2022 to February 3, 2025 ALLEGATIONS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Merck’s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. The full truth finally emerged on February 4, 2025, when Merck announced it would no longer achieve the long-forecasted $11 billion in sales of Gardasil by 2030, as it would cease shipments of Gardasil to China “through at least midyear” to facilitate a “rapid reduction of inventory.” Defendants claimed this was necessitated by the continued over-inflation of overall channel inventories as demand in China for Gardasil had “not recovered to the level we had expected.” Following this news, Merck’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $99.79 per share on February 3, 2025, Merck’s stock price fell to $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025, a decline of more than 9% in the span of just a single day.

Title: Shipping Firms Pull Back from Hong Kong to Skirt US-China Risks

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Port Of Hong Kong Stock Photo: leungchopan / Shutterstock.com HONG KONG/LONDON, March 6 (Reuters) – Some shipping companies are discreetly moving operations out of Hong Kong and taking vessels off its flag registry. Others are making contingency plans to do so. Behind these low-profile moves, six shipping executives said, lie concerns that their ships could be commandeered by Chinese authorities or hit with U.S. sanctions in a conflict between Beijing and Washington. Beijing’s emphasis on the role of Hong Kong in serving Chinese security interests and growing U.S. scrutiny of the importance of China’s commercial fleet in a possible military clash, such as over Taiwan, are causing unease across the industry, the people told Reuters. The U.S. Trade Representative’s office last month proposed levying steep U.S. port fees on Chinese shipping companies and others that operate Chinese-built vessels, to counter China’s “targeted dominance” of shipbuilding and maritime logistics. USTR’s $1.5M Port Fee Proposal on Chinese Ships Sparks Industry Confusion Over Critical Definitions Washington in September warned American businesses about growing risks of operating in Hong Kong, where the U.S. already applies sanctions against officials involved in a security crackdown. Hong Kong for more than a century has been a hub for shipowners and the brokers, financiers, underwriters and lawyers supporting them. Its maritime and port industry accounted for 4.2% of GDP in 2022, official data show. The city’s flag is the eighth most-flown by ships worldwide, according to VesselsValue, a subsidiary of maritime data group Veson Nautical. Reuters interviews with two dozen people, including shipping executives, insurers and lawyers familiar with Hong Kong, revealed growing concern that commercial maritime operations could be ensnared by forces beyond their control in a U.S.-China military clash. Many pointed to China’s intensified focus on national security objectives; trade frictions; and the broad powers of Hong Kong’s leader, who is accountable to Beijing, to seize control of shipping in an emergency. “We don’t want to be in a position where China comes knocking, wanting our ships, and the U.S. is targeting us on the other side,” said one executive, who like others was granted anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue. The concerns of shipowners and their actions to curb exposure to Hong Kong have not been previously reported. The perceptions of risk have grown in recent years, coinciding with a tightening security climate in the Chinese-ruled city and tensions between the world’s two largest economies. Commercial ships must be registered, or flagged, with a particular country or jurisdiction to comply with safety and environmental rules. Despite an influx of Chinese-operated ships onto Hong Kong’s registry, the number of oceangoing vessels flagged in the city fell more than 8% to 2,366 in January from 2,580 four years earlier, according to independent analysis by VesselsValue. Government data show a similar drop. Among the ships that left Hong Kong’s registry, 74 re-flagged to Singapore and Marshall Islands in 2023 and 2024, chiefly dry-bulk carriers designed to transport commodities such as coal, iron ore and grain. Some 15 tankers and seven container ships separately left the Hong Kong registry for those flags, according to VesselsValue. The outflow of ships since 2021 marks a reversal for Hong Kong’s registry, which official data show grew roughly 400% in two decades following 1997. In response to Reuters questions, Hong Kong’s government said it was natural for shipping companies to review operations given changing geopolitical and trade circumstances, and normal for the number of ships on registries to fluctuate in the short term. Hong Kong would “continue to excel as a prominent international shipping centre”, a spokesperson said, outlining a range of incentives for shipowners, including profits tax breaks and green subsidies. Neither the laws governing the registry nor emergency provisions empowered Hong Kong’s leader to commandeer ships to serve in a Chinese merchant fleet, the spokesperson said. The spokesperson declined to elaborate when asked about industry players’ concerns over how colonial-era emergency powers might be applied during a U.S.-China conflict. The provisions allow the city’s leader to make “any regulations whatsoever”, including taking control of vessels and property. China’s defence and commerce ministries didn’t respond to questions about the role of a merchant fleet in Beijing’s warfighting plans, the potential involvement of Hong Kong-flagged vessels, and the worries of commercial shipowners. The U.S. Treasury and Pentagon declined to comment about potential sanctions, shipping executives’ concerns, and the role of Hong Kong-registered vessels in a Chinese merchant fleet. Lawyers and executives say ships can be re-flagged for various reasons through sale, charter or redeployment to different routes. Basil Karatzas, U.S.-based consultant with Karatzas Marine Advisors & Co, said Singapore had become the preferred domicile for companies with lesser exposure to Chinese shipping and cargo trade, because it offered many efficiencies, including its legal system, but less risk than Hong Kong. Singapore’s Maritime and Port Authority said decisions about domiciles and flagging were based on commercial considerations. It had not observed any “significant change” in the number of Hong Kong-based shipping companies relocating operations or re-flagging vessels to Singapore. Hong Kong’s shipping registry is widely regarded for its safety and regulatory standards, executives and lawyers say, allowing its ships to pass easily through foreign ports. Hong Kong’s flag is now flown by many of China’s state-owned international vessels. In a conflict, these tankers, bulk carriers and large container vessels would form the backbone of a merchant fleet serving the People’s Liberation Army to supply China’s oil, food and industrial needs, according to four security analysts and PLA military studies. By contrast, the U.S. has a small commercial shipbuilding industry and far fewer ships under its flag. While China’s state-owned fleet is growing in size, it would be a target for the U.S. in a military clash, and Beijing would likely require other vessels to ensure supplies given its vast needs and reliance on international sea lanes, three analysts said. Strategic maritime operations have surfaced on President Donald Trump’s radar. In his inauguration speech in January, Trump threatened to “take back” the Panama Canal, which he said had fallen under Chinese control. He did not give specifics, but Trump’s remarks focused attention on two Panama ports operated by a subsidiary of Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings 0001.HK. The group, which didn’t respond to questions about Trump’s comments, agreed this week to sell a majority stake in the subsidiary to a consortium of investors led by BlackRock BLK.N, giving U.S. interests control over the ports. Trump told Congress on Tuesday that his administration will create an office of shipbuilding in the White House and offer new tax incentives for the sector. A U.S. congressional study in November 2023 stated that “cargo ships typically transport 90% of the military equipment needed in overseas wars”. It noted that Chinese shipyards had 1,794 large oceangoing ships on order in 2022, compared with five in the U.S. Merchant vessels were vital in Britain’s long-range mission to retake the Falkland Islands from Argentina in 1982. And UK-flagged commercial ships operating out of Hong Kong – many owned by local firms dependent on or controlled by China – supplied communist Hanoi during the Vietnam War, frustrating the U.S., declassified CIA documents show. The need for a strong Chinese merchant fleet to help build China’s maritime power was outlined by President Xi Jinping in a Politburo study session in 2013. Over the last decade, Chinese government and military documents and studies have highlighted the dual-use military value of China’s merchant ships. Regulations enacted in 2015 required Chinese builders of five types of commercial vessels – including tankers, container ships and bulk carriers – to ensure they could serve military needs, according to state media. Since then, the state-owned COSCO line has grown significantly. Public COSCO documents show China is placing political commissars – officers who ensure Communist Party goals are ultimately served – on nominally civilian ships. In January, the U.S. blacklisted COSCO subsidiaries for what it said were links to the Chinese military. COSCO did not respond to questions about its deployment of commissars, the U.S. restrictions and what role the company’s ships, including Hong Kong-flagged ones, might play in a wartime scenario. Hong Kong remains an important base for shipowners, despite the geopolitical challenges. But some are quietly hedging their bets. One company founded in Hong Kong in 2014, London-listed Taylor Maritime TMI.L, now has a smaller presence in Hong Kong after making several strategic moves over the past few years. Since 2021, it has kept its ships flagged in the Marshall Islands and Singapore. Its offices are in London, Guernsey, Singapore, Hong Kong and Durban. The firm “really de-risked Hong Kong”, said a person familiar with the matter, citing investors’ concerns about a Chinese invasion of Taiwan and the Communist Party’s increasing control of Hong Kong. A Taylor Maritime spokesperson said that initially, the company moved its Asia-based commercial teams to Singapore from Hong Kong to be closer to clients. With its acquisition of shipping company Grindrod, which had its Asia office in Singapore, Taylor Maritime expanded its operation there and relocated some functions from Hong Kong, to the point where Singapore became its primary Asia hub, the spokesperson added. Hong Kong-listed Pacific Basin Shipping 2343.HK has traditionally flagged its 110-strong fleet of bulk carriers in Hong Kong but is drafting contingency plans to register them elsewhere as it gauges potential risks, said two people familiar with the matter. A Pacific Basin spokesperson said the company was constantly evaluating geopolitical risks but that its fleet was still flying the Hong Kong flag, “which at least for now outweigh(s) the challenges”. “Being in Hong Kong positions us close to China’s 40% share of global dry bulk import/export activity and close to Asia’s strong economic and industrial growth regions,” the spokesperson said. Angad Banga, chairman of the Hong Kong Shipowners Association, said shipping firms adjusted contingency plans based on risk assessments in a complex geopolitical environment but he had not encountered concerns about the commandeering of vessels. “While some may be reviewing operational strategies, we as an organisation do not to see any widespread exodus or loss of confidence in Hong Kong,” Banga told Reuters, adding that the city remained attractive for maritime commerce. Yet some industry figures described a broad unease about Hong Kong that was affecting their planning. Three lawyers said that until recent years, contracts hammered out for the growing number of ships built in China and financed by Chinese banks typically stipulated that they must fly the Hong Kong flag. But over the last two years, some have included a caveat demanded by owners to provide flexibility: a few other prominent flags are listed as options alongside Hong Kong, the lawyers said. Reuters could not independently verify the changes. Beyond China’s military modernisation and its refusal to renounce the use of force to seize Taiwan, Beijing officials have stressed the importance of Hong Kong in fulfilling national security priorities. Three executives and two lawyers told Reuters that sweeping security legislation, first imposed on Hong Kong in July 2020 and strengthened in March 2024, had added to the dangers. The lawyers said any move by Hong Kong’s leader to commandeer vessels in an emergency might prove difficult in practice, as locally registered ships often plied routes far from Hong Kong. But such long-standing powers now had to be viewed through a national security lens, they said. Some shipowners wouldn’t object to an official request to turn over their vessels, either out of patriotism or the potential to profit from a crisis, one lawyer said. But “it is better not to be in a position where you might even be asked”, said another veteran lawyer. “It was not an issue just a few years ago, in what is clearly a redrawn national security map.” (Reporting by Greg Torode and Jonathan Saul; additional reporting by Andrea Shalal and Idrees Ali in Washington, and the Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong newsrooms; editing by David Crawshaw) (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2025.

Title: As Trump Hails Taking Back of Panama Canal, Hong Kong Inc Walks Tightrope

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio tours the Miraflores locks at the Panama Canal in Panama City, Feb. 2, 2025. Mark Schiefelbein/Pool via REUTERS HONG KONG, March 6 (Reuters) – Hong Kong‘s edge as a financial hub will erode further as the city becomes embroiled in China-U.S. tensions, with the flash sale of a Hong Kong-owned global ports business highlighting geopolitical volatility, executives and analysts said. The former British colony is caught in the eye of a storm between Beijing and Washington, underlined by the decision by conglomerate CK Hutchison, controlled by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, to sell its ports network, including assets along the Panama Canal, to a U.S. consortium led by BlackRock. U.S. President Donald Trump, who claimed in January that the Panama Canal was being operated by a Chinese company, has hailed the deal. “The Trump administration is going to see that this worked…and you have to assume they’re going to follow the same play book…(they) see this as a victory,” Steven Okun, a senior adviser to financial and risk advisory Kroll, told Reuters. As the U.S. strives to contain its main global rival China on fronts including trade, shipping, technology and capital raising, a dozen business people, investors, lawyers, shipping executives and risk analysts who spoke to Reuters say this is bringing greater uncertainty and volatility to Hong Kong. Hong Kong firms have traditionally been seen as internationally-focused and independent of the Chinese state, reflecting the role of the former British colony as a freewheeling financial hub. “We have been constantly reviewing our business plan and discussing about our strategy because of the political tension,” said an executive of a listed Hong Kong company who declined to be named given the sensitivity of the topic. “For example, do we still want to list our units in Hong Kong and is Hong Kong still attractive as a listing venue, because investors could draw a China connection,” he told Reuters. Hong Kong has a separate rule of law from China and its own financial policy-making autonomy, but some lawyers, diplomats and business executives say that after China’s imposition of a national security law in 2020, the city was essentially being viewed by the West as fully under the control of Beijing. This has hurt it economically and cast doubt on whether it is a jurisdiction separate from mainland China with global best practices, they said. Earlier this year, Hong Kong’s Far East Consortium and Chow Tai Fook Enterprise, which owns a development with Star Entertainment, the embattled casino group in Brisbane, tried to buy Star out. If successful, the bid will be another test of regulators who view Hong Kong companies as Chinese. In 2018, Australia blocked a A$13 billion ($8.2 billion) takeover of the country’s biggest gas pipeline company, APA Group APA.AX, by CK Infrastructure, a unit of CK Hutchison, citing it would be against the national interest. “Hong Kong is being increasingly lumped in with China … that’s a fact,” said a board member of a leading Hong Kong business family with interests locally and overseas, including retail and property. “To a degree, this has raised the complexity and cost in our business dealings. We have to live with this.” According to a person with knowledge of the matter, CK Hutchison had initially tried to fight to keep its two main port businesses in Panama after Trump alleged the Panama Canal was under Chinese control. But later, Hutchison opted to cash out and mitigate longer term reputational risks. “People in the Hutch empire are running for cover,” said the person with knowledge of the ports negotiations, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue. “This is a nightmare situation and we’ve never dealt with anything like this before.” This source added that CK Hutchison executives were in touch with officials in Beijing while the situation unfolded. CK Hutchison did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Co-managing director Frank Sixt said in a statement this week the ports transaction was “unrelated to recent political news reports.” The Hong Kong government has said it has never interfered with the commercial operations of Hong Kong companies, and criticized U.S. officials for making what it said were unreasonable and distorted accusations regarding the operation of the Panama Canal. “It’s been politicized and weaponised,” a senior Chinese government official said of the Trump administration’s framing of Hutchison as a Chinese entity – something the firm has denied. “It’s unfortunate and regrettable,” the official told Reuters, declining to be identified. Others, including business executives and lawyers, agreed that Hong Kong is increasingly being viewed as similar to other Chinese cities, even though officials like the territory’s financial secretary, Paul Chan, say the city remains a global hub for the free flow of capital, goods and people. “The market is based on expectations,” said Vera Yuen, an economics lecturer with the University of Hong Kong business school. “The valuation (of Hong Kong) is based on what they (the world) think, not what you claim.” Even ahead of the recent Trump administration pressure on Hutchison’s Panama ports, some local firms with international reach had been drawing up contingency plans to deal with growing U.S.-China strategic rivalry – and a growing sense Hong Kong would be in the crosshairs in a conflict. In 2023, Hong Kong-based conglomerate Swire Pacific sold its Swire Coca-Cola USA unit to its controlling shareholder, John Swire & Sons Ltd headquartered in the U.K., to protect the business so that it would no longer be seen as being held by a “Chinese company,” two sources with knowledge of the matter said. A Hong Kong shipping firm executive described how his operation was already presenting its international posture in meetings with foreign investors. “The key is being as international as we can – our offices, domiciles and ships,” the executive said. “We want to be able to show we are not really based anywhere.” ($1 = 1.5780 Australian dollars) (Additional reporting by Greg Torode and Jessie Pang in Hong Kong; Scott Murdoch in Sydney and Beijing Newsroom; Writing by James Pomfret; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan) (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2025.

This group brings together the best thinkers on energy and climate. Join us for smart, insightful posts and conversations about where the energy industry is and where it is going. Video Llewellyn King is the creator, executive producer and host of “White House Chronicle,” a weekly news and public affairs program, airing nationwide on PBS and public, educational and government... Video recording of the session at the bottom of this post, along with open Q&A discussion from the session taking place actively on the Energy Central Community: Lee Zeldin, new Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, has said, “It’s important for us urgently to do everything in our power to make sure Americans have the cleanest air, land, and water. That’s something that keeps me up at night." Environmentalists and many in the energy sector believe the Trump administration is doing just the opposite. It has taken aim at a raft of laws and regulations which protect the environment, including the National Environmental Policy Act, bulwark of a vast structure of environmental laws and protections since it was signed into law by President Nixon in 1970. There is alarm in the utility industry about the administration’s antipathy to wind generation. Its enthusiasm for coal alarms clean air advocates who see it as a step backward. There also is alarm about the future of transitional funding guaranteed during the Biden administration, under the Inflation Reduction Act, to enhance clean energy and finance transition from polluting fuels to green ones. That funding is frozen and the Department of Government Efficiency operatives have slashed employment in the Department of Energy’s loan office. What now? The rural electric cooperatives are worried about $9 billion in financing they were to get from the Department of Agriculture for rural electrification projects. Lesser laws like the Endangered Species Act, it is feared by their defenders, may be repealed or circumvented. The United States Energy Association at its most recent virtual press briefing, conducted on March 5, examined what to expect from the Trump administration in its reshaping of environmental policy, and the nature and scope of the legal opposition. Court challenges have already been filed and many more are expected. As usual, a panel of experts were questioned by a panel of senior journalists who cover energy and the environment. Journalist Llewellyn King organized and moderated the press briefings, which are broadcast live on Zoom and last an hour. Mark Menezes gave welcoming remarks and was on hand to share his deep knowledge as president and CEO of USEA and as a former deputy secretary of energy. The Experts: The Reporters: Ongoing Q&As Taking Place Post Session on EnergyCentral.com: No discussions yet. Start a discussion below. Last week Congress voted to remove limits to methane emissions. This is in spite of greatly improved infrastructure for monitoring emissions and proving that the value of the emitted methane if often far more than the cost to implement reductions.

Title: Even your weight loss drugs aren't safe from tariffs

Novo Nordisk (NVO), the maker of the popular diabetes and weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, expects at least some short-term impacts from President Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs. “We still have products moving across borders like most global companies,” Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen told Bloomberg on Thursday. “Of course there’ll be some short-term impact as we mitigate the impact of tariffs.” The Denmark-based company’s stock fell nearly 3% Thursday morning following his comments. Jorgensen noted that even when drugmakers manufacture in the U.S., they typically rely on ingredients sourced abroad. He emphasized that generic drugs would be hit the hardest, potentially causing shortages and driving up prices in general. Since taking office, Trump has proposed several tariffs. He announced last month plans to impose tariffs “in the neighborhood of 25%” on imported vehicles, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals starting in April. Meanwhile, 25% tariffs on most imports from Mexico and Canada took effect on Tuesday, and duties on Chinese goods were raised by 10%. Trump also suggested that tariffs on imported goods from the European Union are “coming very soon.” And he recently signed a memorandum that directs his advisers to draft new “fair and reciprocal” trade tariffs on all major U.S. trading partners. Jorgensen’s comments also come as Trump has pushed pharma companies to bring more production to the U.S. as part of his broader effort to boost domestic manufacturing. In February, Trump met with top industry executives, including Eli Lilly (LLY) CEO David Ricks. A week later, Eli Lilly announced plans to invest $27 billion in four new U.S. manufacturing facilities. Pfizer (PFE) CEO Albert Bourla also said this week that the drugmaker could move some of its overseas manufacturing to its U.S. plants, if necessary. Novo Nordisk announced last year that it is investing $4.1 billion to build a new facility in Clayton, North Carolina.

Title: World beginning to tire of whiplash leadership...

Follow: Government by chaos is back. One day, President Donald Trump imposed a punishing tariff regime against Canada and Mexico. The next, he froze auto duties for a month after suddenly realizing that – as everyone had predicted – they could wreck a quintessential American industry. Last week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky came to the Oval Office to sign a rare-earth minerals deal that Trump billed as a triumph for the US. But Zelensky was provoked by Vice President JD Vance and kicked out of the White House. European leaders have spent days trying to fix the debacle. Elon Musk, meanwhile, is taking his chainsaw to the bureaucracy, indiscriminately firing workers and feeding agencies into the wood chipper – pitching citizens and industries who rely on government payments into uncertainty just as the economy softens and is more vulnerable to such shocks. At first, Trump’s early-term energy on multiple fronts was a bolt of energy as he scratched his Sharpie across executive orders and chased away the lethargy that marked President Joe Biden’s waning months in office. Six weeks in, however, as Trump makes gut-check calls to dismantle post-Cold War national security arrangements, the global free trade system, and the federal machine – all of which helped make the US a superpower – a new realization is dawning. There doesn’t seem to be a plan. Trump’s haphazard efforts to make peace in Ukraine, revive Rust Belt-heavy industry with 19th century-style tariffs and slash government are as improvisational as the “weave” – his name for his stream-of-consciousness campaign screeds. And the world is once again left hanging on the “America first” president’s whims and obsessions. “There’s too much unpredictability and chaos coming out of the White House right now,” Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly said Wednesday, describing US trade policy as a “psychodrama” her country can’t go through every 30 days. America’s friends are often left to puzzle over what exactly Trump is trying to do. The president, for instance, said Wednesday that Canada hadn’t done enough to stem the flow of fentanyl over the border – but only minuscule amounts of the drug are involved. Sometimes the White House complains about the flow south of undocumented migrants – but these numbers are also small. Trump also wants manufacturing to leave Canada and move south. No wonder some officials in Ottawa have concluded he’s trying to weaken their country to make it easier to annex. Still, the president can point to some successes with his threat-based foreign policy. For instance, his fury that a Hong Kong-based firm owned two ports at either end of the Panama Canal is precipitating a purchase by US investment giant BlackRock. The president had falsely claimed these ports meant China controlled the vital waterway built by the US, but the change of ownership may still improve the US strategic position. And Trump might be downgrading the transatlantic alliance that has kept world peace for 80 years – but he’s set off an unprecedented rearmament program among NATO allies that other presidents have demanded for years. But just as often, it’s as if Trump is more interested in brute force personal power than working off any long-term playbook. Michael Froman, a former US trade representative who chairs the Council on Foreign Relations, told Jim Sciutto on CNN International Wednesday that while the cost of imposing tariffs often outweighs the benefits, they can be a tool that gets other nations to the negotiating table. This is true in the case of Mexico with which the US has far wider border issues than Canada. But, Froman added, “you have to know what it is you want them to do for that leverage to be useful.” To some extent, the chaos is the point. And the theatrics of a president addicted to stunt politics are key to his political appeal. But allied governments have their own politics to worry about – a factor the Trump administration often seems to ignore. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum – who is, like Trump, new in office and keen to make a mark – said Wednesday that her country could consider alternative trade partners to the United States “if necessary.” On Tuesday, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer pointedly paid tribute in the House of Commons to British soldiers who were killed fighting alongside the United States in Iraq and Afghanistan. This followed a comment by Vance on Fox News that Ukraine needed better security guarantees than undertakings from “some random country that has not fought a war in 30 or 40 years.” The vice president’s remark caused great offensive in Britain. He said on X that claims he’d been talking about Britain and France were “absurdly dishonest,” but those are the only allies who have so far publicly volunteered to take part in a post-peace deal reassurance force in Ukraine. And French President Emmanuel Macron warned his compatriots Wednesday evening the world had changed utterly since Trump returned to the White House, adding that he was considering extending the protection of France’s nuclear arsenal to European allies. For some MAGA supporters, Trump’s genius for enraging Democrats, the media and foreign governments is an end in itself. And for ideologues on the populist nationalist right, sparking pandemonium in Washington and destroying governing agencies is a way of deconstructing the administrative state. Trump’s method was honed in his office high up in the skyscraper that bears his name in Manhattan. The future president learned through his real estate career how to push opponents off balance with outlandish demands, verbal confrontations and sudden switches of position. In government, he does the same thing to disorientate adversaries and seeks to impose power amid the mayhem. But while unpredictability is a real estate superpower, it’s a liability when running a country, an economy and a planet – where continuity and predictability are preferred. “It’s just constant, and it’s exhausting,” said Julian Vikan Karaguesian, a former Canadian Ministry of Finance official, referring to Trump’s scorched-earth tariff offensive. “It’s almost surreal. Is it real? Is it going to be real this time?” Karaguesian, who now lectures at McGill University in Montreal, added: “Maybe the modus operandi here is uncertainty. It’s not tariffs, it’s not anything else, but intentionally creating a sense of chaos and a sense of uncertainty.” The auto tariffs that the president froze for a month on Wednesday, a day after imposing blanket 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, shows how he sometimes has second thoughts about his own aggression. Perhaps his favorite barometer, the stock market, forced his hand. His concession reversed two days of steep losses on the Dow Jones Industrial Average with a handy near-500-point rebound. CNN reported Wednesday that Trump relented after conversations with the CEOs of the Big Three automakers. And his press secretary Karoline Leavitt said he was open to “hearing about additional exemptions.” The idea that well-placed CEOs can use their access to the powerful to acquire exemptions and special favors not available to ordinary Americans is the antithesis of an equitable economy. But then Trump has shown little respect for rules-based systems that eliminate the kind of patronage and potential for corruption that thrives in autocratic societies. Trump’s approach may also mean he likes threatening tariffs more than imposing them. But by constantly threatening tariffs and then creating doubt about whether or when they will be maintained, the president is causing huge uncertainty for businesses that need to establish certainty of costs and supply and consumers who could damage an already-softening economy if they rein in spending. “There’s so much uncertainty about what the administration is doing that the mere prospect of tariffs is creating a big anchor on the economy,” Bharat Ramamurti, former deputy director of Biden’s National Economic Council, told reporters on a conference call Monday. “The prospect of significant tariffs on our allies has resulted in withholding investments and preemptive price increases that are going to be borne by small businesses and, ultimately, by consumers.” Trump’s relentless bullying of America’s friends – while seemingly doing everything he can to advance its traditional adversary Russia in Ukraine – may also drain US power in the long run. “What we have seen this week is that the dollar has suffered a very sharp decline,” Ruchir Sharma, founder and chief investment officer of Breakout Capital, told Richard Quest on CNN International. “It’s revealing that the rest of the world is getting its act together … and I think investors are beginning to notice there are other countries worth investing in, given all this policy volatility that is emerging in the US,” he said. The danger for the US therefore is that four more years of Trump’s antics could reshape the globe – in a way that does not comply with his vision of US dominance but leaves Americans looking in from the outside. Mexico and Canada, for instance, can’t change the geography that makes it a no-brainer to trade with the mighty US. But both also may see advantages in expanding trade and investment with America’s rising rival China. And the European Union, which is expecting its own barrage of Trump tariffs soon, may examine similar horizons. America’s Western allies have too much invested in generations with ties with Washington to want it to fail. But they have their own national interests too. Canada can’t win a trade war against its more powerful neighbor. But its patience is thin over Trump’s brinkmanship and bullying. Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, home to Canada’s largest provincial economy, says the only way forward is for Trump to eradicate all tariffs rather than an a la carte easing of duties industry by industry, as with autos. “All this gives us is uncertainty again,” Ford told CNN’s Phil Mattingly on Wednesday. “There is one person that’s causing that problem today: that’s President Trump.” © 2025 Cable News Network.

Title: What Happens in a Recession?

A Wealth of Common Sense Posted March 6, 2025 by Ben Carlson A reader asks: I’ve seen some pundits (*cough* Chamath *cough*) now shifting their stance to “short-term pain for long-term gain” from all of the political upheaval we’re seeing. Basically the idea is a recession will actually be useful because home prices, stock prices and interest rates will go down. I think this is nuts but wanted to hear your take — are there any positives from a recession? In just a few short months we’ve gone from worries about an economy that could be at risk of overheating to worries about the economy slowing dramatically. GDP estimates for Q1 have gone from nearly +4% a month ago to -2.8% in a hurry: These estimates are not set in stone, but economic activity is slowing. One thing we’ve learned these past few years is that no one is good at predicting the timing of recessions, but that doesn’t stop people from speculating about the potential ramifications of an economic contraction when it finally arrives. Here’s what Chamath had to say on Twitter about the prospect of Trump’s no policies potentially throwing the country into a recession: It’s a long one so allow me to summarize: A significant percentage of the country doesn’t own much in the way of financial assets like stocks or a house. If we have a recession that should bring stock prices and housing prices down which would make them more accessible to more people. He’s looking for a silver lining. I get that. I’m a glass-is-half-full guy too. This sounds great in theory. Plenty of young people would like more affordable home prices and a better entry point into the stock market. A recession would also likely mean lower borrowing costs so mortgage rates would be lower. What’s not to like? Since 1950, there have been nine bear markets. The average drawdown in those bear markets was a loss of 35.5%, lasting 406 days from peak to trough. The ability to buy stocks on sale should be a welcomed development for young people or anyone who will be a net saver in the years ahead. The problem is you don’t get to experience recessions in a vacuum. People lose their jobs. Businesses cut back or go belly up. People spend less money. It’s harder to find new employment or get a promotion. Wages fall. Big raises go away. During the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath there was a constant drumbeat of: You’re lucky to even have a job. You want a raise. In this economy?! That lasted for years after the technical recession had ended. A lot of finance people look at recessions through the lens of spreadsheets and charts. I’m guilty of this too. But the human toll from a recession cannot be overstated. Ronald Reagan once said, “A recession is when your neighbor loses their job. A depression is when you lose yours.” Be careful what you wish for. JP Morgan once said, “In bear markets, stocks return to their rightful owners.” Some interpret that as a behavioral lesson where only those investors with enough intestinal fortitude to lean into the pain will buy when stocks are on sale. There is some truth to that. However, those “asset-light” individuals will struggle to pay their bills or keep their jobs during a recession because they have no support from financial assets. Who do you think is going to lean into the pain and buy? The people who buy will be the ones who already have the money. The top 10% of households by wealth own nearly 90% of the stocks in the United States. They’re the ones who can keep buying in a downturn. Right or wrong, those are the rightful owners JP Morgan was referring to. I also hate to be the bearer of bad news to prospective homebuyers but there is no guarantee that housing prices will fall, even if we go into a recession. This is housing price performance during every recession going back to 1960: There was a brief decline in the 1990 recession and of course the Great Financial Crisis saw housing prices get walloped. Other than that, housing prices have been among the best hedges against a recession. If the economy contracts, we may see some relief in mortgage rates. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean housing prices will drop. In fact, lower rates could actually drive more demand for homes, especially since activity has been sluggish with 7% mortgage rates. While increased market activity would be a positive development, it wouldn’t automatically lead to lower prices. It would be a good thing to see more activity in the housing market but that might actually lead to higher prices. Personally, I would rather we don’t have a recession. Job loss is painful. It can set people back years of their lives. However, you also have to recognize that you have no control over the reason for a recession–whether it be a financial crisis, pandemic, government policy, inflation or something else. Whatever your station is in life you have to be prepared for a national or personal recession at some point: Recessions can be a good thing for certain individuals and businesses. There have been a handful of great businesses founded during periods of economic pain — Airbnb, Uber, FedEx, Microsoft and LinkedIn to name a few. But I’m not going to sit here and tell you to hope for a recession. Recessions are bad and we should avoid them if possible. The drawbacks far outweigh the benefits.

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: The rocky week on Wall Street continued on Thursday as investors grappled with further uncertainty from President Donald Trump’s tariffs. US stocks opened sharply lower but fluctuated on the mixed messaging coming from the White House. All three major indexes closed lower, despite Trump announcing a nearly one-month tariff delay on all products from Mexico and Canada that are covered by the USMCA free trade treaty. Earlier in the day, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC that the president would likely announce a one-month tariff delay on products that are covered by the USMCA. The Dow closed lower by 428 points, or 0.99%. The broader S&P 500 fell 1.78% and the Nasdaq Composite slid 2.61%. The Nasdaq closed in correction territory, down 10% from its record high in December. That leaves the Dow down almost 3% on the week, on track for its worst week since March 2023. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are both on pace for their worst week since September 2024. The market is in the red during Trump’s presidency in part because of the uncertainty the administration’s trade policy has caused. The Nasdaq has fallen more than 7% since Trump took office, and the S&P 500 is down more than 4%. Investor sentiment is struggling due to the persistent uncertainty around tariffs, according to Rob Haworth, a senior investment strategist at US Bank Wealth Management. “Eventually, that uncertainty is just going to weigh too much on business decisions and those forward prospects for earnings growth,” Haworth said. Also in focus for investors: recent data revealing the extent of recent layoffs and renewed concerns about spending on artificial intelligence. Futures tied to the Dow had tumbled in early trading as new economic data showed unease in the labor market. US-based employers last month announced plans to slash 172,017 jobs, a 103% increase from January and the highest February total since 2009, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas’s latest monthly job cuts report. Related article US employers cut more jobs last month than any February since 2009 Futures tied to the Nasdaq 100 also fell in early trading as companies focused on the AI trade posted mixed earnings results and guidance for this year. Marvell Technologies (MRVL), a chipmaker, fell by almost 20%. Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR) also slid, dragging the Nasdaq lower. Chinese tech giant Alibaba on Thursday announced its own AI model, challenging upstart DeepSeek as well as OpenAI, raising questions about whether the AI boom in the US is worth the money that is being poured into it. Thursday’s decline is a reversal of the rally on Wednesday afternoon, highlighting that investors lack clarity and confidence about the next developments in the brewing trade war between the US and its biggest trading partners. “For now, tariff-induced inflation amid slower growth could bring the economy dangerously close to stagflation,” said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL financial, in a note Wednesday. The US dollar index, which measures the dollar’s strength relative to six other currencies, fell to its lowest level since November — signaling a weakening outlook for US economic growth. Investors will be closely attuned to the government’s monthly jobs report Friday, set to be released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics at 8:30 a.m. ET. and giving investors more insight into how the economy is doing. “I think if we see the hard data start to come in much weaker, that’ll become more and more concerning for the market,” said Haworth. “Extreme fear” has been the sentiment driving investors for the past week, according to CNN’s Fear and Greed Index.

The dollar index is having a positive effect on BTC. In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin [BTC] has seen a gradual price increase, crossing back into the $90,000 region. It was around $92,500 as of this writing, following a 6.12% gain. This recent accumulation is driven by the Dollar Index losing strength and investors gradually building buying momentum. If sentiment continues to grow, the asset is likely to see a major push to the upside and cross above the $100,000 region. There has been a decline in the U.S. Dollar Index [DXY], which measures the strength of the dollar against a basket of six commodities. Historically, a weakening dollar index tends to benefit cryptocurrencies like BTC and altcoins. In the last two market cycles—2017 and 2021—BTC gained ground and saw major market moves following a decline in the dollar index. A similar trend was observed with altcoins, which experienced significant gains, as seen in the chart below. Source: X If key levels hold as indicated and the DXY chart follows the pattern of the past two cycles, the cryptocurrency market, particularly BTC, could gain an edge for an upswing. The amount of Bitcoin sold in the spot market over the past 24 hours has begun to decline. As of the time of writing, BTC sales totaled $163.54 million on the 5th of March but have since dropped to $87.12 million. If this trend continues, it is more likely that investors will begin accumulating again, leading to increased exchange net inflows. Similarly, the fund market premium—which measures whether investors are buying or selling based on whether it is above or below zero—was at 0.2 at press time, indicating buying activity. Source: CryptoQuant However, a closer look at the chart shows that the fund market premium has remained at a similar level since March began, moving along a steady line. This suggests that investors are likely accumulating BTC in anticipation of a major upward move. After days of consistent market outflows from the Bitcoin exchange-traded funds [ETF] market—indicating institutional investors are selling BTC—the sentiment is shifting. BlackRock, a notable institutional investor with over $50 billion in BTC ETF via IBIT, has stopped selling. When selling slows or halts, it often signals that investors are reassessing their positions and may soon resume buying, especially in a bullish environment. At the time of writing, BTC ETFs recorded an inflow of $22 million in the past 24 hours, indicating renewed interest among institutional investors.

It is sustained by the pursuit of what Michael Lewis once called the “new new thing.” The Internet, the smartphone, social media: the new new thing cannot be a modest tweak at the edges. It has to transform the human race. The economic incentives are clear: a firm that popularizes a paradigm-shattering invention can make a lot of money. But there is also something larger at stake. If Silicon Valley doesn’t keep delivering new new things, it loses its privileged status as the place where the future is made. In 2022 the industry was having a bad year. After a lucrative pandemic—the five most valuable tech companies added more than $2.6 trillion to their combined market capitalization in 2020 and nearly the same amount in 2021—the sector suffered one of its sharpest-ever contractions. Amazon lost almost half of its value, Meta close to two thirds. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 33 percent, its worst performance since the 2008 financial crisis. The reasons were straightforward enough. At the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates to zero, and people stayed home, where they spent more time and money online. By 2022 both trends were in reverse. Most Americans had decided to stop worrying about the virus and were happily resuming their offline activities. Meanwhile the Fed began hiking interest rates in response to rising inflation. It would be a mistake to overstate the severity of the “tech downturn” that followed. Despite mass layoffs and declining revenue, the big firms remained larger and more profitable than they had been before the pandemic. Nonetheless a certain malaise had set in. The industry needed a dazzling new invention that could attract billions of consumers and send capital markets into a froth. One candidate was Web3, a proposal for rebuilding the Internet around blockchain, the accounting technology underlying Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Championed in particular by venture capitalists, who hoped that it would enrich them by empowering a new generation of start-ups to unseat the big firms, Web3 never proved useful for anything except speculation, and even the speculators got soaked as various schemes imploded under the pressure of high interest rates. Another possibility was the metaverse, Mark Zuckerberg’s dream of an immersive Internet experienced through a VR headset. It, too, struggled to demonstrate any practical advantage. Worse, it was unpleasant: a glitchy simulacrum of a postapocalyptic shopping mall as designed by David Lynch, where fish-eyed avatars with no legs floated through sparsely populated cartoon worlds. Then, on November 30, 2022, OpenAI released ChatGPT. A powerful AI system paired with an affable conversational interface, it let anyone ask a question and get an impressively humanoid (though not always correct) response. By January 2023 the chatbot had amassed 100 million users, making it the fastest-growing Web application ever. It was storybook Silicon Valley: OpenAI, which at the time had only a few hundred employees, caught everyone by surprise and, virtually overnight, established “generative AI”—the category of software to which ChatGPT belongs—as the new master concept of the entire industry. The tech giants rushed to respond, setting off a stampede. Everything from search engines to e-mail clients began sprouting generative AI features. In 2023 the Nasdaq climbed 55 percent, its best performance since 1999. The new new thing had been found. It’s too soon to know whether generative AI will prove to be a pot of gold or a blast of hot air. Opinions are divided. Some companies have done fabulously well: Nvidia, the boom’s breakout star, is raking it in, since its chips are the basic infrastructure on which generative AI is built. The cloud divisions of Microsoft, Google, and Amazon have also grown considerably, which their executives attribute to increased demand for AI services. But these are, in the parlance of the financial press, “picks and shovels” plays. Nobody doubts that there is money to be made from selling companies the paraphernalia they need to use generative AI. The real question is whether generative AI helps those companies make any money themselves. Skeptics point out that the high cost of creating and running generative AI software is a potential obstacle. This negates the traditional advantage of digital technology: its low marginal costs. Starting an online bookstore worked for Amazon because it was cheaper than going the brick-and-mortar route, as Jim Covello, head of global equity research at Goldman Sachs, noted in a June 2024 report. AI, by contrast, is not cheap—which means “AI applications must solve extremely complex and important problems for enterprises to earn an appropriate return on investment.” Covello, for one, doubts that they will. Yet companies, like people, are not entirely rational. When a firm decides to adopt a new technology, it rarely does so on the basis of economic considerations alone. “Such decisions are more often than not grounded upon hunches, faith, ego, delight, and deals,” observes the historian David Noble. Looking at American factories after World War II, Noble identified a number of reasons for their shift to “numerical control” technology: a “fascination with automation,” a devotion to the idea of technological progress, an urge to be associated with the prestige of the cutting edge, and a “fear of falling behind the competition,” among others.1 Advertisement Noble does, however, put special emphasis on one motivation that is at least partly rooted in economic rationality: labor discipline. By mechanizing the production process, managers could more fully master the workers within it. The philosopher Matteo Pasquinelli takes a similar view in his recent book The Eye of the Master: A Social History of Artificial Intelligence. In the introduction, Pasquinelli, a professor at the Ca’ Foscari University of Venice, explains that he won’t be offering a “linear history of mathematical achievements.” Rather, he wants to provide a “social genealogy” that treats AI not merely as a technological pursuit but “as a vision of the world.” The centerpiece of this vision is the automation—and domination—of labor. Contemporary AI is best understood, he believes, as the latest in a long line of efforts to increase the power of the boss. In The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith famously argued that the manufacture of pins could be made more efficient through the division of labor. Instead of having a single pinmaker do everything, you could break the job down into several distinct tasks and distribute them to make pins more quickly. This is the canonical principle of capitalist production and the one that automation epitomizes and enforces. First you make work more mechanical, then you delegate it to machines. An important popularizer of this principle was Charles Babbage, a central figure in Pasquinelli’s book. Originally a mathematician, Babbage became what we would now call a “thought leader” among the nineteenth-century British bourgeoisie. Today he is better known as one of the inventors of the computer. His work on computation began with the observation that the division of labor could be “applied with equal success to mental as to mechanical operations,” as he stated in an influential 1832 treatise. The same method of industrial management then remolding the British worker could be transported outside of the factory and applied to a very different kind of labor, Babbage believed: mathematical calculation. He took inspiration from Gaspard de Prony, a French mathematician who came up with a scheme for streamlining the creation of logarithmic tables by reducing most of the work to a series of simple additions and subtractions. In de Prony’s arrangement, a handful of experts and managers planned the job and did the more difficult calculations while an army of menial number crunchers did lots of basic arithmetic. If the poor grunts at the bottom of this pyramid were basically automatons, why not automate them? In the factory the division of labor went hand in hand with automation. In fact, according to Babbage, it was precisely the simplification of the labor process that made it possible to introduce machinery. “When each process has been reduced to the use of some simple tool,” he wrote, “the union of all these tools, actuated by one moving power, constitutes a machine.” In 1819 he began designing what he called the Difference Engine, which automated the labor of arithmetic with three rotating cylinders and was powered by a steam engine. Babbage’s ambition was enormous. He wanted to “establish the business of calculation at an industrial scale,” Pasquinelli writes, by harnessing the same energy source that was revolutionizing British industry. The mass production of error-free logarithmic tables would also make for a profitable business, because such tables allowed the United Kingdom’s formidable mercantile and military fleets to determine their position at sea. The British government, recognizing the economic and geopolitical value of Babbage’s venture, provided funding. The investment failed. Babbage managed to construct a small prototype, but the full design proved too complicated to implement. In 1842 the government pulled its support, by which point Babbage had begun dreaming of an even less buildable machine: the Analytical Engine. Designed with the help of the mathematician Ada Lovelace, this extraordinary mechanism would have been the first general-purpose computer, able to be programmed to perform any calculation. Thus, amid the smog and soot of Victorian England, the idea of software was born. The division of labor was never just about efficiency; it was also about control. By fragmenting craft production—picture a shoemaker making a pair of shoes—into a set of modular routines, the division of labor eliminated the autonomy of the artisan. Now management brought workers together under a single roof, which meant they could be told what to do and watched while they did it. Advertisement Pasquinelli believes that Babbage’s engines, originating as they did in a “project to mechanize the division of mental labor,” were driven by the same managerial imperatives. They were, he writes, “an implementation of the analytical eye of the factory’s master,” a sort of mechanical representation of the watchful, despotic boss. Pasquinelli goes so far as to call them “cousins” of Jeremy Bentham’s notorious panopticon. But these imperatives presumably remained latent, since the gadgets never worked as designed. Babbage tried to use mechanical gears to represent decimal numbers, which meant he struggled with the problem of how to automate the “carryover”—the process whereby one column resets to zero and the next column increases by one—when a digit reaches 10. It would take the simplifications of the binary system, the invention of electronics, and the many advances bankrolled by the ample military budgets of World War II to make automatic computation finally feasible in the 1940s. By then capitalism had become a more international affair, which made the matter of managing workers more complicated. “The more the division of labor extended into a globalized world,” Pasquinelli writes, “the more troublesome its management became,” as “the ‘intelligence’ of the factory’s master could no longer survey the entire production process in a single glance.” Thus, he contends, the need for “infrastructures of communication” that “could achieve this role of supervision and quantification.” The modern computer, in the decades following its arrival in the 1940s, helped satisfy this need. Computers extended the “eye of the master” across space, Pasquinelli argues, enabling capitalists to coordinate the increasingly cumbersome logistics of industrial production. If Babbage had wanted to construct a prosthesis with which to project managerial power, as Pasquinelli suggests, then computation’s triumph in the twentieth century as the indispensable instrument of capitalist globalization should be understood as a fulfillment of the technology’s founding spirit. Moreover, this spirit appears to have intensified as computers continued to evolve. “Since the end of the twentieth century,” Pasquinelli writes, the management of labor has turned all of society into a “digital factory” and has taken the form of the software of search engines, online maps, messaging apps, social networks, gig-economy platforms, mobility services, and ultimately AI algorithms. AI, he concludes, is accelerating this transformation. There is no doubt that computers are often used to the advantage of employers, from the scheduling software that reduces labor costs by saddling retail and restaurant workers with unpredictable schedules to the several species of “bossware” that enable the remote surveillance and supervision of office employees, Uber drivers, and long-haul truckers. But to argue that such uses are the raison d’être of digital technology, as Pasquinelli seems to, is to overstate the case. Labor discipline is one use to which computers can be put; there are many others. And it was not central to the technology’s development: the core innovations of computing arose in response to military prerogatives, not economic ones. The desires to crack enemy cryptography, calculate the correct angles for aiming artillery, and perform the math necessary for making the hydrogen bomb were a few of the motivations for building computers in the 1940s. The US government became infatuated with the technology and spent millions on research and procurement in the subsequent decades. Computers would prove integral to a variety of imperial pursuits, from assembling intercontinental missiles capable of (precisely) incinerating millions of Soviets to storing and analyzing intercepts sourced from listening stations around the world. American corporations followed behind, adapting the contraptions cooked up by the security state to various commercial ends. Still, if Pasquinelli’s claims do not always convince, there is much to learn from the material he presents. Publishers have inundated readers with books about AI in recent years—enough to fill a small bookstore.2 Most have an undercooked quality. The Eye of the Master is, if anything, overcooked: there is an enormous amount of thinking compressed into its pages. Pasquinelli’s omnivorous intellect often mesmerizes. Nonetheless, I sometimes found myself wishing he would slow down to scaffold his provocations with more evidence. The fact that Babbage drew from the playbook of industrial management in designing his protocomputers is an interesting piece of history. But its relevance to later developments, or even just its resonance with them, can be determined only by looking closely at how computers actually transformed work in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, which Pasquinelli does not do. Instead he takes a sharp turn halfway through the book, pivoting from nineteenth-century industrial Britain to the early AI researchers of mid-twentieth-century America, focusing in particular on the field’s “connectionist” school. Connectionism, as Pasquinelli notes, departed in significant ways from the automatic computation of Babbage. For Babbage the soul of the computer was the algorithm, a step-by-step procedure that traditionally makes up the principal ingredient of a computer program. When Alan Turing, John von Neumann, and others created the modern computer in the twentieth century, what they created was a device for executing algorithms. The programmer writes a set of rules for transforming an input into an output, and the computer obeys. This ethos also guided “symbolic AI,” the philosophy that came to dominate the first generation of AI research. Its adherents believed that by programming a computer to follow a series of rules they could turn a machine into a mind. This method had its limits. Formalizing an activity as a logical sequence works fine if the activity is relatively simple. As it becomes more complex, however, hard-coded instructions are less useful. I could give you an exact set of directions for driving from my house to yours, but I couldn’t use the same technique to tell you how to drive. An alternative approach emerged from cybernetics, a postwar intellectual movement with extremely eclectic interests. Among these was the aspiration to create automata with the adaptability of living things. “Rather than imitating the rules of human reasoning,” Pasquinelli writes, the cyberneticians “aimed at imitating the rules by which organisms organize themselves and adapt to the environment.” These efforts led to the invention of the artificial neural network, a data-processing architecture loosely modeled on the brain. By using such networks to perceive patterns in data, computers can train themselves in a particular task. A neural network learns to do things not by simplifying a process into a procedure but by observing a process—again and again and again—and drawing statistical relationships across the many examples. One of connectionism’s progenitors was Friedrich Hayek, the subject of Pasquinelli’s most intriguing chapter. Hayek is best known as a leading theorist of neoliberalism, but as a young man he developed an interest in the brain while working in the Zurich lab of the famous neuropathologist Constantin von Monakow. For Hayek the mind was like a market: he saw both as self-organizing entities from which a spontaneous order arises through the decentralized interaction of their components. These ideas would help influence the development of artificial neural networks, which in fact function much like the market mind of the Hayekian imagination. When a psychologist named Frank Rosenblatt implemented the first neural network with the help of a navy grant in 1957, he acknowledged his debt to Hayek. But Hayek also diverged from the cyberneticians in important respects. Cybernetics, as the philosopher Norbert Wiener defined it in his eponymous 1948 book, involved the scientific study of “control and communication in the animal and the machine.” The term, coined by Wiener, was derived from the ancient Greek word for the steersman of a ship, which shares the same root as the word for government. The cyberneticians wanted to create technological systems that could govern themselves—a prospect that appealed to a Pentagon looking for ways to gain a military advantage in the cold war. The navy funded Rosenblatt in the hopes that his neural network could assist in “the automation of target classification,” Pasquinelli explains, by using its powers of pattern recognition to detect enemy vessels. For Hayek, by contrast, connectionism offered a way to think about a system that eluded control. He had a special kind of control in mind: economic planning. In his view, the brainlike complexity and distributed architecture of the market meant that socialism could never work. Thus the need for neoliberal policies that, in the words of the historian Quinn Slobodian, would “encase the unknowable economy,” protecting it from government interference.3 Nonetheless, Hayek and the other connectionists were very much on the same team. Rosenblatt and his colleagues were able to secure funding for their research because the US government believed their ideas could help defeat socialist armies. Hayek was in the business of defeating socialist ideas. At first, connectionism failed to fulfill its promise. By the early 1970s it had fallen out of favor in the AI world. Still, neural networks continued to develop quietly over the subsequent decades, enjoying some breakthroughs in the 1980s and 1990s. Then, in the 2010s, came connectionism’s quantum leap. Training a neural network, as Rosenblatt once pointed out, requires “exposure to a large sample of stimuli.” Size matters: since neural networks learn by studying data, how much they can learn depends in part on the quantity of data available to them. For much of computing’s history, data was expensive to store and difficult to transmit. By the second decade of the twenty-first century, both barriers had dissolved. Plummeting storage costs, combined with the birth and growth of the Web, meant that a mountain of words, photos, and videos was accessible to anyone with an Internet connection. Researchers used this information to train neural networks. The abundance of training data, along with new techniques and more powerful hardware, led to swift progress in fields like natural language processing and computer vision. Today AI based on neural networks is ubiquitous, at work in everything from Siri to self-driving cars to the algorithms that curate social media feeds. Neural networks also underpin generative AI systems like ChatGPT. Such systems are particularly large—meaning they are composed of many layers of neural networks—and their appetite for data is immense. The reason that ChatGPT sounds so lifelike and seems to know so many things about the world is that the “large language model” inside it has been trained on terabytes of text drawn from the Internet, including millions of websites, Wikipedia articles, and full-length books. This is what Pasquinelli means when he writes that the neural networks of contemporary AI are “not a model of the biological brain but of the collective mind,” a social endeavor to which many people have contributed. Not everyone is pleased by this fact. Generative AI’s voraciousness is responsible for what the podcast host Michael Barbaro calls its “original sin”: copyrighted material is among the information ingested. The New York Times has sued OpenAI for copyright infringement; so has the Authors Guild, alongside Jonathan Franzen, George Saunders, and several other writers. While OpenAI and the other major “model creators” do not disclose the details of their training data, OpenAI has conceded that copyrighted works are included—yet maintains that this falls under fair use. Meanwhile the demand for training data keeps growing, compelling tech companies to find new ways of obtaining it. OpenAI, Meta, and others have struck licensing deals with publishers such as Reuters, Axel Springer, and the Associated Press, and they are exploring similar arrangements with Hollywood studios. For Pasquinelli there is a lesson here. Contemporary AI’s reliance on our aggregated contributions proves that intelligence is a “social process by constitution.” It is communal, emergent, diffuse—and thus a perfect match for the connectionist paradigm. “It comes as no surprise that the most successful AI technique, namely artificial neural networks, is the one that can best mirror, and therefore best capture, social cooperation,” he writes. There is a Marxist coloring to this argument: intelligence resides in the creativity of the masses. But it is also an argument that could have been made by the profoundly anti-Marxist Hayek. The old Austrian would be gratified to know that the “intellect” of the most sophisticated software in history is sourced from the unplanned activities of a multitude. He would have been further tickled by the fact that such software is, like his beloved market, fundamentally unknowable. The strangeness at the heart of the generative AI boom is that nobody really knows how the technology works. We know how the large language models within ChatGPT and its counterparts are trained, even if we don’t always know which data they’re being trained on: they are asked to predict the next string of characters in a sequence. But exactly how they arrive at any given prediction is a mystery. The computations that occur inside the model are simply too intricate for any human to comprehend. You can’t just pop the hood and watch the gears click away. In the absence of direct observation, one is left with a more oblique method: interpretation. An entire technical field has sprung up around AI “interpretability” or “explainability,” with the goal of puzzling out how such systems work. Its practitioners across academia and industry talk in scientistic terms, but their endeavor has a devotional quality, not unlike the exegesis of holy texts or of the entrails of freshly sacrificed sheep. There is a limit to how much meaning can be made. Mortals must content themselves with partial truths. If today’s “AI monopolies” represent “the new ‘eye of the master,’” as Pasquinelli believes, it is an eye with a limited field of vision. The factories of Babbage’s day were zones of visibility: by concentrating work and workers, they put the labor process in full view. Contemporary AI is the opposite. Its casing is stubbornly opaque. Not even the master can see inside.

Title: Super Micro Computer (SMCI) March-Quarter Revenue To Be Impacted By “Blackwell Queue” And NVIDIA’s Ongoing Preference For Hyperscalers, As Per The Insights Gleaned By An Analyst From A Fireside Chat

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), one of the most prominent retailers of data center servers and liquid-cooled AI racks, has been trapped in the market's purgatory ever since the stock cleared its biggest near-term overhang by filing its requisite financial statements with the SEC in the nick of time to avoid a damaging delisting event. Now, a Wall Street analyst has stepped up to provide some much-needed context to SMCI's confounding weakness. Super Micro Computer recently provided a fairly disappointing near-term guidance, but was able to limit the fallout by aggressively ramping up its projections for FY 2026. To wit, SMCI now expects to earn $40 billion in full-year revenue in FY 2026 vs. Wall Street's consensus estimate of just $29 billion. Now, Northland analyst Nehal Chokshi is out with an important investment note on Super Micro Computer's prospects. To wit, Chokshi hosted SMCI's IR team for a fireside chat on the 28th of February, after the company had filed its "delayed FY24 10K, F1Q25 10Q (Sept Q) and F2Q25 (Dec Q) 10Q on Tuesday, February 25th, NVDA reporting modest data center upside on Wednesday, February 26th and key peer DELL reporting results on Thursday, February 27th." Bear in mind that NVIDIA and CoreWeave are Super Micro Computer's biggest customers, while Dell is its biggest competitor. Before going further, do note that Super Micro Computer reported $5.65 billion in revenue for its fiscal Q2'25 and guided to a range of between $5 billion and $6 billion in revenue for its fiscal Q3'25 (March-ending quarter), which corresponds to a QoQ decline of ~6 percent at the low-end, and a QoQ increase of ~12 percent at the high-end of the range. Coming back, Chokshi notes that the stated trajectory of Super Micro Computer's March-ending quarter - "guided down 12% q/q to up 6% q/q" - is largely a function of the fact that the company's GPU-as-a-Service (GPUaaS) customers "are unlikely to be at the front of the Blackwell queue." Here, Chokshi adds additional color by noting that Blackwell GPUs constituted ~31 percent of NVIDIA's January-ending quarter revenue, "driving NVDA data center revenue up 16% q/q, implying Hopper shipments down 20% q/q." Chokshi also notes that "consensus for DELL servers and networking is being projected flat q/q for the April Q, consistent with SMCI midpoint guidance, leading us to believe NVDA Blackwell shipments for the Jan Q indexed towards hyperscalers that DELL nor SMCI typically serve." Bear in mind that there is a roughly 8-week lag between when NVIDIA recognizes GPU revenue to when server OEMs recognize their top-line metric. So, according to Chokshi, Super Micro Computer's near-term revenue is being impacted by NVIDIA's Blackwell queue and its preferential treatment of hyperscalers.

We rely on your support for our independence, diversity and quality. Germany’s recent election results highlight deepening political fractures, with the rise of the far-right Alternate for Deutschland and the weakening of the center-left Social Democratic Party. Economic struggles and immigration concerns have fueled AfD’s support, especially in former East Germany. This instability could undermine Germany’s leadership in Europe, leaving the continent vulnerable. This article saved into your bookmarks. Click here to view your bookmarks. Germany’s recent election results have brought to the forefront the deepening fractures within the nation’s politics and society. The election showcased a significant shift in the political landscape, with the rise of the Alternative for Germany (AfD), a far-right party that has gained considerable support, particularly in the former East German territories. This, in conjunction with a weakening of the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) and a fragmented political environment, reveals the complexities Germany faces in its efforts to govern effectively. A divided political landscape The election results underscored the ongoing fragmentation of Germany’s political system. The SPD, led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz, saw a significant decline, securing only 16.4% of the vote. While this result was expected due to the party’s struggles in recent years, it has led to a situation where the SPD has lost much of its influence in shaping the nation’s future. On the other hand, the Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU), while victorious, achieved only 28.6% of the vote. This result demonstrates that even the center-right, long the dominant force in German politics, is no longer able to secure a decisive win without relying on coalitions. The rise of the AfD, which secured 20.8% of the vote, is perhaps the most striking outcome of this election. Although their support is still strongest in the former East Germany, where they garnered 29.7% of the vote, the AfD is beginning to make inroads into the West, achieving 13% of the vote in regions that were once firmly supportive of the CDU/CSU. This growing influence of the AfD highlights the increasing polarization of German politics and society, driven in part by economic insecurity, immigration concerns and the cultural tensions surrounding globalization. In addition to the rise of the AfD, the election results also revealed the diminished strength of the SPD, the Greens and the Free Democratic Party (FDP). These parties, which had formed the previous traffic light coalition government, struggled to present a unified front. The fractious nature of this coalition led to inefficiencies in governance and left the electorate dissatisfied. The lack of progress on key issues such as inflation, immigration and economic reform contributed to the overall sense of disillusionment with the current political establishment. The roots of AfD support: economic struggles and immigration concerns The AfD’s strong performance can be attributed to a combination of factors, with two key issues standing out: economic discontent and concerns over immigration. Germany’s economy has struggled in recent years, with no GDP growth for several consecutive years. The country has faced multiple crises, from the effects of the Russia–Ukraine war to challenges stemming from global inflation. These economic difficulties have taken a toll on the German population, particularly in the former East, where unemployment rates remain higher and economic opportunities more limited. Moreover, immigration has become a deeply divisive issue in German society. With a growing percentage of the population born outside of Germany, many citizens feel a sense of cultural insecurity and fear that the nation’s identity is being eroded. The AfD has capitalized on these fears, advocating for tighter immigration controls and a reassertion of German values. Their message has resonated particularly in the East, where the legacy of reunification remains a source of tension. While Germany does require immigration to address its demographic challenges and labor shortages, the rapid pace of immigration has created a perception of cultural and economic strain. This issue has been exacerbated by the ongoing debates over asylum policies and the EU’s handling of migration. The AfD’s success can thus be seen as a reaction to the perceived failure of the political establishment to address these concerns effectively. The CDU’s shift toward the far-right In response to the AfD’s growing influence, the CDU, under the leadership of Friedrich Merz, has begun to shift its stance toward the far-right. Merz, a former lawyer with ties to major international firms, including BlackRock, has sought to consolidate the center-right vote by adopting some of the AfD’s positions, particularly on issues like immigration. His proposals for stricter asylum laws and the tightening of border controls echo the policies championed by the AfD and reflect the growing pressure on the CDU to adopt a tougher stance on migration. Merz’s strategy, however, raises questions about the future direction of the CDU and its relationship with the AfD. While some analysts argue that the CDU is attempting to outflank the AfD on the right, others warn that this could further erode the party’s centrist identity and deepen the political polarization in Germany. The shift to the right is already being felt in the party’s rhetoric, with Merz calling for deregulation of the economy and stronger defense policies in line with the rising nationalist sentiment in Europe. The impact of Germany’s political instability on Europe Germany’s political instability and economic challenges have broader implications for the future of Europe. As the heart of the European Union, Germany’s struggles to maintain political cohesion and economic stability could have far-reaching consequences for the entire continent. A fractured Germany is unlikely to provide the leadership needed to navigate the complex geopolitical challenges facing Europe, from the ongoing conflict in Ukraine to the growing threat posed by Russia. The lack of a strong, unified German government also undermines Europe’s ability to respond effectively to global challenges. With the United States increasingly focused on domestic issues and shifting its attention away from Europe, the continent may find itself exposed to geopolitical risks. In the absence of a coherent European strategy, populist leaders like Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin could exploit Europe’s weaknesses, further undermining the region’s influence on the global stage. Germany’s failure to address its internal divisions could result in a Europe that is fragmented, weakened and increasingly susceptible to external pressures. As the continent grapples with an aging population, economic stagnation and rising political extremism, the prospect of a more cohesive EU seems increasingly unlikely. A long road ahead Germany’s political future is uncertain, with deep divisions in society and a lack of consensus on key issues. The rise of the AfD and the CDU’s shift toward the far-right reflect the growing dissatisfaction with the political establishment and the challenges facing Germany in the 21st century. As the country grapples with economic stagnation, immigration concerns and a fractured political system, the path forward will require difficult compromises and painful reforms. Without a strong and unified government, Germany risks losing its leadership role in Europe, leaving the continent vulnerable to external threats and internal disarray. The coming years will be critical in determining whether Germany can overcome its political paralysis and reclaim its position as a stable and effective force in Europe and the world.

Germany’s recent election results have brought to the forefront the deepening fractures within the nation’s politics and society. The election showcased a significant shift in the political landscape, with the rise of the Alternative for Germany (AfD), a far-right party that has gained considerable support, particularly in the former East German territories. This, in conjunction with a weakening of the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) and a fragmented political environment, reveals the complexities Germany faces in its efforts to govern effectively. The election results underscored the ongoing fragmentation of Germany’s political system. The SPD, led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz, saw a significant decline, securing only 16.4% of the vote. While this result was expected due to the party’s struggles in recent years, it has led to a situation where the SPD has lost much of its influence in shaping the nation’s future. On the other hand, the Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU), while victorious, achieved only 28.6% of the vote. This result demonstrates that even the center-right, long the dominant force in German politics, is no longer able to secure a decisive win without relying on coalitions. The rise of the AfD, which secured 20.8% of the vote, is perhaps the most striking outcome of this election. Although their support is still strongest in the former East Germany, where they garnered 29.7% of the vote, the AfD is beginning to make inroads into the West, achieving 13% of the vote in regions that were once firmly supportive of the CDU/CSU. This growing influence of the AfD highlights the increasing polarization of German politics and society, driven in part by economic insecurity, immigration concerns and the cultural tensions surrounding globalization. In addition to the rise of the AfD, the election results also revealed the diminished strength of the SPD, the Greens and the Free Democratic Party (FDP). These parties, which had formed the previous traffic light coalition government, struggled to present a unified front. The fractious nature of this coalition led to inefficiencies in governance and left the electorate dissatisfied. The lack of progress on key issues such as inflation, immigration and economic reform contributed to the overall sense of disillusionment with the current political establishment. The AfD’s strong performance can be attributed to a combination of factors, with two key issues standing out: economic discontent and concerns over immigration. Germany’s economy has struggled in recent years, with no GDP growth for several consecutive years. The country has faced multiple crises, from the effects of the Russia–Ukraine war to challenges stemming from global inflation. These economic difficulties have taken a toll on the German population, particularly in the former East, where unemployment rates remain higher and economic opportunities more limited. Moreover, immigration has become a deeply divisive issue in German society. With a growing percentage of the population born outside of Germany, many citizens feel a sense of cultural insecurity and fear that the nation’s identity is being eroded. The AfD has capitalized on these fears, advocating for tighter immigration controls and a reassertion of German values. Their message has resonated particularly in the East, where the legacy of reunification remains a source of tension. While Germany does require immigration to address its demographic challenges and labor shortages, the rapid pace of immigration has created a perception of cultural and economic strain. This issue has been exacerbated by the ongoing debates over asylum policies and the EU’s handling of migration. The AfD’s success can thus be seen as a reaction to the perceived failure of the political establishment to address these concerns effectively. In response to the AfD’s growing influence, the CDU, under the leadership of Friedrich Merz, has begun to shift its stance toward the far-right.

Title: Wall Street is turning its back on Elon Musk | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Liberals and government employees aren’t the only people angry with Elon Musk. Tesla’s plunging share price means many investors are angry, too. Shares of Tesla shot up 91% after election day, peaking just before Christmas, as investors anticipated Musk and his car company would be big winners as a result of Donald Trump’s second term as president. Musk was Trump’s largest financial supporter during the campaign, and has since become the highest-profile member of his administration, by far. In his role as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (or DOGE), he has been trying to impose deep cuts in spending that had been previously approved by Congress, laying off thousands of federal workers. But shares tumbled 5.6% in trading Thursday and are now down 45% from their December peak, giving up 96% of that post-election bump. Just since Trump took office and Musk began wielding power they have lost 38% of their overall value. The drop in share price probably reflects the concern that Musk has been much a more visible – and polarizing – figure in the Trump administration than he was expected to be immediately after the election. Many investors likely figured Musk would be a more traditional “behind the scenes” kind of adviser, not necessarily taking an active role in enacting controversial policies. Musk had enough other business interests, running companies ranging from Tesla to SpaceX to Neuralink to X, to keep him occupied. But the drop in Tesla’s value is also a sign of the headwinds the company is facing, in addition to increased competition from other automakers, especially those from China, who have made significant gains in their home market and in Europe as well. Whether it’s one problem or a myriad of problems causing the slump, however, it is clear now that Tesla’s sales woes are dragging the stock price down, too. And it’s not clear what, if anything, could lift Tesla sales going forward. While electric vehicle sales in Europe shot up 34% overall in January, sales of Teslas plummeted 50%. Tesla’s sales fell 29% in China, the company’s second largest market after the United States, over the course of the first two months of the year, according to Reuters. And Tesla’s US sales suffered a 16% drop in US sales between December and January, according to an estimate from Cox Automotive. It’s difficult to directly attribute the drops to any one cause, however, as a drop in that period is typical for the company, which usually makes a major push for year-end sales to hit its full-year financial results target, followed by a drop in January. Sales in January 2024, for instance, were off 24% from its December 2023 sales. “Globally his sales are imploding,” said Gordon Johnson, an analyst who is mostly critical of Tesla and its shares. “The sales drop in China is about competition but in western nations, people are pissed at him. Whether that’s driving down the sales in western countries, or it’s competition doesn’t matter. There’s little he can do reverse it. And we know he’s not going to have full self-driving. I think this could be the year the Tesla’s shares finally collapse.” Even even some bullish investors already think Musk is going to wildly miss the mark when it comes to Tesla’s growth this year. “I think investors are coming to a new expectation around what deliveries are going to look like for the year,” said Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management. “Three or four months ago, Musk guided to 20% to 30% delivery growth in 2025. And then a month ago he didn’t make any mention of the previous target, which analysts and investors correctly assumed that that meant that target is no longer on the table.” The question is how much of the plunge is a reaction to Musk’s political profile. Munster, who still considers himself a Tesla bull, said he believes about three-quarters is blowback. “At the time of the election, it was unclear how visible Musk would be (in the Trump administration),” Munster said. “Some believed the whole DOGE thing wouldn’t get off the ground. At this point Tesla investors are seeing Musk as having more authority than Trump. There’s some brand damage that comes from that.” There were protests outside Tesla stores throughout the country Saturday, with scattered reports of vandalized Teslas. One person was arrested in Loveland, Colorado and faces federal criminal charges after prior acts of vandalism against a Tesla store, and possession of “incendiary devices.” Perhaps the biggest sign of shift in how badly people want to own a Telsa comes from S&P Global Mobility, which has sales data on a state-by-state basis. It broke the data down into “blue states,” meaning states that voted for the Democratic candidate in the last four presidential elections, and “red states,” where Republicans won four straight elections. And within each group of states, it looked at the loyalty rate, meaning the percentage of households that have bought more than one Tesla. In the blue states, the percentage of repeat Tesla buyers fell, from 72% in the last quarter of 2023 to 65% in the last quarter of 2024. Meanwhile, repeat Tesla buyers in red states edged up very slightly from 47.6% at the end of 2023 to 48.2% during the last three months of last year. The drop in loyalty rate for Tesla owners in blue states resulted in Tesla losing about a percentage point of market share in those states, which includes some of the nation’s biggest car markets, such as California. A poll last month by Morning Consult that shows that nearly 32% of US buyers “would not consider” buying a Tesla. That’s up from 27% in a Morning Consult survey a year ago, and only 17% when it asked the question in in February 2021. By comparison, only 16% of potential buyers were almost certain or very likely to look at a Tesla before buying in the most recent survey, a figure that hasn’t changed much over the last four years. There’s also been anecdotal backlash against Musk on social media, including videos of people booing Cybertrucks which then needed a police escort out during the Mardi Gras parade in New Orleans, as well as people voicing approval for acts of vandalism against Teslas and accidents involving Tesla stores or vehicles. Beyond any concerns about liberals who might now avoid buying Teslas in reaction to Musk’s politics, Munster said there’s a concern that Musk is distracted from running Tesla, the company on which the majority of his fortune is based on. “Musk really rewrote the book in terms of leaders’ capacity to do different things. That used to be frowned upon,” Munster said, referring to Musk’s job not only as CEO of Tesla but also SpaceX, the primary owner of social media platform X, as well as the founder of artificial intelligence company xAI and Neuralink, which aims to implant computer chips into people’s brain to control computers. “I think there are natural limitations to what he can do. He has a lot going on.” In addition there could be growing concerns that as trade tensions rise between China and the United States that the Chinese could target Tesla for action because of his role in the Trump administration. “Beijing grants favors and withholds favors,” according to Isaac Stone Fish, the CEO of Strategy Risks, a business intelligence firm. “They have many levers over Elon Musk and Tesla.” But Tesla bulls say there is still an argument for how Musk’s ties to the Trump administration could benefit the automaker, such as easier approval for its plans for self-driving “robotaxis.” While many Teslas now have a “Full Self Driving” feature that can handle some driving maneuvers, drivers are required to be behind the steering wheel ready to take control of the car. And there are still accidents involving FSD, prompting a number of investigations by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. But Musk has promised that by June he’ll have vehicles ready to provide autonomous operations without drivers transporting passengers in a ride hailing service in Austin, Texas, Tesla’s home base, although Uber and Alphabet’s Waymo unit have already beaten Tesla with a driverless service in that city. And he expects that service to spread quickly and for a Cybercab vehicle to be on the roads by next year without steering wheels, brake or accelerator pedals. Those promises have bulls still excited about Tesla’s prospects, no matter the current sales problems. They believe the current decline in share price is a buying opportunity for those who believe in that future. “The real unlock of Tesla value is on autonomy,” said Munster. “Trump loves Musk, and Musk is going to get some of the things he wants, and the big thing is more opportunity to prove the safety of robotaxis. I think that’s going to happen.” Others have severe doubts about that. Johnson, the Tesla bear analyst, says that Musk has been promising that truly autonomous vehicles have been just a year or so way for the last decade, and that any problems living up to his latest promises will cause a sharp drop in the stock price, as will the first quarter sales figures due out in early April. – CNN’s Juliana Liu contributed to this report Correction: An earlier version of this story understated the gain in Tesla shares after the election through a December peak.

Title: Trump hails retaliatory tariffs in defense of America's jobs and its soul

Manufacturers are already shifting some operations from Asia in response to his policy, Trump says. By Mike Firn for RFA 2025.03.05 BANGKOK -- U.S. President Donald Trump defended on Tuesday his policy on tariffs saying reciprocal duties to be imposed across the board from April 2 would not only protect U.S. jobs but would defend the soul of the country. Trump, in his address to a joint session of Congress six weeks after taking office for a second term, said tariffs was "a beautiful word" and his policy was already seeing manufacturers relocating facilities to the U.S. from Asia. "On April 2, reciprocal tariffs kick in and whatever they charge us on tariffs we will charge them, a reciprocal back and forth," Trump said to the applause of his Republican supporters. "If they use non-monetary tariffs to keep us out of their market, we will use non-monetary barriers to keep them out of our market." Earlier on Tuesday, the U.S. imposed 25% duties on Mexican and Canadian imports and doubled tariffs imposed on China last month to 20%. China responded immediately, taxing U.S. farm imports by as much as 15%. It also imposed export and investment restrictions on 25 American firms, citing national security. "The Chinese people will not be intimidated," Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said at a regular news conference. In his speech to Congress, Trump said China was already taxing U.S. exporters too much. "China's average tariff is twice what we charge them," he said, adding that he would match any country's retaliatory tariffs. Trump said the threat of tariffs had already had an impact on the business plans of Japan's Honda, America's Apple and Taiwan chipmaker TSMC. All three companies recently announced large investments to shift some manufacturing to the U.S. "If you don't make your product in America you will pay a tariff," Trump said. "Tariffs are not just about protecting American jobs, they are about protecting the soul of our country." While economists have warned of the impact of tariffs on pushing up prices for U.S. consumers, Trump dismissed concerns of any negative impact. "There may be a little bit of a disturbance but we're OK with that," he said. Trump said he could balance the budget while offering "tax cuts for everyone." China's premier Li Qiang said China's economy would match last year's growth in spite of a trade war with the U.S. Speaking at the opening of the annual National People's Congress in Beijing on Wednesday, he said the economy would expand by around 5% this year. Li said Beijing was willing to let the budget deficit expand to fuel an upturn in domestic demand as the "main engine and anchor" of growth. Trading accusations on drugs Part of the reason for Trump's tariffs on Mexico and Canada is what he says is their failure to stop the flow of deadly fentanyl into the United States, which the U.S. president said Tuesday was "destroying our families." Both of those countries have defended their actions to stop drug smuggling. Trump has also accused China of failing to stamp out production of the synthetic opioid but China says it has already done its part to control the drug and it should not be blamed for a U.S. "governance failure." On Tuesday, Beijing released a white paper highlighting the steps it had taken to control the spread of fentanyl. "These have delivered notable results," it said. Reporting on the findings, the state-run tabloid Global Times hit out at Trump for blaming China for America's opioid problem and punishing it with tariffs. "Shifting the responsibility for domestic governance failures onto others and abusing tariffs as a means of pressure and coercion will not cure America's ills, nor will it help Washington achieve its political objectives," it said in an editorial. In his speech, Trump also repeated his pledge to take control of the Panama Canal. "It was given away by the Carter administration for one dollar but that agreement has been violated," he said. "We didn't give it to China. We gave it to Panama and we're taking it back." Earlier on Tuesday, Hong Kong's CK Hutchison Holding said a consortium including America's BlackRock would acquire Hutchison Ports and Panama Ports giving it control of the ports at either end of the canal.

Title: Country club culture no more: Inside Microsoft's move to cull staff on performance

In 2023, a Microsoft employee asked to take on a lighter workload when his wife was found to have terminal cancer. His managers were supportive, and they appeared happy with his performance during his wife's illness as recently as late 2024, when they told him to expect 120% of his bonus. Then, on January 22, the employee said, an HR representative unexpectedly joined his weekly manager meeting. The employee was fired without severance and was told his health insurance would expire that night. The employee said the gap in coverage meant his wife had to skip chemotherapy treatments for a month after. "I'm still shocked," he told Business Insider in a recent interview. "Shocked and angry. I did everything right." The Microsoft employee asked not to be identified to protect future career prospects. BI has verified his identity and confirmed details of his performance, his termination, and his wife's illness through documentation. A Microsoft spokesperson, Frank Shaw, said performance-based terminations rarely come as a surprise to employees and people could elect to have COBRA coverage. Nearly 2,000 employees were fired by Microsoft in January and February in a culling of those deemed low performers, a person familiar with the cuts said. This kind of performance-based mass cut is a shift for the tech giant. Managers spent months evaluating employees all the way up to the executive level as part of changes to the company's performance review and management process that are still under review, several people with knowledge of the plans said. "We aspire to have a high-performance culture and want to make sure managers have the ability to drive that and that expectations are clear," Shaw said, adding that the company wasn't trying to design a tougher system, but one that removes ambiguity, provides clarity and flexibility, and allows managers and teams to move with speed. Microsoft's new approach to performance management is shaping up to be one of the biggest changes to the company's management strategy since Satya Nadella became CEO more than a decade ago. Before he assumed the role in 2014, Microsoft had a reputation for a cutthroat performance-review system, at least in a tech industry that often mollycoddled talented employees. Nadella softened that considerably. Microsoft once had a reputation for a "country club" culture, as Amazon's founder, Jeff Bezos, called it, a place employees would go after they were done working hard in their careers and wanted to coast before retirement. Now, some leaders worry the company has gotten too soft, making it difficult to shed underperformers, according to the people familiar with Microsoft's plans. The company is looking to new external leaders, such as the former Google executive Mustafa Suleyman and a former Meta engineering chief, Jay Parikh, along with existing executives like the company's senior leadership team and LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky, to help design a new way to evaluate employees, these people said. Microsoft has had an incredibly successful decade, becoming a leading cloud provider and AI player. It's worth about $3 trillion, making the software giant the third-largest company by that measure. The stock has stagnated over the past year, however, as questions mount about the company's Copilot technology, and as AI competition intensifies. The broader tech industry is facing other challenges, and Microsoft is not immune. A decadelong hiring boom has fizzled as companies focus more on profit, and AI coding tools reduce competition for software engineering talent. Meta recently cut about 5% of its workforce to "raise the bar on performance management," CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in an internal memo in January. Amazon is culling managers. Even Google is trimming jobs. Employees who were let go in Microsoft's recent round of performance cuts got termination letters explaining the abrupt exit. "The reason(s) for the termination of your employment include your job performance has not met minimum performance standards and expectations for your position," said several letters viewed by BI. "You are relieved of all job duties effective immediately and your access to Microsoft systems, accounts, and buildings will be removed effective today. You are not to perform any further work on behalf of Microsoft." The letters mentioned severance but said medical, prescription, and dental benefits ended on the last day of employment. The letters also said Microsoft would consider past performance and termination if the person applied for other jobs at the company in the future. "At Microsoft we focus on high performance talent," a company spokesperson told BI recently. "We are always working on helping people learn and grow. When people are not performing, we take the appropriate action." Deena Merlen, a partner at Reavis Page Jump LLP, told BI her law firm had received more inquiries about performance-based layoffs as of late. "Employers generally have the right to fire, just as an employee has the right to quit," she said. "As long as Microsoft's alleged performance-based reasons are not for some other, unlawful reason, Microsoft is within its rights to engage in these layoffs." The company has no obligation to provide severance, but such agreements often come with a release of legal claims that can protect the company from lawsuits, Merlen added. Before 2014, Microsoft used a controversial system to evaluate employee performance. Called stack ranking, it forced managers to put employees on a curve and cut the lowest performers. At Microsoft, that meant managers had to rank employees from 1 to 5, and someone always had to get a 5, the lowest score, no matter how well they or the team performed. Shaw, the Microsoft spokesperson, said that the system was especially problematic for small teams and that while terminating the lowest rung was not a companywide policy, it happened on some teams. Stack ranking was unpopular internally and was seen as prioritizing individual work, pitting employees against one another and creating a barrier to collaboration. Developers and even entire organizations had a tendency to reject acceptable solutions to problems if they hadn't developed those solutions themselves, the company's chief people officer, Kathleen Hogan, previously told BI. There's even a famous cartoon depicting Microsoft's org chart as warring factions. The company officially abandoned stack ranking just before Nadella took over as CEO in early 2014. He redesigned the company's performance-review system around the "growth mindset" concept. The idea is that skills are developed through hard work and that challenges and failures are opportunities to learn. This is counter to a "fixed mindset," which assumes talent is innate and struggles are a sign of failure. Nadella and his new leadership team applied this growth mindset to a new framework called "model, coach, care," which called on managers to set a positive example for employees, help staffers adapt and learn, and invest in people's professional growth. Instead of ranking employees from 1 to 5, Microsoft moved to a performance-review system that gives managers a simple payroll budget they could divide and dole out to employees based on performance. Kevin Oakes, the CEO of the Institute for Corporate Productivity, has worked with Microsoft on implementing a growth mindset. He told BI this approach was a way to encourage top performers but noted that even companies like Microsoft need to cull their workforces to become leaner and higher performing. "Any high-performing organization should make sure employees are performing at an acceptable level, and they should be weeding out people who are not performing at an acceptable level," he said. "Over time, you tend to get a little bloated as a big company where you've let hiring go unchecked in some areas and need to get back to a lean, efficient machine." Today, employees are evaluated on a scale from 0 to 200 called the "ManageRewards slider." The process begins with frontline managers, who evaluate an employee's impact and recommend where they think they should land on the slider. Then, a higher-level manager considers "differentiation" — i.e., making sure the team is distributed along the slider. The middle of the range is 100, while 0, 60, and 80 are lower performers and 120, 140, and 200 are higher performers. Those ratings influence how much an employee receives in stock awards and cash bonuses. A score of "Impact 60," for example, generally gives employees 0% of their stock award and 30% of their maximum cash bonuses while the slightly higher rating of "Impact 80" gives them 60% of their normal stock award and 80% of their maximum bonus. Shaw, Microsoft's spokesperson, said 100 would be considered a good score and mean an employee had met all of their objectives. In general, the company's senior leadership team gives managers a budget that allows for every employee on the team an average score of 109. "So you want to pay someone Impact 140 for doing an outstanding job? Find three people you're giving Impact 100 so it's affordable," one executive-level manager explained. "Keep this guy around. He'll be paying for everyone's bonuses." The manager said they typically had paid top performers by finding a set of people who failed in the previous year and giving them all zero or reduced rewards. This person asked not to be identified discussing sensitive topics. "That's a bad manager," Shaw said. "You certainly can't give everybody high rewards," but it's still possible to give one person high rewards while keeping other people's scores close to 100, he added. While low rewards can indicate a performance issue, Microsoft's actual system for managing out low performers is separate from this employee-rating process. Generally, managers email an internal HR system and request a consultation for performance concerns, and the manager will be matched with an internal consultant. More seasoned consultants are used for higher-level employees, or if the situation is difficult. These consultants often give written formal feedback to employees, saying they delivered "Less Impact than Expected" and would be starting a three-month performance-management process. Some managers can cut low performers who don't improve within about four months through this process. But sometimes Microsoft's HR department concludes that managers haven't done enough performance coaching, one manager said, meaning they have not generated enough documentation showing employees have been given the opportunity to improve and have repeatedly failed. It can take two or three more 90-day programs before these employees are ousted. One high-level manager said the average time to exit a low performer was seven months from the time a manager notified HR about the situation, which often comes after sustained low performance. "It takes too long to performance-manage folks out," one executive said. These exits can be further delayed by leaves of absence. One of the Microsoft managers who talked to BI said employees sometimes shared tips on how to complicate the company's performance-improvement process. One common suggestion: If your manager is working to fire you, go to a doctor and say you have certain symptoms, get a supporting letter, and secure health-related time off work. This can pause or reset aspects of the process, this person said. Short-term paid disability typically covers 60 to 90 days away from work, and Microsoft's HR department can be reluctant to exit these employees for some time after that, the person said. "For employees gaming the short-term disability policies, you can be talking 12 to 18 months to get to a point where HR is comfortable firing them," they added. In the US, a common refrain for the 0-to-200 performance reviews was, "One Year, One Reward," meaning employees are judged on a single year's performance. The separation between rewards and the formal performance-management process gave flexibility to managers to "harvest the budget," as one manager said, in other words give lower ratings to relatively adequate performers so big rewards could be doled out to high performers. They could do this without much risk to the employment status of the adequate performers. Shaw, the Microsoft spokesperson, said this was not company policy. Hogan, Microsoft's chief people officer, in an internal email in 2023 instructed managers to give fewer employees "exceptional rewards," meaning a high performance rating that leads to higher pay and bonuses. "More will need to be at the middle of the range," Hogan said in the email. Shaw, the spokesperson, said the email was specific to that year and that rewards changed annually based on factors like the economy and company performance. Changes to this year's rewards cycle won't be solidified until later in the year, he said. "Microsoft just summarily terminated hundreds of employees who had year-over-year insufficient performance based on rewards, without a lengthy documentation and feedback process," one executive said, adding that this coming rewards season would be more difficult on managers, who would have to be more careful about doling out low rewards. Shaw, the Microsoft spokesperson, confirmed that the decisions about whom to cut came from looking at rewards year over year but said the company still believed in "one year, one reward." Just because an employee gets high rewards one year, for example, doesn't mean they've earned it the next. As Microsoft evaluates its performance-review process, people familiar with the plans say the company is looking for perspectives from new leaders such as Suleyman, the former Google executive who is now Microsoft's CEO of AI, and Parikh, the former head of engineering at Meta who runs AI platforms at Microsoft. Shaw said that Suleyman and Parikh were just some of the people providing perspective and that Roslansky, the LinkedIn CEO, had also provided a lot of input. "The company will have a much stronger point of view, like some of our competitors," one Microsoft executive said. The company is making other changes to prioritize engineering talent and level out organizations, taking a page from Amazon. Separate from its performance-management processes, Microsoft is starting to weigh how it can become leaner and more engineering-focused. The company measures what it calls "good attrition," which is reviewed at the executive level, the Microsoft executive said. That's reminiscent of Amazon's "unregretted attrition." Right now there are no targets for this Microsoft metric. But the company is borrowing from Amazon in trying to increase the ratio of engineers working on projects. Amazon has something called the "Builder Ratio," which analyzes the ratio of software engineers to "non-builders," such as program managers and project managers. The goal is to try to keep organizations lean. Charlie Bell, Microsoft's security boss who came from Amazon's cloud unit, has brought this metric to Microsoft. Microsoft tracks the "PM ratio" which is the ratio of product managers or program managers to engineers, and has increased targets in the current fiscal year. For example, Bell's security organization right now is around 5.5 engineers to one PM, and his goal is to reach 10:1, according to a person familiar with Bell's plans. Have a tip?

Title: The dot-com bubble burst 25 years ago. What does that history say about stocks today?
URL: https://qz.com/dot-com-bubble-stock-market-crash-anniversary-ai-1851767436
Time Published: 2025-03-06T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
On March 10, 2000, the Nasdaq Composite index peaked at 5,048.62, more than double its value from just a year earlier. Internet startups with “dot-com” slapped on the end of their names and little more than ideas to sell to investors had soared to astronomical valuations over the previous five years. But all parties come to an end. Within weeks of that high, the index began its fall, with a mix of factors spooking investors. Eventually, the Nasdaq shed more than 75% of its value, wiping out $5 trillion in market capitalization. The age of irrational exuberance was over. A quarter-century later, the rise of AI has market veterans debating whether history repeats, or merely runs the same bubble algorithm with new inputs. Some market watchers see structural differences preventing an immediate collapse, while tech critics warn we’re debugging the same old bubble logic. Beyond balance sheets lies a deeper concern: We keep forgetting that the social costs of tech revolutions outlast their market corrections. There are similarities between the market today and 25 years ago as some investors grow nervous, according to Kairong Xiao, a finance professor at Columbia Business School. But if the moment we are in ends up bursting, the market structure means things will look different than 2000. “The dot-com bubble was characterized by a lot of IPOs, with companies trying to get into the biggest asset class in the Nasdaq” Xiao said. “Today, due to regulation and many other structural changes, new investments nowadays have been through the private equity market.” That structural shift from public to private funding represents one of the most significant changes. While Netscape’s 1995 IPO sparked a gold rush of public offerings from internet startups, today’s most prominent AI developers — OpenAI and Anthropic — remain private despite valuations in the tens of billions. They can access enormous capital without facing public market scrutiny or quarterly earnings pressure. The companies leading today’s tech wave also differ markedly from their dot-com predecessors. In 2000, many market darlings were freshly minted startups with minimal revenue. Today, AI innovation is largely funded by cash-rich tech giants including Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOGL), and Nvidia (NVDA), companies with diverse revenue streams and substantial profits. This concentration of resources among established players may provide a cushion against market volatility that didn’t exist during the dot-com era. “The big companies can survive if there’s a crash in the market because they have other ways to raise financing, whereas the small guys get eliminated,” Xiao said. Yet not all market observers are convinced we’ll avoid a reckoning entirely. Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, said today’s AI boom has runway left — but also an expiration date. “I still think we got another two good years left in the market,” Munster said. “Unfortunately, it’s gonna end in the same way that it did 25 years ago.” For Munster, the key indicator isn’t current valuations but the psychological state of the market, which he sees as “euphoric” right now. He defines euphoria — that intoxicating moment when rational investing gives way to the fear-of-missing-out — as when the forward price-to-earnings multiple exceeds 50 times. Today’s Nasdaq trades around 25 times earnings. But Munster said that euphoric threshold could be reached by 2027, potentially triggering what he described as a “spectacular burst.” While Munster said he believes the substance of AI will eventually exceed the hype, that likely won’t happen in time to avoid a market correction. “By the time the numbers start to improve, the bubble will have burst,” Munster said. “I lived through the dot-com bubble. I don’t want to see people’s lives get blown up, but I also think that AI is going to be more impactful than the internet.” Yet for all the structural differences between eras, some experts warn that we risk repeating the same fundamental mistakes. Mar Hicks, a history of technology professor at the University of Virginia and author of “Programmed Inequality,” said our retrospective view of previous tech bubbles often minimizes their negative impacts. Those harms, Hicks said, include substantial erosion of privacy norms and labor market transformations that began during the first internet boom. Early e-commerce companies like Kozmo.com used venture capital to offer services at unsustainably low prices, conditioning consumers to expect convenience without cost — a precursor to today’s gig economy. “That led to getting people used to this idea that you can have anything for free, essentially,” Hicks said. “It made it so that people either didn’t think about the labor and paying the labor of the people who are doing this work, or it completely changed the structure of the labor market.” Hicks suggested that while Silicon Valley’s memory may be short, its executives aren’t entirely forgetting history — they’re strategically misremembering it. Today’s AI leaders appear to have studied the dot-com collapse primarily as a public relations case study rather than a substantive business lesson. “The way in which they’re being mindful is they now know what they have to say in order to maybe get people to not get upset about these new revolutionary technologies,” Hicks said. “They’re giving lip service to it because they don’t ever address any of the real problems.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: JioStar Employees with Rs 1 Crore+ Salaries Seek Jobs Amid Massive Layoffs
URL: https://www.medianama.com/2025/03/223-jiostar-employees-with-₹1-crore-salaries-seek-jobs-amid-massive-layoffs/
Time Published: 2025-03-06T07:51:20Z
Full Content:
MEDIANAMA Technology and policy in India JioStar is laying off more than 1,100 employees to eliminate overlapping job positions following the merger between Reliance Industries Ltd.’s Viacom18 and The Walt Disney Company’s India division, according to a report by LiveMint. The layoff drive includes job losses for entry-level employees, senior managers, directors, and even those at the assistant vice president level. “The departures started a month ago, and they are not ending anytime soon,” said one of the people quoted in LiveMint’s report. The downsizing will continue until June and will primarily focus on corporate-level positions in JioStar’s distribution, finance, commercial, and legal departments, according to people interviewed by LiveMint. This move comes at a time when JioStar is targeting to increase the efficiency of its operations and focus on high-growth verticals—specifically digital streaming and sports. “Whenever two large companies with similar businesses merge, redundancies are inevitable,” an industry executive told LiveMint. “This restructuring is about optimizing resources and reducing duplication, ensuring the joint venture operates as a leaner and more efficient entity,” they added. A rival media company’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) confirmed that they have been receiving resumes from JioStar employees—many of whom have annual salaries exceeding Rs 1 crore—ready to make the switch. However, the laid-off employees will receive a severance package from JioStar, which is a silver lining: affected workers will receive six to twelve months’ salary as part of the payout plan. The company will provide employees with one full month’s salary for every year they have worked, in addition to a notice period of one to three months. For example, an employee who has worked for less than six years will receive a minimum of seven months’ pay and benefits, including the notice period. Meanwhile, those with longer tenures at the company will receive up to 15 months of compensation. Even employees who have not completed the compulsory five-year period for gratuity eligibility will receive a pro-rata payout. On the other hand, some affected employees, specifically from tech and digital services, will reportedly get jobs within Jio or the wider Reliance ecosystem. The only unaffected department when it comes to the current job cuts at JioStar is the sports department, as the media giant plans to expand its sports portfolio and launch new sports channels. For context, JioStar currently offers broadcast and online streaming of the ICC Champions Trophy, the Women’s Premier League (WPL), the FIH Hockey Pro League, the Premier League, and the Indian Super League, on its Star Sports TV channels and JioHotstar streaming platform. This offering will further expand in about two weeks’ time as the Indian Premier League (IPL) – which is scheduled to take place over two months – kicks off on March 22. As a result, there won’t be any panic about job losses or layoffs in its sports department for now. JioStar’s sports portfolio expansion aligns with the company’s 2023 strategy, when its JioCinema platform secured exclusive streaming rights for the IPL from the now-defunct Disney+ Hotstar. In a similar vein the streaming platform carried out another invaluable coup when it agreed a deal with Warner Bros. to stream its entire content library after Disney+ Hotstar chose not to renew its contract. At the end of the day, JioStar’s overarching aim with all these acquisitions is to rival and eventually marginalise streaming giants Netflix and Amazon Prime Video in the Indian online streaming market.

Prices of silver in INR terms, have moved up by 15% in CY24 and YTD 2025 the prices are up by another 11%. A confluence of factors such as falling US interest rates, geopolitical situation and uncertainties surrounding Trump policies have been supportive of precious metals. Going ahead silver prices are expected to be well supported. Fundamental Factors The medium term as well as long term factors indicate a positive outlook for silver. The US interest rates are expected to follow a downward trajectory for 2025, albeit at a gradual pace. Over the near to medium term interest rates are a critical determinant of demand for precious metals. The geopolitical situation is expected to remain fluid over the near term and the trade policies of Trump administration are expected to encourage safe haven demand. The long term outlook of a commodity is determined by the demand-supply scenario. The supply of silver has been in deficit over the last four years. The supply for CY24 is estimated at 1,004 million ounces whereas demand is estimated at 1,219 million ounces. The majority of this demand (~60%) comes from industrial uses. Silver finds extensive applications in electronic devices, circuit boards, solar panels and electric vehicle batteries. As the adoption of EVs and green energy technologies continues to gain traction, the industrial demand for silver is expected to remain robust.

The effect of President Trump’s policies appear to be disinflationary in the immediate term with crude oil slumping to ~USD 70/bbl while the impact of higher US tariffs is yet to be seen and would depend on various scenarios (refer our note). As such, the euphoria around President Trump’s victory seems to be fading with the dollar index giving away a large part of its gains since Sep’24 while the INR has also started to rise.

(Neutral) Market Closing Commentary Nifty broke its 10-session losing streak, ending Wednesday’s trading up by 1.15% at 22,337.30. The benchmark indices saw a strong recovery from the oversold zone. The pullback was driven by several factors, including strength in Asian markets, bargain buying in oversold stocks, and value buying in blue-chip stocks. All 13 major sectoral indices closed in the green, with Metals, Information Technology, and Automobile stocks leading the rally. The BSE Midcap and BSE Smallcap indices surged by 2.66% and 2.8%, respectively. Nifty Outlook Index formed a strong bull candle with a higher high and higher low, indicating buying demand emerging for the second session from the 22,000 levels. We anticipate the current pullback to extend toward the 22,500 level, which corresponds to the gap down area from February 28, 2025. Overall, the index is expected to consolidate within the range of 21,700 to 22,500 in the upcoming sessions. Key support levels are identified between 22,000- 21,700, as this range. For a reversal of the short-term corrective trend, the index needs to consistently form higher highs and higher lows. Bank nifty Outlook Bank Nifty formed a second consecutive bull candle with a higher high and higher low highlighting buying demand emerging from the lower band of the last 8 weeks range placed around 48,000-47,800. We expect the index to trade in the range of 47,800-49,000 in the coming sessions. A breach below the lower band of the range will lead to extended decline towards 47,000 levels in the coming sessions. While holding above the support area of will lead to pullback towards the 49,000 levels. Bank Nifty has been consolidating in the broad range of 47,800-50,500 in the last 8 weeks.

March 05, 2025 17:26 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, March 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The following statement is being issued by Levi & Korsinsky, LLP: To: All persons or entities who purchased or otherwise acquired securities of AppLovin Corporation (“AppLovin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: APP) between May 10, 2023 to February 25, 2025, both dates inclusive. You are hereby notified that the class action lawsuit Michael Querio v. AppLovin Corporation, et al. (Case No. 5:25-cv-02294) has been commenced in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. To get more information go to: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/applovin-corporation-lawsuit-submission-form or contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. either via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. There is no cost or obligation to you. According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. If you suffered a loss in APP securities, you have until May 5, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn’t require that you serve as a lead plaintiff.

Title: Amazon-Owned One Medical CEO Trent Green to Move to NRC Health
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/personnel/2025/amazon-owned-one-medical-ceo-trent-green-move-nrc-health/

The CEO of Amazon-owned One Medical, Trent Green, will leave that position to become CEO of National Research Corporation, a publicly traded provider of healthcare solutions doing business as NRC Health. NRC Health announced the move in a Wednesday (March 5) press release, saying Green will join the company June 1. Green will leave One Medical April 4, CNBC reported Wednesday, citing an internal Amazon memo. “After nearly three years with Amazon One Medical, CEO Trent Green has decided to leave the company,” an Amazon spokesperson said, per the report. “We are grateful to Trent for his many contributions and wish him well on his next endeavor.” Green became CEO of One Medical in September 2023, about six months after Amazon completed its acquisition of the company, according to the report. During his time in that role, One Medical, which is a primary care provider, expanded into new geographic areas, opened more offices, and integrated further into Amazon, in part by offering services for Prime members, per the report. At NRC Health, which provides a healthcare experience management platform, Green will use his experience in care delivery, digital transformation and strategic business execution to advance the company’s personalized, data-driven solutions and strengthen its market presence, according to the press release. “I am excited to join NRC Health and lead the company during this transformative period,” Green said in the release. “I look forward to working alongside NRC’s talented associates to advance innovative solutions that enhance healthcare experiences for patients, providers and caregivers and drive sustainable growth for our investors.” When Amazon announced its $3.9 billion acquisition of One Medical in July 2022, it said it aimed to reinvent healthcare and described One Medical as a tech-powered primary care provider that offers in-person, digital and virtual care services. It was reported in February 2024 that Amazon was cutting “a few hundred” jobs across its healthcare units One Medical and Amazon Pharmacy while working to save another $100 million in 2024 and decrease its operating losses. The cuts in its healthcare units were the latest in a series of layoffs announced by Amazon around that time. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by nearly 500 points, recovering from a steep decline earlier in the week as the major U.S. automakers are given a one-month exemption from new tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports. “We spoke with the Big Three auto dealers. We are going to give a one month exemption on any autos coming through USMCA,” President Donald Trump said, according to a statement provided by White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt during a news conference. The news follows comments from Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who indicated that there might be potential tariff relief for Canada and Mexico. He suggested that the U.S. could be moving toward a compromise that is a “middle ground.” As the day ended in New York, the S&P 500 added 1.1%, while the Nasdaq 100 climbed 1.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 485 points or 1.1%. Meanwhile, the job report came weak, raising concerns about stagflation. General Motors (GM) stock surged more than 3% as the broader market rebounded in the morning. The rally appeared to be driven by investor optimism following Lutnick’s remarks suggesting potential tariff relief for Canada and Mexico. Meanwhile, Ford (F) also jumped 5% in the afternoon following the news. Shares of pharmaceutical giant Moderna (MRNA+8.96%) surged over 6% on Wednesday after strategic insider stock purchases by the company’s CEO and a board director. According to a recent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, CEO Stephane Bancel and board director Paul Sagan acquired $6 million worth of Moderna shares. Shares of Novo Nordisk (NVO+3.93%) climbed 3.5% after the company announced plans to sell its weight loss drug Wegovy at less than half its usual monthly price through a new direct-to-consumer online pharmacy. CrowdStrike (CRWD) stock fell 9% on Wednesday after the cybersecurity software company provided disappointing earnings guidance. The company gained significant attention last year following a widespread global tech outage linked to its software. — William Gavin contributed to the article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Futarchy As Meta Governance
URL: https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/futarchy-as-meta-governance
Time Published: 2025-03-05T18:37:44Z
Full Content:
While anyone can buy stock in public firms, private firms are instead held by a more concentrated and exclusive set of owners. Such firms tend to make higher returns than public firms, and are more responsive to investment opportunities. They tend to be taken public when they reach a stable situation where managers can just “milk the cow”, while public firms tend to be taken private when they start to face many big new decisions. The basic idea is this: when CEOs of public firms make substantial and uncertain investments, they face the immediate judgment of market speculators, expressed in the firm’s stock price. And without a good inside view of particular investments, speculators have to rely on the average return of such public firm investments, which tends to be bad. So the firm stock price falls, after which the CEO may not last long enough to see if their investments actually pay off. Thus CEOs of public firms tend to invest only when they can show speculators enough to convince them of their investments’ unusual value. So they tend to make investments that are clearly much like successful prior projects, and so can be judged on the track records of such projects. In contrast, CEOs of private firms typically hold far larger personal fractions of the firm’s stock, and so consider their investments more carefully. They can invest using info that they can’t effectively communicate to market speculators, and so they can make novel investments, different from what they and others have done before. Thus private firms seem to be a superior form of firm governance. Why then are there any public firms? Because there are only a limited number of skilled CEOs and trusted partners rich enough to take firms private. Over the decades, we have been creating more such people, and a larger fraction of business firms have been converted to private equity. And until the public can more easily invest in private firms, their money will have to go somewhere. All this could be see as a critique of futarchy, since futarchy picks actions using the info that is available to market speculators. Without access to the extra info typically available to private firm CEOs, such speculators must make the sorts of judgments that public firm speculators typically do about possible firm investments. Thus, for max profits, it seems better to take a firm private than to have it run either by a CEO responsive to a public stock price, or by futarchy speculators who advise particular decisions. Futarchy might be able to advise a public firm on whether to go private, but that decision seems to be well made by a simple auction. If private investors are willing to pay more for the firm than public investors, it should go private. But alas we typically block this sort of solution via poison pills, and maybe people would be more willing to listen to futarchy advice on this key decision. Futarchy seems to have a better chance of advising public firms on key decisions where we suspect the CEO might be biased. Such on whether to replace the CEO, or on how much more money to raise from investors, when, and at what price. But while this is a reasonable hope, it is far from a sure thing. The best case for futarchy seems to be in cases where we are just not sure that max profits, even if expertly executed, is the outcome we want. Then we can use a futarchy tied to some other outcomes that we better trust, and ask futarchy either re specific decisions, or whether to hand off decisions to something else, like a private firm. Or whether to later change back from a private allocation. Competing private firms seem to be our best known institution for getting the most profits from some area of life. And we economists do have good reasons to expect that this is often the best way for everyone to get the more of what they want. But we economists also know of many plausible exceptions, and many others have stronger doubts than economists about for-profit ventures. So there’s a place for an institution that makes reliable, unbiased judgements about the effects of key decisions on other outcomes, judgements that are quite well informed compared to most other institutions, even if not as well informed as private choices. We can plausibly best trust this institution for our most meta decisions, on which other institutions to use when and where. The main more meta decision that remains is: what are the ex-post measurable outcomes for futarchy to use when making these decisions? It seems like you're using the term "private equity firm" as a synonym for "private firm" here, considering that you contrast and compare it with "public firm." Are you using the term right? To my understanding a private equity firm is a private firm that manages a portfolio of investments in other firms. It's not just any firm that's privately owned. I'm not so sure about your explanation for why a private firm would have a higher rate of return. If the problem with public firms is that CEOs are getting ousted too quickly, it's not the average uninformed investor doing that - it's large activist investors and board members. Activist investors and board members would be highly informed in what's going on with the company. I hear that, once adjusted for size and leverage, profitability is about the same. That being said, all equity is by nature overvalued and the threat if PE keeps it somewhat sane. No posts Ready for more?

Title: Amgen just got one step closer to bringing its Ozempic competitor to market

Amgen (AMGN) is getting closer to challenging the weight-loss drug duopoly of Novo Nordisk (NVO), the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, and Eli Lilly (LLY), which produces Zepbound. The pharma company announced today that it has begun two late-stage clinical trials for its experimental weight-loss drug, MariTide. If successful, MariTide could disrupt the market by offering a less frequent dosing regimen than the current weekly injections on the market. The drug has been tested as a once-monthly treatment, as well as with dosing intervals of every other month and once every three months. Amgen’s executive vice president of research and development, Jay Bradner, shared key details of the new trials Wednesday morning at TD Cowen’s annual healthcare conference. The two trials will enroll about 4,500 patients in total. One study will recruit 3,500 participants that are obese or overweight, while the other will include 999 people who are both obese or overweight and have type 2 diabetes. The primary objective of both studies is to assess the percentage of weight loss at 72 weeks. Amgen will test three dose levels — low, medium, and high — starting patients at a lower dose and gradually increasing it to the target doses. According to ClinicalTrials.gov, the studies are set to begin officially on March 17 and are expected to conclude in early 2027. In November, the company reported that MariTide helped patients with obesity or excess weight shed an average of 20% of their body weight in an earlier 52-week trial. For comparison, the highest dose of Wegovy resulted in an average weight loss of 15% after 68 weeks in clinical trials. Meanwhile, patients taking the highest dose of Eli Lilly’s rival drug, Zepbound, achieved over 20% weight loss after 72 weeks.

Title: Deals: Samsung S25+ $150 off + $50 credit and 2x storage, Lenovo Snapdragon PC $500 off, Bose QuietComfort Ultra buds, more
URL: http://9to5google.com/2025/03/05/deals-samsung-s25-lenovo-ideapad-5-bose-ultra-buds/

We have now moved on to day 3 of the massive Discover Samsung sale and the highlight deal of the day is now live – Galaxy S25+ with $700 trade value, or up to $150 off with a bonus $50 credit and double storage for FREE. From there, we have unlocked Pixel 8a handsets at up to $132 off as well as Lenovo’s Snapdragon X Plus IdeaPad 5 Copilot+ PC at 50% off, and some deep deals on the wonderful Bose QuietComfort Ultra wireless buds. All of that and more awaits below in today’s 9to5Toys Lunch Break. The official Discover Samsung rolls into day 3 today with big-time deals across just about every product category you’ll find on the official site. Today’s headliner 24-hour sale features the new Galaxy S25+. While there are weeklong deals on all of the new S25 models through Sunday, these daily deals offer up some seriously notable extra savings, with today’s offer landing with up to $700 in instant trade-in value, or a straight up $150 price drop without a trade-in alongside a bonus $50 Samsung credit and double the storage on select colorways. Remember to select the “No, Get $100 – $150 Samsung instant savings” in the trade-in section to redeem the deal – this will side-step the trade-in options and apply the discount directly to your order. But you can’t stack the trade-in value with this deal (it’s one or the other). You’ll also want to pop down to the “Make your Galaxy epic with an exclusive” section near the bottom of the Galaxy S25+ listing page – this is where you’ll find special discounts on add-on items, like headphones, and Galaxy Rings, and Galaxy Watches, and more at prices far lower than buying them individually. Today’s 24-hour deal is easily one of the best we have tracked outside of some of the bundle deals we featured during the pre-order phase, and is only going to get slightly worse starting tomorrow. That said the ongoing weeklong Galaxy S25 deals (seen below) are pretty notable nonetheless, you just might not want to miss out on today’s special offer if you’re going to pull the trigger at any time soon: The release of the new Pixel 9a is all but imminent at this point. We expect it to launch in the last week of March at the same price as the Pixel 9 with a few upgrades, and a look closer to that of a previous-gen iPhone – Google appears to be doing away with the camera bar with some leaks suggesting quite a cheap-looking handset. But if you like your Pixels the way they are, or just want to save a solid $100 on the current-generation entry-level model instead of the full list on the new 9a later this month, Amazon is now offering the unlocked Pixel 8a down at $399 shipped. Regularly $499, this is a straight up $100 discount to land on par with last year’s Black Friday price. Today’s deal at Amazon lands on the most affordable Pixel 8a configuration, and on three different colorways: Obsidian black, Aloe green, and Bay blue. As we mentioned above, this deal is on par with just about every price drop we have tracked on the device over the last several months. Update: This deal is now back in stock. Details below in the original post. While we still have some notable exclusive price drops on the Chipolo Google Find My Device trackers via the brand’s official site, we just spotted the Chipolo Card Point model down at the $24 Amazon all-time low. Shipping is free for Prime members or in orders over $35 on Amazon. Over at B&H, you’ll find Lenovo’s IdeaPad 5 Copilot+ PC with Snapdragon X Plus/16GB/1TB down at $499.99 shipped. This is regularly a $1,000 notebook which is now seeing a solid $500 markdown. We saw the 16GB RAM and 512GB variant of this machine drop to $510 earlier this year, but this is the first time we’re tracking a deal on this model with more storage. Today’s 50% discount lands this machine $500 below its usual going rate, making it a great time to snag. Head below for more details. We are now tracking some notable deals on the wonderful flagship Bose QuietComfort Ultra Wireless Earbuds. Amazon is now offering a series of colorways down at $219 shipped – that’s $80 off the regular $299 list price and the same deal you’ll find directly from Bose right now for a limited-time. This includes the sweet champagne and off-white Diamond 60th Anniversary Edition too. Today’s deal is $10 under the official 2024 Black Friday price and among the lowest we have ever tracked for a brand-new condition set – there have been a few fleeting deals for a couple bucks less at other retailers but only on limited colorways. If you’re a Costco member, you’ll want to head below for another notable chance to save. Costco has teamed up with Bose on this deal as well. That means Costco members can score the same $219 discounted price (White Smoke and Black only on this offer) and also claim a FREE $50 gift card – Apple, Spotify, Hulu, Google Play, Sirius XM, DoorDash, Uber Eats, or Xbox. Again this deal is only for Costco members, but here’s how it works: FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More. Check out 9to5Google on YouTube for more news:

Title: China Market Update: NPC’s Government Work Report Reviewed – Consumption, Consumption, Consumption & AI

ByBrendan Ahern ByBrendan Ahern , Senior Contributor. CLN At the National People’s Congress, Premier Li provided the government work report. The lack of Western media coverage is interesting, so I pulled out the choice lines. Consumption comes up a lot, indicating where policy support is headed. Artificial intelligence was also explicitly mentioned. Real estate was not as big of a focus, though a large part of the bond issuance is linked to real estate support as local governments have been given more latitude to support project completion. Jonathan Krane’s thesis in creating our firm was to align China investment products with government policy. We are looking good in 2025 as this top-down consumption directive is implemented by government agencies and local governments. Numerically, the report was largely in line with expectations that were low to begin with, though the verbal was stronger than anticipated. It is important that the government recognizes deflation because ignoring it means not fixing it. They did not ignore it. On Thursday, the heads of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, PBOC, and Ministry of Finance are hosting a press conference at 10 am Beijing time. Further articulation of consumption policies would be interesting. China’s Uber for truck drivers company Full Truck Alliance (YMM U.S.) announced Q4 results after the Hong Kong close/pre-U.S. market opened. Asian equities were higher overnight, led by Hong Kong, Thailand, and Indonesia, while Vietnam was off as Trump’s cabinet tried to talk up markets on tariff deals after the close as the U.S. dollar weakened. However, it is important to remember that Trump’s cabinet is made up of staff and not stakeholders, as only the big guy counts. Hong Kong had a strong day, though volumes were a touch light, and advancers trounced decliners, led by Hong Kong’s most heavily traded stocks by value, including Xiaomi, +7.22%; Tencent, +2.95%; Alibaba, +1.64%; Meituan, +6.39%; and Semiconductor Manufacturing International, +6.6%. The NPC’s government work report contributed to Hong Kong-listed growth stocks' strong outperformance, though it was a broad rally. Superman was flying as CK Hutchison (Hong Kong ticker 1, how cool is that) gained +21.86% after selling their Panama ports to BlackRock (founder Li Ka-Shing is known as Superman for his business acumen). Mainland investors bought a net $1.08 billion worth of Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs, including Alibaba, which was a large net buy via Southbound Stock Connect. Mainland China had a good, but not great, day as technology and growth stocks also outperformed, though decliners outpaced advancers. Remember, stocks are reflective of consumer confidence. Real estate stocks were a rare underperformer in both markets, though remember there are very few stocks left in MSCI indices, which is why we’ve favored the bonds over the stocks. It is interesting that CATL fell by -0.76% as electric vehicles weren’t highly noted. The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech gained 2.84% and 4.02%, respectively, on volume down 4.02% from Tuesday, which is 167% of the 1-year average; 428 stocks advanced, while 65 declined. Main Board short turnover decreased by -12.87% from Tuesday, which is 169% of the 1-year average, as 16% of turnover was short turnover (Hong Kong short turnover includes ETF short volume, which is driven by market makers’ ETF hedging). The growth factor and small capitalization stocks outperformed the value factor and large capitalization stocks. The top-performing sectors were Information Technology, +6.23%; Materials, +3.92%; and Communication Services, +2.99%. Meanwhile, the worst-performing sector was Real Estate, which fell 0.30%. The top-performing subsectors were industry conglomerates, semiconductors, and construction materials. Meanwhile, household appliances were the worst-performing subsector. Southbound Stock Connect volumes were light of late as Mainland investors bought a net $1.076 billion worth of Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs, led by Alibaba, a large net buy; Tencent, a moderate net buy; Xiaomi, Ubtech Robotics, and Hua Hong Semiconductors, which were small net buys; SMIC and Meituan were small net sells. Shanghai, Shenzhen, and the STAR Board gained 0.53%, 0.41%, and 0.29%, respectively, on volume up 4.12% from yesterday, which is 129% of the 1-year average; 2,180 stocks advanced, while 2,798 declined. The value factor and large capitalization stocks outperformed the growth factor and small capitalization stocks. The top-performing sectors were communication services, +1.40%; financials, +1.31%; and consumer discretionary, +1.09%. Meanwhile, the worst-performing sectors were real estate, which fell 1.07%; health care, which fell 0.52%; and consumer staples, which did an inverse James Bond to close down by 0.07%. The top-performing subsectors were construction machinery, internet, and telecommunication, while leisure products, petrochemicals, and real estate were the worst. Northbound Stock Connect volumes were above average. CNY and the Asia Dollar Index rose versus the U.S. dollar. The Treasury bond curve steepened. Copper and steel fell.

Title: Tech and Non-Tech Stacks to Run Listen Notes (2025)
URL: https://www.listennotes.fm/p/tech-and-non-tech-stacks-to-run-listen
Time Published: 2025-03-05T15:59:28Z

I wrote about the tech stack of Listen Notes in early 2018 (with a slight update in 2019) in a blog post that got shared several times on Hacker News. It’s 2025 now, and with the evolution of our product lineup, my mindset, and technology itself (plus the decay of outdated tools), I think it’s time for a refresh. Back in 2018/2019, during the early years of Listen Notes, I focused on how to build products fast and get the right product off the ground. It was our “building phase”—similar to opening a new coffee shop, where you focus on interior design, sourcing coffee beans, designing the menu, etc. Now in 2025, Listen Notes has a mature product lineup. Our main focus has shifted to stability (aiming for ~100% uptime) and sustainability (ensuring Listen Notes remains a key player in podcasting even 10 or 20 years from now), much like running a coffee shop that consistently serves great coffee day in and day out. Listen Notes, Inc. is a company I started in October 2017. Initially, it was a single-page web app to search podcast episodes by keyword. This is how listennotes.com looked like in 2017: As you can see, the 2017 version of ListenNotes.com was quite basic. I hope this inspires you to launch your own web projects. Remember, launching is just the beginning—most of the work comes afterward. Now in 2025, Listen Notes is one database with three user interfaces (UIs): One Database: The best podcast database with high-quality metadata and (ideally) close to zero AI-generated fake podcasts. Three UIs to query the database: A website for discovering podcasts: ListenNotes.com A Podcast API for developers to integrate podcast discovery into their apps: PodcastAPI.com A “bring your own UI” option where you get raw data from us and use your preferred UIs (e.g., Excel, Google Sheets, SQLite, etc.) to explore the data. We also offer a few small-ish products. For example, we have a Cloudflare-based open-source CMS called microfeed and a fast podcast transcription/summarization tool called Listen411 (or Transcript.New). At this point, Listen Notes has more than one person to work on it (with a single-digit team size, and some even part-time). The exact number fluctuates based on our current technical and non-technical tasks. I believe we’ll see more companies like this—lean, efficient teams where not everyone needs to be full-time. I’ve been inspired by how Gumroad is run. I’d like to openly share how we run Listen Notes. However, as a private company, I can only disclose what I feel comfortable with. Like other companies (e.g., 37signals), we strive for a certain level of transparency but choose not to share revenue or highly detailed stats. While some startups embrace radical transparency (kudos to them!), most companies—including ours—prefer to keep some things private. We appreciate your understanding. You might find this article interesting: The Golden Era of Being an Open Startup Is Gone. There’s a darker side to human nature—when you try to be transparent, some people criticize you for not being transparent enough. It’s like donating to someone, only to be told it wasn’t enough. Let’s see how this goes. Fingers crossed. This will be a long post, but here’s a quick summary of the Listen Notes tech and non-tech stack in 2025. (Apologies if some cool, new tools you love are missing!) Engineering OS: Ubuntu Linux Cloud Hosting: Amazon AWS, Google Cloud, Cloudflare R2 + Pages Web Backend: Python, astral-sh/uv, Django, uwsgi, Nginx, supervisord Web Frontend: ReactJs, Tailwind, Webpack, Volta Async Workers: Celery, bash scripts, Docker DevOps: Ansible, Slack Datastore: Postgres, Elasticsearch, Redis, ClickHouse Dev Tools: Parallels, Vagrant, Packer, PyCharm Monitoring & Alerting: BetterStack Performance & Security: Cloudflare CDN / Firewalls / Turnstile Payments: Stripe, PayPal AI-Assisted Coding: ChatGPT Design: Figma Non-Engineering Documents: Notion, Microsoft Office 365 Legal: Clerky, Stripe Atlas Contractors / Freelancers: UpWork, 99designs, Facebook Groups Payrolls & Benefits: Gusto, Lively, Schwab, E*TRADE Domain Names: Cloudflare Registrar Helpdesk: HelpScout Emails: Superhuman, Google Workspace, Cloudflare Email Routing Small Website Building: microfeed.org with Cloudflare R2 & Pages Banking & Credit Cards: Mercury, Amex, Chase Bookkeeping: Quickbooks Online Office / Company address: WeWork The main products of Listen Notes are not particularly “technical”, because we don’t do deep AI research like OpenAI or build defense tech like Anduril or cure cancer. We just build superficial CRUD apps—like many web products today. As mentioned earlier, our main web app consists of one database and three UIs. Our code lives in a monorepo containing Django/Python for the backend, ReactJs for the web frontend, and various bash scripts/Ansible YAML files for DevOps. We use multiple data stores, including Postgres, Elasticsearch, Redis, and ClickHouse. Other small-ish projects (like microfeed and Listen411) have separate repos, but this article primarily focuses on our main Listen Notes business—the monorepo. If I remember correctly, the most profitable AWS products are all database-related. While we run on AWS, we don’t pay for those managed database products—we run open-source datastore software on AWS EC2 instances for cost efficiency. Sustainability is key: we want to provide excellent service without running out of money. Personally I enjoy shopping for new EC2 instance types—comparing specs, pricing, and benchmarking—especially after AWS re:Invent each year. It's a bit like how others love shopping for handbags, watches, or cars. I don’t know if it's a healthy (and admittedly expensive) hobby! We use Postgres as our primary data store, which has grown to over 1.2 TB. In the doomsday scenario, even if the code base or servers were gone, with our Postgres dump, the business could be restored. That’s how critical it is. When Listen Notes started, we used Postgres 9.6; now we’re on Postgres 17.0 (as of writing this post in early 2025). I remember each major upgrade vividly, almost like flipping through a family album. Our Python code—running on async worker servers (from compute-optimized EC2 instances like c5 to c6i to c7g)—ingests and processes podcast metadata, which then flows into Postgres. Most data related to the website (e.g., user info) & API are also stored in Postgres. Our Postgres cluster typically has 3 (sometimes 4 or 5) instances: one primary (for writes and some reads) and several read-only replicas with short query timeouts (e.g., 30 seconds). These servers run on storage-optimized EC2 instances (e.g., i3 → i3en → im4gn & is4gen). We avoid AWS RDS for cost and control reasons (e.g., lack of root access). Over time, we’ve accumulated many custom bash scripts for routine DBA tasks, some scheduled, others ad-hoc. The heart of Listen Notes is our podcast search engine. We index all public podcasts and episodes in the world—now totaling over ~200 million documents. (For comparison, in 1998 Google indexed ~25 million web pages, which was a lot then.) Our Elasticsearch cluster runs on storage-optimized EC2 instances. Whenever a podcast or episode is added, updated, or deleted, we sync the corresponding document from Postgres to Elasticsearch. We run periodic jobs to keep the two copies of data almost perfectly in sync. Search queries—whether triggered on the website, via the Podcast API, or from internal scripts—are routed from our Python code to the Elasticsearch cluster. We store analytics data (like API / listen / search logs) in our own ClickHouse installation. Added to our tech stack around 2020, ClickHouse has proven to be robust and fast for data warehousing. Kudos to the ClickHouse team! We rely on Redis as a cache for rate limiting, feature switches, and other performance-critical functions. Our Redis instances, hosted on memory-optimized EC2 instances, are among the longest-running servers in production, sometimes for 2–3 years before an instance upgrade—remember I enjoy shopping for new EC2 instance types? :) Technically, our “one database” is the logical “Podcast Database.” In practice, various data types are spread across Postgres, Elasticsearch, ClickHouse, and Redis. Even data like API / listen / search logs contribute indirectly (e.g., to our Listen Score). In any CRUD app, the data layer is critical—and it’s especially true for our business. In today’s world, UIs aren’t necessarily graphical—APIs and even voice interfaces (e.g., Amazon Echo) count. For Listen Notes, our three UIs are: Our website is a typical Django app with Views, Models, Celery tasks, and more. When I first wrote Listen Notes (late 2016), I used Django 1.9 and Python 2.7; today, we run Django 5.1 and Python 3.13. We organize our Django code into “apps” (e.g., playlists, episodes, datasets) with standard files like views.py, models.py, and admin.py. As some files grew large, we broke them into multiple view files (e.g., views_xxx.py, views_yyy.py, views_zzz.py, etc.) We used to use virtualenv and pip, but since early 2025 we’ve switched to uv. We found that uv is extremely useful for managing multiple Python projects across various versions—even when some dependency libraries don't yet support Python 3.13. Most webpages on ListenNotes.com are partly server-side rendered (Django templates) and partly client-side (a React single-page app compiled via Webpack with Volta to pin NodeJs versions). Although some criticize JS bundles and prefer vanilla JavaScript, we haven’t found major issues with our current approach. We simply cannot commit to a multi-week migration project based solely on a random blog post on the Internet—what works as best practices for others may not suit our needs. For async tasks triggered by user events (e.g., sending transactional emails), we offload to Celery async workers. In production, Django is served via uwsgi (managed by supervisord) behind an nginx load balancer. We group uwsgi processes to prevent one slow page type (e.g., search) from affecting other page types (e.g., feed). I wrote about building our Podcast API a few years ago. While the core remains the same, we’ve added more API endpoints, data attributes, SDKs for multiple languages, and even a self-hosted code playground. We launched the API in December 2017, and it’s now integrated into thousands of apps and websites. Initially, we used RapidAPI (then Mashape) to manage and monetize the API. However, after experiencing multiple RapidAPI outages, we spent a month building our own API gateway. This not only improved our reliability but also saved us from paying RapidAPI's 20% commission fee. While paying 20% might be acceptable for a side project, it's simply too high for a serious API business. Our API gateway is now part of our monolithic Django app, handling rate limits, authentication, authorization, caching, and the actual request processing. To let users try the API without writing code, we built our own multi-language code playground using Docker for an isolated environment. We allow customers to export raw podcast metadata and explore it in their favorite tools (Excel, Google Sheets, etc.). As a small business that serves many other small businesses, we favor an on-demand pricing model. Small customers might spend $10–$20 multiple times a year to access just the data they need, while larger customers can purchase the entire podcast database delivered as a SQLite file. We have extensive Python scripts to handle batch data exports and automatically deduplicate records from previous orders. When we first started Listen Notes, we used Sketch for all our design assets. In mid-2018, while working with a designer on our website redesign, we were introduced to Figma. Since then, it has become our go-to tool for all design assets. I know some idealistic developers believe everything on the Internet should be free or that the only moral way to earn is via a 9-to-5 job or donations. Listen Notes is a for-profit company—like a coffee shop, we have operating costs, and the people behind Listen Notes need to earn a living. If money wasn’t a concern (e.g., maybe become a trust fund kid in my next life?:), Listen Notes might be 100% free. We monetization via the aforementioned three UIs: UI #1 (Website): Free for 99.9% of users (with ads), with some premium features behind a paywall (no ads). Instead of forcing long-term subscriptions, we offer one-time “2-day passes” (think Disneyland tickets) by default, which many customers repurchase over several years. UI #2 (API): Operates on a freemium model. There’s a free plan for side projects, a self-service PRO plan (with fair pricing—if you use zero requests, you pay nothing), and an Enterprise plan involving a sales process. UI #3 (Data Exports): Self-service options let users buy a small piece of data on demand, while enterprise customers follow a full sales process. We use PandaDoc for contract management and both Stripe and PayPal for payment collection. Using two payment processors offers peace of mind in case one fails or bans us. We appreciate Stripe’s highly friendly and competent customer support, along with its excellent developer experience. However, when it comes to handling dispute charges, PayPal significantly outperforms Stripe. Any business that accepts credit card payments will inevitably face customer disputes—malicious claims are simply unavoidable. Fortunately, Listen Notes experiences only one or two disputes per year. When processed via PayPal, our win rate is nearly 100%, compared to about 15% when handled through Stripe. To be clear, this isn’t Stripe’s fault; it’s the credit card networks (Visa, MasterCard, American Express) that ultimately decide the outcome, with Stripe merely acting as the intermediary. To minimize disputes, we follow several best practices: offering a great product, providing excellent customer service, and ensuring that customers clearly understand the terms before payment. For our self-service tools, we display a prominent modal that outlines the terms and requires customers to click the “I Agree” button before proceeding. While this might deter some users, it effectively reduces the risk of future disputes—a trade-off we are willing to make. Additionally, our self-service tools automatically send PDF invoices to customers. These invoices are created by taking a screenshot of the HTML version of the invoice using headless Chrome and Puppeteer. Running a database business means continuously maintaining and cleaning the data. Our internal tools help us: Manually review newly added podcasts to ensure they don’t violate our content policies. Auto-detect AI-generated fake podcasts and streamline the review process. Handle user account operations (merging duplicate accounts, blocking bad actors, etc.). Toggle feature switches to ensure confidence when launching new features. Enhance customer support by instantly retrieving all essential details about a specific user or podcast—it’s like having a co-pilot. … These internal tools are built into our monolithic Django app and include a web portal as well as ChatOps (command-line tools within Slack) for quick operations. We maintain several small repos for AI/ML projects, primarily for features like “PEOPLE ALSO LIKE THESE PODCASTS.” But recently, we’ve had to use AI to fight AI — With tools like NotebookLM making it easier than ever to mass-produce fake podcasts, spammers have begun inserting casino links into AI-generated podcasts and distributing them across platforms. Listen Notes was the first to crack down on this issue. We developed multiple models to detect AI-generated fake podcasts and even open-sourced a simple one: notebooklm-detector. A few months ago, we reached out to Notebook LM’s lead PM to ask if they had tools for detecting Notebook LM-generated audio. She initially said yes but struggled for weeks to follow up before eventually leaving Google with several colleagues. It’s unclear how serious Google is about this project. Regardless, fighting AI-generated fake podcasts remains an ongoing effort. We invested in a maxed-out Mac Mini with an M4 chip to train models and refine our detection and review process. We’ve also uploaded some generated fake podcasts to Kaggle, hoping the community can collaborate to combat AI-generated spam effectively. We host our repos on both Bitbucket and GitHub for vendor redundancy. All production servers run on Ubuntu Linux. As for our devbox, we run Ubuntu inside Parallels + Vagrant on macOS. I personally code in PyCharm. I tried VS Code a few times in the past few years but always returned to PyCharm (I'm sorry; I promise I'll give VC Code another try in a few months to see if the chemistry is there. :) I also used GitHub Copilot for a year (2024) but eventually canceled the subscription. Nowadays, I often rely on ChatGPT for writing small bash scripts, React components, or Python functions—it’s like having an intern to do self-contained coding tasks for $20/month. In 2017, we used three $10/month DigitalOcean droplets. In early 2018, we switched to AWS (thanks to WeWork’s $5,000 AWS credits). Since then, we’ve become a loyal AWS customer. While cheaper alternatives exist, the cost of downtime or poor support is far higher in human and customer trust terms. AWS remains our choice, even though it’s our second biggest expense after human costs. For EC2 instances, we always purchase reserved instances and pre-pay where possible. It’s a significant expense but well worth it. We provision servers using Ansible. This lets us spin up an EC2 instance and have it fully configured automatically. Our primary data (in Postgres) is our single source of truth, replicated across multiple servers in realtime. We also run daily backups like this (encapsulated in a cron job): Run pg_dump on one of our read-only Postgres servers. Encrypt the dump with GPG. Upload to AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Cloudflare R2 - I hope these three public companies don’t lose our data all at once :) We deploy our Django and React code directly from MacBook Pro using an Ansible-orchestrated script. Our process is simple and effective—compile assets (JS/CSS), upload to Cloudflare R2 (served via Cloudflare CDN), and check out latest Django code on production servers via Ansible. A load balancer (nginx) ensures zero downtime by temporarily removing some uwsgi processes during deployments. In the past, we used Datadog, PagerDuty, and Atlassian Statuspage, costing ~$3,500 annually. As a small business owner, I frequently evaluate whether there are more affordable and better alternatives to the tools we use. Recently (early 2025), I found BetterStack. And we’ve already moved our entire monitoring & alerting stack to BetterStack—a bundled solution that cut our monitoring costs by 90% and offers responsive, friendly support. All requests to ListenNotes.com & Podcast API pass through Cloudflare, which provides CDN, firewall, and DDoS protection. We’ve set up custom firewall rules for different web pages and API endpoints. Our internal tools also integrate with Cloudflare’s API, allowing us to block or challenge malicious IP addresses with a click. To protect some compute-intensive pages on our website, we used to use Google reCAPTCHA, but since early 2025 we’ve switched to Cloudflare Turnstile—it's free and works well. We periodically upgrade key software components—such as Ubuntu, Postgres, Elasticsearch, and Django—to apply bug fixes, introduce new features, enhance security, and boost performance. Additionally, we update our EC2 instance types to optimize the price/performance ratio. Each upgrade is meticulously planned and rehearsed, which has prevented outages over the past eight years. These tasks remain too critical to fully trust to AI for now. This section covers the non-technical aspects of running the company—the parts I wish someone had shared at length when I started Listen Notes in 2017. Great customer support is the best form of marketing. I personally reply to most customer support emails, typically within an hour (and almost always within 12 hours). Two key tools help us do great customer support: Documentation & Help Articles: We use HelpScout for our helpdesk (listennotes.help). We used to use Intercom until I switched to HelpScout: more affordable and better! Email Client: I use Superhuman. Over the years, I’ve accumulated a lot of email snippets that lets me reply to most customer support messages within seconds—right inside Superhuman using shortcuts. We treat our customers the way we wish to be treated by any software or hardware vendor's support team. As customers, we all want prompt responses and we want to deal with honest, friendly, and competent human beings. We have multiple marketing channels. But the two most effective channels so far are: Providing great customer service that leads to positive word-of-mouth. Buy Google Ads. We’ve experimented with Facebook and Twitter ads, but Google Ads has proven most effective for us. We hold several checking accounts with major U.S. banks and Mercury that allows no-fee international wires. Why do we maintain checking accounts at multiple banks? Simply in case one experiences technical issues, goes bankrupt, or de-banks us—vendor redundancy gives us peace of mind. We also park our cash in Vanguard (VUSXX yielding 4+% as of early 2025). Caveat: Opening a Vanguard business account required multiple phone calls—a true test of patience. For business credit cards, we favor: Amex Business Gold: 4x points for advertising and software/hardware (except AWS). Amex Blue Business Plus: 2x points for all expenses under $50k/year. Chase Ink Business Preferred: 3x points for travel expenses. Amex Amazon Business Prime: 5x cashback on Amazon expenses, including AWS. These cards help us maximize rewards by allowing points transfers to airline and hotel loyalty programs (e.g., Chase to Hyatt), significantly reducing our conference travel expenses. We incorporated Listen Notes, Inc. through Stripe Atlas in 2017. Stripe’s customer support has always been friendly, competent, and incredibly helpful. For quick legal paperwork, we use Clerky, which offers on-demand pricing. For more complex legal matters, such as sales contracts, we work with a local law firm. We’ve used Notion since early 2018 for wikis and project planning. While it might not be perfect for every feature, it consolidates many useful tools in one place. We maintain runbooks for DevOps, DBA tasks, financial tables, and monthly kanban boards. Although cool kids use Linear nowadays, Notion works well for our small team. We also pay for Microsoft Office 365 to ensure compatibility with enterprise customers who rely on Word, Excel, and Teams. Since 2017, Gusto has reliably handled our payroll without excessive upselling. We also use it to send job offers, which significantly streamlines the process. Additionally, Gusto manages our payroll-related taxes, including withholding taxes and W-2 forms. It's a very reliable service—we love it. We use Lively (integrated with Schwab) for HSA and E*TRADE for 401k. It took me quite a while to figure out how to do these things—a lot of Googling, Reddit-ing, and many phone calls with other humans in the pre-ChatGPT era—but I’m glad it’s finally done. This might be the fun (or not-so-fun) part of being a small business owner! I personally believe that in the future, it will be normal for people to work multiple part-time jobs and have multiple income streams. Pay cycles will likely become more frequent than the traditional bi-weekly paycheck—ideally in real time, where you get paid immediately after completing a task. At Listen Notes, we frequently work with contractors and freelancers. A common example is hiring a CPA for tax prep—there’s no need for a full-time, in-house CPA at a tiny company. For design work or experimental projects, we often turn to platforms like Upwork or 99designs. I also enjoy hiring multiple people for the same task and comparing their results. While this approach can be more expensive, I value redundancy and having options. Occasionally, we also find freelancers through Facebook Groups, generate contracts using Clerky, and process payments via Gusto. We register dozens of domains through Cloudflare, GoDaddy, and Namecheap (since some TLDs are only available on certain registrars). Our corporate emails (e.g., hello@listennotes.com) are managed through Google Workspace, while some wildcard/project-specific addresses are handled via Cloudflare Email Routing (e.g., hello@listen411.com). BTW - we have several domain names for sale. Email hello@listennotes.com if you are interested: breaker.fm listen.host listenhost.com inka.fm Aside from our core products, we run several small websites using our own opensource project microfeed - Listen Notes Changelogs: changelog.listennotes.com Our mascot llamacorn: llamacorn.listennotes.com Listen Notes brand assets: brand-assets.listennotes.com Microfeed is a lightweight CMS built on the Cloudflare stack and originally designed for podcast hosting. Using microfeed allows us to host these “micro” sites on Cloudflare at virtually no cost. We plan to create more fun “micro” sites with microfeed in the future! Before COVID, we had a small office at WeWork. During the pandemic, we shifted to working from home. Now, we've returned to a dedicated private office at WeWork, which also serves as our business address. While knowledge workers can technically work from home, having a separate workspace often boosts productivity—at least it does for me. We do bookkeeping on our own using Quickbooks Online. While there was indeed a learning curve for us in early 2018, we have steadily improved over the past few years. Many VC-funded tax startups aim to generate recurring revenue by offering bookkeeping services (kind of like SaaS?), which in turn helps justify their valuations. However, as a small business owner, you might not need these services. If your financial operations are straightforward, handling bookkeeping internally can deepen your understanding of your business finances and enhance your financial acumen. After all, if you can flip binary tree, there's no reason you can't grasp some basic financial principles :) Thanks for reading this long blog post. I truly wish I’d had a resource like this when I started Listen Notes in 2017. I hope sharing our practical tools and practices can help others running a small software business. You don't have to chase every new tool or tech trend. Many of the tools we rely on have been around for over a decade—some even longer. In fact, podcast as a media format is 20+ years old! Our focus remains on stability and sustainability. We’ve been around for 8 years. Look forward to next 8 years~ This blog post was initially published at https://www.listennotes.com/blog/tech-non-tech-stacks-to-run-listen-notes-2025-113/ No posts Ready for more?

Title: The price of Wegovy was just cut by more than half — if you pay cash
URL: https://qz.com/wegovy-ozempic-novo-nordisk-price-cut-insurance-1851767802
Time Published: 2025-03-05T15:07:00Z
Full Content:
Following in the steps of its rival Eli Lilly (LLY), Novo Nordisk (NVO), the maker of the blockbuster drug Ozempic, is cutting the price of its weight loss drug by more than half for patients that pay without insurance. Novo Nordisk announced on Wednesday that it is now offering all doses of its popular weight loss drug Wegovy for $499 a month. That’s a more than 60% discount from the drug’s $1,349.02 list price. The catch is the offer is only available through the company’s direct-to-consumer service, NovoCare Pharmacy. And it applies only to uninsured patients or those with commercial insurance that doesn’t cover obesity treatments. “Novo Nordisk continues to advance solutions for patients that improve affordability and access to our medicines, whether they have insurance or not,” said Dave Moore, executive vice president of U.S. operations at Novo Nordisk, in a statement. “With NovoCare Pharmacy, patients and prescribers alike have another option that provides convenient access to all doses of real, FDA-approved Wegovy at a reduced cost in our high-quality pen.” Eli Lilly launched a similar offer last year through its direct-to-consumer program, selling the lowest doses of its weight loss drug Zepbound starting at $399. However, the medication came in single-dose vials, requiring patients to use a traditional syringe instead of the more convenient auto-injector pen that treatment usually comes in. Since then, the company has lowered the price and expanded the program to include all dose sizes. Novo Nordisk’s announcement comes as Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently removed semaglutide — the active ingredient in Wegovy and Zepbound — from its drug shortage list. The move put pressure on companies that have been able to sell off-brand, or compounded, versions of the drug amid past shortages. The FDA said that state-licensed pharmacies and physicians, known as 503A compounders, must stop making and distributing off-brand semaglutide products by April 22. Outsourcing facilities, known as 503B’s, have until May 22 to do the same. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: The 100 Best Artworks of the 21st Century

By The Editors of ARTnews, Art in America March 5, 2025 8:00am A global recession, a pandemic, 9/11, the Arab Spring, Brexit, the rise of Web 2.0, unrest in the face of economic stability, wars in Afghanistan, Ukraine, Gaza, and elsewhere: these were but a few of the many events that have defined the past 25 years, a period characterized by tumult and uncertainty. That all may explain why art appeared to change faster than ever all the while, with artists burning through styles and tendencies with each coming year. With the 21st century now at the quarter point, we’ve taken the opportunity to pinpoint the greatest artworks of the past 25 years. Even though we set down some parameters for ourselves (more on that here), it was no small task—one made more difficult by the restless creativity of artists during this period. The joy of an epic list like this one is that it can’t encapsulate everything: we know we’ve left some artworks off, simply because there was no shortage to choose from. We hope you’ll discover some amazing pieces here, reflect on some that are much-loved already, and debate the merits of others. And moreover, we hope to learn of new artworks through the conversations we hope our list inspires. Below, a look back at the greatest 100 artworks of the 21st century so far, as selected by the editors of ARTnews and Art in America. This article features contributions from the following writers: Francesca Aton, Andy Battaglia, Daniel Cassady, Anne Doran, Sarah Douglas, Maximilíano Durón, Alex Greenberger, Harrison Jacobs, Tessa Solomon, and Emily Watlington. Even from pictures, I can still feel the headache I got from this work’s pungent presence. Half a million cigarettes lean against each other to form a tiger skin carpet; walk around it, and see the colors change. By the time it premiered at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, the world’s tobacco-growing capital had shifted from Virginia to China, where Xu Bing is based. Yet in Chinese branding, “Virginia Tabacco” and other romanticized references to colonial lore still abound. Xu chose the cigarette brand 1st Class because it was one of the few still grown and distributed in the United States. The work’s mass and materiality were not only stunning and stinky; the piece’s enormity gave a glimpse of global supply chains. —E.W. In the uneasy images from this series, crowds of people look up at trees or poles that seem totally unremarkable. In fact, those trees once contained something horrifying: lynched Latinx, Asian, and Native American men. These lynchings have not often been recognized in the historical record, and Ken Gonzales-Day wanted to call attention to them. Rather than reproduce the bodies of these men, however, Gonzales-Day used image editing software to remove them. The focus here, instead, is the white people who attended the lynchings, creating a public spectacle of this brutality and then circulating images of it via postcards, which the artist collected. Gonzales-Day’s jarring images force viewers to reckon with a form of collective violence that is perpetrated by regular people, frequently with little to no consequences. —M.D. Before becoming an artist, Jordan worked as a diver. Underwater, she became fascinated by the symbiotic relationships shared by sea cucumbers and certain fish, who hide from predators in, of all places, the sea cucumber’s anus. Longing for such symbiosis, she turned to the potato, a German transplant much like herself, welcoming it in. First, she made a video in which she appeared to grow a potato in her own butt. Then, when the Humboldt Forum reopened in Berlin in 2021, the project got a second life. In protest of the institution, Jordan replied to the Forum’s invitation with a proposal astronomically overbudget. Home to looted objects in what was once an Imperialist palace, the Forum was occupied by Friedrich II—the king who made potatoes, native to the Andes, a German staple. Miraculously, the Forum accepted. At the grand reopening, Jordan lined the entrance with 3D-printed copies of her rump—33 of them, that butt-shaped number—all with tubers growing from her anus. This cheeky retort to nationalism and imperialism was a reminder that Germany’s treasures, even its cuisine, are extracted from elsewhere. More recently an image of Jordan’s potato-filled rump was used on posters protesting Germany’s crackdown on immigration, as if asking, will they deport kartoffel next? —E.W. Produced in the wake of Occupy Wall Street and a couple years after Meta (né Facebook) made facial recognition ubiquitous, Zach Blas’s Facial Weaponization Suite explores the sinister undercurrent of our surveillance state. For the work, Blas held workshops to collect the facial data of participants, and aggregated it to produce what he termed “collective masks.” Bulbous, strange, and an off-putting shade of magenta, the masks are meant not only to make users unidentifiable, but to protest the technology’s supposed objectivity. The most successful of them, Fag Face Mask, was generated with data solely from queer men in response to efforts to use the technology to determine sexual orientation, a goal obviously ripe for pseudoscience and stereotyping. Other versions respond to the targeting of immigrants and other minorities. More than a decade later, with immigrants, minorities, queer, and trans people under ever-heightening threat, perhaps it’s time to take up Blas’s call to challenge the techno-capitalist order. —H.J. As Schutz’s canvases have grown larger and her compositions more elaborate over the years, it is easy to forget the raw energy of the “Frank” paintings. An exhibition of them, at the now-defunct Zach Feuer gallery in New York, was the first time many of us encountered Schutz’s work and the punch that it packed. The show was called “Frank from Observation,” Frank being a fictional character Schutz made up; he lived on a desert island and was the last person alive. I’ve always considered the title of the show a double entendre: To paint something frankly is to paint something made of paint. Or, as David Salle has observed is Schutz’s greatest asset, “the imagining is inseparable from the paint itself.” (Or, again, as Nicole Eisenman put it more recently: “Someone like Dana Schutz is fantastic because she is painting with her eyes closed.”) This painting stands out from the other Frank paintings in the series because Frank has apparently become something else: a proboscis monkey. Is his mind so addled from isolation that he is imagining this? Is this a painting of Frank’s imagination? The mysteries have only deepened and become more complex with Schutz’s more recent canvases—which have occasionally courted controversy, as one did during the 2017 Whitney Biennial. —S.D. Barriers (Stanchions) comprises rows and rows of retractable belt barriers, arranged to form a maze. At the end stands a vinyl poster printed with a poignant statement borrowed from materials disseminated by the organization Immigration Equality: “FOR LGBT IMMIGRANTS, DEPORTATION CAN BE A DEATH SENTENCE. IT’S TIME FOR A NEW APPROACH.” What would such an approach entail? Surely, one that requires fewer of these seemingly innocuous barriers seen everywhere from national borders to airports, from DMV offices to museum admissions desks. —A.G. Wellness often gets talked about as if it is a science: Which treatments are the best, and how do they work? This leaves out a whole lot: the feelings elicited by buying things in search of healing, and the culture that wellness has brought about. Long before Gwyneth Paltrow’s pivot to Goop girlboss, Shana Moulton created an alter ego named Cynthia who was obsessed, like Paltrow, with finding the perfect cure. Cynthia isn’t trying to sell you anything, though. In this 10-part online soap opera, absurdist videos show Cynthia chasing the high of trying something new. She does so with a wink and a nod—and also with earnest hope, something that distances Whispering Pines from the woman-hating found in many critiques of wellness culture. Moulton’s series was pivotal in steering feminist art’s conversations about bodily difference toward the realm of disability, making space for ailments as a subject in art. —E.W. New Red Order, a public secret society founded in 2016 that comprises artists Jackson Polys, Adam Khalil, and Zack Khalil, along with their collaborators, has slyly critiqued settler colonialism via installation art that calls for greater recognition than simple land acknowledgments. The group’s film Give It Back: Crimes Against Realty focuses on the Land Back movement, which seeks the return of ancestral lands to Indigenous people. Commissioned by Creative Time, the film features testimonials about white people who have given their land back, but this is no documentary. Jim Fletcher, a white actor who has played Indigenous characters, is shown here giving an MTV Cribs-style tour of the Upper East Side apartment that houses the Gochman Family Collection, which focuses on Indigenous contemporary art. Fletcher then uses the New Red Order film as a platform to recruit others to the cause. This is a classic New Red Order gag in which irony and seriousness combine, confusing any potential allies. As usual, New Red Order gets the last laugh. —M.D. This video was a case of right place, right time. As serious conversations about the presence of Confederate monuments in American cities were gaining momentum, the Serbian artist made this essay film about monuments cropping up in the Western Balkans after the Yugoslav wars. These statues offered a means to remember histories without heroes: The artist dubbed them “turbo sculptures,” drawing on turbo-folk, a musical genre that emerged in the former Yugoslavia, combining folk tunes with techno. The video introduces bizarre statues of Bruce Lee in Bosnia, then Rocky Balboa and Johnny Depp in Serbia, asking whether these pop icons represented a healthy rejection of nationalism, or just denial in the wake of ethnic wars. Turbo sculpture’s absurdism was not unlike that proffered by other Eastern European artists who were introduced chaotically to capitalism’s dizzying variety. Last year, for her Kunsthalle Vienna retrospective, Domanović updated the work to account for the citizen toppling of the Bruce Lee statue, a reminder that nothing is permanent, neither humor nor history, no matter how sturdily sculpted. —E.W. The US military’s Iraq War–era insistence that waterboarding was not “torture” defied credulity. Bilal made a proposition to test the claim. Online, the Iraqi artist created a poll, asking the world to vote: Should he waterboard a dog or himself? If waterboarding wasn’t torture, after all, it should be no big deal to enlist others—or was it only no big deal when Iraqis were the recipients? Bilal “won” the poll after PETA stepped in (fair enough, considering the artist was the only consenting party). On video, he covered his face in cloth before pouring water over it in a process that simulates drowning. At the end of the video, Bilal, choking, says that “anyone who said it’s not torture should try it.” Here as ever, he puts his skin in the game in solidarity with the many other bodies on the line. —E.W. This brilliant artwork correctly diagnosed the art fair as a site for entertainment: Visitors pay their $30 admission and expect something big and shiny in return, and so, we got Jeff Koons’s diamond rings and hanging hearts and balloon dogs to gawk at—what critic Ben Davis called “bling conceptualism,” exemplified by Terence Koh redoing a Sol Lewitt in gold leaf and bronze (along with a gold leaf and bronze pile of dog poop). When you strolled past the booth of Gavin Brown’s Enterprise at Art Basel Miami Beach 2006 and saw nothing but a crumpled-up cigarette pack on the floor, you felt swindled. But if you stood there for a moment and waited, the thing, attached by transparent fishing line to an unseen mechanism in the ceiling, started dancing around. It is still one of the funniest things I’ve ever seen, a real fuck-you to the whole system. —S.D. In the mid-’90s, Laura Aguilar began a body of work in which she photographed herself and others in the nude, in a variety of landscapes. “Grounded,” her final series and the only one she ever did in color, was photographed in the rugged desert landscape of Joshua Tree National Park. These images are most impactful when they verge on abstraction. In Grounded #111, we see her nude body from behind in front of a much larger beige rock. She is seated on the ground, her back curving as she leans forward, and it takes a second to register that her body is indeed a body at all. The majesty of this natural landscape now includes Aguilar, and that was exactly her point: She wanted viewers to confront her nude fat body and appreciate it in the same way one might contemplate a desert. In doing so, Aguilar forced viewers to confront their own standards of beauty. —M.D. Growing up in Manhattan—specifically, Chelsea—Johnson has witnessed the increasing privatization of urban space firsthand. “Loiter” began when he noticed a certain form this phenomenon took: those medieval-looking spiked-metal contraptions affixed to standpipes, installed to prevent people from sitting on them as benches have become increasingly rare. To draw attention to this form of privatization, and to intervene in it, Johnson began removing the spikes from public areas, displaying them in galleries. This made the standpipes potential seating once again and produced new sculptures too. The effect is critique and repair together: not just a found object with a dark story, but one whose displacement is a victory. —E.W. During the 2005 Venice Biennale, Frieze magazine sent out SMS messages with hints as to what you would see in the national pavilions. The one for Germany was especially cryptic: The display was said to be “so contemporary.” This was the first time many encountered—“encounter” being the operative word—the work of Tino Sehgal, whose performers were seen dancing around you as soon as you made your way into the building. “This is so contemporary, contemporary, contemporary!” they sang. Sehgal had by then become known among curators as one of the primary figures associated with relational aesthetics, a tendency in which artists offered conversations and interactions, not objects, as artworks. A fair number of such works were whimsical and moving: Rirkrit Tiravanija’s 1990s meals-as-art come to mind. But This Is So Contemporary! was relational aesthetics at its most charming. —S.D. When President Joe Biden ended the war in Afghanistan, he did so abruptly: US troops left overnight with no real plan in place for an Afghan future. Predictably, the Taliban took over the next day. In their scramble, the troops left behind a bunch of trash: Gatorade bottles, junk food bags, tires, jugs. Hazara kindly collected all that garbage, effectively cleaning up the mess the Americans left behind for a gesture he has referred to as “a gift to the American people.” Then, he assembled it all into various installations that have traveled to Melbourne, Milan, Bombay, Kolkata, Sharjah, and Berlin. Next fall, at SculptureCenter in New York, the trash will return home, in a pointed provocation ultimately made of flimsy, powerless stuff. —E.W. Santiago Yahuarcani was one of the standouts of a 2024 Venice Biennale that celebrated the vastness and underacknowledged variety of the world, and El mundo del agua (The world of the water) is one of the paintings that broadcast his spirited engagement with Indigenous histories and allegiance to the land. As a member of the Aimeni (White Heron) clan of the Uitoto Nation of northern Amazonia, Yahuarcani channels stories of cosmological creatures, colonial conflict, and ancestral legacies, often on llanchama (a type of parchment made from bark). In El mundo del agua, mermaids rise, snakes writhe, and a marine organism smokes a pipe—all with a sense of intricacy and electricity that make it seem ancient and contemporary at once. —A.B. Though her output has encompassed a dizzying range of mediums, German artist Isa Genzken is best known for her sculpture, from fabricated pieces such as her lacquered-wood “Ellipsoids” of the 1970s and architectonic cast-concrete pieces of the late 1980s to her mixed-media assemblages of the 1990s (which, being in step with the work of younger American artists like Rachel Harrison and Jessica Stockholder, brought her increased visibility in the United States). Despite shifts in modes and materials, a consistent theme in Genzken’s art has been a fascination with modernist design and architecture, particularly their interaction with the messy business of urban life. First shown at New York’s AC Project Room in 2000, “Fuck the Bauhaus (New Buildings for New York)”—a group of six sculptures pieced together from scraps of found cardboard, foam core, plastic, and glass—epitomize the irreverent yet formally sophisticated approach that has marked Genzken’s art for half a century. —A.D. Kudzu, a fast-growing plant that the American government brought from Japan to the US in 1876, is an invasive species that is difficult to contain. In this installation, however, kudzu is something to behold, a species that fascinates because of its unwillingness to be hemmed in. Taking the work’s title from a Fred Moten essay, Precious Okoyomon intended the kudzu as a parallel for Blackness, given the plant’s history as a means of fighting the lingering environmental effects of cotton production in the American South. Fittingly, the artist has described both kudzu and Blackness as being “indispensable to and irreconcilable with Western civilization.” —A.G. Four decades ago, the Guerilla Girls made a name for themselves by provocatively calling attention to the disparities faced by women artists within museums and galleries. In 2018 they returned with an incisive rumination on how the art world handles allegations of sexual harassment and assault against artists—straight white males in particular—in the wake of the #MeToo movement. For this work, the Guerrilla Girls took on the case of artist Chuck Close, who the previous year had been accused of sexual harassment by women who had modeled for him. They presented three versions of a museum wall label for the artist’s 1992 portrait of Bill Clinton: one for museums “afraid of alienating billionaire trustees,” one for “conflicted” museums, and one for “museums who need help from the Guerrilla Girls.” The final text is the only one to mention the allegations; it ends with “the art world tolerates abuse because it believes art is above it all, and rules don’t apply to ‘genius’ white male artists. WRONG!” The work reminds viewers that even something as simple and didactic as a museum label is never objective. —M.D. The community of Kinngait (known as Cape Dorset until 2020) in Nunavut, northern Canada, has produced such renowned Inuit artists as Kananginak Pootoogook, Pitseolak Ashoona, and Kenojuak Ashevak, largely through the West Baffin Eskimo Cooperative, an art studio established in 1959. Until late in the 20th century, works from this cooperative tended toward subjects such as birds, fish, and other animals, as well as idealized scenes of traditional Inuit life. Both Ashoona, Annie Pootoogook’s grandmother, and Napachie Pootoogook, her mother, however, were among the first Inuit artists to create autobiographical artworks. Following their example, Pootoogook likewise based her drawings on personal experience, including her struggles with addiction and—as here—abusive relationships. Her work found fame in the larger world (it was included in Documenta 12 in 2007), but the artist drowned in Ottawa’s Rideau River in 2016 at age 47. Whether an accident, suicide, or murder, her death remains a mystery. —A.D. The imminent has at last caught up with Tishan Hsu, whose work since the 1980s has imagined how digital technologies might transform our visual world, our consciousness, and even our bodies. The pieces Hsu made while a denizen of the 1980s East Village art scene comported with the quasi-minimalist sculptures of the time, but they differed from those by, say, Ashley Bickerton or Haim Steinbach in that they pondered a data-driven future rather than a commodity-oriented present. As Hsu told art critic Martha Schwendener in 2021, “All of my work is really an effort to come up with something that would convey this paradigm that I felt would become very influential, that would have a huge impact on our reality, and that I was already seeing [happen] in much simpler ways.” By the 1990s Hsu was using emerging software like Photoshop to create silk-screened works with photo-based imagery. Since then, rapid advances in computer imaging have afforded the artist the tools he needed to produce hybrid pieces like this one, which combines references to bodies (photos of eyes and flesh-colored silicone protuberances); a screenshot of a quotidian exchange between a user and a program; and an enveloping, vaguely reptilian digital “skin.” —A.D. Perhaps you want to license a digital photograph of a nubile young woman bent over an open dishwasher and smelling a freshly laundered flip-flop? You can do so, for only $200, via DISimages, a library of stock photography that enlisted artists such as Katja Novitskova, Dora Budor, and Anicka Yi to produce the hundreds of images hosted on a website that effectively offers the same services as iStock and Shutterstock. The photographs DIS sold here appropriate the sleek brightly lit aesthetic of stock pictures, except that here, all the subject matter appears dark and downright bizarre. Was DISimages an ironic stunt, a ploy for attention? Not even the collective’s members could agree. But when DISimages went viral on social media, it laid bare an online appetite for meaninglessness, with a side of absurdist humor. —A.G. Debates about who is allowed to represent whom lit the internet on fire when Dana Schutz showed a painting of Emmett Till, a Black teenager abducted and lynched by a white mob, at the 2017 Whitney Biennial. In one particularly controversial remark, Schutz defended herself, saying, “I don’t know what it is like to be black in America. But I do know what it is like to be a mother.” Hamishi Farah extended her logic, painting a blond child Farah claimed was Schutz’s son, Arlo, an image of whom he had found online. In so doing, Farah asked how it feels to have one’s child painted into a political debate. —A.G. In this 11-minute film, one of the most intimate artworks I’ve ever seen, we watch Sophie Calle’s mother’s final moments. At first, the French artist hadn’t meant for the video to be art at all; she had simply left a camera rolling in her mother’s final days, hoping to stay connected when she had to step out and run errands. But then she noticed something profound she thought was worth sharing: though in the footage you are watching someone die, death itself is impossible to see. In the video, Calle’s mother is shown lying still in bed, and after she dies, she simply lies still some more—this is a moving image that doesn’t move. Here, Calle managed to show me something I’d truly never seen before, even though it happens every day. —E.W. After the curator Okwui Enwezor stumbled upon a screening in India by the history-major-turned-filmmaker Amar Kanwar, he liked the film he saw—A Season Outside (1997)—so much that he commissioned a sequel. The follow-up, A Night of Prophecy (2002), premiered in Documenta 11, Enwezor’s defining exhibition that ushered in contemporary art’s so called “global turn.” In this feature film, Kanwar records vernacular poetry—sayings people share—derived from times of conflict, spanning eleven languages from across India. In one memorable line, a young Dalit boy asks his mother whether he is Hindu or Muslim. She replies with a searing line borrowed from a 1970s Prakash Jadhav poem—one likely passed down orally, as few Dalits then had access to literacy education—telling him, “You are an abandoned spark of the world’s lusty fires.” A Night of Prophecy implies that history is recorded not through timelines or forensics so much as the traces of poetry that they leave behind, the stories those most affected pass down. —E.W. A multitude of artists mined archives of all kinds during the 21st century, re-presenting information about under-examined histories in unexpected ways. Tiona Nekkia McClodden exemplified the trend with her multipart “Brad Johnson Project,” examining the archive of the Black American queer poet Brad Johnson, who died in 2011. In a series of 10 videos, McClodden recites Johnson’s works; the final entry shows her hanging upside-down as she reads his 1988 poem “On Subjugation,” as a way to make visceral the subjugation Johnson describes. For the installation version of this work, McClodden places a screen showing the video behind the structure from which she was suspended; that structure is itself hung with her boots and accompanied by a smattering of earth, rose petals, and naval and leather/BDSM paraphernalia. Taken together, these objects give us a fuller sense of Johnson and the life he lived. In looking to queer ancestors of the past and filling in the gaps, McClodden was able to make something wholly new, moving, and poignant. —M.D. Why does the woman in this picture look so familiar? Because she’s meant to. Conceptual artist Christopher Williams’s work, usually produced by professional studios, often mimics 20th-century commercial, ethnographic, or architectural photographs. While deconstructing how such photographs continue to shape our present late-late-capitalist reality, the artist also deconstructs how they were made—here, by including a usually hidden Kodak tool. The photo’s subject is a model Williams chose using the criteria given in a casting call for Jacques Tati’s 1967 film Playtime. Her pose, open-mouthed smile, and towel-wrapped hair vividly recall bath soap ads of the 1960s and ’70s. In another nod to Kodak, the towel is the exact shade of the company’s signature yellow packaging. Despite, or perhaps because of, such extreme deliberation, the resulting artwork is as seductive as the advertisements that inspired it. —A.D. Informed by a visit to a pearl-making facility in China in 2014, this video captures the delicate and repetitive tasks Mika Rottenberg witnessed—in particular, the extracting and sorting of pearls. In her absurdist take on the subject, Rottenberg links these activities with a range of other seemingly unconnected ones: an administrative worker rings a bell that prompts a Chinese factory worker to turn a handle, powering a fan that then blows pollen from a bouquet of flowers into her nose. The sneezes that result mimic the way that oysters, when irritated by grains of sand, eventually produce pearls. But you don’t need to know that Rottenberg’s strange fictions are in fact based in truth for this video, which highlights the global economy’s various forms of exploitation and production that ultimately give way to the treasures we call our own. —F.A. Like many of the most memorable creations by the perennially probing and prescient Pierre Huyghe, After ALife Ahead became all the more identifiable as a work by Huyghe when it started to stray from the control of the artist himself. He created this work—a “time-based bio-technical system,” as he called it—for the 2017 edition of Skulptur Projekte Münster, where it took the form of a sort of excavation of a former ice rink that was transformed into an alternately earthy and technology-abetted biosphere, with materials including bacteria, algae, bees, human cancer cells, and phreatic water (water from below the water table), along with a variety of snail whose patterned shell provided information that triggered sound- and color-changing aquarium glass. Altogether it was a kind of tribute to old and new life forces that are stranger than science-fiction. —A.B. It would be easy, in 2025, as Ai Weiwei produces countless LEGO re-creations of art history, to forget just how revolutionary the Chinese artist-activist’s work has been. Travel back to 2008, however, and Ai was in a very different place in his career. That year, a devastating earthquake hit China’s Sichuan province, killing nearly 90,000 people. It was a national tragedy made more devastating by the government’s censorship of information about it. No one truly knew the scope—no one outside the immediate area, that is—until Ai created “a citizen investigation team” to interview survivors, uncovering widespread corruption in building construction, which was to blame for many of the deaths. That effort resulted in Straight. For the installation, Ai and his team collected 200 tons of mangled rebar rods from schools that had collapsed and meticulously straightened them by hand. The rods were then laid out to resemble tectonic plates in a gallery where the names of 5,000 schoolchildren who had died in the quake were displayed on the walls. A tribute to those lost, the installation is a crushing emotional experience to walk through. And, as Ai recalled in 2018, Straight and his other works around the earthquake made him “the most dangerous person in China.” —H.J. South African photographer Zanele Muholi, whose work was the subject of a recent retrospective at Tate Modern, prefers to be known as a visual activist. Born in 1972, they began studying at photojournalist David Goldblatt’s famed Market Photo Workshop in Johannesburg in 2001. The following year, they began photographing members of South Africa’s LGBTQI community, individuals whose rights are constitutionally protected but who are nevertheless frequent victims of discrimination, harassment, and sexual and physical violence. In the series of portraits “Faces and Phases” (2006–14), from which this photograph is taken, Muholi focused largely on Black South African lesbians and trans men, a population with which the artist most identifies. While Muholi has since expanded into theatrical self-portraits and color images of LGBTQI people in public places, these tender black-and-white depictions, which insist on the humanity of their subjects, remain some of Muholi’s most poignant images. —A.D. For nearly a decade now, rafa esparza has transformed institutions with installations made of adobe. His installation tierra, made for the 2016 edition of the Hammer Museum’s Made in L.A. biennial, was among the first of these high-profile interventions, covering the museum’s north terrace with adobe bricks that were produced using dirt from Elysian Park, the site of Dodgers Stadium, which had once been a vibrant Chicano community known as Chavez Ravine. At the Hammer, esparza installed found objects in his adobe brick road, including a mailbox and a blue armchair accompanied by a cactus. Such interventions, esparza has said, stem from his “interest in browning the white cube” as a “response to entering traditional art spaces and not seeing myself reflected.” A vital part of this project has been enlisting members of his community in his art: He learned to make adobe bricks from his father, and for this iteration, he brought on his mother and siblings to help out. —M.D. When Luc Tuymans debuted this painting in the aughts, it seemed that the world had little use for more images of Condoleezza Rice. Then National Security Advisor to President George W. Bush, she was responsible for controversially authorizing waterboarding in the so-called “war on terror” while advocating for the invasion of Iraq, falsely claiming the nation possessed weapons of mass destruction. But the Belgian artist’s portrait and its attendant commentary would prove more relevant still. Tuymans was inspired to paint Rice after her 2005 trip to Belgium, when the nation’s foreign affairs minister called her a “strong, not unpretty woman.” Her neck and chin are cropped out, and her brow is furrowed. The painting’s sickly grays and muted beiges offer a decidedly unheroic vision of this high-ranking politician, neatly encapsulating the distrust of authority that was in the air post-9/11 in the US and beyond, and turning the power dynamics of portraiture on its head. —A.G. In 2014 Israeli soldiers in the occupied West Bank shot and killed two unarmed teenagers, Nadeem Nawara and Mohammad Abu Daher. The case hinged at the time on whether the soldiers used rubber bullets, as they claimed, or illegally fired live rounds. Together with Forensic Architecture, the London-based research group that investigates armed conflicts, Lawrence Abu Hamdan performed an acoustic analysis of the gunshots, audio of which was captured and disseminated widely alongside video of the incident. Israel initially claimed that its soldiers could not have killed the two teens, but Abu Hamdan’s research suggested otherwise: The soldiers, he ultimately proved, had fired live rounds. A year or so later, he reimagined the body of evidence as Earshot, an installation comprising photographs, video, and audio. The gallery thus became another court of culpability. Here, art functioned as journalism should, with the power to hold politics accountable to fact. —T.S. During the late ’90s, Apple’s Macintosh computer touted a sleek aesthetic, distinct from the less user-friendly PC. That’s why, for this “desktop performance,” as the artists call it, the Dutch duo JODI—Joan Heemskerk and Dirk Paesmans—used a Mac to induce a dizzying experience, one at odds with Apple’s claims of seamlessness. Using an OS 9 operating system, JODI opened up folders within folders, files upon files, until it all climaxed into chaos. Hosted as an interactive work on JODI’s website and later recorded via screen capture, the piece required its user to close out of an overwhelming barrage of windows, putting Apple’s marketing to the stress test. With My%Desktop, one of the defining works of net art, JODI shows how Apple streamlined, and perhaps even sanitized, the act of computing, alluding to how the corporation tried to obscure computational processes. —A.G. Wangechi Mutu had in mind a specific mother while creating this collage: Funmilayo Anikulapo-Kuti, whose son was the pioneering Nigerian musician Fela Kuti. Yet the woman shown here is just as easily a stand-in for many more women, specifically “all the mothers who give us our voices and empower us to be who we are and believe in our talents,” as Mutu put it in an interview published alongside her 2023 New Museum retrospective. Her subject is shown sinking a stiletto into the neck of a severed serpent, a “monster that managed to span two … continents,” per Mutu, who has also said that the work shows opposites colliding: “African/European, archaic/modern, religion/pornography.” The result is a fantastical world filled with disco balls and gigantic jellyfish, with implicit critiques, unglued from reality, laying the ground for a whole new world. —A.G. This installation was a progenitor of the blockbuster immersive video boom that critics love to hate. Indeed, it got the kinds of criticism such videos get today: that it was too pretty, that it was merely spectacle. When it debuted at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, Jerry Saltz wrote that the piece served as but a backdrop while visitors typed on laptops or hung out. In protest of the video’s lulling, hypnotic appeal, another artist even staged a yoga class inside MoMA. But beneath the piece’s consumable veneer, Rist sneaked in something subversive: this sleepy, gorgeous film is about menstrual blood. In it, Rist’s protagonist sets out to collect her menses in a silver chalice, but rendered in fuchsia instead of scarlet. Floating freely in an underwater world, her blood feels palatable, even pretty. Rist’s feat was making menstrual blood as boring and ordinary as it really is. —E.W. Paul Chan’s 1st Light conjures a sense of wonder by way of a sort of shadow play projected on the floor. For 14 minutes, in a state of soundlessness that grows more and more profound, the work cycles through a succession of slow-motion imagery that fluctuates between the familiar and the abstract. As if backlit by a window nowhere to be found, a series of squiggles and lines is accompanied by the silhouettes of birds flying off in the distance. Then, shortly after, the shadows of bodies begin to tumble and fall upside-down, turning the mood unmistakably somber. The presence of streetlights and railroad cars suggests an urban setting being torn asunder, and in that, 1st Light summons memories of 9/11 that remain just as haunting now as they were when Chan debuted this work in 2005, four years after that tragic day. —A.B. In 2010 Basel Abbas and Ruanne Abou-Rahme were in Palestine, watching the Arab Spring uprisings through social media. The images of protesting, dancing, and singing that passed through the digital slipstream made them determined to counteract the amnesia of the internet. That impulse evolved into an ongoing project to document and preserve Palestinian culture against its ongoing erasure at the hands of the Israeli state. The work has taken many forms: installations, an interactive web project, public performances, and sculptures. While the ground-level urgency of May amnesia… has never been more clear following the decimation of Gaza, the work is also formally daring. By engaging a digital vernacular that blurs boundaries between artist, subject, and audience, this work refuses a frozen, historicized vision of Palestinian identity. We are still here, the work says in so many ways—still dancing, still singing, still resisting. —H.J. Louise Lawler took this photograph just after Art Basel Miami Beach held its first edition. The weirdness of the fair—its rampant commercialism and fast-paced sales, both seemingly at odds with much of the conceptual art showcased there—may explain Lawler’s unusual approach to photographing Marian Goodman Gallery’s inaugural booth at this event. Here as in other works, Lawler takes aim at works by her well-known male colleagues—in this case, Maurizio Cattelan’s sculpture of Pablo Picasso and Thomas Struth’s photograph of a museum. Rather than shooting these objects straight-on, Lawler pictures them mid-install, such that the head of the Cattelan sculpture is shown separate from the body, which lies on a blanket beneath the Struth photograph. With the Cattelan sculpture represented as though decapitated, Lawler dressed down Picasso, that symbol of male genius, while also offering an unglamorized glimpse of how the sausage that is the art world gets made. —A.G. Themes of capitalism, colonialism, and immigration meet in this work, a one-to-one replica of Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi’s Statue of Liberty. The work’s 300 or so pieces commissioned in 2010 from a fabricator in Shanghai remain forever disassembled. Depending on how they are exhibited and where, the isolated pieces resemble welded copper abstractions, salvaged artifacts or scrap metal sold on the cheap (one piece was even reported missing in 2014). Myriad readings befit the installation, which alludes to the malleability of state symbols, particularly those purporting to represent freedom—whatever that currently means in America. “We the People is not about going to the past,” Vo said of the work on its debut. “Since it’s one of the most important icons for Western liberty I think [it] is very much about the present and our future.” —T.S. For 10 months, artist Paulo Nazareth traversed the Americas, starting from his home state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, and ending in Miami, for an edition of Art Basel Miami Beach. Nazareth has described the trek, covering several thousands of miles and 15 countries, as “a residency in transit” and an “accidental residency.” Along the way, Nazareth documented what he saw in photos, videos, texts, and found objects, providing a firsthand look at how grueling the process of migrating from South America to the United States can be, both physically and geopolitically. In one image from the series, a tiny US flag lies under the artist’s bloated dirty feet; in another, he stands before a sign demarcating the Arizona state border holding a placard that reads WE HAVE RIGHTS AT THIS LANDSCAPE. In many ways, the project points to the absurdity of man-made borders, particularly when confronting the perseverance needed to navigate them. —M.D. Second Life, a multiplayer virtual platform popular during the 2000s, beckoned users with the promise of a fresh start in an online-only world. Yet in using the platform for this piece, Cao Fei showed that digital dreams were inextricable from the IRL world. Named after the shorthand used to describe the Chinese yuan, RMB City may have seemed like an escape from 21st-century China, whose citizenry had been reshaped—and alienated—by attempts at globalization. In Cao’s alternate reality, one found a floating panda, carefully manicured fields, and a giant spinning wheel set on a sunny blue isle. But one also found the stuff of unchecked urbanization: a crane, slick yet scarcely populated skyscrapers, a smokestack belching fire. All this combined to form a landscape that was at once familiar and fantastic, showing how our fantasies are hard to cleave neatly from the worlds we know. —A.G. When this 2-channel, 37-minute piece debuted, the animation felt frighteningly cutting-edge. Over a decade on, it’s still uncanny. It’s clear now that this owes less to the technology, which is already dated, than to how Atkins uses it, blending CGI’s sleek hyperrealism with realism of a gritty variety. The computer-generated skinhead protagonist of Us Dead Talk Love has phrases tattooed on his face—they change over the video’s duration, from ASSHOLE to FML to DON’T DIE. We watch him smoking, shirtless, singing a melancholy tune with lyrics proclaiming that love makes us sad, and sadness makes us drink. Scenes show a limp dick, a man passed out at the bar, words like ENFEEBLED and DISAFFECTION hovering in cheesy fonts. It’s all chillingly affecting—its sadness too real, its presentation not real at all, the video’s sheen incongruous with its sorrow. As ever, it’s Atkins’s skillful, poetic writing that carries the piece. —E.W. The protagonist of Wildness is not a person but a place: the Silver Platter, a Los Angeles bar that narrates the film. Founded in the 1960s in the city’s MacArthur Park neighborhood, the Silver Platter has long offered a safe haven to LA’s queer and trans communities, as well as to immigrants from Latin America. (The bar shut down in 2010 and has since reopened under new management.) The film’s backdrop is the bar’s weekly “Wildness” party, organized by director Wu Tsang, who also stars, and DJs NGUZUNGUZU & Total Freedom. Noirish shots of the bar and its environs, weekly drag performances, and people dancing are interspersed with talking-head interviews. Amid all this is a moody narration spoken by Mariana Marroquín and drawn from oral histories by Tsang. Wildness is a portrait of both a bar and a community built by it, where “the struggle to find adequate labels/identities/descriptors for this ‘community’ is precisely what the film is about,” as Tsang once put it. —M.D. Posters and ephemera salvaged from the streets of Mark Bradford’s South Central Los Angeles neighborhood are layered to form the surface of this unconventional painting, which he made by sanding down its various strata, exposing fragments of information embedded between them. The result looks like a form of cartography—a map, perhaps, of a dense network found in the vast metropolis that Bradford calls home. Yet the painting is not only a celebration of South Central: Its title refers to a Roman term of appeasement used to distract the public from more substantial issues, like poverty and disenfranchisement. The work’s beautiful surface could serve as a similar kind of distraction, but his materials make clear that he’s dealing with real problems impacting his community. —F.A. We may want to imagine that nostalgia-inducing franchises from the past are set in stone. But Cory Arcangel suggested with his 2002 installation Super Mario Clouds that everything is inherently fungible. To make the work, Arcangel undertook the laborious process of hacking a Super Mario Bros. cartridge, removing every element except the game’s pixelated clouds and vibrant blue sky. Presented on monitors and projected on nearby walls simultaneously, those clouds now float on without Mario, Luigi, or their cohort to race around beneath them. From the detritus of consumerism, Arcangel forged something new: an artwork that resembled its source material in spirit alone. —A.G. The sculpture represents a person with the creviced face of a 50-year-old man and the body of a grade-school boy—the contrast would be jarring enough even if it weren’t, well, him. Cattelan himself said he nearly destroyed the piece depicting Adolf Hitler after completing it, but in the end, he made it in an edition of three (a fourth copy, the artist’s proof, sold for $17 million at Christie’s in 2016). We think of Hitler as a dark cloud looming over history, but here we are able to look down on the man, who is posed as a supplicant. Cattelan called the piece “a test for our psychoses.” He completed it in early 2001; a half year later came 9/11 to prove that, pace Fukuyama, history had not ended. We live in it still. —S.D. Some 15,000 objects—roughly half of which remain at large today—were looted from the National Museum of Iraq in Baghdad after the American invasion of the country in April 2003. A few years later, Michael Rakowitz set out with the goal of creating to-scale reproductions of every stolen artifact, a project so epic that it is still ongoing. Each replica is made using Middle Eastern commercial packaging for foodstuffs and local Arabic newspapers that were then exported to the US. Though these looted artifacts are now made visible once more, Rakowitz’s efforts also underscore the fragile nature of the originals, which may never return to the Museum. The piece doubles as both a form of institutional critique and a kind of research art: Accompanying labels reveal each original object’s status, and provide additional contextual information about its whereabouts from experts. —F.A. One way to establish intimacy with an audience is to stage an artwork that revolves around plaintively strumming a guitar while naked in a bathtub and singing a song that tugs at the heart and explodes with emotion. That is what Ragnar Kjartansson did for The Visitors, a mesmeric nine-screen video installation that features the Icelandic artist and a cast of his friends bowing, plucking, and picking their way through a cryptic piece of music whose soft spot for slyness and sentiment is clear. Though the title alludes to the name of Swedish pop group ABBA’s last album, the lyrics draw from a poem written by Ásdís Sif Gunnarsdóttir, Kjartansson’s ex-wife, with whom he had recently split. The words aren’t easy to decipher (they’re both sad and uplifting, and the breakup was said to be amicable), but they strike an improbably moving chord when they cycle back around to a much-repeated chorus: “once again I fell into my feminine ways.” —A.B. When Jill Magid was denied access to the professional archives of Mexican architect Luis Barragán—which were bought by the Swiss furniture company Vitra—she turned the problem into an opportunity, steering the genre of institutional critique away from museums and toward corporations. First, she contrived clever ways to get around copyright restrictions. Instead of paying a licensing fee to reproduce a photograph, for instance, she bought a book that had already printed it, then framed the whole book. Forbidden from re-creating his iconic pyramidal lectern, she skirted copyright law by adjusting the scale—that is, until a French show under new jurisdiction required she throw a blanket on top. Despite these persistent public pleas, archival access remained restricted. Then, Magid managed permission for something even wilder: with the consent of Barragán’s family, she exhumed his ashes and turned them into a diamond, which she then used to propose to the archive’s keeper. The offer of her proposal still stands. —E.W. If you needed a reminder of the sheer power of this artwork, you had a chance to see it last year during Paul Pfeiffer’s survey at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. I saw that show, and can report that John 3:16 has aged exceptionally well, given that, if anything, we revere sports stars even more now than we did at the turn of the millennium. On a tiny screen, a basketball appears to dart around a court in the absence of players, their hands merely hinted at. You have to get up close to see this little screen, as you would with a liturgical manuscript. (The piece is named for the famous biblical passage: “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”) In casting basketball as revelation, Pfeiffer mined footage from the NBA, splicing together clips with the utmost meticulousness, doing for the game what Christian Marclay did for time with The Clock. —S.D. After the Yes Men made DowEthics.com, a website spoofing Dow Chemicals, they received an invitation from a BBC journalist who was apparently not in on the joke. Andy Bichlbaum, a member of the art collective, gleefully accepted, appearing in front of 350 million viewers on the 20th anniversary of the 1984 Bhopal disaster that exposed hundreds of thousands of Indians to toxic gas. The artist, pretending to be a businessman, took “full responsibility” for the gas leak at a pesticide plant and issued an apology to the thousands killed and the many more rendered chronically ill. Stocks plummeted; the Dow retracted. The Yes Men highlighted the authority we bestow on white men in suits, then wielded that power against, well, power itself. —E.W. In the 1980s, after retiring as a machinist at the Pullman boxcar factory in Bessemer, Alabama, Thornton Dial started making assemblage sculptures and reliefs. By the time of his death in 2016 at the age of 87, he had been widely recognized as a major contemporary artist whose work—materially inventive, formally rigorous, and politically astute—rendered the distinction between trained and self-taught immaterial. In 2011 Dial embarked on a series of reliefs inspired by natural disasters, including the Tuscaloosa tornadoes of 2000 and the Japanese earthquake and tsunami of 2011. In this piece, an undulating wave of tree branches, torn metal, and scraps of sequined fabric set against a watery blue and white painted background, he memorialized the devastation Hurricane Katrina caused in New Orleans in 2005 and its disproportionate effect on the city’s largely Black Lower Ninth Ward. —A.D. When the Statue of Liberty reopened following its eight-year hiatus, the mood was tense. Though the destruction of the 9/11 attacks that prompted the closure was in the distance, the trauma of that fateful day remained present. Steve McQueen captured the spirit of this post-9/11 moment with Static, a film in which the camera circles the motionless Lady Liberty pinned to a tiny island not far from Manhattan. Shot from a helicopter, McQueen’s film takes on the perspective of the surveillance technology that became pervasive after the Twin Towers fell, but offers no direct statement on wounded national pride, and thus comes off confounding rather than clarifying. Therein lies its power: It’s a disorienting gesture for a directionless time. —A.G. Jana Euler has strategically deployed ugly images, sometimes in bad taste, as a means of aesthetic assault, and though nearly every one of these efforts is a banger, her most provocative pictures are the ones in her “GWF” series (2019), in which elongated sharks leap out of the ocean. There can be no mistaking the fact that these sharks, with their ribbed gullets and raging heads, look more than a bit like erect phalli. Yet these sharks are hardly seductive: the one shown in GWF 1 flails ungracefully, bearing its teeth and gazing down at the viewer, who seems poised to become the fish’s lunch. Large for a phallus and agile for a shark, Euler’s apex predator is no object of admiration. Instead, it’s simply a dick joke. —A.G. On its face, Daniel Joseph Martinez’s The House America Built seems like a simple, large-scale installation of a small cabin split in two and painted in complementary colors. But what house is this, really? That’s the point of Martinez’s inquiry: the place could belong to just about anyone, even though his reference points are highly specific to American history. The structure is a 1:1 replica of the remote cabin that Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber, built and lived in, and the color palette draws from Martha Stewart’s seasonal collection of interior paints. Kaczynski and Stewart are both Polish Americans, born within a year of each other, and while they took very different paths in life, both were incarcerated in 2004, the year Martinez made the original installation. The piece presents the ends of what Martinez sees as the spectrum of Americanness: Stewart and high capitalism on one, Kaczynski and anarchy and domestic terrorism on the other. —M.D. El Anatsui has made an artistic practice out of stringing together thousands of metal bottle caps to form large, vibrant tapestries, and while he’s repeated the format many times over, it never gets old. Anatsui’s oeuvre reached new heights with this 24-foot-long sheet of caps, which was originally created for the central exhibition in the 2007 Venice Biennale. This work, like his others, cleverly references contemporary overconsumption in material resulting from that consumerism, and is fashioned with gentle folds in a way that recalls traditional Ghanaian craft traditions, like kente cloth. But here, more so than in other works, Anatsui also makes clear that the strung-together caps nod specifically to his own community, whose many members help him make his grandly scaled art. The title, he has said, could be translated from the Ewe to “communal patchwork made by a team of townspeople.” —F.A. Before 3D printing was widely accepted as an artistic medium, Josh Kline embraced it for this unsettling sculpture of a Manhattan hotel housekeeper named Aleyda, whom Kline interviewed and scanned. Featuring to-scale, 3D-printed versions of several of Aleyda’s body parts along with cleaning supplies arrayed on a janitor’s cart, the piece comments on how technology has forever altered the workforce. The plastic cart was purchased and will last, but the body parts and tools of her trade are disposable prototypes about which a question looms: What role will the human hand play in the future of our lives and our art? —A.G. Animators Meriem Bennani and Orian Barki created this series of eight short videos during the first months of the 2020 Covid-19 lockdown in New York City. The videos portray friends, strangers, and the artists themselves as digitally created avatars superimposed on real-life footage. Bennani and Barki star as the titular lizards; friends appear as a snow leopard and a hummingbird, among other creatures; and Dr. Anthony Fauci is depicted as a fanged green snake. Strangely, this approach conveys the weirdness of that time and place more effectively than if the artists had made a straightforward documentary. Moments of panic (the lizards freak out during a nighttime drive through a depopulated Brooklyn) and distress (a hospital-nurse cat recalls helping a wife put through a call to her husband, who is on a ventilator) alternate with scenes of resilience: a Zoom birthday, a stoop meet-up, an impromptu street concert. It is a piercing reminder to anyone who was in the city at that time of just how bizarre things were. —A.D. Pope.L began crawling urban streets in 1978, and though much of his work was made in the 20th century, his influence grew wider after the turn of the millennium. He was overlooked before in part because his public performances were easy to read as regular New York nonsense—and because the art world was not yet ready for his abjection, his pranks, or his Blackness. For this particular Crawl, he shimmied up the entire length of Broadway, going at it in chunks over the course of nine years. And he did so alone, on elbows and knees in a Superman suit. The cartoon-reference humor was strategic: in New York, a Black man on the ground is too likely to be ignored. Pope.L refuted this with a Superman suit that screamed: Look at me. —E.W. To experience this work by Sondra Perry, one must climb onto an upright stationary exercise bicycle, thereby experiencing a degree of discomfort. And discomfort is the point, as Perry’s digitally produced avatar, appearing on the video screen that replaces the bicycle’s control panel, demonstrates when it asks “How does your body feel inside us?” The avatar is an imperfect simulacrum of Perry: Its movements are stuttering, its voice robotic, its body thinner than the artist’s and hairless. This is not Perry’s fault, the avatar tells us, but the fault of the program that created it, which had no preexisting template for Perry’s body type. Over the course of a 9-minute video, the idea of discomfort is expanded to include the question of whether racial uplift must entail making a Black body a neutral body, a process that the avatar likens to working on an exercise machine with its pedals installed backward and no hex key. “We are not as helpful or Caucasian as we sound,” the Perry avatar says. “We have no safe mode.” —A.D. In 2001 Palestinian artist Emily Jacir, who holds an American passport, asked Palestinians unable to enter to Israel, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip, as well as Palestinians in those three places whose movements are restricted, “If I could do anything for you, anywhere in Palestine, what would it be?” For the next six months, she did her best to fulfill their requests, documenting her attempts in text and photos. One man asked her to visit his mother; another asked for a photo of his family (they gave her strawberries and lemons grown on their land to take back to him). A third asked her to pick an orange in Jericho and eat it (this, she was unable to do). About this piece, the late Palestinian-American scholar Edward Said wrote, “[Jacir’s] compositions slip though the nets of bureaucracies and nonnegotiable borders, time and space, in search not of grandiose dreams or clotted fantasies, but rather of humdrum objects and simple gestures like visits, hugs, watering a tree, eating a meal—the kinds of things that maybe all Palestinians will be able to do someday.” —A.D. Many artists this century grappled with how painting for its own sake is seen as a Western construct, with Frieda Toranzo Jaeger’s contribution being among the most articulate. In altarpiece-style works with panels on hinges, she renders her subjects in a manner that appears amateurish; she then hires family members to embroider her surfaces using a traditional Mexican technique. Here, her altarpiece format approximates the shape of a Tesla, a subject Toranzo Jaeger took on after noticing that many fellow Indigenous artists were at work to preserve history in the face of erasure. She wanted to supplement these efforts by ensuring that Indigenous imaginations had a voice in visions of the future, and indeed, her Musk mockery would prove prophetic. In the background of her painting, a mansion standing in for the old world order is on fire; in the foreground, a fast car promises both a getaway and an intimate interior, or a private reprieve. —E.W. When Julia Child’s cooking show aired on TV, her network briefly experimented with open rather than closed captions, meaning they could not be turned on and off. Lazard, a disabled artist, picks up here, remixing an episode of Child’s show but taking its commitment to access one step further. Child already describes her actions, since the show is didactic. But where the captions fail to describe sound (only dialogue) and Child’s monologue neglects the scenery (only directions), Lazard fills in the gaps, looping in D/deaf and blind audiences. All this quickly accumulates into cacophony, which Lazard embraces. The crescendo, narrated by artist Constantina Zavitsanos, is a manifesto overlaying it all. Lazard revealed the limits of treating access as an afterthought; other artists—Zavitsanos among them—followed, making work that Geelia Ronkina dubbed “access materiality.” A movement was born, centered around works taking up captions, ramps, image descriptions, and so on as a medium—all recently chronicled in The Agency of Access, a book by art historian Amanda Cachia. —E.W. For several centuries in the West, history painting was considered the highest form of art-making. Yet its scope was narrow, leaving so much history always overlooked. Artists like Marakatt-Labba revisited the genre in the 21st century, filling gaps by depicting histories that had not yet been told widely. Historjá is a 77-foot-long embroidered epic that translates the tradition into fiber, and ambitiously aims to depict the whole of the Sámi people’s history: their Nordic Indigenous lore, rituals, prosperity, and oppression rendered scene-by-scene via spare tableaux stitched into linen in a manner not unlike the canonical Bayeux tapestry. Refuting any narrative of progress that might posit modernism over Indigeneity, it begins and ends in a forest, whence the Sámi came. —A.G. The 7th Havana Biennial, at which Tania Bruguera’s Untitled (Havana, 2000) debuted, invited artists to explore mass communication in the new millennium. But rather than a great connector, Bruguera framed communication as a tool for exploitation in Cuba. Bruguera’s work comprised fermenting sugarcane piled several inches high in a darkened tunnel in the Cabaña fortress, a military bunker once used to jail prisoners of conscience. At the end of the space was its sole illumination: a small television monitor suspended from the ceiling that played footage of Fidel Castro, who was still in power at the time. Only as they approached the monitor could visitors notice several nude male performers fiercely rubbing their hands together. The piece spoke to all that lay at the limits of vision in Cuba, a country whose repressive leadership has long tried to keep dissent out of sight, out of mind. Untitled (Havana, 2000) didn’t stay on view long—it was shut down by authorities hours after going up—but it was enough to spur on many dissident Cuban artists after Bruguera. —T.S. Cremaster 3 is a strong candidate for the best movie ever about lamb-eating giants, balletically crashing cars, and Richard Serra flinging molten petroleum jelly inside one of our most august sanctuaries for the appreciation and narrativization of art. The longest feature film in a five-part cycle and the last to be released, the 3-hour fantasia plays as a sort of wordless cinematic tone poem filled with considerations of human evolution and reproduction (the “cremaster” muscle controls male testicles, and figures in the sexual differentiation of an embryo) and interconnected allusions to Matthew Barney’s expansive artistic universe. Starkly divergent vignettes vary from mysterious happenings within New York’s iconic Chrysler Building (the site of a surreal staging of six automobiles smashing into one another, over and over again) to an extravagant set piece in the Guggenheim Museum’s famous rotunda that features Busby Berkeley–style dancing, a hardcore-punk battle of the bands, and Barney himself climbing up and down the walls while interacting with a spectral woman who changes form into a cheetah. While it’s far from easy to apprehend, the film proves transfixing in its elusive and hyper-imaginative flights of fancy. —A.B. For an ambitious undergraduate senior thesis, Shvarts artificially inseminated herself each month for nine months—a routine she followed up with an herbal abortifacient. Her work highlighted the uncertainty that accompanies having a body, especially one that can become pregnant, and it drew attention to those womanly experiences that can be traumatic and ordinary at the same time. Each month, she would bleed heavily, not knowing whether the blood signaled a period, a miscarriage, or an early-stage abortion. Shvarts’s interventions lay bare the ways that bodies rub up against ideologies, existing in ways for which we often lack the language or knowledge to express. Or so argued Harvard art historian Carrie Lambert-Beatty in her 2009 October article defending the young artist, who’d been subjected to vitriol, even death threats. —E.W. For a show at Kunsthalle Portikus, located on a small island in Frankfurt, Germany, Raza rerouted the Main River so that it ran right through the museum. He didn’t stop there: inside, he filtered the water through a very fine coffee filter, then boiled it and added some minerals. Suddenly, the hydrologist-approved water was drinkable; guests were offered glasses of it. It was at once a mind-blowing feat and an extremely simple gesture. Beyond that, Diversion was galvanizing for the way it made survival and reconnecting with nature seem well within reach. —E.W. In 2001, a shocking item appeared in eBay’s “Black Americana” category: an object that was labeled “Keith Obadike’s Blackness (Item #117601036).” It came with an opening bid of just $10 and a list of potential benefits and warnings, including one that read: “The Seller does not recommend that this Blackness be used in the process of making or selling ‘serious’ art.” In placing the work for sale on eBay, the Obadikes drew a connection between the history of enslavement, the auction block, and the website’s “Black Americana” category. The listing did not last long: eBay removed it after four days, by which point bidding had risen to $152.50. Yet Blackness for Sale has had a more enduring legacy, serving as an important intervention in the history of net.art, which had until then mostly avoided discussions about race. In doing so, the work prefigured later conversations around Blackness on the internet. —M.D. The practice of quipu-making comes from pre-Columbian Peru, wherein various Andean peoples tied cords and colorful strands into knots to record events, information, and stories. For decades, Cecilia Vicuña has been making sculptural works that bring this age-old format into the present day, often with a feminist undercurrent. This work, one of the biggest pieces in the “Red Thread” series, was made for Documenta 14. Vicuña created 52 red wool strands, or chorros, and suspended them in a circular ring that hangs from the ceiling. The cascade of red fiber recalls the tenuous nature of life itself, bringing to mind flows of blood that result from wounds and menstruation; from certain angles, her wool forms even look like umbilical cords. Vicuña powerfully connects Indigenous modes of communication and feminine wisdom, suggesting that there are forms of knowledge that exist beyond history books and archives. —F.A. For a formative show at Essex Street Gallery in New York (now Maxwell Graham), McArthur gathered 20 ramps, most of which had been improvised to accommodate the artist, a wheelchair user, during her visits to otherwise inaccessible art spaces between 2010 and 2013. The makeshift ramps were made of materials including plywood boards, a cupboard door, and handmade wedges. The show took place more than 20 years after the Americans with Disabilities Act was signed into law, and highlighted both the inaccessible entrances that still punctuated McArthur’s every day and the caring improvisation that ensued. But it was more than an autobiographical show or a complaint about lack of compliance, with McArthur’s most crucial gesture easy to miss: Printed on one wall was the URL for the Wikipedia page McArthur built for Marta Russell, a disabled activist who wrote Beyond Ramps (1998), a book arguing that certain American economic policies are greater threats to the quality of disabled life than impairment itself. McArthur shined a spotlight on how disability is politically constructed, and a whole artistic movement took off in the wake. —E.W. Vertigo Sea seems to take place in the past, present, and future simultaneously, clocks ticking throughout the duration of this arresting three-screen video. Archival oceanic images of whales, seals, and enslaved people recur alongside newer shots of people in 19th-century European garb pondering cloud-covered landscapes. The soundtrack features quotations from the abolitionist Olaudah Equiano and novelist Herman Melville alongside other musings on the ocean, ranging from maritime disasters during the transatlantic slave trade to rising sea levels now and in the future. This haunted 48-minute installation can feel too intense to bear as interwoven historical strands accrete. Akomfrah presents history as an unstable narrative, filled with bits and pieces that get dispersed, reassembled, and reshaped in the wake of so much death and destruction. Conventional senses of time and chronology offer no aid in wading through the roiled waters of history. —A.G. No material is more elemental than earth, which Colombian artist Delcy Morelos enlisted to alternately exhilarating and disquieting effect with El abrazo, an enormous arrangement of dirt (or, more properly, a mix of clay and soil laced with hay and coir) that filled a building in the Chelsea gallery district of New York. Commissioned by the Dia Art Foundation, the work was a sort of counterpoint to Walter De Maria’s New York Earth Room—another Dia installation that is basically the soil-filled floor of a building in Soho on view since 1977. But its purview ventured into more worldly, even cosmological, terrain in the way it channeled Andean, Amazonian, and many other belief systems that have been cultivated through the ages. El abrazo was also a rare artwork that granted permission to touch: as Morelos stated in a brochure, “Let the hands listen, see the smell of the earth with the fingertips, let its taste be savored by the skin.” And then, at the end: “To touch the earth is to be touched by her.” —A.B. During the late 2000s, beer gardens became a familiar motif in works by Nicole Eisenman, who sought to vividly evoke contemporary society; this one is her most poignant. Overtly modeled on Renoir’s Bal du moulin de la Galette, the painting updates that famous tableau for modern times. Eisenman masterfully throws art history into a blender, evoking Impressionism, Expressionism (channeling Munch in particular), and contemporary cartoons all at once. The forlorn tank-topped figure in the foreground, fiddling with his BlackBerry while gazing vacantly at the viewer, is a subtle reminder of the backdrop of this gathering: a global recession. Thus, the painting recognizably belongs to a specific time and place, and fulfills Eisenman’s goal of creating art that belongs distinctly to the present. —S.D. Airport blueprints from around the world form the basis of this 20-foot-wide abstract painting. The emphasis on travel appears biographical: Julie Mehretu and her family fled political instability in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and wound up in East Lansing, Michigan, and the artist is now based in New York. But, ultimately, almost everyone is migratory now, and the painting is an apt reflection of our time. The painting is engrossing up close—its intricate marks draw the eye in—but from afar, the work appears even more resonant. Its dramatic scale mimics the sheer vastness of our world, which seemed to grow ever wider as the economy became more global during the 2000s. —F.A. At the start of this video, nearly all the foul-mouthed, catty protagonists seem to be named Jenny. By the end, they take on other aliases. The fka-Jennys film each other, partake in dance-offs, lob insults, and drunkenly run through chroma-key green halls. Along the way, these characters paint their faces in tones ranging from pewter to green, don wigs, sport fake facial hair, and apply garish makeup. Like all Ryan Trecartin’s videos, Center Jenny epitomizes the frenetic pace and glut of options the internet enabled, emblematizing how people began to adopt personas as they broadcast themselves to the world. No surprise that most TikToks now look a lot like this video, with its chatterbox youths, cacophonous soundtrack, and twitchy editing style. —A.G. The water crisis in the majority-Black Michigan city Flint began in 2014 and remains ongoing. That year, the water source for locals was switched from Lake Huron to the Flint River, whose contaminated flow was soon consumed as drinking water. The community was forever altered by resulting illnesses and death. To offer visual evidence of all the destruction, photographer LaToya Ruby Frazier documented the lives of those impacted by the crisis. The resulting photographs were not only touching and deeply personal but also doubled as a means of exposing environmental injustice. Initially released as a photobook, this series showed that documentary photography need not be either objective or impersonal, plotting a fresh path for this 20th-century genre in a new era. —F.A. For her breakout show at the Kitchen in New York, Yi swabbed DNA from 100 women in the art world and mixed all the samples together. Working with synthetic biologist Tal Danino, Yi installed the bacteria in a glass vitrine, where it bloomed to spell out the titular phrase. The show ushered in a whole new generation of bio art, work that involves using living material as a medium. But unlike the bio art of yore, exemplified by Eduardo Kac’s glowing green bunny, this new wave drew less from synthetic biology and resisted dominating nature. Rather, the bio art Yi heralded reveals and reveres the dense networks of organisms that we depend on to survive. You Can Call Me F melds this idea with a feminist critique of the lone genius, highlighting the support network behind the artist. —E.W. Eight hands draw crooked lines that connect disparate countries. Eight disaffected voices narrate tumultuous journeys—across seas, through cities, into and out of refugee camps. Eight hanging screens feature unbroken takes of hands running markers across maps. Such are the elements of Bouchra Khalili’s Mapping Journey Project, a video installation that concisely highlights the geographic (and bureaucratic) barriers faced by people who left their homelands for new lives in Europe. Khalili captures the difficulties of these voyages, as well as the long-term impact of the pain experienced along the way, playing recorded testimonials from migrants in European cities. Khalili asked all her interviewees to draw using permanent markers, their lines lingering forever on the artist’s maps, like scars running under vast oceans and across mountain ranges. —A.G. What happens when music becomes a weapon of war? This video offers one answer. Here, Tony Cokes draws on the accounts of Iraqi and Afghan civilians who endured a form of torture that involved playing American tunes at a deafening volume. Chart-topping hits from the likes of Eminem and Britney Spears, Metallica and Bruce Springsteen roared as text excerpts from “Disco Inferno,” Moustafa Bayoumi’s 2005 article from the Nation flashed by, slideshow-style. “Disco isn’t dead,” the video informs us at one point. “It has gone to war.” Cokes shows that mainstream music—heard daily on the radio, where it seems so innocuous—can be used as a weapon, a form of psychological manipulation, and a means of American imperialism all in one. —F.A. The task of choosing one Deana Lawson work was excruciating. Unlike most photographers, whose sensibilities are best portrayed through whole projects rather than single images, nearly every Lawson photo holds its own, triumphant in scale and offering lots to look at. Here, as in most of her portraits of Black people in domestic interiors, you are left to wonder what of it is staged. Lace curtains sag awkwardly and seem candid, yet our subject is dressed up in a satin gown with a hole in the front, where her pregnant bare belly protrudes. The outfit is clearly a choice—hardly what one expects in a photo of a person at home—yet its significance is elusive. As ever, Lawson might get you to believe at first that you are seeing an intimate scene. But incongruous details—wearing heels in bed, posters hung upside down—make it clear the setup is contrived, reminding just how little you can know of a person from a picture. —E.W. Maria Eichhorn lent the phrase “paid time off” new meaning with this piece, for which she shuttered London’s Chisenhale Gallery for the time span noted in the work’s title. Employees were directed not to answer phones, not to reply to most of their emails, and not to report to work at all. Instead, Chisenhale’s staff was given five weeks of free time with pay. Meanwhile, the gallery remained shuttered to the public; all there was to see was a sign with a short text that explained the staff was “not working.” The piece was a salient reminder that any artwork exhibited is indebted to the labor of others. —A.G. Rare are the gestures profoundly poetic and political at once, affecting and effecting without compromising one for the other. Mirror Shield Project is among the finest such examples. Luger, a member of the Three Affiliated Tribes of Fort Berthold, was born on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, whose name made headlines during the 2016 #NoDAPL movement protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline, which was scheduled to run through sacred land and disrupt water supply. Inspired by civil unrest that unfolded in Ukraine, Luger made a video showing masses how to construct DIY mirrored shields from simple materials. Protesters arrived in droves, holding the mirror shields up against officials in riot gear, building a barrier while inviting those on the other side to reflect. —E.W. The Atlas Group is credited with numerous artworks concerning the 1975–90 Lebanese Civil Wars. Often, these are detailed and painstakingly comprehensive research-based works: a journal tracking every car bomb detonated during the conflict, photographs of bullet-hole-pocked buildings overlaid with color-coded dots that correspond to different types of ammunition, clues to who fired the shots. The Atlas Group, though, was mostly the work of a single artist: a carefully crafted persona named so that you might trust its authority; the Group is an artwork unto itself. You might wonder how an artist could gather data this definitive or, perhaps, how anyone could. It takes only a mildly studious eye to catch the farce: the date of the group’s origin varies in different shows. The Atlas Group parodied the absurdism in claims to comprehension, and pointed to how facts and data can be hardest to procure when they are most urgent, most politicized. This may seem more obvious today than when the project began, but it isn’t any less essential. —E.W. Over the past 35 years, Andrea Fraser has critiqued the systems and structures of the art world, offering biting commentary on its pretensions and class distinctions largely through venturesome video performances. In Museum Highlights: A Gallery Talk (1989), she passed herself off as a docent at the Philadelphia Museum, flummoxing visitors with an unhinged commentary on the institution and its history as well as social and political issues. More notoriously, in Untitled (2003), she videotaped herself having sex with the anonymous art collector to whom she presold the piece, literalizing the blurred lines between personal and financial relationships in the art business. In this video from 2001, Fraser takes on the Guggenheim Bilbao and its audio guide extolling the glories of the Frank Gehry–designed museum building. Fraser pantomimes exaggerated responses to the guide’s litany of wonders, until, prompted to stroke one of the museum’s pillars, she lifts her skirt and ecstatically rubs herself against it. “Critique,” Fraser told ARTnews in 2016, “at its best is a verb.” —A.D. Simone Leigh won the Golden Lion at the Venice Biennale in 2022 for this sculpture, a 16-foot-tall, 5,900-pound bronze bust. The work originally presided over the High Line in New York City; it is part of a larger series by Leigh in which female forms fuse with historical and contemporary signifiers of Africa and the African diaspora. Here, cowrie shells, a reference to a material used widely in African art, adorn the figure’s cornrows; its skirt honors the architectural traditions of Benin, Togo, Chad, and Cameroon, among others. Few of these references were made plain to viewers, however—if they knew, they knew, and if they weren’t curious, they wouldn’t learn. Brick House evinced a kind of withholding that was widely seen in art of the past decade, rarely with such grace as in Leigh’s sculpture. —T.S. Technically, this piece had a mouthful for a full title: “the Marvelous Sugar Baby an Homage to the unpaid and overworked Artisans who have refined our Sweet tastes from the cane fields to the Kitchens of the New World on the Occasion of the demolition of the Domino Sugar Refining Plant.” Certainly, with this sculpture, Kara Walker gave those artisans their due. It was with this piece that Walker, who had become known for her work in silhouetted paper cutouts that told harrowing stories of enslavement, made a radical shift in scale to the monumental. Drawing on the history of labor in sugar processing, and leaning heavily into the metaphor of its refinement (bleaching from brown to white), Walker created an object that may have tasted sweet but smelled acrid and looked formidable, almost menacing. A sphinx sculpture made from 160,000 pounds of sugar, it was a great artwork—and a controversial one too, many claiming that its highly sexualized representation of a Black woman worked to no end. Like it or not, however, it was a statement of intent from an artist who was just 44 at the time. Walker went on to make other enormous pieces, including a fountain shown at the Turbine Hall at Tate Modern, and remains a force to be reckoned with. —S.D. It was one of those experiences that was so cool you couldn’t believe you got to be part of it. Ace Gallery had a cavernous space in downtown Manhattan, and for this work, it was kept pitch-dark. You were given a little blue penlight and permission to navigate. Here and there, you’d see other blue pinpricks of light—other humans!—but the light was not quite enough to fully illuminate them. There were almost no other objects in the space. By the time he made this piece, David Hammons was already a master of audience participation or, put another way, audience provocation, Exhibit A being a 1983 piece in which he sold snowballs on the sidewalk in New York’s East Village. This work, though, was stranger and more subtle, made during a time—just after 9/11, just after anthrax in the mail—when, in New York, it felt as if we were all fumbling in the dark, wondering what would next happen, what kind of world we lived in, even who among us was safe and who might pose us harm. This Century artwork list was being compiled long before Hauser & Wirth decided to re-create Hammons’s Concerto in Black and Blue at its LA gallery during Frieze Los Angeles this past February; the gallery did well to do so. —S.D. For the 2003 Istanbul Biennial, Doris Salcedo piled 1,550 wooden chairs in a gap between two buildings in the city’s center. Rising almost three stories, the chairs pressed right up against the edge of the sidewalk. The work built upon one made the year prior, in which Salcedo lowered dozens of chairs from the roof of Bogotá’s Palace of Justice to commemorate a siege there. In Istanbul, the historical reference point was more ambiguous, hinting at the city’s history of migration and displacement while also speaking to a desire to “represent war in general” and create a “topography of war,” as Salcedo once said. The totality of this work, in both its location and size, made it hard to miss, a reminder that these histories and the people they affect can be overwhelming when made manifest. —M.D. Sometimes, masterpieces create monsters. So it was for Harun Farocki, whose style of essay film many have emulated, few successfully. The late German filmmaker was deft at exposing the industry of images, and at revealing various systems of power often hidden in plain sight. Eye/Machine I is the first video in a trilogy, and it highlights footage that is more data than aesthetic, with blurry clips of airports unintelligible to the untrained eye. It opens with found footage—aerial surveillance collected by the US in 1991, during the war on Iraq—and features an unseen narrator calling such pictures “devoid of social intent.” Yet Farocki masters the art of show, don’t tell, with Eye/Machine’s narrator intervening strategically, decrypting only the images that are illegible to the human eye. As for the rest, he lets you see for yourself. —E.W. With this piece staged for the Mexican Pavilion at the Venice Biennale, Teresa Margolles transformed the grisly residue of death into art. Known for addressing violence fueled by Mexico’s narcotics trade, Margolles here used materials like bloodstained cloths and shattered glass to expose the human cost of systemic inequities. The piece included fabric soaked in blood from murder sites, along with an accompanying performance that impressively—and grotesquely—involved a man mopping the floor with fluid from the dead acquired from morgues in Mexico. For even greater effect, Margolles distributed cards that doubled as cocaine cutters, suggesting that global consumer culture itself was complicit in sustaining the very carnage she highlighted. It was all unsettling and deeply uncomfortable because it offered material proof of violence that is sometimes tough to see. —D.C. I probably watched Grosse Fatigue in its entirety three times during the 2013 Venice Biennale (curated by Massimiliano Gioni), and with every viewing, new elements of the piece came to the fore. Against a techno/jazz beat by Joakim Bouaziz, artist Akwetey Orraca-Tetteh recites a poem written by Henrot and poet Jacob Bromberg that begins with the first words of the Bible: “In the beginning…” We start on a computer home screen, from which blossoms a mesmerizing bouquet of images. It is impossible to catalog them: snippets of old master paintings, a copy of The Origin of Species next to a Charles Darwin bobblehead, a fish head, a sculpture of an ancient god. (Much of the imagery came from objects Henrot encountered during a residency at the Smithsonian Institution.) What is most striking about the piece is the way it seems to echo the process each of us goes through every day in our digital age in our attempts to make sense of an image-saturated world, to create some kind of narrative out of chaos. In an art world that was going increasingly online (remember all those articles about art on Instagram?), Henrot’s work struck just the right chord. It still does. —S.D. Time flies when you’re having fun watching time—or so it seems when in the thrall of The Clock, a 24-hour assemblage of found footage starring timepieces of different kinds from the past century of film and TV. Drawing on his legacy as a maestro of remix culture (both musical and other), Christian Marclay spent three years combing the annals of moving-image history for brief clips he sequenced together. The result is a cinematic collage made up of appropriated scenes of actors glancing at their watches or waiting for seconds and minutes to tick down on clocks, alarms, and more. Each scene corresponds with the progression of a full day, so that the times in the clips sync up with the points at which they appear in Marclay’s work. While The Clock is an organizational and technical marvel (how did he find the thousands of clips, and how did he piece them all together?), the experience of watching the work as a movie of its own is just as awe-inspiring as the process. Taking stock of time manages to capture the essence of suspense and turn it inside out, leaving a viewer to wonder what it is about viewing that can leave us so rapt. —A.B. This sculpture appears innocuous, as though merely a simple metal corner desk. But a text provided by the artist reveals that it was produced by inmates at the Attica Correctional Facility in New York, who at the time were given hourly rates between $0.16 and $1.25. Rowland was working within the tradition of the readymade sculpture, but unlike Marcel Duchamp and his ilk, the artist was questioning more than artistic authorship, showing instead that everyday objects such as desks could unfurl knotty, horrifying histories of systemic exploitation. When the work was initially exhibited at New York’s Artists Space, it was no coincidence that the desk might have been mistaken for a staffer’s workstation. It was a reminder that objects produced through systems of underpaid, even forced, labor are just about everywhere. —A.G. With a series of essays and videos produced during the early 2010s, Hito Steyerl became the greatest observer of the state of total visibility brought on by the internet and rampant surveillance. Is it possible not to be seen today? Steyerl’s 2013 magnum opus asked that question, then offered a few tips, some practical, others absurdist—like “being female and over 50.” The video demystifies optical engineering by the US Air Force, green-screen technology, and more, all in 15 minutes, so as to suggest that in the age of image overload, none of us will escape becoming pixels to be played with. Her attempts to escape feel comically futile: in one memorable sequence, she smears her face with green paint, revealing color charts that were added in post-production. She goes invisible, becoming a part of the digital ether. —A.G. Completed the year before Kerry James Marshall’s midcareer retrospective at the Met, which went on to acquire this work, Untitled (Studio) exemplifies the noun referenced in the intentionally misspelled title of that show, “Mastry.” There is mastery in the whole, and in all its glorious parts: the crisply modeled dog, the bouquet out of an old master painting, the drapery, the paintbrushes, that Tiepolo sky glimpsed through a window, the uncompleted canvas on an easel, passages of which, viewed up close, can read as pure abstraction. And that is to say nothing of its subject. Here, Marshall took on a scene that to date had mainly been the province of white artists: the studio. He stepped into the pantheon of Matisse, Courbet, and their ilk, inserting and asserting the Black artist as a protagonist in art history. It’s the kind of painting that makes you say to yourself: OK, now he’s just showing off! Shouldn’t he be allowed to do just that? —S.D. Adrian Piper’s conceptual art of the 20th century may have made a bigger mark on art history, but this video is significant for the way it throws all that work into sharp relief. The artist is known for pointed work that tackles serious subjects, from racial inequity to transcendental philosophy. But her sensibility was often playful and irreverent, even when her work was sharp and intense, and this video makes that much obvious. It shows Piper dancing improvisationally in Berlin’s Alexanderplatz, the center of the city she has called home since fleeing the US in 2006. Piper dances for an hour, and she dances quite well, accompanied by 2000s Berlin house music. This is an artist who sees the world’s evils as clearly as she does its joys. —E.W. A scorching sun; Notorious B.I.G. rapping; Martin Luther King Jr. riding in a car; police committing violence; protests raging for civil rights and Black Lives Matter; Barack Obama grieving the victims of the Charleston church shooting; Mahalia Jackson performing. These are among the memorable clips packed into this video, which aspires to distill the rich range of Black experience in the US into just seven minutes. Working from his extensive archive of other peoples’ pictures, Arthur Jafa offered a full gamut of experiences from death to celebration, at a time when footage of Black Americans dying violent deaths at the hands of police proliferated in the media. Set to Kanye West’s “Ultralight Beam,” Jafa’s video is a sublime artwork that teeters between abject horror and bona fide beauty. Its final image is tough to shake: a clip of James Brown performing his ecstatic music until he collapses. —A.G. Get our latest stories in the feed of your favorite networks We want to hear from you!

If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Participation at the NFL Scouting Combine has dwindled in recent years. None of my top five prospects -- Cam Ward, Abdul Carter, Travis Hunter, Mason Graham, and Jalon Walker -- tested in Indianapolis. That being said, it is still a great proving ground for unheralded players in the middle rounds of the NFL Draft. It's also a good check to make evaluators go back to the tape to see what they missed in both positive and negative ways. One position that showed out in a big way were the running backs. Even taking positional value into account, six running backs made my top 100 -- the most I've had in any year since 2018. Fourteen different backs ran sub-4.50-second 40-yard dash times at Lucas Oil Stadium -- and that's without everyone's RB1, Ashton Jeanty, even testing! Expect a ton of starters to emerge from this year's crop. After reviewing the tape on combine standouts like Texas wide receiver Matthew Golden and Texas A&M defensive end Shemar Stewart, here's how my top-100 board shakes out after a week of testing in Indy. Note: Positional value is taken into account when assembling my draft board. Cam Ward oozes the kind of confidence you want from a franchise quarterback prospect. He also has top-tier arm talent with a career trajectory firmly pointed towards the ceiling. He may not be the same caliber of prospect we saw at the top of last year's class, but he's no less talented. Abdul Carter has only been a full-time edge rusher for one season. Over the course of that season, he quite dominantly established himself as the top pass-rusher in the country. He has All-Pro-caliber tools. The most dynamic athlete in the draft class has the highest grade at both wide receiver and cornerback for me in the draft class. Travis Hunter is a truly special prospect who can legitimately still play some of both positions in the NFL. Mason Graham may not be the most physically imposing defensive tackle, but he's just darn good. He's uber-consistent and plays with a motor that won't quit. There's very little to dislike. Explosiveness, ferocity and an innate feel for rushing the passer -- Jalon Walker has a jam-packed toolbox. His size will be his biggest knock, but there's numerous defenders rushing the passer at a high-level with similar frames. Kelvin Banks Jr. is a three-year starter who showed signs of growth every single fall. He was battle-tested this past season iin the SEC and passed every single one. He's an easy people mover in the run game and has a tremendous anchor for a true junior. Tetairoa McMillan is a unique receiver prospect who's every bit of 6-feet-5. He's gone for 3,414 yards and 26 scores in three seasons for the Wildcats. His ability to make plays outside his frame is the best in the draft class. Colston Loveland is a young, natural receiving tight end. While not much of an inline blocker, he has room to grow at only 20 years old currently. He's a terror when climbing past the linebacker level of the defense. Armand Membou has been a right tackle for Missouri, but with his stout body type, I believe he can be an All-Pro guard. His ability to gain natural leverage is outstanding and he's one of the best in the class at finding linebackers in space. Will Campbell is a three-year starter at left tackle and arguably the most technically advanced lineman in the draft class. Some may see him as a guard, but I see no reason not to start him at tackle. Will Johnson came into this season as the top-ranked player on my board and only fell due to a turf-toe injury that limited him to only 279 snaps. He's a big, physical press corner who's held his own against some of college football's best the past couple of seasons. Walter Nolen is explosive, flexible and only scratching the surface of his potential. He's a plug-and-play run defender who can get in opposing backfields with ease. What I love most about projecting his game to boost him into my top 10 is his ability to finish plays in space for a defensive tackle. Mykel Williams is one of the biggest enigma's in the draft class. He played out of position much of the season as a between-the-tackles player when he'll be an edge rusher in the NFL. The twitch he possesses combined with extraordinary length and play strength should be a nightmare for opposing offensive tackles. Malaki Starks is the kind of versatile safety who's worthy of a top-10 pick. He may not be a high-end playmaker, but he's the kind of Swiss Army Knife who can fill any role in the secondary. Tyler Warren is Jason Witten for a new generation. It's a pleasure to watch him work in- and out-breakers like clockwork. He also has excellent size to be an inline option. Few have raised their stocks as much as Derrick Harmon this past fall. There's really not much to dislike about his tape. He's got the kind of versatile body type to play any technique on the interior while still being effective against both run and pass. Mike Green flashed in a part-time role a year ago before breaking out and leading college football with 17 sacks this past fall. He's outstanding at shedding blocks for an undersized outside linebacker and developed a ton physically over his career. I take positional value into account for my board, which means Ashton Jeanty takes a hit. If all positions were created equal, he could easily be the top prospect in this class. There's very few holes in his game. Jihaad Campbell is the kind of jumbo off-ball linebacker who can rush the passer like a defensive end that are the wave in the NFL. He did a little bit of everything for Alabama's defense in a breakout campaign this past fall. Luther Burden III a YAC-monster who can create easy separation out of his breaks. He's also got some extremely reliable hands with a drop rate under 5% in each of the past two seasons. Nick Emmanwori might have the best range of any safety in this class while simultaneously being the biggest safety in the class. That's a unique combination that will translate to the next level. Jahdae Barron was mostly a slot corner until this past fall where he became a star on the outside. Barron brought that physical slot mentality to the outside and it paid off. He intercepted five passes, which exceeded his entire career prior. Emeka Egbuka is an incredibly high-floor wide receiver. He ticks a ton of boxes for the position and already has NFL-veteran level chops as a route-runner. The biggest athletic marvel in the draft class, Shemar Stewart is the closest thing to Myles Garrett physically since Garrett came out in 2017. NFL evaluators will have to figure out why his collegiate production paled in comparison to Garrett's and every other top edge rusher in the class, though. Edge is a position where you still bet on traits, even if the production hasn't caught up yet. Matthew Golden is a graceful route-runner who you can trust to run the full tree. Golden is versatile and ascending as a true junior coming out. Kenneth Grant is a physical freak who holds over 330 pounds with ease. While you might think that makes him a nose tackle, his first step plays anywhere along the defensive line. Tyler Booker is a brick wall in pass protection. When defensive tackles try to overpower him, they end up going nowhere. While he's not the most fleet of foot, Booker is always on balance and able to mirror quicks on the interior. Josh Simmons was firmly on track to be a top-15 pick before he went down with a patellar tendon tear in his knee in Ohio State's midseason game against Oregon. He's a smooth pass protector who rarely gets out over his skis. I'll lean on Nic Scourton's scintillating sophomore tape in his evaluation when he was primarily a stand-up edge rusher at Purdue. One might think at 285 pounds that Scourton would be better over tackles as a 4-3 or 3-4 defensive end, but it was when he had a head of steam that Scourton was at his best. One of the youngest prospects in the class, Scourton has so much room for development. I'm going out on a limb before the Senior Bowl considering we haven't seen David Walker face any semblance of NFL-quality tackle play. His dominance at the FCS level, however, was unlike anything I've seen in my decade of doing this. Walker is a Brandon Graham-esque edge rusher with a bowling ball frame and explosive first step that give opposing tackles nightmares. Benjamin Morrison has some of the best man-mirror tape of any corner in the class. Unfortunately, he also is coming off a season-ending hip injury that could scare some away. I'm still betting on the talent who picked off six passes as an 18-year-old freshman in 2022. Jared Ivey is a jumbo defensive end who was a big-time riser this season. He's gifted with his hand usage and knows how to win with his length. While Ivey isn't a first-round-caliber athlete, he's got other traits to make up for it. James Pearce Jr. may very well be the most athletic defensive lineman in this draft class. His movement skills could pass for that of a wide receiver. The problem is that so could his frame. If he can beef up, he'll be a problem in the league. Grey Zabel rides the back of an outstanding Senior Bowl performance all the way to this ranking. His natural coordination shined as he looked like a veteran at all three interior positions after only having played left tackle last fall. Shavon Revel Jr. is a massive corner who's incredibly fluid for a man his size. He's also outstanding at locating the football in the air. The only worry is an ACL tear he suffered in practice early on in the 2024 campaign. Josh Conerly Jr. is still more traits than polish, but the latter is catching up quickly. He may be the twitchiest offensive lineman in the entire class, and you see that in his ability to eliminate space on edge rushers. Donovan Jackson made himself as much money as anyone with his play over the course of the College Football Playoff. After two seasons starting at left guard, Jackson took over at left tackle midway through this past season. In Ohio State's four playoff games, Jackson allowed all of two pressures against some of college football's best defensive lines. One of the most explosive receivers in the draft class, Kyle Williams has an easy accelerator on tape. More importantly, he also possesses an easy brake pedal as he can send defenders flying past with his suddenness. Azareye'h Thomas is another 20-year-old who's already started for more than two seasons. This past season opposing offenses didn't even challenge him most games as the 6-2 corner smothers opposing receivers. Donovan Ezeiruaku is the most technically advanced edge rusher in the class. He has a myriad of moves at his disposal and racked up double-digit sacks this past fall because of it. His athletic testing will be big because on tape he rarely impressed in that regard. Shedeur Sanders has the numbers and the experience, but his arm strength and frame leave a little to be desired. I expect him to go higher than this ranking, but such is the nature of need at the quarterback position. Dillon Gabriel has played more football than any other quarterback in college football history. 63 starts all together. And unlike many quarterbacks in this class, Gabriel was already playing high-level football as a true freshman when he averaged over 9.0 yards per attempt for UCF. His size won't be for everyone, but his accuracy and ability to handle an NFL offense should be. Dylan Sampson has elite ability to consistently find the right crease. And when he does, the undersized running back hits it at full speed. Sampson consistently overcame poor run blocking to produce in the SEC. Trey Amos has been stingy for a while now. In each of his four seasons prior to transferring to Ole Miss, Amos allowed a sub-50 completion percentage. Most of those came at Louisiana Lafayette, however. It wasn't until he balled out for a full season as a starter in the SEC that NFL evaluators started to buy in. He had double-digit pass breakups this past fall for the Rebels. Charles Grant is arguably the most athletic tackle in the class. While he may not be NFL-ready given his level of competition, give him a couple years of seasoning and you could have a perennial Pro Bowler with his tools. CJ West is a stout and imposing nose tackle. He may only be 6-1, but at 316 pounds no one wants to get in a trench brawl with him. West was the tone-setter for the second-best run defense in the country last season. Kevin Winston Jr. missed most of this season with a partial ACL tear, but still declared for the NFL Draft early as a junior. That's because his sophomore tape showed an enforcer on the back end who only added explosiveness and strength early on in 2024. He's an outstanding tackler who's not afraid to stick his nose in it. Maxwell Hairston has real-deal wheels. His 4.28 speed shows on tape when tracking down deep balls or breaking on routes underneath. While he was banged-up this past fall, Hairston's sophomore tape when he had five picks was outstanding. Jayden Higgins is one of the few "X" receivers in the class with the kind of size and burst to win on the outside consistently. Higgins has racked up more than 2,000 yards as Iowa State's top passing option the past two seasons. Jaxson Dart is an ascending quarterback prospect with a ton of ball under his belt. He's been starting ever since midway through his freshman year at USC in 2021. After getting usurped by Caleb Williams, Dart transferred to Ole Miss and improved by leaps and bounds every single season en route to 4,276 passing yards this past fall. Wyatt Milum takes the fight to every defender in his path. If he gets his hands on you it can get ugly. While he plays left tackle for the Mountaineers, Milum projects to guard at the next level. Darius Alexander is a versatile defensive tackle who's shown the ability to line up anywhere along the defensive line of scrimmage. He's got a good get-off that he pairs with active hands to find opposing quarterbacks. Elic Ayomanor is a big-bodied wide receiver who has some sneaky speed to his game. His ability to fight through contact along his routes is tremendous and will suit him well translating to the NFL. Ayomanor was Stanford's No. 1 option in both his seasons, but the quarterback situation cost him better numbers. Alfred Collins is put together how you want a stout interior run defender. He's got a massive, long frame that can keep opposing linemen at bay. Collins took over right where T'Vondre Sweat left off at Texas. Carson Schwesinger plays the linebacker with an uncoachable ferocity you can't help but root for. The former walk-on turned himself into a tackling machine in his first season as a starter last fall, leading the Big Ten with 136 total tackles. Tyleik Williams looks like a sure thing in the run game with a solidly-built frame and heavy hands. The big question is whether he can rush the passer, as he never quite progressed from the player we saw early in his career at Ohio State. What Aeneas Peebles lacks in size, he makes up for in motor. He's the kind of defensive tackle I love to root for because he'll never give up on a rep. NFL defenses are getting more adept at taking advantage of interior defenders with first steps like Peebles. Terrance Ferguson is a loose route-runner who can shake linebackers and safeties at the top of his routes. He was also the best testing athlete at the position at the NFL combine. That's a good combination to develop at tight end. Aireontae Ersery is a smooth and effective offensive tackle prospect. In a class full of guard converts, Ersery is a tackle all day. He never allowed more than 15 pressures in a year in his three seasons as a starter. Harold Fannin Jr. was college football's leading receiver last year ... as a tight end. His 1,555 yards is unheard of production at the tight end position, as it smashed the previous record. He's obviously undersized for the position at 6-3 and 241 pounds, but his ability to get open isn't in question. Darien Porter is one of the weirdest prospects in the draft class. He's a sixth-year player, but only spent the last three on defense after switching from wide receiver -- and he still wasn't a full-time starter this past fall. When he was out there, though, Porter was one of the most impressive specimen in the entire country. He's got elite downfield speed and at 6-4 is still somehow fluid enough to stick with smaller wide receivers. Danny Stutsman is a three-down middle linebacker with great range to make plays around the line of scrimmage. He racked up more than 100 tackles in each of the past three seasons for the Sooners. While others from the conference will surely get drafted ahead of Bradyn Swinson come draft day, no one in the SEC was more productive as a pass-rusher this past fall. His 60 pressures led the conference as he routinely won the edge. Jalen Royals is an incredibly crafty wide receiver who was en route to a massive season before injury struck. He had 839 yards in only seven games this season for the Aggies. He may not be tall, but he's well put together to play a physical brand of football. Omarion Hampton is a hard-nosed, between-the-tackles runner who will maximize every opportunity he gets. You will not see him ever shy away from contact as he not only has power, but also an explosive element to his game. Jamaree Caldwell is very nimble for a big fella; he can play around blocks as well as through. He's one of the few nose tackles in the class who you're not necessarily taking off the field on passing downs. Demetrius Knight Jr. is a former quarterback turned linebacker, although you'd never guess by the way he plays. That's because he's one of the biggest hitters in the linebacker class with easy speed to track down ball-carriers sideline-to-sideline. Jacob Parrish may be short, but he's not small and he's definitely not unathletic. Parrish closes to the football in the air with a relentlessness that's a joy to watch. His tape was good enough for him to declare early after two years as a starter. Elijah Arroyo may very well be the most athletic tight end in the class. He had a monster breakout campaign with more yards in Week 1 (89) than his previous two seasons combined. He finished with 590 yards on the year while averaging a healthy 16.9 yards per catch. Deone Walker is a unique specimen. He's one of the tallest defensive tackles I've ever seen at over 6-7 and 344 pounds. At that size, he's incredibly nimble. He just can't hold up to double teams or play as many snaps as Kentucky asked him to. Still only 20 years old, Walker has time to figure it out. Jaylin Noel is an explosive slot receiver who can take the top off the defense with ease. He went for 1,193 yards this past fall and blazed a 4.39-second 40-yard dash at the NFL combine. Tyler Shough is a unique quarterback prospect who'll be 26 years old before he takes a snap in the NFL. He would have been in the NFL already had it not been for three straight seasons getting derailed by injury. Once he was fully healthy this past fall at Louisville, he showed outstanding arm talent and an ability to operate under pressure that few in the draft class can match. Tez Johnson is the smallest player in the draft class at 154 pounds, but watch him run routes and his weight concerns slowly start to drift away. He runs away from everyone and nearly impossible to get hands on in space. Vernon Broughton waited patiently behind numerous NFL defensive tackles at Texas before finally getting his turn this past fall. It was worth the wait as the fifth-year defensive tackle racked up 32 pressures and 22 run stops. Xavier Watts is one of the most instinctive safeties in the draft class with a nose for the football. Over the past two seasons he's racked up 13 interceptions. Joshua Farmer definitely looks the part of an NFL defensive tackle. He's got one of the best frames in the draft class with a 6-10 wingspan, 10.5-inch hands and 35 ¼ inch arms at 314 pounds. He may not be much as a pass-rusher, but his power plays in the run game. Jordan Burch is an ascending edge prospect who's one of the most explosive athletes in the class. At 279 pounds, Burch ran a 4.67-second 40-yard dash. For context, Aaron Donald ran a 4.68 at only six pounds heavier. That's good company and it shows when bull-rushes opposing tackles. Tre Harris may not have great long speed, but he wins with his burst at the top of routes. He's got a lanky frame that he uses to pluck balls out of the air with ease. He was the most productive receiver in college football last fall when healthy averaging 5.12 yards per route. Jonah Savaiinaea is a three-year starter with experience at right guard, right tackle and left tackle. While his arm length and testing numbers say he could be a tackle, one look at Savaiinaea's frame and it's hard to think he won't end up at guard in the NFL. While he's light on his feet for a bigger lineman, Savaiinaea's hands need work in staying attached to blocks. Tyler Baron has been seeing significant time ever since his true freshman season at Tennessee in 2020, but never quite made a big leap as a pass-rusher. He has the tools to do so in the NFL, though, as he can really bend for a bigger defensive end. Nick Martin is one of the most athletic linebackers in the draft class. Even though he's undersized, no one seems to have told him. Martin plays like an alpha and hits like a brick. Andrew Mukuba was yet another breakout star in Texas' secondary this season. He's one of the twitchiest safeties in the class with an easy ability to mirror from an off alignment. Elijah Roberts is a powerful defensive end who's racked up pressures for the Mustangs the past two seasons. Over that span his 131 pressures are the most in the draft class. Jack Sawyer has been extremely productive in his time at Ohio State, but he comes with serious limitations when projecting to the NFL. Not only is he a middling athlete by NFL standards, he also has very short arms for a defensive end (31 ¾ inches). TJ Sanders is a trim 3-technique defensive tackle who can get off the line of scrimmage and into backfield. While he needs to fill out his frame, Sanders presents pass-rushing upside. Quandarrius Robinson is one of the most athletic edges in the class. He also has a great frame for the edge position with 33.5-inch arms at 6-4 and 243 pounds. He may profile to a pass-rush only player at the next level, but he's got the goods in that regard. Cameron Williams looks like a future starter, but on tape it's clear he needs more reps. The junior had only one season of starting under his belt when he declared and struggled against top competition. Josiah Stewart is an undersized butt-kicker who attacks play after play. At 6-foot-1 and 249 pounds, he won't be everyone's cup of tea, but when you watch him knock back tackles on contact consistently, you see a path to success for him in the NFL. Jack Bech is one of the best possession receivers in the draft class. With great hands and good size, he can be counted on to move the chains. He did so a lot for the Horned Frogs this past fall as he racked up his first 1,000-yard season. Clay Webb started off his career at Georgia before transferring to Jackvsonville State and dominating the past few years. In three seasons he allowed all of 13 pressures. Cam Skattebo is arguably the hardest runner in the draft class. He refuses to go down on first contact and has the kind of light feet to avoid defenders in the hole. Skattebo may not have home run speed, but he'll rake in short yardage. There hasn't been a 5-foot-10 starting offensive linemen in the modern NFL. I think that changes with Willie Lampkin. At that size, he still has a 6-foot-6 wingspan -- bigger than LSU's Will Campbell and NDSU's Grey Zabel. If he can get his weight into the 280s up from 270, Lampkin can start at center in the NFL. Chris Paul Jr. was highly productive this past fall at Ole Miss after transferring from Arkansas. He was everywhere around the line of scrimmage for the Rebels with an innate feel for sorting through trash. Paul also missed only four of his 89 tackle attempts all season. Jonas Sanker is a big, explosive and fluid safety. He's the kind of athlete who can wear a lot of different hats in a defense. Quinn Ewers college career was marred by injury and unmet expectations, but the talent that made him the former No. 1 overall recruit never disappeared. Quinshon Judkins played second fiddle to Tre Henderson this past fall for the Buckeyes, but that was through no fault of his own. He's one of the best tackle breakers in the draft class and showed at the combine he's one of the best athletes as well. Anthony Belton is a massive tackle prospect who may end up on the interior at the next level. He uses his hands so well for a bigger tackle and has an easy anchor at that size. Thomas Fidone II was a former No. 1 tight end recruit who couldn't stay healthy and struggled to develop because of that. This past fall, though, you saw his special traits in action. He's a sudden route-runner with a massive frame. Jared Wilson is the most athletic interior linemen in the draft class. Even though he's only a one-year starter, Wilson cracks this top 100. While he still needs more reps, he has a high-ceiling. One of the forgotten men in the running back class because of eligibility issues this past fall, Jacory Croskey-Merritt is a name to remember. He won the MVP of the Shrine Bowl and was easily the most impressive back in attendance with his electric footwork to manipulate defenders. The 2025 NFL Draft is to take place from April 24-26 at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin.

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Trump celebrates his first weeks back in office in a speech to Congress. Border Patrol agents are accused of targeting people based on their skin color during a “fishing expedition.” And director Bong Joon-ho talks about his upcoming movie, “Mickey 17.” Here’s what to know today. Donald Trump touted the first weeks of his second term as president as a ringing success in a speech before a joint session of Congress, declaring "America is back" and that his administration has "accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations accomplished in four years or eight years." Republicans showered Trump with applause as he touched on his economic plans, culture war issues, immigration and more. Democrats demonstrated that they are not as impressed. Though mostly silent, one representative, Al Green of Texas, shouted at Trump until he was removed from the House chamber (See video of the interruption). Trump taunted Democrats for not applauding him and repeated his derisive nickname for Sen. Elizabeth Warren, “Pocahontas,” when talking about Ukraine. This is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. Trump’s speech, which at an hour and 40 minutes was the longest speech ever delivered by a president to Congress, covered a variety of topics. Here are a few highlights: → On the economy, Trump acknowledged that newly imposed tariffs could cause pain for Americans. “A little disturbance,” he said, “but we’re OK with that.” He also renewed his pledge to eliminate taxes on tips, Social Security benefits and overtime pay — even though the budget that the House passed last month would make room only for extending the tax cuts from his first term. → On foreign policy, Trump pledged to sign a deal that would give the U.S. mineral rights in Ukraine, though his discussion of the war was relatively short despite it dominating the White House’s agenda in recent days. He also said Secretary of State Marco Rubio would oversee efforts to regain control of the Panama Canal and invited Greenland to join the U.S. “if you choose.” → On immigration, Trump said he is waging the “most sweeping border and immigration crackdown in American history.” He also highlighted the passage of the Laken Riley Act. → Missing from the speech was any mention of the thousands of federal workers who have been fired since Trump has taken office. However, he mentioned Elon Musk several times and claimed without evidence that he had found “hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud” in the government. Read the full story here. Less than a day after new tariffs against Canada, Mexico and China took effect, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated relief may be in sight. An interim agreement with Canada and Mexico could come as soon as today, Lutnick said yesterday in an interview on Fox Business Network, and allow tariffs on Canada and Mexico to be rolled back to some degree. Reaction to the tariffs — 25% on nearly all goods from Mexico and Canada and additional 10% on all imports from China — was swift, with economists and companies warning about the potential wide-ranging implications: 🚗 The price of cars could increase, even for vehicles assembled in the U.S. 🏠 The cost of building a new home could rise by as much as $10,000 per house, an economist said, which would impact the real estate market as a whole. 🛍️ Target and Best Buy have warned of price hikes, though some businesses have vowed to hold the line on costs. China and Canada have already imposed retaliatory tariffs on the U.S., and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said her country would respond by Sunday. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said imposing tariffs “is a very dumb thing to do.” Read the full story here. Border Patrol agents are accused of carrying out a “fishing expedition” in Kern County, California, allegedly targeting people of a certain color in a search for criminal immigrants, making arrests without warrants and using trickery to get people to leave the country, according to a recent lawsuit. Border Patrol said that 60 agents arrested 78 people, all who were unlawfully in the U.S. in the three-day operation. However, attorneys said some of the people arrested had no criminal convictions. On. Jan. 8, agents arrested Ernesto Campos Gutierrez, a 44-year-old U.S. citizen and resident of Bakersfield for 20 years, after they blocked his truck, slashed his tires, and dragged a passenger from the truck. The same day, Yolanda Agiulera Martinez, a 56-year-old lawful permanent resident was ordered out of her car and thrown to the ground before she was arrested. After she showed agents a photo of her legal residency card, she was told to “get the f--- out of here,” according to the lawsuit. The arrests have left many people in the Latino-majority county traumatized, attorneys said. Read the full story here. “Parasite” director Bong Joon-ho returns with his signature blend of drama and absurdist comedy with “Mickey 17.” The film, out Friday, stars Robert Pattinson as an “expendable” — a worker who takes on potentially fatal assignments during an expedition to a new planet, with the expectation of being cloned if he dies. Bong, who speaks Korean, talks about how he nails his specific brand of comedy in another language, his special bond with Pattinson and how getting his big break in his 50s means he can stay truer to himself. — Jessi Prois, NBC Asian America editorial director Retinol helps with accelerating skin cell turnover, which is why so many experts recommend incorporating it into your routine.

Title: Nvidia Stock: Are Tariff Fears Overblown?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team , Contributor. SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA - FEBRUARY 26: The Nvidia logo is displayed on a sign at the Nvidia ... [+] headquarters on February 26, 2025 in Santa Clara, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Nvidia stock fell nearly 9% during Monday’s trading session, while the broader Nasdaq index declined by just over 2%. The market-wide sell-off coincided with U.S. President Donald Trump’s confirmation that his administration would impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico starting Tuesday. Additionally, Nvidia’s drop was further exacerbated by investigations into Chinese buyers suspected of bypassing U.S. export controls on advanced semiconductor chips. How will these developments affect Nvidia stock? We do not believe that the Trump Administration’s initial tariffs will have a material impact on Nvidia. Nvidia’s chips are primarily manufactured by TSMC in Taiwan; however, some systems and computers utilizing these chips are produced in other regions, including Mexico. It is possible that these segments of the business might experience some impact. Nonetheless, the core of Nvidia’s operations—the high-margin GPU division—should remain mostly unaffected. Last month, President Trump also suggested the possibility of a “25% or higher” tariff on all semiconductor chips imported into the United States. Investors will need to monitor this development closely, although we believe it will not have a significant impact on Nvidia’s bottom line. As of 2024, Nvidia reported an adjusted gross margin of approximately 75.5%, indicating that the cost of its imported products is likely less than 25% of its revenues. Furthermore, since Nvidia generates around 47% of its sales from the U.S., the impact on its margins is probably even more constrained. In addition, TSMC, which is Nvidia’s main contract manufacturer for GPUs, has announced plans to invest roughly $100 billion in new chip fabrication facilities in the United States. Nvidia executives have indicated that they plan to produce chips at these new facilities, potentially helping the company mitigate long-term tariff risks. However, if you are seeking growth with less volatility than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since its inception. The United States has implemented export control restrictions on most of Nvidia’s newest AI chipset offerings to China, with the exception of the H20 chips, due to national security concerns. Nevertheless, reports indicate that gray market resellers are utilizing entities registered outside China to purchase servers incorporating Nvidia’s latest offerings from companies based in several countries, such as Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Vietnam. This concern is substantiated by the fact that Singapore has emerged as Nvidia’s second-largest market, representing approximately $23 billion in sales in FY’25, or about 18% of revenue, compared to only $2.3 billion, or 8% of revenue, in FY’23. Singapore has now launched an investigation into these potential loopholes. The emergence of China’s DeepSeek open-source AI model also suggests that the country is advancing significantly in AI, with both prominent startups and major companies like Alibaba and Baidu investing heavily in AI infrastructure. Should Chinese companies bypass sanctions and face stricter enforcement measures that eventually close these loopholes, Nvidia’s revenues could be affected. Over the past four years, NVDA stock's performance has been inconsistent, with annual returns displaying much greater volatility than the S&P 500. The stock returned 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, 239% in 2023, and 171% in 2024. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, which comprises 30 stocks, exhibits significantly less volatility. It has also comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four years. Why is this the case? Overall, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index, resulting in a less turbulent performance as demonstrated in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics. In light of the current uncertain macroeconomic climate, marked by potential rate cuts and several conflicts, might NVDA experience a scenario similar to 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months, or will it experience a robust surge? We estimate Nvidia stock to be valued at approximately $101 per share, which is about 20% below the current market price. Refer to our analysis of Nvidia valuation: Expensive or Cheap. There are several reasons why we currently hold a negative outlook on the stock. We believe that the AI wave, driven by a “fear-of-missing-out” over the past two years, might subside due to diminishing incremental performance improvements from larger models and because high-quality training data may become a bottleneck. This transition towards more efficient models could further intensify the effects of a potential slowdown for GPU manufacturers like Nvidia. Additionally, Nvidia is encountering increasing competition from companies such as AMD and even from its own clients, like Amazon, which are focusing on developing and deploying their own AI chips. Although Nvidia boasts a comprehensive software ecosystem surrounding its AI processors—including programming languages that help secure customer loyalty—the company could still face pressure. Its premium valuation might not fully account for these risks at present. NVDA Return Compared With Trefis Reinforced Portfolio Invest with Trefis Market Beating Portfolios | Rules-Based Wealth

Dear friends, Welcome to the March issue of Mutual Fund Observer. I am surprised, sometimes, at how much I now appreciate some of the stuff that I found most mindless and annoying in high school. (I’m still not there with Moby Dick; the whole idea of a monomaniacally obsessed old guy leading his ship to destruction because he can’t be reasoned with and won’t back down, just strikes me as implausible, but I’m willing to listen.) My secret hope as a professor is that I’m like the gardener scattering seeds too early, in patches that seem disconsolate, for those seeds still sprout whither they would. And so, I teach my students about Thorstein Veblen, one of his age’s most impenetrable geniuses (he coined “conspicuous consumption”), and Sherry Turkle, one of our age’s most thoughtful, who asks “What do we become when we talk to machines?” We read about Hitler, and about the disastrous misjudgments – by mainstream politicians who had faith that they could control him and German industrialists who had faith that they could harness him to their everlasting profit – that led to the rise of Hitler. We read the reflections of the decent, hardworking Germans who convinced themselves that it was better to keep their heads down and pray. This separation of government from people, this widening of the gap, took place so gradually and so insensibly, each step disguised (perhaps not even intentionally) as a temporary emergency measure or associated with true patriotic allegiance or with real social purposes. And all the crises and reforms (real reforms, too) so occupied the people that they did not see the slow-motion underneath, of the whole process of government growing remoter and remoter. . . (A German professor speaking with Milton Mayer, They Thought They Were Free: The Germans, 1933-45. University of Chicago Press, 1955) We read the final report of Herbert Hoover’s 1929 Committee on Recent Economic Changes that hailed an “almost insatiable appetite for goods and services,” and envisaged “a boundless field before us … new wants that make way endlessly for newer wants, as fast as they are satisfied.” The kids from Nepal and Mongolia read it alongside the kids from Naperville and Milwaukee, read it very differently from one another, and speak to each other with increasing confidence about how they connect to the readings … and connect to each other. And so, in the spring of my 41st year at the college, I’ll continue scattering seeds and nurturing hope. Heck, perhaps one day they’ll reflect on my classes as I’ve reflected on Dickens. “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.” ― Charles Dickens, A Tale of Two Cities (1859) Our colleague Lynn Bolin continues looking at bonds as an attractive alternative, on a risk-adjusted and valuation basis, to stocks just now. “Spicy Bond Funds” explores “spicier” (higher-yielding) bond investments in the current market environment. Lynn analyzes various risk factors including inflation, duration risk, and policy uncertainty, and provides a comprehensive ranking system for bond funds. Spoiler: you might want to check Janus Henderson AAA CLO ETF (JAAA) as a relatively safe way to achieve higher yields in the current market, Lynn complements that with a new take on an old strategy, bond laddering. In “ETF Bond Ladders,” he examines ETFs designed for bond laddering, focusing on products from Invesco (BulletShares) and BlackRock (iShares iBonds). The essay concludes with the note that corporate BBB-rated bond ladders will be Lynn’s mainstay investment, with potential additions of high-yield bonds for near-term investments and municipal bonds for tax-efficient accounts. In “The Great Rotation” (below), I highlight the surprising extent of the change in stock investors’ preferences – small, value, international, and emerging are being rediscovered – and offer up the funds that should be on an investor’s shortlist. Not to put too fine a point on it, but the Trump administration has gutted efforts to minimize global warming, coordinate international responses to it, or maintain a credible information infrastructure for it. In January we noted that the necessary response to allowing such a collapse was a shift to infrastructure investing to manage the effects. In February, we extended the analysis to water infrastructure. In “The Climate Denial Profit Paradox,” we update the state of government efforts and lay out additional investing opportunities. (I’ll go back to being optimistic about the future next month.) After markets get pricier and shakier, asset managers are doing what asset managers do: they’re rolling out new products in new asset classes using new algorithms that guarantee that happy days will be here again. After walking through the sad wreckage of other “can’t miss” innovations, we highlight the risks surrounding three new funds and ETFs in “Liquid Promises, Illiquid Reality.” All of which brought to mind the stunning collapse of Firsthand Technology Value Fund, a tale that continues to this day. Launched in 1994, the fund returned 60% a year in the 1990s and gave rise to a half dozen siblings. Twenty years after launch it became a business development company doing private equity investing in the same sorts of tech companies. And ten years later, the fund is trading for $0.06/share and isn’t even able to liquidate. The cautionary tale is in “The Rise and Fall of Firsthand Technology Value Fund.” Speaking of rising and falling, The Shadow documents the death of Matthews Asian Growth & Income, a fund made famous by Paul Matthews and Andrew Foster as the least volatile, most consistently excellent way to invest in Asia equities from 1994 to about 2011. But thereafter … We can establish two things about the stock market with great confidence: The US stock market has a giant problem. “Giant” in the sense that investors have poured money so steadily and so long into a handful of leaders that their valuations are beginning to redefine “irrational.” Jason Zweig notes, “Even after the stumble in tech stocks late last month, the Magnificent Seven traded this week at an average of 43.3 times what analysts expect them to earn over the next 12 months” (“What You Should Do About the Stock Market’s Giant Problem,” com, 2/7/25). That leaves most of the US market and virtually all of the rest of the world with tolerable valuations. Spencer Jakab reports that “developed-market large growth stocks were trading last week at 98th-percentile valuations… [meaning] they have been more expensive only 2% of the time.” (Ever.) Simultaneously, “developed-market large value is at the 2nd percentile, so it has been cheaper only 2% of the time” (“Stocks have a big, expensive problem,” WSJ, 2/25/25, B10). Morningstar pictures it this way: Source: Morningstar.com, Market Valuation View, 2/28/2025 Leuthold Group reports that small caps are selling at a 26% discount to large caps, adjusted for earnings, and value is selling at a near-historic discount to growth. Investors have noticed. As of March 3, 2025, Vanguard Value ETF is up 4.5% on the year, Vanguard Growth ETF is down 1.2%. Similarly, the Vanguard FTSE EM ETF is up 1.6%, Vanguard Total International Stock ETF is up 5.7% and the value-oriented Vanguard International High Dividend Yield ETF is up 6.6%. Contrarily, the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF is down 6% YTD. Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF is down 2%. Tesla is down 27% YTD. Google is down 10%. Trump Media & Tech is down 32%. All of this is separate from broader concerns about chaos, tariffs, reciprocal tariffs, escalating tariffs, government shutdowns, and burgeoning deficits. What might an investor consider? If you’re a young investor with a diversified portfolio (think more than 50 stocks representing many different industries, ideally spread over several countries), do nothing to your portfolio. You’re fine. This might be unpleasant, but that’s part of the price of playing the game. If you’re an investor with all of your eggs in one small basket (you have a tech ETF and shares of Nvidia, Google, and Amazon), broaden your exposure. That doesn’t mean selling what you own. It might mean adding something like Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP). At base, the equal weight 500 counteracts the large/growth/momentum biases embedded in many portfolios. It gives equal exposure to the largest and smallest companies in the S&P 500 which creates an immediate contrarian balance. It is more oriented toward less expensive stocks, smaller stocks, old-economy stocks, and dividends than the S&P or the typical portfolio. In Morningstar terms, it is a one-star fund which is precisely its appeal: it invests in the companies left for dead by the FAANG/MAG7 mania. If you want to increase your exposure to value-oriented stocks, consider Wisdom Tree US Value ETF (WTV) or Goodhaven Fund (GOODX). Why these two? We turned to the MFO Premium screener which allows us to assess open-end funds, closed-end funds, and exchange-traded funds side-by-side. We screeners for funds with three essential characteristics: We applied that screener to large value, mid-cap value, and multi-cap value funds for the past three years. Thirty-four value funds and ETFs showed both excellent manager performance and excellent resilience over the past three years. Wisdom Tree US Value had the highest information ratio of all, and Goodhaven had the highest ratio for all mutual funds. If you want to increase your exposure to small cap stocks, consider Vanguard Strategic Small Cap Equity, North Square Dynamic Small Cap, or Adirondack Small Cap. Vanguard Strategic Small Cap Equity is an actively managed, low-cost small-cap blend fund that holds about 500 names (yikes! But it works) with a growth-at-a-reasonable-price discipline. It charges one-third of the category average and is about as diversified as can be. North Square Dynamic Small Cap employs a systematic, quantitative approach to identify behavioral inefficiencies in small-cap equity markets, leveraging sophisticated data science to exploit pricing dislocations caused by investor biases. That “behavioral finance” angle is fairly distinctive. Adirondack Small Cap is the top-performing small value fund, earning a remarkable 11% annual return in one of the market’s left-for-dead categories. The fund specializes in identifying undervalued small-cap companies that have fallen out of favor with investors, seeking to capitalize on these “turnaround situations” before mainstream investors take notice. They target companies that might rebound within three years. The team has been around forever and is heavily invested in the fund. If you want to increase your exposure to international stocks, consider the Janus Henderson Global Research or Moerus Worldwide Value. The Janus Henderson Global Research is a global large-cap growth fund that employs a distinctive sector-driven approach where specialized teams of dedicated sector analysts build high-conviction portfolios of their best ideas worldwide. They also work to hedge away most macroeconomic risks leaving the portfolio performance mostly driven by stock selection. Moerus Worldwide Value is a globally unconstrained deep value fund managed by Amit Wadhwaney, who employs a disciplined approach to identifying companies trading at significant discounts to intrinsic value across developed and emerging markets, with a particular emphasis on strong balance sheets over income statements. Amit has three decades of value investing experience and willingness to embrace market turmoil as an opportunity, seeking out underfollowed businesses, complex situations, and temporarily distressed sectors that most investors avoid, creating a distinctive portfolio of 30-40 high-conviction holdings with minimal index overlap. And if you’re simply freaked out, (a) welcome to the club and (b) increase the strategic cash allocation in your portfolio. Cash and cash alternatives are paying 4-5% a year with minimal downside. If you don’t have any great conviction in risk assets, take a deep breath and invest in some variation of an ultra-short bond fund or money market. CrossingBridge is run by David Sherman & co., and they have an outstanding record of low-risk income investing. Fidelity Conservative Income is a cheap, active, middle-of-the-road ultra-short bond fund. The “cheap” is really useful here. We’ve also included the profile of the money market peer group. In reality, there’s no downside to any of them and precious little upside deviation. So, the whole group sits at 4.2% give-or-take 0.2%. Pick whichever one is convenient to you if you don’t want the prospect of adding just a bit of upside with CrossingBridge or Fido. The bottom line: running around in panic is not your friend. Hiding is not your friend. Taking a deep breath and making rational adjustments is. We’ll help. March has been designated as “B Corp Month.” Hallmark has not yet taken notice. In an era of growing disillusionment with traditional corporate structures, B Corps stand as beacons of a more conscientious approach to business. While many companies prioritize profits at any cost, Benefit Corporations (B Corps) represent a revolutionary paradigm that balances financial success with positive social and environmental impact. B Corps are businesses that meet rigorous standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency. Unlike conventional corporations that answer primarily to shareholders, B Corps legally commit to considering all stakeholders: workers, customers, suppliers, community, and the environment. In the US, 2,400 corporations are organized as B Corps. Worldwide, that swells to 9,500. What makes B Corps worth celebrating? They’re proving that business can be a force for good. From fair wages and diverse workforces to sustainable sourcing and ethical production, these companies demonstrate that profit and purpose aren’t mutually exclusive, they’re mutually reinforcing. The B Corp movement isn’t just idealism; it’s pragmatism for our times. As consumers increasingly vote with their dollars for companies that reflect their values, B Corps are showing that ethical business practices create resilience, innovation, and long-term success. The Annual Report of B Lab documents a lot of ways in which these companies really are different. I am not surprised, though I am slightly appalled, by the speed with which Corporate America as a whole has thrown all principles except shareholder (and executive) gains under the bus. By supporting the good guys, you aren’t underwriting the swift abandonment of employees, communities, and the environment by the billionaire-dollar corporations that were cheerleading for it, flying rainbow flags, and signing on to global initiatives … for precisely as long as it was convenient. Support how?? Follow B Lab Global, the certifying body, on social media (LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, X) and follow the #GenB or #BCorpMonth hashtag to see the different stuff happening throughout March. You can also use the ‘Find a B Corp’ directory to discover businesses that are part of the community and use your purchasing power to support B Corp companies, and the movement of business as a force for good. You might also consider Bookshop.org as an ethical alternative to Amazon, at least as a bookseller. They’ve donated $36+ million in profits to local bookshops since their launch during Covid. Nice people, good selection. Amazon has recently changed policy, they now forbid Kindle users from downloading their books, giving them permanent control of your purchases. (You might recall their freakish decision to remove the book 1984 from all Kindle readers a few years ago.) Bookshop has e-books and is working with folks like Kobo to make them available on readers. Similarly, a handful of major retailers have recognized the business case of sustaining a diverse and vibrant workforce and have, to date, refused to roll back corporate efforts to support their employees. Those include Costco, Crate & Barrel, Home Depot, Ikea, Kroger, Sprouts Wayfair, West Elm … and Whole Foods (?).

To, Sara from Brooklyn, Charles of Michigan, Ronald from Alexandria, Marjorie (thank you, ma’am, I also get such a headache some days) of Chicago, The Grinch Redux, and dear Binod from Houston, thanks! And for more than just financial support. You make a difference. It’s planting time. Chip is busily searching seed catalogs for spring-planted garlic (stiff neck mostly, because they generate delicious garlic scapes) and mild onions. I’ll continue searching for the perfect potato. And somewhere in there, more native wildflowers and grass (sheep fescue looks cool) will continue their relentless incursion on our lawn. Planting is an act of hope.

March 04, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, March 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC), Elastic N.V. (NYSE:ESTC), Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTLA), and Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. FMC Corporation (NYSE:FMC) Class Period: November 16, 2023 - February 4, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 14, 2025 The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants allegedly failed to disclose to investors: (1) the Company’s channel management initiatives were not progressing as represented; (2) that, faced with pricing pressure, the Company had made the decision not to compete on prices and instead walk away from sales opportunities; (3) that, as a result, the Company had inflated inventory in the channels in “LATAM, including Brazil, Asia, including India, as well as Canada and Eastern Europe;” and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. For more information on the FMC class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/FMC Elastic N.V. (NYSE:ESTC) Class Period: May 31, 2024 - August 29, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 14, 2025 The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Elastic had implemented significant changes to its sales operations, particularly with respect to its customer segments in the Americas; (2) the foregoing changes were likely to, and did, disrupt Elastic's sales operations during the first quarter of its FY 2025; (3) accordingly, Defendants had overstated the stability of Elastic's sales operations; (4) as a result of all the foregoing, Elastic was unlikely to meet its own previously issued revenue guidance for its FY 2025; and (5) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. For more information on the Elastic class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ESTC Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTLA) Class Period: July 30, 2024 - January 8, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 14, 2025 According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Intellia's Phase 1/2 study evaluating NTLA-3001 for the treatment of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD)-associated lung disease. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in the Company’s timeline for the aforementioned study, specifically that Intellia expected to dose the first patient in the second half of 2024. Defendants failed to disclose inter alia that the demand for viral-based editing was rapidly dwindling as non-viral delivery methods became a main target of the scientific research community due to their cost-effectiveness and more efficient development, thus making NTLA-3001 an inefficient program for Intellia to maintain. The alleged truth emerged on January 9, 2025, when Intellia published a press release announcing Company reorganization. In pertinent part, defendants disclosed that Intellia would be halting all NTLA-3001 research and studies and that the Company would be reducing its workforce by 27% in 2025. Specifically, the Company announced that management decided to focus Intellia’s resources on other pharmaceutical development and would be implementing cost saving in the form of a major reduction in force. As a result, defendants pipeline priority readjustment resulted in the Company’s once-touted NTLA-3001’s discontinuation. Following this news, Intellia’s stock price fell from a closing market price of $12.02 per share on January 8, 2025 to $10.20 per share on January 10, 2025. For more information on the Intellia class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/NTLA Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) Class Period: February 3, 2022 - February 3, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 14, 2025 The Merck class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Merck's projected revenue outlook and anticipated growth of Gardasil while also minimizing risk from competition and drug approval development, such as China's approval to shift Gardasil to a 2-dose regimen; (ii) in truth, Merck's optimistic reports of growth, claims of successful consumer activation and education in China, overall ability to drive demand, and efforts to downplay the impact of competition on Gardasil fell short of the reality; and (iii) Merck's ability to push Gardasil in China had materially diminished. The Merck class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 30, 2024, Merck revealed that in the second quarter of 2024 "there was a significant step down in shipments from our distributor and commercialization partner, Zhifei, into the points of vaccination, compared with prior quarters, resulting in above normal inventory levels at Zhifei." On this news, the price of Merck stock fell nearly 10%, according to the complaint. Then, on February 4, 2025, the Merck class action lawsuit alleges that Merck published its fourth quarter fiscal year 2024 results, disclosing that "GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 Sales Declined 3% to $8.6 Billion; Excluding the Impact of Foreign Exchange, Sales Declined 2%" "primarily due to lower demand in China, partially offset by higher demand in most international regions, particularly in Japan." On this news, the price of Merck stock fell more than 9%, according to the complaint.

(NASDAQ: QUBT) Class Period: March 30, 2020 - January 15, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 28, 2025 The lawsuit alleges that, during the Class Period, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Defendants overstated the capabilities of QCI’s quantum computing technologies, products, and/or services; (ii) Defendants overstated the scope and nature of QCI’s relationship with NASA, as well as the scope and nature of QCI’s NASA-related contracts and/or subcontracts; (iii) Defendants overstated QCI’s progress in developing a TFLN foundry, the scale of the purported TFLN foundry, and orders for the Company’s TFLN chips; (iv) QCI’s business dealings with Quad M and millionways both qualified as related party transactions; (v) accordingly, QCI’s revenues relied, at least in part, on undisclosed related party transactions; (vi) all the foregoing, once revealed, was likely to have a significant negative impact on QCI’s business and reputation; and (vii) as a result, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

(NASDAQ: RKLB) Class Period: November 12, 2024 - February 25, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 28, 2025 On February 25, 2025, Bleecker Street Research published a report alleging, among other things, that Rocket Lab “has materially misled investors about the likelihood that its Neutron rocket will launch in mid-2025.” The report revealed that the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests, which were originally scheduled to occur in a window between September 2024 and March 2025, had been pushed back to a window beginning in September 2025 and could occur as late as March 2026. The report further revealed significant delays in preparing the Company’s launch pad, including a potable water problem not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which would delay launch further. The report also alleged that Company’s only Neutron contract so far is with an “unreliable startup” named E-Space which is described as “risk item.” The report further alleged this “contract is not a full-price deal, contrary to what Rocket Lab has said.” On this news, Rocket Lab’s stock price fell $2.21, or 9.8%, to close at $20.28 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) the Company’s plans for three barge landing tests were significantly delayed; (2) a critical potable water problem was not scheduled to be fixed until January 2026, which delayed preparation of the launch pad; (3) as a result of the foregoing, there was a substantial risk that Rocket Lab’s Neutron rocket would not launch in mid-2025; (4) Neutron’s only contract was made at a discount with an unreliable partner; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

Title: IPO-bound CoreWeave to buy AI developer Weights & Biases for a reported $1.4B
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/03/04/ipo-bound-coreweave-buy-ai-developer-weights-biases-reported-1-4b/
Time Published: 2025-03-05T01:07:49Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 20:07 EST / MARCH 04 2025 by Mike Wheatley Cloud-based artificial intelligence infrastructure startup CoreWeave Inc. today announced it plans to buy the AI model development firm Weights & Biases Inc. for an undisclosed price. The company confirmed the acquisition plan just minutes after The Information first reported that it was “in talks” to buy Weights & Biases in a deal valued at $1.7 billion. CoreWeave has emerged as one of the AI industry’s hottest properties because it provides enterprises with access to that most treasured resource: the graphics processing units that power today’s AI services. Through its cloud infrastructure, enterprise customers such as Meta Platforms Inc. can obtain on-demand access to some of Nvidia’s most powerful GPUs, including its H100 and H200 chips, which are designed to provide accelerated computing power for large language models and other AI workloads. San Francisco-based Weights & Biases, which had raised more than $250 million in funding from investors since its founding in 2017, has built a platform that promises to speed up the development of AI models. It provides extensive capabilities to AI developers, including tools for managing training datasets, testing how changes to a model affect its performance, and troubleshooting technical problems. In addition, Weights & Biases offers more specialized capabilities, including a set of features for fixing so-called “hallucinations,” or erroneous responses that are sometimes generated by large language models. Its platform has proved to be a major hit, and the company claims it’s being used by more than 1 million AI engineers, including some from enterprises such as OpenAI, Meta, Nvidia Corp., Snowflake Inc. and Toyota Motor Co. CoreWeave said it will integrate Weights & Biases’ capabilities into its cloud infrastructure platform in order to give customers a more comprehensive “end-to-end” AI experience. Not only will they be able to run their models in its cloud, they’ll also be able to build and test their own. Collectively, the two companies aim to help customers accelerate their AI roadmaps and bring new applications to market faster. It promised that Weights & Biases’ existing customers will continue to be allowed to deploy their AI models wherever they like, meaning they won’t be forced onto its cloud infrastructure – though they’ll likely be “encouraged” to consider it. Holger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc. told SiliconANGLE that CoreWeave’s management has recognized that many enterprises prefer to buy a complete AI solution that can simplify their forays into AI application and model development, housing everything under one roof. “They want a turnkey cloud platform that lets them build and operate their next-generation AI applications and do everything associated with them in one place, and that’s what CoreWeave aims to give them,” he said. CoreWeave co-founder and Chief Executive Michael Intrator described Weights & Biases as a “phenomenal platform” that helps companies of any size to get a handle on the complexities of building AI models, deploying them and monitoring their performance. “Together with CoreWeave, we will bring this grit and passion for innovation to customers at an even greater scale, with the goal of rapidly accelerating adoption across the world’s leading AI labs and enterprises,” promised Weights & Biases CEO Lukas Biewald. The acquisition is subject to “customary closing conditions” and is expected to be finalized in the first half of the year. Assuming it does go ahead as planned, it will bring an even greater sense of urgency to CoreWeave’s plan to list on the Nasdaq stock exchange later this year. Only yesterday, the company revealed it had filed the necessary paperwork for its initial public offering, saying it intends to trade on the Nasdaq exchange under the “CRWV” ticker symbol. CoreWeave’s IPO filing revealed that the company has seen dramatic growth over the last year, with its revenue rising by a stunning 700%, to $1.92 billion, in fiscal 2024. It’s expecting to grow even faster in the future, too, with more than $15 billion in signed contracts that it has yet to fulfill. The company remains unprofitable, though, posting a loss of $863.4 million that year.

Title: GOP Is ‘Trying to Gaslight’ Americans Into Believing Trump Has Made Their Lives Better, Tara Setmayer Says | Video

“I don’t think that’s what the American people voted for,” the former GOP comms director adds Tara Setmayer thinks the GOP is doing a lot of gaslighting to keep the American people convinced President Donald Trump is making their lives better. In the wake of Trump’s renewed push to place major tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, the stock market took a hit and prices around the U.S. continued to increase. Setmayer – a former communications director for the GOP – explained that the party is having to cover for the president’s choices with a lot of gaslighting for promises made before the election. Watch her breakdown while on MSNBC Tuesday below: “I think the Republicans are going to have to explain to the American people why Donald Trump’s actions so far in his few weeks that he’s been in office, how has that improved their lives?” Setmayer said. “It hasn’t and no matter what they keep saying, they’re trying to gaslight the American people into thinking everything’s better. ‘This is much better — you’re going to have to go through some pain but it will be better eventually.’ I don’t think that’s what the American people voted for.” She continued: “They didn’t hear about that ‘some pain’ part first in order to get this magical better economic situation. The economic situation was actually pretty good under Joe Biden, but a lot of the American people didn’t feel it.” The Nasdaq, Dow Jones and S&P 500 were all down about 2% on Tuesday, a day after the president said he would be imposing tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico. Big tech has been hit especially hard since Trump took office – ironic since many of them were prominently displayed behind him on Inauguration Day. Amazon, Apple, Tesla and Alphabet, Google’s parent company, all who were represented at Trump’s swearing in, have seen their shares take a sizable hit since 2025 began. Only Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta has enjoyed a price climb so far.

March 04, 2025 17:26 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, March 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between November 2, 2022 and December 19, 2024, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important March 25, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors concerning the details of, and expectations for, Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1.” Defendants’ statements failed to disclose or otherwise misled investors as to the nature of the dosages provided to patients in the study. Defendants’ statements further included, among other things, significant confidence in Novo Nordisk’s expectations for the study, in particular a minimum expected 25% average weight loss for obesity patients treated with CagriSema in the REDEFINE-1 study. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s REDEFINE-1 trial protocol; notably, that it was a “flexible protocol” which gave patients the ability “to modify their dosing throughout the trial.” When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

President Donald Trump’s broad-ranging tariffs went into effect earlier Tuesday, sending the market in a downward spiral. The United States will be enacting 25% duties on all Mexican goods and most Canadian goods, and 20% on all imports from China. Retaliatory tariffs followed promptly: Canada imposed 25% tariff on $107 billion worth of American goods, as China announced duties of up to 15% on agricultural products and targeted actions at more than 20 companies, including artificial intelligence startups and drone makers. Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum said she will announce retaliatory measures on Sunday. The tech industry is wary. Shares of Tesla (TSLA), which owns a major assembly plant in China, were down more than 3% in Tuesday late afternoon trading. The stock gained back some of its losses from earlier in the day when several investors downgraded the stock due to tariff fears. Retailer Best Buy (BBY) warned investors that the duties could increase the price of the electronics it sells. “In terms of visibility of goods, I’d say Apple (AAPL) and Tesla are probably the headliners,” D.A. Davidson head of technology Gil Luria told Quartz. But the tariffs and their immediate impact is by no means unexpected by global markets as Trump made his fondness of tariffs clear even on the campaign trail. Tech analysts are more worried about how long the tariffs will last, as well as whether or not further escalation in reciprocals will occur — and if they’ll extend beyond tariffs on physical goods. “It’s far more likely that this time, they’re going to hurt the U.S. where it matters,” Luria said, adding that the big tech companies are “the best target.” If Canada, Mexico or China decide that the U.S. has taken a confrontational approach to tariffs, they can respond in kind by penalizing big tech companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOGL), Meta (META) or Amazon (AMZN). This, Luria said, would be “the most meaningful and most broad in its impact.” “In China, for instance, they can just eliminate the sales of iPhone altogether,” Luria said. “These are all things that any country that the U.S. is getting into a confrontation with could decide to do in order to exert pressure on the U.S. to reduce those tariffs.” Following the first set of 10% tariffs on Chinese imports last month, Beijing was quick to retaliate with an investigation into alleged antitrust violations by Google while reportedly laying the groundwork for a formal probe into Apple’s App Store. Last month, the Financial Times reported that the EU is ready to impose retaliatory measures on Big Tech companies in the case of a potential dispute with the Trump administration. Trump has threatened to use tariffs on the EU several times. But some are optimistic that things won’t escalate to that point. “As we navigated in 2018/2019 we caution this is all a game of high stakes poker to get other countries to the negotiating table and will very likely not last for an elongated period of time,” Wedbush’s Dan Ives wrote in Tuesday morning’s note. An aggressive approach towards China and chip export controls is “the biggest risk” to the artificial intelligence trade, according to Ives. Nvidia (NVDA) stock closed down 8.7% on Monday after Singaporean police uncovered an illegal export operation aiming to take servers containing Nvidia chips to mainland China in violation of American chip export controls that the market fears the U.S. might now further restrict. “Outside of the U.S., there’s been a surprising amount of openness to working on DeepSeek models, and the more the U.S. alienates its trading partners, the more likely they are to gravitate to Chinese models,” Luria said. But any slowdown in the AI trade associated with these tariff-borne near-term risks will be short-lived, according to Wedbush analysts. “Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Palantir (PLTR), Salesforce (CRM), Tesla, Apple will remain the stocks to own and any weakness is a buying opportunity in our view given the fundamental demand picture,” Ives wrote. “This will be an ‘uncomfortable time for growth investors’... but ultimately this is not the time to run for the hills in the tech trade and instead own these tech AI winners.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Click here to subscribe and get it in your inbox every Tuesday. Women experienced less gender discrimination when working remotely than when working in-person, according to a new study. As companies (and the government) continue to bring their employees back to the office, researchers at the University of Toronto recently published a study that shows remote work is protecting women from gender discrimination. The December 2024 report shows that of the more than 1,000 women surveyed, 31% experienced gender discrimination when working at their physical workplace, compared to 17% of those working remotely. The research is part of a larger group of studies that show how women benefit from remote work. From increased participation in the labor market to flexible childcare options, flexible work arrangements have been seen as a large win for working women. Meanwhile, men continue to “disproportionately” benefit from in-person work, according to HR Dive. Still, the study’s authors warned against extrapolating the results too far––remote work won’t fix workplace discrimination, they warned, but the data shows such instances are decreasing. Happy reading, and hope you have a lovely week! Practical insights and advice from Forbes staff and contributors to help you succeed in your job, accelerate your career and lead smarter Here’s how to grow in your career if you don’t want to be a manager. If you fear layoffs may be in your company’s future, here’s how to protect your career. Still thinking about The Oscars? Here are the leadership lessons you can learn from Sunday’s biggest moments. Melly Barajas, owner and head distiller of Leyenda de Mexico made this year's 50 Over 50 Global list. When Melly Barajas, now known as the “Queen of Tequila” among industry circles, first started hiring for her Leyenda de Mexico Tequila distillery, she was shocked to find only women showed up for the job openings. Today, the company produces 20,000 liters of tequila a day to be sold across her brands. I spoke with Barajas, an honoree of this year’s 50 Over 50 Global list, about what it means to run an all-women team, the rise in female distillers, and how she empowers her employees. This is an excerpt of that conversation, of which you can listen to in full here. The tequila industry has been dominated by men for quite some time. Can you walk me through the choice to hire only women to work in the factory when you first started 25 years ago? It wasn’t conscious. Only women started working with me not because I decided to do so. I mean, in the towns of Mexico, you know that most of the men go to the United States or elsewhere to look for other opportunities. So the town was full of daughters, mothers, grandmothers who wanted to do something. So, the fact that they believed in me, that is to say, gave me the driving force that now drives me. They came in and were like “Oh, ma’am I learned how to distill and my son congratulated me and they had never said anything to me!” So they were really excited about contributing. And I had to teach them to have strength and to believe in themselves, too, because it was also very difficult. I would arrive and ask them: “What do you want to do?” “No, well I know how to sweep and mop.” “But what else would you like to learn about? What about this machine?” And they wouldn’t believe they could do it, so a lot of it was also teaching them that they can do it and learn more skills. How have you seen the industry change since you started? I really think this industry needed the female touch. They’ll kill me for having said that, but it’s the truth. I mean, there are really a lot of people, as I said, who have all their lives and pedigree and everything, but women really get to do things a little bit differently. When they tell me that so-and-so died, and the wife, instead of selling the tequila plant she is going to take charge, I applaud them! Or that so-and-so is going to leave his daughter at the front of the tequila factory, I applaud them, to tell you the truth. It is very nice because, whether you like it or not, we give real added value. Women do not subtract. And in this industry the feminine touch was missing. I used to feel horrible arriving at industry meetings and it was all men, and I was standing around like a kid. And now it is so nice to see two, three, four, five women in the room. The pandemic was a really big turning point for lots of businesses and workers alike. Can you talk about how you and Leyenda de Mexico were impacted? We did not close our doors a single day. I’d hear about other distilleries closing and that was like a stake through my heart, you know? I wondered how I was still going, if I should go on. But I kept motivating our workers. I told them: No ladies, we keep going, you can do it. And then sometimes there was a time when I said well, we are going to close even if it is only for 15 days, but when they came and told me, “Ma’am, do you remember my dad would get angry because I came to work? Yes, now he sits down to talk to me at night because I’m financially maintaining our household.” You think I was going to close after that? No. Wow, it’s really about motivating them, right? How have you seen your employees take that motivation and put it into action? Yes. Like I told you before, it’s about teaching them to try different things. After the pandemic, we ramped up production by five times, all with the same amount of staff. The girls would tell me: “Listen, ma’am, I can do this in X-amount of time. But if you buy this new machine I’ll be able to do twice as much.” And that’s how we grew quickly. News from the world of work A top Pentagon DOGE staffer looks like a successful founder, having raised $10 million for a telehealth startup. But Justin Fulcher’s story doesn’t always add up: The company went bankrupt, and he is now being accused of unpaid bills and overstating his credentials, David Jeans reports. Some economists worry that job growth is increasingly limited to a few industries. The unemployment rate remains low, but new jobs are mostly coming from the healthcare and hospitality fields, while the white collar market remains stagnant. Meta must face a lawsuit alleging it prefers to hire international visa-holders over American workers because of cheaper labor, a federal judge ruled last week. The tech giant isn’t the only company currently in litigation over alleged “systemic preferences” for visa holders: Current and former employees of Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC are suing the company over alleged “anti-American” discrimination. Workers at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Education are being offered thousands of dollars to quit, up to $50,000 and $25,000, respectively. Corporate America has been known to use pay-to-quit programs as a way to reduce headcount. When Amazon bought Zappos in 2014, for instance, Jeff Bezos implemented a similar program. Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Agency announced a “hiring supercharge” for more air traffic controllers after a start of the year filled with high-profile plane accidents.

The S&P 500 took a sharp hit on Tuesday as newly implemented tariffs rattled investors’ confidence and continued a selloff that has now fully erased the market’s gains since the election of President Donald Trump in November. Trade war concerns prompted the S&P 500 to drop to an intraday low of 5,732.59 during a widespread market selloff, falling well below its close of 5,929.04 on Nov. 6, the day after the election. The index, after having its worst day of the year on Monday, finished Tuesday with a loss of 1.2%. “This is the first market day we’ve had in which investors have been saying they’re really afraid of an economic slowdown,” Chris Grisanti, chief market strategist at MAI Capital Management, told Quartz. Trading was very unusual on Tuesday, with industrials and banks way off. Other major indices, such as the Nasdaq Composite, shed 0.35%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 670 points or 1.5% by the end of the day in New York. Tesla (TSLA) stock declined on Tuesday due to rising fears about tariffs among investors — car prices may be driven higher by the duties. The company also has a large presence in China, including a major assembly plant, and so may be vulnerable to retaliation by Beijing. Additionally, Bank of America (BAC) reduced its price target for the stock to $380 from $490 while maintaining a Neutral rating. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas yesterday had designated Tesla stock as a “Top Pick” in the U.S. automotive sector and raised his price target to $430. Target’s (TGT) stock fell after it said it expects a “meaningful” year-on-year decline in first-quarter profits compared and CEO Brian Cornell warned that the new tariffs may prompt the retailer to increase prices as soon as next week. The company’s fourth-quarter earnings beat Wall Street’s expectations. Best Buy (BBY) stock dropped 12% after company executives warned that the duties could increase the prices of goods it sells and could reduce its comparable sales if they stay in place for a full year. The electronics retailer reported fourth-quarter results that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations.

Title: LA Times Will Label Opinion Articles With AI-Powered ‘Bias Meter’

The Los Angeles Times has seen better days as the company’s billionaire owner continues taking a wrecking ball to the nearly 150-year-old institution. Waves of layoffs and editorial interference by Patrick Soon-Shiong, a vocal Trump supporter, has tanked morale, and now the owner has set his sights on AI as the panacea that will improve trust and, ultimately, the fortunes of the newspaper. Soon-Shiong announced this week that opinion articles will now include an AI-powered bias meter that labels articles based on an algorithm’s perceived interpretation of its political leanings. The new labels include âLeft, Center Left, Center, Center Right or Right,â and are determined by a startup called Particle.News, which was founded by former Twitter engineers. There will also be a section called “Viewspoints,” powered by AI startup Perplexity, that will display alternative views to those put forth in an article. These new AI products will apply not just to opinion pieces but any âarticles that offer a point of view on an issue,â according to a statement received by The Guardian. Opinion-oriented articles will be more clearly delineated from straight news reports with a new “Voices” label. Standard news articles will not include the AI features. Voices and Insights button now live â¦@latimesâ©. Try it. Now the voice and perspective from all sides can be heard, seen and read âno more echo chamber. Thanks to our talented content management software team running this Graphene platform pic.twitter.com/HslD5dKinz — Dr. Pat Soon-Shiong (@DrPatSoonShiong) March 3, 2025 Trust in media is notoriously low, and it is worth experimenting to see how the tide can be turned. But it is all a bit ironic that Soon-Shiong claims to be trying to improve trust in the media while he repeatedly interferes in reporting. The billionaire caught flak in 2024 after sharing on X an opinion piece that the original author claimed was altered after submission to make it appear more positive about Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Multiple staffers left after Soon-Shiong similarly interfered in an article regarding one of his friends who got into an altercation over a dog attack. It does not instill much “trust” when the billionaire owner is second-guessing journalists’ decisions about newsworthiness and getting personally involved when reporters are investigating his friends. While the Times’ editorial union is not necessarily opposed to displaying alternative opinions against an article, they say that AI is not the way to do this. The AI-generated viewpoints will not be scrutinized by editors, and of course, AI models continue to make up information and get basic queries wrong (during the recent Oscars, ChatGPT surfaced nominees from the wrong year). Already, the Guardian reports that some of the contrasting viewpoints suggested by the AI tool were featured in the article itself. âThe money for this endeavor could have been directed elsewhere: supporting our journalists on the ground who have had no cost-of-living increase since 2021,â said Matt Hamilton, vice president of the LATimes Guild. It seems inevitable that we are heading towards a place where the internet is rife with AI-created, pseudo-academic writing filled with made-up facts and quotes, which will then get cemented into âknowledgeâ as those articles become the training fodder for future models. How much of this will end up in the alternative viewpoints on Times articles?Â Perplexity, it should be noted, has shown disdain for the journalism industry in general by scraping articles and regurgitating them almost whole-cloth in its chatbot, claiming fair use over the practice. When New York Times staffers went on strike last year during labor negotiations, Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas offered to provide AI tools that he suggested could replace them. Showing similar disdain for his own employees, it would not be surprising to see Soon-Shiong expand the use of AI to write entire articles. Other news organizations have experimented with AI in small and subtle ways. The Washington Post now automatically summarizes articles and surfaces key points at the top. That newspaper is experiencing its own turmoil as billionaire owner Jeff Bezos pivots from a hands-off ownership to exerting more control and making its opinion section entirely pro-capitalism and “free markets.” The Post lost hundreds of thousands of subscribers since Bezos blocked the newspaper from endorsing Kamala Harris and has again bled subscribers following the changes to the opinion section. It was only a few years ago that the likes of Bezos appeared to be benevolent billionaires who would swoop in and save legacy media from the destruction wrought by the internet. We were naive to believe that. This was always going to be the problem with news organizations owned by billionaires with conflicting interests. Today, the name of the game is pleasing President Trump so he does not go on the attack against Amazon, and perhaps tosses Blue Origin some new contracts.

U.S. stocks plummeted again on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 670 points as President Donald Trump’s newly imposed 25% tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico, and China prompted retaliatory measures from some of the affected countries. China imposed additional duties of up to 15% on certain U.S. products. Ottawa retaliated with 25% tariffs on $30 billion worth of U.S. goods starting Tuesday, rising to cover $125 billion of merchandise in 21 days. Canada’s provinces are taking their own actions, and irate citizens are boycotting U.S. products.

Title: How Trump’s Tariffs Are Ushering In A New World Order

ByMegan Poinski andCFO ByMegan Poinski , Forbes Staff andCFO , Forbes Staff. Today is the day: The sweeping 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada that President Donald Trump has been talking about since his term began are here. Whether or not they would actually start today was an open question until late Monday afternoon when Trump confirmed them, as well as an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, upping new tariffs on the U.S.’s third-largest trading partner to 20%. The announcement sent many key economic indicators way down. Stocks fell across the board, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq and S&P cratering. Chip maker Nvidia took an unusually deep tumble, with its stock falling more than 8.6%—though that can be partially attributed to how Chinese buyers are getting around export controls to get Nvidia’s powerful AI chips, according to a Wall Street Journal report. The across-the-board selloff continued Tuesday morning, with all indexes dropping more than 1.4% in the first hour of trading. The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow forecast, a constantly updated forecast of GDP growth based on real-time economic conditions, plummeted from more than 2% to -2.8% based on the tariff announcement. Analysts say that Trump is watching the stock market closely and may use it as an indicator to temper his policies. Forbes’ Sergei Klebnikov and Matt Schifrin write that the markets may be the only true check on Trump’s policies—the Republican majority Congress has so far bowed to his wishes with few questions, and many judicial rulings against Trump’s agenda have been appealed and largely unheeded so far. In his first term, Klebnikov and Schifrin write, Trump paid attention to the markets, signing a 2018 trade agreement with China after a tariff announcement caused the markets to fall 5% in one week. But Trump’s reaction may not be the same this week. After all, he’s been talking about tariffs since the campaign trail, calling himself the “Tariff Man” and proclaiming tariff “the most beautiful word in the dictionary.” A post on Truth Social yesterday tells farmers that they should get ready to export less because of the coming levies—“Have fun!” China immediately announced retaliatory tariffs and blacklisted some U.S. companies, while Canada introduced a slate of its own charges on the U.S. Target CEO Brian Cornell warned consumers will likely see higher prices this week, since the bulk of fruits and vegetables are imported from Mexico this time of year. But Trump is sure to trumpet tariffs and his economic plan at his address to Congress tonight. The reception—both from Congress and Americans watching—will be telling. And this is just one set: New tariffs on aluminum and steel imports and reciprocal tariffs on all countries are slated to go into effect next month. Even if it all goes away or is reduced, Trump's aggressive policy swings may not bode well for the economy as a whole. Forbes senior contributor Christian Weller wrote about the most recent Economic Policy Uncertainty Index, compiled by researchers from Northwestern University, Stanford University and the University of Chicago. Policy uncertainty leads to a slowing economy, with lower consumer sentiment and industrial production. In other words, certainty is a vital ingredient for economic growth. Since Trump’s election, the uncertainty index has increased by more than 66%. The way businesses operate is likely seeing a permanent change from Trump’s tariffs. Last week, I talked to Paul Johnson, executive director of the Gabelli Center for Global Security Analysis at Fordham University’s Gabelli School of Business, about what it means to business leaders. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. And a reminder that we’re seeking feedback from leaders to help compile Forbes’ next installment of the New Ivies—the public and private colleges that are graduating the most prepared and competitive young talent. Please share your experience in this survey. getty The saga of the Corporate Transparency Act continues. This week, the Treasury Department announced that only foreign companies need to comply with the beneficial ownership information reporting, writes Forbes’ Kelly Phillips Erb. President Trump praised the decision in a Truth Social post, saying the CTA reporting was an “outrageous and invasive” requirement. It’s not surprising Trump doesn’t like the law—he vetoed the bill that contained it in 2021. A bipartisan coalition in Congress overrode his veto. The law sought to shed some light on anonymous shell companies, and as written, required companies to disclose who controls it to the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. Since it became law, the CTA’s beneficial ownership information reporting requirement has been challenged in federal court cases, putting the requirement on hold, then allowing it to go forward. Before this announcement, the requirement was back, and FinCEN extended the reporting deadline to March 21. It’s unclear what will happen with the still-pending cases. Also unclear: Whether the Republican-majority Congress will object to the president unilaterally halting a bipartisan initiative. President Donald Trump. Since the campaign trail, Trump has said he will create a national cryptocurrency reserve. He announced it on Truth Social over the weekend, saying that the new “crypto strategic reserve” will have bitcoin and ethereum at its core, but will also include XRP, solana and ADA. The announcement builds on a January 23 executive order to create a working group to propose regulations for cryptocurrency and evaluate a “national digital asset stockpile.” However, many big names in crypto and tech didn’t like Trump’s weekend announcement. Forbes’ Derek Saul writes that Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong posted on X that the best option would be using only bitcoin to become the “successor to gold” for the government. Trump supporter and Palantir cofounder Joe Lonsdale said it’s “wrong to tax me for crypto bro schemes” and “not the proper, principled role of government” to finance a crypto reserve. And Jason Calacanis, who co-hosts the “All-In” Silicon Valley podcast with Trump’s “crypto czar” David Sacks, called the move the “Trump Pump” and called it “an insane grift.” A table at a job fair in Florida last year. While it hasn’t shown up yet in economic reports, major U.S. job losses are coming. Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger writes that retail closures at national chains Party City and Joann’s will bring 16,000 and 19,000 fewer jobs, respectively. Estée Lauder, Starbucks, Kohl’s and Walmart have also announced major layoffs. And outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported retail job cuts in January were 20% higher than a year ago. Massive job cuts are on the way in other sectors as well. Through Elon Musk’s federal spending slashing as part of the Department of Government Efficiency, tens of thousands of federal government employees have lost their jobs. The job slashing continues, with agencies reportedly offering employees up to $50,000 to voluntarily resign. Paul Johnson, executive director of the Gabelli Center for Global Security Analysis at Fordham University’s Gabelli School of Business. Trump’s tariffs are going from largely a threat to reality today, causing major changes for many businesses worldwide. Before most of them took effect, I talked to Paul Johnson, executive director of the Gabelli Center for Global Security Analysis at Fordham University’s Gabelli School of Business, about what businesses should be doing. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. How have tariff threats impacted businesses so far? Johnson: Tariffs increase prices. Prices will go up. If I’m a business leader, the odds are greater than zero that the tariffs will be put in place. When they do, I know that that product for me is going to go up in price. So if I am a prudent leader, I am out looking for alternative sources. The administration wants us to believe that’s a positive, so [businesses] will start shopping in the U.S. But a thoughtful leader's already been canvasing the planet for the lowest cost of that product. There’s lots of reasons you buy things, and most businesses are to some degree always on the lookout for a cheaper, better way to do things. That’s standard business practice. Now, all of a sudden, there’s a new administration and we’re talking tariffs. Everybody is starting to look for alternatives. If those exist in the U.S., that company supplier may benefit from that. But you have to ask yourself, well, why wasn’t the customer in this case already buying American? There’s so much uncertainty. I know that anything I import or anything I buy from somebody who imported it, the price is going up. That’s facts. Now I’m scrambling [to] see what our alternatives are. If it’s a U.S. solution, I suspect that that solution is already more expensive than the import. If the import goes up by a lot, then all of a sudden I may have no choice but to buy American. I don’t mean that as a negative, but I have no choice but to buy a more expensive product made in America. Business people are not paid to be patriotic. They’re paid to be efficient. Businesses likely have been looking at their supply chains and potential impacts for months because of what Trump has said about tariffs. Should they consider these changes as fixes for now, or is this the beginning of a new world order? Absolutely we have a new world order. Anybody who’s looking at the model—the 70 years post World War II—that’s gone. Dead. And I don’t know that we [will] ever recover it. There’s no question that the old rules have changed. Covid started it, and this is now accelerating it. What should companies do? At the board level, it should be a holistic review of the business. What is our value add? If your value add is that you were nothing more than an importer, that business has changed dramatically. If your business is delivering value in other ways, it’s time to reevaluate. It’s a great wake up call. It’s frustrating, there’s a lot of uncertainty, but in a sense it could be incredibly healthy. The smart ones are going to say, ‘Hold on a second, why are we in business? What is it we’re delivering to our customers? What is that value? What do they value? What's the relationship like?’ It doesn’t have to be an eight-month study. Let’s have this discussion: Where are we crossing borders one way or the other? Exporting or importing? Where are we affected on the demand side? Are we shipping outside the U.S.? Are we importing raw material? Are we importing finished goods or equipment? How important is that to our value add? Should we even be in that part of the business? Can we even replace that? Is there a domestic solution that would get you out of that? What advice would you give business leaders looking forward to the next six months? Freeze for a second. Reevaluate some other best practices. Check in with your customers and find out how they’re doing because they may be struggling a bit, and that’s going to come back to you. I would definitely look at my supply chain, where I’m vulnerable both financially and [with] availability, because not having a product is always frustrating to your customers. I would be a bit more cautious on any project that’s got a lot of uncertainty inherent in it. It might just slow down a little bit. I want to protect my balance sheet. I want to protect my current employees. I hate to say this, but you might not hire that extra employee yet. Say to your employees, ‘We’re just being a bit more cautious. I know everyone’s stressed. We appreciate it. This is temporary. We’re not trying to kill you.’ It is time to laser focus in this period of uncertainty. Some of that uncertainty will turn into risk. Some of it will turn into opportunity. The weirdest part is that you may actually become a better business.

Four of the five major tech companies represented at President Trump’s inauguration have seen their share prices decline in 2025, including Tesla, which has taken a 30% hit If, after seeing a who’s who of Silicon Valley executives at President Trump’s inauguration in January, you believed it was going to be the Year of Big Tech, you’d be wrong — at least so far. Instead, four of the five major tech companies represented at the inauguration — Amazon, Apple, Tesla and Alphabet, Google’s parent company — have seen their share prices take a noticeable hit to start 2025. Only Meta, who was represented by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, has seen its share price climb this year. Here’s how those companies have performed on Wall Street since the start of the year, by mid-morning on Tuesday: — Meta: up 4.7% — Apple: down 1.9% — Amazon: down 9.6% — Alphabet: down 11.8% — Tesla: down 30% Tesla, as seen above, has been particularly hard-hit in 2025. CEO Elon Musk has been spearheading the Department of Government Efficiency for President Trump, as both are aiming to cut at least $1 trillion from the federal bureaucracy. Musk’s time spent away from his electric car company has upset some investors, who are calling for him to spend more time on Tesla and less time on DOGE. Reports of softening sales in China have not helped, either, although Tesla bulls are pointing to revamped models, the expansion of its self-driving technology and the launch of its $20,000 Optimus robots as reasons to be optimistic. From a macro standpoint, the market has taken a downturn recently, with many analysts saying the tariffs imposed by President Trump have been a key driver of the dip. The Nasdaq, Dow Jones and S&P 500 were all down about 2% on Tuesday, a day after the president said he would be imposing tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico. The Wall Street slide for the major tech companies stands out, after Musk, Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Alphabet chief Sundar Pichai and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos literally stood behind the president on Jan. 20 in Washington, D.C. Many Trump fans who attended the inauguration told TheWrap they were skeptical of Big Tech’s sudden embrace of Trump, aside from Musk, whom the crowd overwhelmingly seemed to like. Now, it will be worth watching to see if investors remain skeptical of the market, or if they are “buying the dip” on these Big Tech stocks.

Title: The Uncomfortable Truth Behind Tesla’s Falling Stock Prices

Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily. Elon Musk has become as much the face of Donald Trump’s presidency as Trump himself. Musk speaks at Cabinet meetings, sits down with Sean Hannity as Trump’s equal, and takes reporters’ questions from the Oval Office. He walks around like he owns the place, not wearing a suit—now a big deal, apparently!—and letting his son use him as a human jungle gym as he stands a few steps away from where Trump sits. Musk has garnered lots of attention for this power move. Some is positive. Most is not. Tesla, his biggest company, has become the subject of widespread boycotting calls by his and Trump’s opponents. There are frequent protests outside of Tesla showrooms. Barely a day passes without the viral egging of a Cybertruck. Tesla owners are getting international press attention for flipping their cars at a loss just to get rid of them. “I’m selling the Nazi mobile,” one dissatisfied driver says. The social internet might create an outsized impression of how common those acts of resistance are, but they still seem at least reflective of a shift. Public approval of Musk’s government obliteration really is low, and disapproval of Tesla itself is higher than ever. Meanwhile, Tesla’s stock price is declining rapidly. Musk’s largest company lost 24 percent of its value in February. It was the stock’s second worst month ever, and then it fell another 3 percent on Monday, the first trading day of March. What a coincidence it would be if none of that had anything to do with the ever-growing, controversial public persona of its very famous chief executive. Big left-of-center social media accounts are celebrating their work: “Congrats, everyone—the Elon boycott is working!” a Bluesky post from a mysterious account with 800,000 followers reads. How much of that is wishful thinking by liberals desperate for a win, and how much is the anti-Musk resistance already notching wins? We know from recent history that Musk’s intense focus on non-Tesla projects can be a drag on Tesla’s stock. We also know that the stock can go back up rapidly without Musk dialing back his obnoxiousness or giving up his other projects. We do not know how much of the electric car company’s recent tanking owes to opposition to Musk personally and how much stems from Tesla’s wider business challenges, or how much those two things have to do with each other. In other words: Claiming that Tesla boycotts have hurt Musk any worse than a bee sting is speculative cope—but it doesn’t have to stay that way. The job, as Kobe Bryant once said, is not finished. People don’t fill out a questionnaire every time they sell Tesla stock, so we don’t know exactly what causes its price to go down. The evidence is strong, though, that Tesla shares trade down when the spotlight shines extra brightly on Musk paying attention to other things. Tesla’s stock began struggling more or less concurrently with Musk launching his bid for Twitter in the spring of 2022. The stock had a very bad year even compared to other American stocks, and Musk’s selling of Tesla shares (and an aborted plan to use Tesla shares as collateral for his bank loans) aggravated the situation. Musk is always very famous and always known to have lots of balls in the air, but he’s not usually as famous as he is right now. To the extent that Americans are aware of what his “government efficiency” initiative is up to, the polling says they are skeptical of it and of Musk specifically. A team of Wedbush Securities analysts, who are bullish on Tesla overall, put it this way in a Feb. 24 note to clients: “The worry of the Street is that Musk dedicating so much time (even more than we expected) to DOGE takes away from his time at Tesla in such a crucial moment and year for the company.” The investment firm thinks Tesla will manage through its Musk-related branding problems and its stock will rebound, but it calls a spade a spade. Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency and Trump alliance “clearly could alienate some consumers to move away from the Tesla brand.” But there are problems with the idea that anti-Musk sentiment is driving Tesla into the ground. The stock had a miserable February but remains up nearly 40 percent over the past six months. Trump’s victory was a win for Tesla’s stock. The day after the election, investment research firm CFRA found that Tesla and Musk “are perhaps the biggest winners from the election result, and we believe Trump’s victory will help expedite regulatory approval of the company’s autonomous driving technology.” Any gains the boycotters have made so far have not outweighed the benefit to Tesla’s stock from having its CEO more or less running the American government. After all, this self-serving domination of our politics is the very genesis of the protests. There is also the distinct possibility that Tesla’s stock just goes up anyway even if Musk never changes his behavior and liberals never bought a Tesla or rode in one when ordering an Uber again. Musk’s obsession with Twitter dragged the stock for a while, but then the car company’s stock shot up to market-beating heights in 2023 and 2024. It’s not as if Musk quieted down or became a less controversial public figure the past two years. Quite the opposite. Tesla’s biggest problems at the end of 2022 were not just about Musk’s reputation, but headwinds in the electric car market and broader economy. The company addressed those worries to Wall Street’s satisfaction, at least for a time. There’s a fair case that this time will be different, though. Musk is now very popular with Republicans, which would be better for Tesla if Republicans bought electric vehicles. But they don’t, perhaps because conservative media and politicians have spent years denigrating EVs whenever possible. Meanwhile, Democrats do buy electric vehicles but, I think it’s safe to say, will increasingly look for EV vendors who are not Elon Musk. Again, that would be less of a problem for Tesla if Republican adoration of Musk converted to more GOP voter enthusiasm for electric cars. “Could Elon Musk move that troublesome GOP needle?” asked Republican political operative Mike Murphy in a February report accompanying a new poll on the issue. “With his hostility to EV consumer subsidies, and the unwelcome market competition for Tesla that it helps create, the early answer is probably not. Elon seems focused on other things now and helping break down GOP hostility to EVs appears to be low on his priority list.” Tesla has other challenges elsewhere. Sales have been bad lately in Europe, where Musk has also done a bunch of political meddling. Increased Chinese competition for EV market share in that country was likely the biggest problem for Tesla’s stock two years ago, and the company is still losing ground there. The company underperformed in new car deliveries in the fourth quarter of last year, before DOGE existed or Musk cosplayed as Benito Mussolini on a podium on Inauguration Day. Federal regulators launched their latest probe into Tesla self-driving technology in the last few days of the Biden administration. Does the federal government still regulate Tesla in any serious way? Maybe not, but other countries reserve their rights to do so, and every news story with the words “investigation” and “self-driving” is bad press. This blend of events leaves the anti-Musk, anti-Tesla forces in a place of opportunity. While it’s a stretch to say that protests and boycott calls were responsible for all of the stock’s drop in February, or even most of it, it’s implausible that they’ve had no effect on investor confidence in the company. Musk is the face of Tesla, and he has polarized himself against the people who are most likely to buy his company’s primary product. That may not hurt Musk in the long run. He could find more customers elsewhere, or he could persuade huge swaths of Republicans that they are saving America by purchasing his electric cars. Moreover, even if huge numbers of people dislike Musk, many of them may not shun Tesla as a result. The link between disdain and action may not form, in the same way that people who don’t like slaughterhouses still eat steak. A recent observation by New York City–based climate reporter Kendra Pierre-Louis on Bluesky has stuck with me: “I went to the tesla protest for a thing I’m working on and I talked to several onlookers - not protesters - and asked them what they knew about Elon and Doge and I’m telling you people don’t know.” Creating that link in a collective mass of minds requires relentless news coverage and reaching millions of people who do not consume a lot of political news. Right now, people are showing up at Tesla locations and shaming Tesla car owners in an effort to build that attention. It might not be enough, but it’s a more effective and satisfying plan to counter Musk than anything that has so far emerged from most Democrats with power.

Title: FTC hit by layoffs in consumer protection & antitrust offices

DOGE, run by Elon Musk, has been primarily responsible for carrying out this task. Now, for the first time, the FTC has laid off workers from sections such as consumer protection and antitrust. As reported by The Verge, “at least” a dozen probationary staffers at the Federal Trade Commission were laid off last week. The layoffs affected both the Bureau of Consumer Protection and the Bureau of Competition offices. Until now, the FTC had remained safe from government staff cuts. However, it seems that the measures have finally reached the organization. That said, the report mentions that they could not confirm that the layoffs are directly related to DOGE. Donald Trump authorized the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency after receiving Musk’s idea. Both believed that government organizations have way more employees than they actually need. So, DOGE is in charge of trying to solve that situation. Trump was convinced by the downsizing work Musk did at X (FKA Twitter). There have been recent layoffs at the FTC before, but these were not caused by DOGE either. The department affected at that time was the internal equal opportunity office. This was a result of the executive order signed by Donald Trump banning DEI programs in government organizations. Big tech companies, such as Google, Meta, and Amazon, have also followed this mandate. “DEI is over at the FTC,” said Republican Andrew Ferguson, FTC Chair, at the time. The National Treasury Employees are aware of the layoffs at the FTC. However, they do not know the real scope of the changes underway within the agency. Its website now includes a notice with the steps that the laid-off employees could take now. The Trump administration is also preparing a staff move at the FTC in Washington. They will now occupy the building formerly occupied by the dismantled USAID, Bloomberg reports. Copyright ©2025 Android Headlines. All Rights Reserved.

The Trump administration's long-promised tariffs took hold on Tuesday. U.S. stocks tumbled on Tuesday after the Trump administration’s long-promised tariffs took effect. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 670 points, or 1.5%; while the S&P 500 fell 1.2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq ticked down 0.3%. The policy taxes imports from Mexico, Canada and China -- the three largest trading partners of the United States -- meaning that it could raise prices for everything from gasoline to avocados to iPhones. Shares of retail giant Target fell 3% on Tuesday, following an earnings release from the company that cited "tariff uncertainty" as a potential impediment for the business. Walmart's stock price dipped about 2.5% on Tuesday, while Amazon shares inched down 0.6%. Shares of Best Buy plummeted more than 13%. The sharp drop came after Best Buy CEO told analysts that price increases are "highly likely" as a result of the tariffs. Higher costs for car production could also pose a challenge for U.S. automakers, many of which depend on a supply chain closely intertwined with Mexico and Canada. Shares of Ford tumbled nearly 3% on Tuesday, while General Motors dropped about 4.5%. Stellantis -- the parent company of Jeep and Chrysler -- saw shares decline more than 4%. Tesla, the electric carmaker led by Elon Musk, saw its stock price drop about 4.5%. The far-reaching losses extend a market slide that began on Monday afternoon when Trump affirmed plans to impose a fresh round of tariffs. Trump stuck to a March 4 start date for 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, as well as 10% tariff on Chinese goods -- which, as of Tuesday, rises to 20%, per an amended executive order. Tariffs of this magnitude would likely increase prices paid by U.S. shoppers, since importers typically pass along a share of the cost of those higher taxes to consumers, experts said. The duties also raise input costs for manufacturers that import raw materials. In addition to Tesla and Amazon, the tariffs appeared to impact some of the other so-called "Magnificent Seven," a group of large tech firms that helped drive stock market gains in recent years. Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, suffered a 2% drop in its stock price. Apple, which makes some of its products in China, fell nearly 1%. Shares of Microsoft defied the trend, however, remaining essentially unchanged on Tuesday. Chipmaker Nvidia, which relies on semiconductors from Taiwan but also imports some materials from Mexico, saw shares increase about 1.5%. Alphabet's stock price climbed about 2%.

Title: Bitcoin’s ‘KISS Of Death’? Arthur Hayes Warns Of Recession Before Surge
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-kiss-of-death-arthur-hayes-recession/
Time Published: 2025-03-04T14:00:05Z

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. In his latest blog post, titled “KISS of Death,” former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes outlines a provocative thesis on the trajectory of Bitcoin and broader financial markets under the renewed presidency of Donald Trump. Hayes—who has long held bullish views on crypto—argues that a convergence of fiscal and monetary policies could catapult Bitcoin’s price to as high as $1 million during the Trump 2.0 era, but only after a period of recession-driven turmoil. Hayes’s framework revolves around the “KISS” principle—Keep It Simple, Stupid—urging market participants to stay focused on the core driver of asset prices: liquidity. Rather than overreacting to sensational headlines, he contends that one should watch for shifts in the quantity and price of money (i.e., how much credit is created and at what interest rate). “One day, you buy and then quickly sell after digesting the next headline,” Hayes warns. “The market chops you in the process, and your stack quickly diminishes.” He recommends sticking to a simpler outlook: If the U.S. government prints significant amounts of money at lower rates, risk assets like Bitcoin can surge. A key premise of Hayes’s analysis is that President Trump, a “real estate showman” by background, will debt finance his “America First” agenda rather than embrace austerity. Hayes contrasts Trump with Andrew Mellon—Treasury Secretary under Herbert Hoover—who once allegedly declared: “Liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate farmers, liquidate real estate. It will purge the rottenness out of the system.” Hayes argues that such a stance would be political suicide for a president seeking to be viewed as the 21st-century Franklin D. Roosevelt rather than Hoover. As Hayes puts it, “Trump wants to be considered the greatest President ever” and is therefore inclined to loosen credit conditions rather than tighten them. Hayes highlights Trump’s unconventional maneuver to slash federal spending and potentially trigger a recession, thereby forcing the Federal Reserve to respond with rate cuts and fresh liquidity. The newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by high-profile entrepreneur Elon Musk, is portrayed as an aggressive effort to expose fraud and reduce waste in government programs. Hayes cites DOGE’s claims that Social Security payments may be going out to deceased individuals or unverified identities, supposedly costing hundreds of billions—or even a trillion—dollars a year. “Trump and DOGE are firing hundreds of thousands of government employees,” Hayes notes, referencing media reports citing elevated jobless claims in the Washington, D.C., area. By cutting federal budgets so drastically and so quickly, Trump could—in Hayes’s words—“cause a recession or convince the market that one is right around the corner.” Once signs of recession appear, Hayes predicts Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will have little choice but to cut rates, end quantitative tightening (QT), and potentially restart quantitative easing (QE) to avert a widespread financial crisis. Powell, whom Hayes dubs a “turncoat traitor” (a reference to the Fed’s past rate cut during Kamala Harris’s campaign), is nonetheless bound by the Fed’s mandate to maintain economic stability. Hayes points to $2.08 trillion in US corporate debt and $10 trillion in US Treasury debt that must roll over in 2025. If the economy slows, rolling that debt over at high interest rates becomes unfeasible. In that scenario, the Fed’s only salvation is fresh money creation and lower rates. Hayes calculates that a full Fed response—encompassing several policy shifts—could result in as much as $2.74 to $3.24 trillion in new liquidity: Dropping the Federal Funds Rate from 4.25% to 0% could be equivalent to roughly $1.7 trillion of money printing, according to Hayes’s estimates. Currently, the Fed conducts $60 billion per month in QT. If QT ends by April 2025, Hayes sees a $540 billion liquidity injection relative to prior expectations. Additional Treasury purchases by the Fed or US commercial banks (the latter aided by a relaxation of the Supplemental Leverage Ratio) might add another $500 billion to $1 trillion in dollar credit. He compares this to the $4 trillion in stimulus measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given that Bitcoin jumped roughly 24x from its 2020 lows to 2021 highs in response to that liquidity wave, Hayes says even a more conservative 10x multiple could be in play. “For those who ask how we get to $1 million in Bitcoin during the Trump presidency, this is how,” he proclaims, linking massive credit creation with a sharply higher BTC price. Despite his bullish long-term forecast, Hayes believes Bitcoin’s immediate outlook may be rocky. Hayes sees potential for Bitcoin to revisit the $70,000 to $80,000 range in the short-term—levels that are markedly above the prior cycle’s all-time high but still below the current market. “If Bitcoin leads the market on the downside, it will also do so on the upside,” Hayes writes, positing that BTC often bottoms out before traditional equities. He cites the significant run-up to $110,000 around mid-January (Trump’s inauguration timeline) followed by a pullback to $78,000 in late February. “Bitcoin is screaming that a liquidity crisis is nigh, even though the U.S. stock market indices are still near their all-time highs,” he notes. “I firmly believe we are still in a bull cycle, and as such, the bottom at worst will be the previous cycle’s all-time high of $70,000,” Hayes says, underscoring his conviction that any major dips are opportunities to accumulate rather than panic-sell. In Hayes’s view, the “Kiss of Death” is not about Bitcoin’s demise but about the outdated fiat system struggling to contain spiraling debt loads and political brinkmanship. He argues that the short-term chaos in traditional markets—triggered by DOGE-driven spending cuts and a hesitant Fed—will ultimately pave the way for a new round of monetary expansion. The bottom line? Hayes insists that staying focused on liquidity is the best strategy: “Let politicians do politician things, stay in your lane, and buy Bitcoin.” At press time, BTC traded at $83,725.

Title: Nvidia, Tesla, Target, Chipotle, and Super Micro Computer: Stocks to watch today

Time Published: 2025-03-04T13:51:00Z

U.S. stocks fell on Tuesday as President Donald Trump’s newly imposed 25% tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico, and China prompted retaliatory measures from some of the affected countries. China imposed additional duties of up to 15% on certain U.S. products. Ottawa retaliated with 25% tariffs on $30 billion worth of U.S. goods starting Tuesday, rising to cover $125 billion of merchandise in 21 days. Canada’s provinces are taking their own actions, and irate citizens are boycotting U.S. products. As the day ended in New York, the Nasdaq Composite dipped by 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 670 points or 1.5%. The S&P 500, which had its worst day of the year on Monday, dropped 1.2%. Here are stocks to watch on Tuesday. Best Buy (BBY) stock dropped after the electronics retailer reported fourth-quarter results that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations. However, CEO Corie Barry indicated that prices for U.S. consumers are likely to increase due to President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) shares declined due to concerns about the restaurant chain’s dependence on avocados, with 50% of its supply coming from Mexico. As tariffs on imports from Mexico take effect, investors are worried about the potential impact on the company. The company has said its diverse supply chain could help it withstand tariffs. Nvidia (NVDA) stock fell as concerns mounted over AI-related spending and the impact of new tariffs. The chip manufacturer seems to be cautious about limitations on the export of AI chips. Nvidia stock plunged Monday after Singapore said it’s investigating whether servers shipped to Malaysia containing chips barred from China ended up in the mainland. Super Micro Computer (SMCI), a key player in AI hardware, also declined in the morning, mirroring Nvidia’s slump. Investors are uncertain about how Trump’s tariffs could shape the future of the AI industry. However, the stock recovered in the afternoon by gaining 10%. Shares of Target (TGT) were down as it beat Wall Street’s earnings expectations. For the fourth quarter, the company reported revenue of $30.92 billion, about $2.41 earnings per share. But Target said it expects a “meaningful” decline in first-quarter profits compared to the same period last year. The cautious outlook stems from “ongoing consumer uncertainty,” weaker sales in February, and mounting concerns over the impact of tariffs. President Donald Trump’s new tariffs on imported goods from Canada, Mexico, and China — which together accounted for almost 42% of total imports in 2024 — went into effect early Tuesday. Tesla (TSLA) stock declined due to rising fears about tariffs among investors. It is likely that the new tariff will raise car prices. Moreover, a day after Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas designated Tesla stock as a “Top Pick” in the U.S. automotive sector and raised the price target, Bank of America reduced its price target for the stock from $490 to $380 while maintaining a Neutral rating.

Title: Ray-Ban and Meta just teased new limited-edition smart glasses – but they'll be in frustratingly short supply

Ray-Ban and Meta have another 3,600 pairs of clear specs on the way When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Meta has announced that new “limited-edition Ray-Ban Meta glasses” are set to land this month, with promo images suggesting they’ll be transparent just like the previous limited-edition design it launched – but expect them to be even harder to get your hands on. Beyond a look at the Ray-Ban logo on a clear-ish frame that shows off the hardware inside the smart specs, we know relatively little about the design. The previous clear frames used the Wayfarer frame type, but this new run could get the Skyler or Headliner design, which have more rounded lenses, although our money is on a bold new design like the frames A$AP Rocky – Ray-Ban’s new Creative Director – just unveiled at Milan Fashion Week – which would tally with the “straight from the runway” comment in Meta’s promotional material for the new limited-edition specs. We also don’t know if these specs will come with the same limited-edition black case as the previous edition, instead of the standard brown, though we hope they do. Adding to the list of unknown is that Meta has yet to reveal a price. Given that the previous limited model cost $429 – which is about $100 more than the standard translucent frames – we expect this new design will also be pricier than standard Ray-Ban smart glasses, and perhaps even pricier than the previous limited design. We say that because while Meta’s last limited run consisted of 7,500 pairs, this time it’s only making 3,600 – at least, that’s what '0001/3600' printed on the frames in the promo image on its website is suggesting. Given the even more limited supply, Meta may choose to bump the price up, so if you’re keen to pick up a pair for yourself you’ll want to act fast when they drop. There's no precise release date to mark on your calendars, though there is a 'Notify me' button on the website if you want to get an update when the glasses go live –just be prepared to go home empty handed. Scalpers are showing that they’re still in full force in 2025 by ruining limited drops for tech, and there’s a good chance they’ll strike again here. There may also be scammers around looking to take advantage of the hype if stock does run dry – so be careful buying glasses claiming to be the limited edition Ray-Bans from unofficial stores and resellers.

Title: USA Imposes New Tariffs On Canada, Mexico & China, Including On Comics
URL: https://bleedingcool.com/comics/usa-imposes-new-tariffs-on-canada-mexico-china-including-on-comics/
Time Published: 2025-03-04T11:24:09Z

Posted in: Comics, Comics Publishers, Current News, DC Comics, Fantagraphics, Marvel Comics, Vault | Tagged: canada, tariffs The USA imposes new tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, and yes, that includes the printing, distribution and selling of comic books. Since American President Donald Trump paused the threatened taxes and tariffs against American importers of Canadian and Mexican goods earlier in the year, and importers from China got away with just a 10% tariff, the fact that this was a delay rather than a cessation was an inconvenient truth that many tried to dismiss. Tariffs weren't mentioned much at the recent ComicsPRO retailer summit. Surely a deal could be done in time? But today, it is no longer impossible to ignore the fact that the USA imposed 25% tariffs across the board against Canada and Mexico and increased the China tariff to 20%. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau issued a retaliatory statement saying that "Canada will not let this unjustified decision go unanswered. Should American tariffs come into effect tonight, Canada will, effective 12:01 a.m. EST tomorrow, respond with 25 per cent tariffs against $155 billion of American goods – starting with tariffs on $30 billion worth of goods immediately and tariffs on the remaining $125 billion on American products in 21 days' time. Our tariffs will remain in place until the U.S. trade action is withdrawn, and should U.S. tariffs not cease, we are in active and ongoing discussions with provinces and territories to pursue several non-tariff measures. While we urge the U.S. administration to reconsider their tariffs, Canada remains firm in standing up for our economy, our jobs, our workers, and for a fair deal. Because of the tariffs imposed by the U.S., Americans will pay more for groceries, gas, cars, and potentially lose thousands of jobs. Tariffs will disrupt an incredibly successful trading relationship. They will violate the very trade agreement that was negotiated by President Trump in his last term." China has imposed a 15 per cent tariff on imported chicken, wheat, corn, and cotton, while a 10 per cent tariff will be imposed on sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, aquatic products, fruits, vegetables, and dairy products. According to the US Department of Agriculture, China accounted for 17 percent of American agricultural exports in 2023. Beijing also placed 25 American firms under export and investment restrictions on national security grounds. Most comic books read in America are printed in Canada, close to the paper mill logging forests, and most large collections are printed in China. In January, Gina Gagliano at the Comics Journal cited many publishers on the issues they are facing regarding taxes and tariffs at the border. Eric Reynolds, VP and Associate Publisher at Fantagraphics, said, "Even if we could find printers domestically who could do a lot of the higher-end, hardcover visual art books that we do, they would cost roughly twice as much or more as the same book would cost to print overseas, our options in terms of paper and printing/binding would be limited, and the quality would likely suffer as well… I read somewhere that there hasn't been a new paper mill built in the U.S. in something like 35 years and that the number of existing paper mills is a small fraction of U.S. printing's 20th-century heyday." Avi Ehrlich, the publisher of Silver Sprocket, said, "The decision to print overseas isn't just about cost (though they are cheaper), but really about quality and options. We haven't been able to find domestic printers able to offer the quality and options available from printers overseas, such as the high quality interesting paper stocks, binding options, and unique foils that make our books stand out. We used to print primarily in Canada and finally moved most of our printing overseas after a series of very frustrating quality issues and delays due to North American printers simply not having all of the resources available under one roof to efficiently and correctly make books with the quality we want to be producing." Josh O'Neill, publisher of Beehive Books, said, "I just know for our odd business, there's no manufacturing capacity to do books like these in America, and that capacity could not be easily rebuilt. It's less about labor costs than the machines and expertise just not existing to do high end book publishing. Printing overseas is often quicker than domestically, even with the long shipping times, because printing domestically often means one printer handling the covers, another handling a special cover effect, and a third printing the text block (inside pages), which introduces so many extra opportunities for mistakes and delays as the project is moved between different printers." Leyla Aker, Director of Publishing at Square Enix Manga and Books, said, "Aside from tariffs on finished books printed in other countries, the other area of concern would be tariffs on paper, which would have the potential to affect titles printed in the U.S. as well." And Damien Wassel, Publisher of Vault Comics, said "While this environment may benefit American printers, it will harm smaller American publishers disproportionately in relation to larger publishers. Print costs are extremely scale sensitive. Publishers who are producing work with larger print runs will still be able to find margin without making significant changes to their publishing operations or strategies. Smaller publishers simply will not have that luxury." When the plans were initially announced, Bleeding Cool looked at the likely impact on monthly superhero comics, and those issues haven't gone away. They are expected to have a greater impact on DC Comics than Marvel, as DC is more likely to print in Canada, though both have long-term printing contracts. We also looked at how Bad Idea Comics' recent Hank Howard Pizza Detective campaign could result in a two hundred thousand loss for the publisher due to the tariffs. Alien Books' Matias Timarchi told us that the tariffs were likely going to lead to an increase in the price of single-issue comic books by at least a dollar. and that this could be the end of the $4.99 comic book and that they had changed everything about their plans to relaunch the Valiant Universe. However, Bleeding Cool also got the scoop that Transcontinental Inc., the biggest comic book printer in North America, based across Canada, has made the move to cover the cost of tariffs on the comics they print for ninety days after the tariffs have been imposed. That effectively puts a three-month delay on the impact these taxes and tariffs are going to have on comic book publishers such as DC Comics, Marvel, Image and many much smaller companies while taking a massive whack in the process. It is not an exaggeration to say that Transcontinental may have just saved a number of comic publishers and comic book stores from going bust with one move. Now, obviously, not even a printer as big as Transcontinental Inc. can indefinitely subsidise the American comic book market. But three months may be enough to keep the plates spinning until a more permanent solution can be found—or at least a less temporary one. The US stock market fell significantly after – even during – the announcement. But not everyone sees the impact of tariffs so badly. Comic book retailer Regan Clem of Summit Comics & Games in Michigan has a different take from wider picture, citing stories from Reuters saying "Honda to produce next Civic in Indiana, not Mexico, due to US tariffs" and from the AP "Apple announces $500 billion investment in US amid tariff threats", stating "I don't think these stories are getting any attention. Bringing jobs to American workers is caring about the working class" and adding "I'm old enough to remember when Democrats were for tariffs and protecting American jobs." However, Eric Reynolds of Fantagraphics states, "I wish there was an infrastructure here that tariffs would kickstart, but there just isn't. It's not like there are paper mills and printing presses just waiting to have the lights turned back on. Even if the tariffs spurred a long-term investment in paper and printing, with new mills and presses being built, it would take years, and a lot of publishers may well go out of business before that bears fruit. It could be quite disastrous." Enjoyed this? Please share on social media!

SatCo aims to deliver seamless satellite-based mobile broadband services to mobile network operators (MNOs) across Europe, ensuring full geographic coverage. The new entity will exclusively distribute AST SpaceMobile's satellite capabilities through a comprehensive service offering that includes network management and operations, all managed from a European-based center leveraging Vodafone's engineering expertise. As part of its operations, SatCo will establish a network of ground stations to provide backhaul connectivity between MNOs and AST SpaceMobile's low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite network. This initiative is expected to bolster European digital sovereignty, as AST SpaceMobile's satellites function as remote radio heads while core network control remains with each respective MNO. Under Vodafone's co-ownership, SatCo will further enhance this sovereignty with its own backhaul capabilities and European-based leadership. "Vodafone's space-based mobile broadband will mean our customers can stay connected, wherever they are. Our new satellite company will be able to offer this pioneering technology to other European mobile operators through a turnkey service that combines Vodafone's leading network and engineering with AST SpaceMobile's 'antennas in the sky,'" said Margherita Della Valle, Vodafone Group CEO. Abel Avellan, Founder, Chairman, and CEO of AST SpaceMobile, added, "Together with Vodafone, we are poised to accelerate our commercialization plans across all of Europe, making true mobile broadband from space a reality." On January 27, 2025, Vodafone successfully conducted the world's first space-based mobile video call using its newly launched BlueBird satellites, demonstrating its commitment to providing uninterrupted mobile coverage for its 340 million customers across 15 countries, as well as its network partners operating in 45 additional markets. Vodafone plans to launch commercial space-based mobile broadband services across Europe in 2025 and 2026. AST SpaceMobile's unique satellite technology will enable direct mobile broadband connectivity to standard 4G and 5G smartphones without requiring software updates or specialized devices, seamlessly integrating with Vodafone's terrestrial networks. Satellite connectivity will serve as a crucial supplement to existing mobile and fixed infrastructure, ensuring continuous coverage in remote locations such as mountainous regions and offshore areas while also enhancing network resilience across Europe. In addition, Vodafone, AST SpaceMobile, and the University of Malaga have collaborated to establish a new space and terrestrial mobile broadband research and validation hub. Supported by the Spanish Space Agency, the facility will be based at Vodafone's Innovation Centre in Malaga and is set to commence operations by summer 2025. This hub will focus on developing integrated LEO satellite and terrestrial broadband solutions. Further expanding its European footprint, AST SpaceMobile has also inaugurated a 5,600-square-meter manufacturing and office facility in Barcelona, aimed at boosting production capacity and advancing the testing of its satellite and telecom technologies.

Title: Should You Buy AMZN Stock At $205?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team , Contributor. Web Summit attendees visit the Amazon Pavilion on the second day of the Web Summit in Doha, Qatar, ... [+] on February 24, 2025. (Photo by Noushad Thekkayil/NurPhoto via Getty Images). Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock experienced a decline of over 3% on Monday, March 3, amid a broader Wall Street downturn. This sell-off was triggered by President Donald Trump’s tariff confirmation, which resulted in the Dow Jones falling 1.8% and the S&P 500 dropping 2.1%, marking its worst day of the year to date. Our take on market crash risk right now has more details on tariffs and its impact on the broader market. At its current levels of $205, AMZN stock looks attractive but volatile — making it a tricky pick to buy. We believe there is minimal cause for concern with AMZN stock, which makes it attractive but highly sensitive to adverse events as its current valuation is very high. We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of AMZN stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition.

The Blue Ghost 1 lander's performance was bolstered by Rocket Lab's advanced software, which provides critical functions such as commanding, telemetry processing, autonomous sequencing, attitude determination, guidance, navigation, control, and fault protection. These capabilities ensured mission success across all operational phases, from launch to lunar touchdown. Rocket Lab's Mission Operations Center in Littleton, Colorado, operated as a remote and backup control hub for Firefly's primary operations base in Texas. Throughout the mission, Rocket Lab's spacecraft operations team collaborated closely with Firefly's Blue Ghost operations team in both Colorado and Texas. Their responsibilities included orbit determination, maneuver planning, command generation, and continuous monitoring of the lander's guidance, navigation, and control systems to ensure a smooth journey and landing. In addition to software support, Rocket Lab contributed three high-efficiency solar power assemblies, mounted on the lander's sides and top deck. These systems provided a total of 400 W of power, sustaining operations for the mission's 1,470-hour duration. "Congratulations to the Firefly team for the successful landing of the Blue Ghost 1 mission, a remarkable accomplishment achieved by few," said Kyle Andringa, Rocket Lab's Senior Director Space Systems Software.

(NYSE:TIXT), Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), and ModivCare, Inc. (NASDAQ: MODV). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. TELUS International (Cda) Inc. (NYSE:TIXT) Class Period: February 16, 2023 - August 1, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: March 31, 2025 The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants allegedly failed to disclose to investors: (1) the Company’s AI Data Solutions offerings required the cannibalization of its higher-margin offerings; (2) that Telus International’s declining profitability was tied to the Company’s drive to develop AI capabilities; (3) that Telus International’s shift toward AI put greater pressure on the Company’s margins than previously disclosed; and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. For more information on the TELUS International class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/TIXT Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) Class Period: November 2, 2022 - December 19, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: March 25, 2025 The Complaint alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Novo Nordisk’s projected successful outcome of Novo Nordisk’s phase 3 CagriSema study on obesity, named “REDEFINE-1,” while avoiding discussions centered around dosage tolerability; (2) Novo Nordisk’s repeated optimistic claims that CagriSema would achieve at least 25% weight loss in the REDEFINE-1 study fell short of reality; and (3) the utilization of the “flexible protocol” limited the study’s ability to effectively provide weight loss data on the dosage tested, suggesting either that tolerability was significantly worse than anticipated, resulting in patients titrating down their dosages to avoid complications, or that the patient selection process was rushed, leading to the onboarding of patients that did not desire to even achieve the 25% weight loss Novo Nordisk sought to demonstrate. For more information on the Novo Nordisk class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/NVO Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) Class Period: September 28, 2023 - December 18, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: March 10, 2025 The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants allegedly made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) demand for Micron's products in consumer markets, especially the Company's NAND products, had significantly deteriorated; (ii) accordingly, Defendants had overstated the extent to which demand for Micron's products had recovered, particularly in consumer markets and for its NAND products, and/or had overstated the sustainability of demand for such products, as well as the normalization of inventory for such products; and (iii) as a result, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. For more information on the Micron class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/MU ModivCare, Inc. (NASDAQ: MODV) Class Period: November 3, 2022 - September 15, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: March 31, 2025 The Class Action alleges that, during the Class Period, Defendants made misleading statements and omissions regarding the ability of its contracts to stabilize cash flow. As the alleged truth about ModivCare's business reached the market, the price of ModivCare's stock suffered significant declines, harming investors. For example, on September 16, 2024, before market hours, ModivCare filed a press release on a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission, titled "Modivcare Provides Financial Update." Therein, the Company revised its 2024 Adjusted EBITDA guidance range from $185-$195 million to $170-$180 million, "primarily due to NEMT segment pricing accommodations made to strategically retain and expand key customer relationships." On this news, the Company's stock price fell $1.40 or nearly 10%, from $14.12 per share on September 15, 2024, to close at $12.72 per share on September 16, 2024, on unusually high trading volume.

Title: Liquid Promises, Illiquid Reality: Navigating the New Frontier of ETFs
URL: https://www.mutualfundobserver.com/2025/03/liquid-promises-illiquid-reality-navigating-the-new-frontier-of-etfs/
Time Published: 2025-03-04T00:36:11Z

In the investment world, there’s an old saying: “There’s no such thing as a free lunch.” Yet the latest crop of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offering both daily liquidity and exposure to illiquid assets might seem to promise just that—a financial equivalent of eating decadent cheesecake without gaining an ounce. Alternately: we keep waiting for The Wizard to save us. The investment industry has traditionally maintained strict guardrails between liquid public markets and illiquid private investments. This separation wasn’t arbitrary—it reflected a fundamental reality that illiquid investments, by their very nature, cannot be quickly converted to cash without significant price concessions. Regulations limiting illiquid investments in publicly traded funds weren’t designed to deprive “regular” investors of opportunities, but rather to protect them from risks they might not fully comprehend or be equipped to handle. We’ve been here before. History provides sobering lessons. In some cases, arrogance, overconfidence, and groupthink led to stunning levels of concentration in portfolios. The Fairholme Fund today has 74% of its portfolio in a single company, St. Joe. Bruce Berkowitz was Morningstar manager of the decade for 2000-10 but they dropped coverage of the fund in 2021, giving it a score of 100+ on their risk gauge, and note that its category rank has been either in the top 1% or bottom 1% of its peer group for seven of the past eight years. The Sequoia Fund not only sunk 36% of its portfolio in a single sketchy stock, Valeant Pharmaceuticals, but its public statements began parroting the Valeant CEO’s. We reported “the dark version of the Sequoia narrative” in 2016: Goldfarb, abetted by an analyst, became obsessed about Valeant and crushed any internal dissent. Mr. Poppe, nominally Mr. Goldfarb’s peer, wouldn’t or couldn’t stop the disaster. “All the directors had repeatedly expressed concern” over the size of the Valeant stake and the decision to double down on it. Mr. Poppe dismissed their concerns: “recent events frustrated them.” The subsequent resignations by 40% of the board, with another apparently threatening to go, were inconsequential annoyances. Sequoia, rather snippily, noted that board members don’t control the portfolio, the managers do. Foot firmly on the gas, they turned the bus toward the cliff. More recently our colleague Devesh Shah reported that Texas Public Land Corporation comprised 47% of the total holdings of Horizon Kinetics, advisor to the various Kinetics Funds. (Morningstar subsequently picked up on the story albeit without acknowledging Devesh’s work.) As of 3/1/25, Kinetics Paradigm has 66% of its portfolio in TPL and its sibling Kinetics Small Cap Opportunities sits at 53%. Both have perfectly splendid total returns coupled with Morningstar risk scores of 100+. Freakishly Morningstar has endorsed both, awarding them a Bronze analyst rating. The most spectacular blow-ups have resulted from the confidence that star managers can magically turn illiquid investments into liquid ones. Consider Firsthand Technology Value Fund (SVVC), which offered public investors access to pre-IPO tech companies. What seemed revolutionary quickly turned problematic as the fund frequently traded at substantial discounts to its net asset value (NAV)—sometimes exceeding 30%. Why? Because investors couldn’t be certain of the true value of its holdings, creating a persistent trust deficit. The fund posted annualized losses of 75% over the past three years and 60% over the past five. It now trades at $0.06/share and can’t even manage to liquidate. If you’re interested in the cautionary tale of the giant that tumbled, read “The Rise and Fall of Firsthand Technology Value Fund” (March 2025). More dramatically, the Third Avenue Focused Credit Fund‘s collapse in 2015 demonstrates how quickly illiquidity can transform from theoretical to catastrophic. In 2016, we described it this way: …offered the impossible: it would invest in illiquid securities but provide investors with daily liquidity. That worked fine as long as the market was rising and no one actually wanted their money back, but when the tide began to go out and investors wanted their money, the poop hit the propeller. When redemptions accelerated, the fund couldn’t sell its junk bonds fast enough and ultimately had to bar investors from withdrawing their money—the ultimate liquidity failure. The fund froze redemptions and placed the fund in a locked trust. Investors exploded, and lawsuits followed, as did a $14.25 million payment from two Third Avenue executives. It took investors three years to receive, drip by drop, 84% of their investment back. Third Avenue was gutted. Despite these cautionary tales, a new generation of funds is testing the boundaries: Franklin Global Allocation Fund has ventured into business development companies, a relatively modest step into less-liquid territory. Effective on February 5, 2025, the fund gained the option of investing in business development companies, “BDCs are a less common type of closed-end fund [which] typically invest in small, developing, financially troubled, private companies or other companies that may have value that can be realized over time, often with managerial assistance.” At around the same time, its management team turned over, leading Morningstar to place its status as “under review.” The fund has seen continuous outflows essentially every single month for a decade with annual returns in the 5-7% range. Adding the ability to goose returns with a new asset class makes business sense; adding illiquid assets and a new team is grounds for caution. SPDR SSGA Apollo IG Public & Private Credit ETF pushes further by investing in private credit markets. Described as “ground-breaking” by Morningstar, the ETF will give investors exposure to illiquid private credit in a liquid vehicle. Up to 35% of the portfolio can be illiquid debt. The plan is for the fund to buy private credit from Apollo with the promise the Apollo will also promise to help them cover their … uhh, exposure. Morningstar’s Brian Moriarty explains: The ETF plans to overcome those concerns through a contractual agreement with Apollo, which will supply private-credit assets for the fund to buy and provide it with bids, or prices, on those same assets. Apollo has further agreed to purchase those investments from the fund up to an undefined daily limit. In other words, Apollo is selling these instruments to the fund and promising to buy them back at the request of State Street. (“A Groundbreaking New ETF Arrives,” Morningstar.com, 2/27/25). Pretty much no one but the adviser is sanguine about these promises. Mr. Moriarty frets “If redemptions are greater than Apollo’s daily limit and the ETF has few public securities, there are many more questions that the filing doesn’t answer… the filing makes it clear that ‘assets that were deemed liquid by the Adviser may become illiquid’ if Apollo is unable to provide a bid or unable to purchase those assets.” One day later the SEC belatedly located its Big Boy Pants and told the adviser to file an amended plan. In a letter to the firms, the Securities and Exchange Commission noted that the fund had “significant remaining outstanding issues” around its liquidity, name, and ability to comply with valuation rules. That’s in part because the SEC accepted a filing with key information blacked-out, or redacted. “We have concerns,” associate director Brent Fields announced. (Tania Mitra, “After launch, SEC raises concerns about State Street and Apollo’s private credit ETF,” Citywire, 2/28/25). ERShares Private-Public Crossover (XOVR) makes perhaps the boldest move by including private equity investments like SpaceX and it’s drawn the attention of two really smart, very different people, Jason Zweig and Jeff Ptak. Both start with the same observation: XOVR’s claim to fame is that it owns a chunk of Elon Musk’s company, SpaceX and it markets that fact relentlessly. The biggest question, though, is “How big a chunk do they own?” The honest answer to which is “sheet, I dunno” because SpaceX is privately traded and its price is anybody’s (and sometimes everybody’s) guess. The Wall Street Journal’s Jason Zweig launched on the fund in January, doing what Mr. Z. does best: he gets to the point quickly, clearly, and with great style. He reports on the possible current worth of one share of SpaceX: private firms variously put it at $115, $182, $185, $207, or $209. Which is accurate? As Mr. Z. puts it “who knows?” Equally troubling is what happens if the bubble starts to deflate: “in a market crash, XOVR would have to sell its most liquid holdings, such as Alphabet, Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Oracle, to meet redemptions if investors panicked. That might leave remaining shareholders owning little but SpaceX—which isn’t readily tradable.” The fund advisor fumbled about every query placed to it, leaving The Z to conclude, “If the investment industry wants to sell private assets to the public, it had better do better than this—a lot better.” (You Can Own Elon Musk’s SpaceX. But at What Price? WSJ.com, 1/24/25) Similarly, Morningstar’s Jeff Ptak did what he does best in his analysis of the fund, “How to Manage an ETF … Right Into a Corner” (2/25/25). The short version: Mr. P. analyzes more data, more carefully, and more extensively, than the firm’s own auditors might have. He notes that “Capital Impact Advisors, added private equity to its mandate last year and has heavily promoted it as ‘the first crossover ETF’ to invest in private equity in the months since.” The marketing worked (“Around 80% of the new money that’s flowed into the ETF since November has arrived after Dec. 10, 2024, when Capital Impact Advisors marked the SpaceX position up from $135 to $185 per share. It’s remained at that valuation ever since.”) The problem, he notes, is that this money could head for the exits just as quickly as it rushed in. In hopes of preventing that, the managers might double down on illiquid positions or might face a huge burden in liquidating a partially illiquid portfolio. It’s a good piece of analysis, and quite detailed. Each represents a different position on the liquidity-illiquidity spectrum, with potentially different risk profiles. As Mr. Moriarty modestly observes, “This is a groundbreaking proposal that could open the door for a multitude of copycat vehicles… It’s a wide new ETF world out there.” The core issue isn’t just illiquidity itself but the misalignment between asset liquidity and fund structure. When a fund promises daily redemptions while holding assets that might take weeks, months, or years to sell at reasonable prices, it creates a structural vulnerability. This disconnect is like promising instant sobriety after a night of drinking—it violates fundamental realities. During market stress, this mismatch becomes particularly dangerous as funds may be forced to sell their most liquid holdings first, leaving remaining investors with an increasingly illiquid portfolio. These new ETFs aren’t offering the impossible—they’re offering a trade-off. The appropriate metaphor isn’t “alcohol without hangovers” but rather “alcohol with a hangover cure that might work.” The cure isn’t guaranteed, especially if too many people need it at once. Smart investors understand that innovative financial products don’t eliminate fundamental trade-offs—they merely repackage them in ways that might obscure the underlying risks. The promise of private market returns with public market liquidity should be approached not with excitement but with heightened scrutiny.
