Title: Tech job seekers face hard times as industry resets

The big picture: For decades, having a job in tech meant stability, regular raises, and lucrative perks. However, that has changed, perhaps permanently. The tech labor market is currently in upheaval, with firms letting go of employees by the thousands and tightening hiring requirements when they are looking to fill positions. The only safe space appears to be in AI. Since the start of the year, more than 137,500 employees have been laid off from 438 tech companies, according to Layoffs.fyi. Meanwhile, postings for software development jobs have declined by over 30 percent since February 2020, according to Indeed.com. Companies across the industry spectrum are cutting tech positions, including some of the largest names in the game. Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft have all downsized this year, along with eBay, Unity Software, SAP, Intel, PayPal, and Cisco. Furthermore, employees who still have jobs are experiencing stagnant wage growth, according to Pequity, a compensation-planning startup. Wages have increased by an average of just 0.95 percent in 2024 compared to last year. This is not new information for those in the industry seeking employment. Last year, over 260,000 workers across nearly 1,200 tech companies lost their jobs, making 2023 the second-largest year of layoffs on record in the technology sector, behind only the dot-com crash in 2001, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas. "The market isn't what it once was," Roger Lee, creator of Layoffs.fyi, told CNBC. "To secure a new position, many salespeople and recruiters are leaving tech entirely. Even engineers are compromising – accepting roles with less stability, a tougher work environment, or lower pay and benefits." The trend doesn't appear to be part of the typical cyclical fluctuations that characterize tech employment, either. The Wall Street Journal recently referred to it as a fundamental reset in an industry that is readjusting its labor needs. Instead of focusing on growth at all costs, companies are now zeroing in on revenue-generating products and services in their hiring strategies. This shift means that sectors that weren't very profitable, such as virtual reality and devices, are facing significant cuts. Tech firms are also scaling back on entry-level hires and eliminating recruiting teams. Companies that are hiring are now looking for engineers with a broader skill set, including collaboration abilities and a working knowledge of the company's AI strategy. Ryan Sutton, executive director of the technology practice group at staffing firm Robert Half, told The Wall Street Journal, "They want to see people who are more versatile." AI is one of the few areas experiencing growth, perhaps not surprisingly. Individuals who have worked on large language models can easily find jobs with salaries reaching $1 million a year. AI engineers are being offered two to four times the salary of a regular engineer, according to Pequity CEO Kaitlyn Knopp. "That's an extreme investment of an unknown technology," she said. "They cannot afford to invest in other talent because of that." Tech workers may understandably feel a sense of whiplash from these changes. During the pandemic, firms went on a hiring spree as much of everyday life moved online. Employees were offered generous salaries and significant flexibility as companies competed for talent. Then the economy cooled amid higher interest rates and inflation, leading to large-scale layoffs as companies jettisoned tens of thousands of jobs. However, the current hiring trends are not as closely correlated to the economy as one might think. Nela Richardson, head of ADP Research, told The Wall Street Journal that the past few years represent the natural trajectory of an industry grounded in innovation. "You're not breaking as much new ground in terms of the digital space as in earlier time periods," she said. TECHSPOT : Tech Enthusiasts, Power Users, Gamers TechSpot is a registered trademark.

Title: Amazon’s RTO mandate likely to boomerang, other companies ‘should not follow suit’

Beginning with the new year, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wants his employees back in the office five days a week, returning to an office routine that was common before the COVID-19 pandemic upended the workplace. The backlash from employees was nearly instantaneous, as they berated Jassy — and the return-to-work policy — and vowed to quit. Others demanded raises in exchange for in-office work requirements. Industry analysts were not surprised by the reaction, and said back-to-office mandates more often than not have the exact opposite effect as intended. According to the employee memo released this week, Jassy believes being back in the office will help boost employee training, bolster collaboration, and strengthen culture. “If anything, the last 15 months we’ve been back in the office at least three days a week has strengthened our conviction about the benefits,” Jassy wrote. “We understand that some of our teammates may have set up their personal lives in such a way that returning to the office consistently five days per week will require some adjustments. To help ensure a smooth transition, we’re going to make this new expectation active on January 2, 2025.” In fact, a study performed in May indicated mandatory return-to-office (RTO) policies could lead to higher quit rates compared with companies that allow remote or hybrid work. The study by the University of Michigan and University of Chicago found that three large US tech companies — Microsoft, Apple and SpaceX — saw substantially increased attrition, particularly among more senior personnel, when they implemented strict return-to-work policies in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Forcing employees to quit, however, might be exactly what Amazon wants, according to J. P. Gownder, a vice president analyst with Forrester Research. “There is a chance that Amazon is hoping to induce a level of voluntary attrition with this move in lieu of layoffs. Unfortunately, the best talent often has choices, and most don’t want to work in an office five days a week,” Gownder said. In his memo, Jassy also outlined a plan to reduce managers, saying that “will remove layers and flatten organizations more than they are today. If we do this work well, it will increase our teammates’ ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership,” he wrote. Amazon’s mandate puts the company in the minority, according to recent research. Among employees with jobs that can be done remotely, 43% work hybrid, 22% work fully remote, and 35% work in the office full time. “Amazon’s decision may just compromise its promise to be ‘Earth’s best employer,’” said Gownder. “The macro data shows that pre-pandemic nostalgia is not a post-pandemic reality. Other companies should not follow suit.” Abandoning hybrid work policies will negatively affect employee experience — particularly recruiting, retention, and diversity — impacting productivity and, potentially, the bottom line, according to Gownder. A Gartner Research study released this month showed 47% of HR leaders are concerned about employee resentment toward their organization. They see change fatigue (70%), return to office mandates (62%), and lack of career growth opportunities (58%) as the biggest drivers of employee unhappiness. Two other Gartner studies this year showed high-performing employees, women and millennials would be the greatest flight risks when strict RTO policies are implemented. (One in three executives handed a RTO mandate would quit, one of those studies showed.) “Mandated on-site requirements can carry very steep costs for talent attraction and retention. This is especially true for high-performers, women and millennials — three employee segments who greatly value flexibility,” said Caitlin Duffy, a director in the Gartner HR practice. “Often, these costs far outweigh the moderate benefits to employee engagement and effort.” Instead of office mandates, flexible hybrid work policies are the gold standard, research has shown. According to a Stanford University study, only 17.6% of employees who can work from home say they want to work in an office five days a week. A June study by McKinsey & Co. showed organizations where employees work in multiple locations (at home, in the office, or at client sites) are more likely to see 10% or greater revenue growth than companies where employees work from a single location. Another McKinsey study revealed that employees consistently point to greater productivity and reduced burnout as primary benefits of flexible work policies. Flexibility is especially important to women, who report having more focused time to work when working remotely, the study showed. William Hatcher, a professor of public administration and chair of social sciences at Augusta University in Georgia, said research is clear that “individuals are more productive at their jobs when they have more control over their schedules.” “Workplaces that empower employees with flexible scheduling policies and te...

Title: Amazon's return-to-office order bucks job flexibility trend

Getty Images/iStockphoto Amazon CEO Andy Jassy's recent return-to-office order might be more about staff reductions than improving watercooler brainstorming. His letter to employees talks about flattening the organization and having fewer managers. But that language raises suspicion among recruiting experts that the company wants to reduce headcount through attrition. If Amazon wants to reduce headcount, "this is an easy way to do it," said Julia Pollak, chief economist at online job marketplace ZipRecruiter, of the return-to-office mandate. It might cause natural attrition from workers unhappy with the order and help the company avoid mass layoffs, she said. "At the same time, you can always retain your superstar performers by negotiating exceptions for them on a one-on-one basis," Pollak said. But she also said it's possible Amazon had trouble running an effective remote work program. Despite Amazon's return-to-work order, flexible work arrangements have remained constant, according to ZipRecruiter's quarterly analysis of labor market changes. The current share of remote and hybrid job postings in the tech industry is above 20%, similar to 2021 data, Pollak said. "We don't see much pullback," she said. Kate Lister, president of Global Workplace Analytics, a telecommuting research and consulting firm, said she sees return-to-office mandates as being connected to staff reduction goals. "There's no doubt that AI will replace many of the types of jobs people do at places like Amazon," Lister said. "Even prior to the pandemic, hybrid work reversals were often a thinly disguised attempt to get people to quit, rather than having to lay them off." For employers, remote and hybrid work options will produce three times as many job applications compared with non-remote positions, Pollak said. When companies offer these options, attrition falls around 35%, she said. "Workers who work remotely are prepared to take an 8% pay cut because they value it so much," she said. There is little in job ad data that suggests Amazon's return-to-office order is a future of work trend. While there has been some pullback on fully remote jobs, at least in job listings, hybrid job ads are on the rise. Employer preference is shifting to hybrid work, according to data from WilsonHCG, a recruitment processing outsourcing provider. It has found that remote job postings account for 3.4% of all job postings in the U.S., or about 220,000 jobs, a decline ranging from 5% to 6% a year ago. But there has been a shift to hybrid ads, which is nearing 2% of all job postings, nearly double that from 18 to 24 months ago, according to the firm. What employers want is the ability to have workers on-site when needed, said Charles Faigle, executive vice president of talent solutions in the Americas at WilsonHCG. "It's all about flexibility within their workforce," he said. The workforce is also shifting in other ways. TalentNeuron, a labor market intelligence firm, said it is seeing a rise in the 40-hour, four-day workweek, according to an analysis of job postings. The job areas with the highest rise for this trend are medical and health, engineering, quality assurance, IT, administrative and clerical, and operations and logistics. "Many employees cite the four-day workweek as a primary incentive -- even over salary -- for the considerations around a role," said Erica Lee, a senior consultant at TalentNeuron. The firm identified, for instance, 103,000 job postings in the medical and health care field that explicitly mentioned a four-day workweek. These job ads represented less than 5% of the total current job ads, but the overall trend of the four-day workweek has increased more than 50% over the last several years. Dan Schwabel, managing partner at Workplace Intelligence, a research firm, said he sees a trend to tech employees losing remote work options, although it varies by companies. "Some tech companies continue to offer flexible or fully remote options to attract and retain talent," Schawbel said. "Smaller startups and certain tech roles may still provide more flexibility."

Amazon's prestige push, China's slowdown and the rise of TikTok are all factors at play. Senior Editor, Beauty As the beauty landscape shape shifts around the world — Amazon ascendant, China decelerating, TikTok dominating and new consumers emerging — the beauty jobs market is evolving accordingly. Companies both established and emerging are reconfiguring their workforces to better meet the demands of these fast-changing times, whether reshaping certain departments, opting for more agility with a fractional model or restructuring. “The bottom line is simplify to amplify,” said Oliver Chen, an analyst at TD Cowen. “Part of that is managing for speed and agility.” Related Articles Beauty Features Literary Manicures? Meditative Manicures? Kure Bazaar Will Host Them in Its Paris 'Home' Beauty The 40 Best TikTok Beauty Products, Tested by Editors For many larger players, this changing landscape involves some component of restructuring, with layoffs in certain areas of the business even as others are enhanced. “The intention is to maximize profitability, given the China slowdown, and also even just a touch of overall slowdown in this market as well,” said Cassie Cowman, a cofounder of View From 32, a beauty consultancy that works with both founders and investors. “Companies are figuring out how to structure these teams to maximize that,” she added. “I have some clients that are still seeing decent traffic, for example, but the conversion is very low or maybe the dot-com channel is suffering. So, how are they investing more in the brick-and-mortar business to maximize that channel while it’s seeing strong momentum?” Unilever has unveiled a “comprehensive productivity program,” involving 7,500 office-based layoffs globally to achieve total cost savings of around 800 million euros over the next three years. British media outlets have reported that, as part of the layoff plan, it is set to cut a third of all office roles in Europe by the end of 2025, or around 3,200 roles. In February, The Estée Lauder Cos. revealed a restructuring plan, including layoffs, as it continues to tread water amid struggles in Asia and at home. It’s part of the wider Profit Recovery and Growth Plan, designed to make the company more agile. The owner of Clinique, Mac, Tom Ford and others will reduce its 62,000-strong global workforce by between 3 and 5 percent as part of the plan, the equivalent of as many as 3,100 jobs. This will be carried out over the next two-and-a-half years. That same month, Shiseido introduced a new business plan within which it is offering an early retirement plan to approximately 1,500 employees in Japan to help bolster group growth and profitability. The move is part of an overarching vision. “To achieve sustainable growth, Shiseido Japan will concentrate its activities on brands, products and touchpoints with high growth potential and profitability, strengthening brand and touchpoint strategy,” the company said. Dyson is also cutting around 1,000 jobs in the U.K., roughly one-third of its U.K. workforce, due to what the company has described as “fierce” global competition. At L’Oréal U.S., WWD understands that there has been some restructuring in the consumer products division, resulting in around 40 job losses. These are omni shopper roles, the link between the marketing and sales teams. Sales leads for brands are also being moved to retail leads. In a WARN notice filed in New York last month, No7 Beauty company said that 64 workers at its Manhattan office would be affected by an office closure. “To enhance our ability to invest in the growth of No7 Beauty Company in the U.S., we are restructuring our organization to work more closely within our own retail partners,” said a spokesman. “Moving forward, we will no longer occupy a small number of desks in a shared office space in New York, and most of our team members are being relocated.” Its parent company Walgreens Boots Alliance has made several rounds of layoffs. Most recently, LVMH-owed Sephora announced plans to cut its workforce in China by 3 percent, the equivalent to around 120 roles, “in response to the challenging market environment” there. As for what roles companies are hiring, Lisa Mare Ringus, executive vice president of global client strategy and growth at 24 Seven Inc, noted that there has been interest in specific sales roles such as supporting Amazon, social and content, finance and marketing. “We’ve seen more hiring in finance this year than ever before within beauty,” Ringus said. Others have seen a spike in searches for brand chief merchandising officers, as well as sales chiefs and chief commercial officers, also sometimes called chief revenue officers. And of course, those with knowledge of AI and TikTok are increasingly in demand. “It’s also about the new skill set,” said Chen. “When you hire someone they’re going to be much better at AI and use TikTok regularly. You need new people who can engage new customers.” In addition to the strateg... (truncated)

SAN FRANCISCO, CA - JUNE 26: In this handout photo provided by Intel, Tom Kilroy, vice president of ... [+] Intel?s Digital Enterprise Group, displays Intel's new Dual-Core Xeon Processor 5100 on June 26, 2006 at an event in San Francisco. Available for high-volume servers, workstation and communications markets, the 64-bit processor is based on the Intel Core Microarchitecture for increased performance with reduced energy consumption. (Photo by Court Mast/Intel via Getty Images) Intel stock (NASDAQ: INTC) rallied by close to 6% in Monday’s trading and gained by another 8% in after-hours trading, taking the stock to levels of about $22 per share. Intel stock still remains down by over 50% year-to-date. Now the recent surge comes following news that Intel has secured a manufacturing contract from Amazon for its foundry business, where it will design and produce custom AI chipsets for Amazon’s cloud division, AWS. Intel will produce the specialized “AI fabric chip” for Amazon, using its 18A manufacturing process, which is the company’s most advanced chip manufacturing technology. Intel also indicated that more chip designs from AWS could be coming, including versions that will leverage Intel’s upcoming 18AP and 14A processes. Separately, Bloomberg reported last Friday that Intel has received $3.5 billion in grants from the Pentagon to manufacture chips for the U.S. military, although Intel declined to comment on the Pentagon grants. The new wins present a big opportunity for Intel. If the company executes well on its foundry plans and delivers compelling new CPU and GPU chips, Intel could see almost 3x upside. On the other hand, if it fails to execute, Intel stock could see a downside to $10 Now INTC stock has declined over the last 3-year period and the fall has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 6% in 2021, -47% in 2022, and 95% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could INTC face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a recovery? For years, Intel has faced growing frustration from investors as it lost market share to AMD in the PC and server sectors. Adding to this, the industry has been shifting from CPUs to GPUs, particularly in the generative AI era, where GPUs are better suited for the intensive computational tasks that AI demands. The recent wins with Amazon and the Pentagon could mark a turning point for Intel, as generative artificial intelligence dominates the narrative in the computing and semiconductor markets. The Amazon deal, in particular, is seen as a strong vote of confidence in Intel’s improving chip-making capabilities given AWS’s position as the largest public cloud services provider. Intel’s foundry business which has been at the heart of the company’s struggles, has lagged behind competitors like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Samsung. Intel’s attempts to reclaim leadership in chip fabrication have been very capital-intensive and have been hampered by the company’s manufacturing and design missteps. In fact, Intel has had to outsource production of some of its latest CPUs to TSMC. In 2023, Intel’s foundry business reported a $7 billion operating loss on $18.9 billion in revenue, highlighting the scale of the challenges it has faced. Much of the future of Intel’s manufacturing roadmap hinges on the success of the new 18A process. While production on this process is expected to begin in 2025, Intel announced in early August that it had reached critical milestones, noting that the chips made with this process had powered on, booted Windows, and were operational within Intel. Once Intel transitions its latest server and PC chips to this process node, ending its outsourcing of chips to TSMC, we could see higher utilization rates, which would help reduce costs. Additionally, Intel indicated that the first external foundry customer was expected to tape out (move from design to foundry for manufacturing) on the 18A node in the first half of 2025. This could also boost Intel revenues to a certain extent. A key challenge for Intel will lie in meeting production yield expectations at a large scale. However, there have been encouraging signs here as well. Intel recently indicated that the production process was seeing a defect density of 0.4. Defect density refers to the number of defects present per unit area on a wafer and a metric of under 0.5 defects per square centimeter is considered favorable. Intel s... (truncated)

Title: Former AWS Employee: “Most of the Hot Takes on Amazon’s New Strict Return-to-Office Policy Are Wrong”

Amazon’s recent shift toward a strict return-to-office (RTO) policy has sparked heated debates across the tech industry. For some, the mandate represents a regression, particularly in a sector that largely embraced remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, according to a former AWS employee, John McBride, the driving force behind Amazon’s controversial policy shift is not about collaboration or innovation—it’s about something much simpler: economics and taxes. “Anyone who’s been paying attention saw this coming years ago,” McBride said in a series of posts on social media, pointing to a multi-phased strategy that Amazon has rolled out over time. According to McBride, the company’s approach was carefully designed, with the ultimate goal of reducing headcount while avoiding massive tax liabilities that could significantly affect profitability. Listen to a podcast conversation on the ‘real’ reasons for Amazon’s return to the office: McBride, who left AWS in 2023 during what he referred to as “Phase 3” of Amazon’s plan, outlined the following five phases: McBride explained that while Amazon executives publicly framed these moves as necessary for “innovation” and “customer obsession,” the reality, in his view, is far less inspirational. “It’s all about reducing headcount and avoiding tax liabilities,” he asserted. The most significant factor driving this return-to-office push appears to be the economics of headcount management. During the pandemic, Amazon—along with many other tech giants—dramatically expanded its workforce. “They didn’t really have any other option,” McBride noted, citing the unprecedented demand for AWS cloud services and the need to continue scaling as more companies embraced remote work. I’m a former AWS employee: most of the hot takes on Amazon's new strict return-to-office policy are wrong. Anyone who’s been paying attention saw this coming years ago. And ultimately, it comes down to taxes and economics. Here's their plan: Phase 1: layoff over 30k people.… — John McBride (@johncodezzz) September 18, 2024 However, that growth came with significant costs. As McBride explained, AWS operates on “razor-thin margins,” despite being one of Amazon’s most profitable arms. “AWS offers incredible services at excellent usage cost pricing,” he said, pointing to the platform’s ability to enable small disruptors to enter the cloud market. This model has worked well for AWS, but in times of economic uncertainty, even small disruptions in customer spending can have outsize effects on profit margins. Now, with the broader tech sector scaling back due to rising interest rates and shrinking corporate budgets, AWS’s profitability is being squeezed. “Anyone who leaves AWS or meaningfully reduces their cloud spend can impact AWS’s razor-thin profit margins,” McBride explained. This, he argued, has created intense pressure to cut costs, and for a company like Amazon, “the most expensive cost is headcount.” Yet headcount reduction is only one part of the equation. McBride pointed out that the return-to-office mandate is also deeply rooted in tax considerations. “Amazon gets massive tax breaks from cities and states where they have offices,” he said. These breaks are contingent on Amazon bringing jobs to specific locations, like Seattle or Denver. However, those incentives can disappear if offices remain underutilized. “If Amazon continued to enable a remote workforce,” McBride explained, “the tax man would come knocking, and they’d be liable for hundreds of millions of dollars.” In other words, for Amazon, filling physical offices is not just about fostering collaboration—it’s about protecting its bottom line. This aligns with the broader economic realities facing Amazon. In 2023, the company’s overall operating margin was a mere 4.7%, and while AWS’s margins are higher—recently reported as close to 40%—those numbers still reflect the company’s general approach of operating with very thin margins at scale. McBride pointed out that Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos, famously operated under the mantra “Your margin is my opportunity,” focusing on generating significant profits by operating with minimal margins across large-scale services. But as AWS faces increasing competition and clients seek ways to reduce cloud spending, maintaining profit margins becomes more difficult. “Amazon has to keep profit up by reducing headcount,” McBride summarized. The return-to-office policy is a strategic move to ensure that they maximize tax incentives while minimizing staffing costs. For many employees, however, the return-to-office policy feels more like a veiled attempt to force them out. “Phase 4: the Silent Sacking,” McBride described, is particularly brutal. Employees who resist relocation or fail to comply with the return-to-office directives often find themselves marginalized within the company. “You’d be left out of in-person meetings, stiff-armed by management, and wouldn’t be given meaningful work,” McBride said, add...

Title: It's a tough time to be a manager in tech

Managers may just have the toughest job in tech right now. In the latest blow to middle managers, Amazon announced it planned to reduce the number of supervisors within its organization. CEO Andy Jassy said in a message to employees posted to Amazon News that the company plans to flatten departments and ask senior leadership teams to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of the first quarter of 2025. Jassy said the move was part of an effort to get the company operating "like the world's largest startup," allowing employees to "move fast" and not waste time with "unnecessary processes." A copy of an internal document obtained by Business Insider indicates the new plan could result in role eliminations as "organizations may identify roles that are no longer required." It's the latest hit to tech's wearied middle managers amid a rough few years. Many have found themselves in the firing line of sweeping layoffs as Big Tech companies scramble to cut costs. Those who kept their jobs have complained of being left with more work amid hiring slowdowns. Lynda Gratton, a professor of management practice at London Business School, told BI that middle managers had steadily been asked to do more post-pandemic. "Manager overwork and burnout is a real issue," she said. "The pandemic meant that many are also managing complex hybrid teams." Amazon is not the first tech company to balk at its own corporate structure. At Meta, Mark Zuckerberg has been gradually eliminating layers of middle management. The tech boss said he doesn't like seeing "managers managing managers" and has been "flattening" his company ever since. The reorg has seen many Meta supervisors demoted with the aim of having more people on the ground doing things like coding, designing, or selling. Shopify has also been flattening its structure to have fewer managers. At X, Elon Musk has ordered engineering managers to get back into the coding trenches with their direct reports. The reduction of middle managers is, in part, a reaction to overhiring during the COVID-19 pandemic and a backlash against so-called "fake work" within the tech sector. But significantly reducing the number of managers could also backfire on companies. "Tech firms have worked out that the most productive technologists are well managed, feel secure, are mentored and supported, and feel listened to," Gratton said. "That's one of the reasons why they have invested more in managers — when management is done well — they are the golden thread." When asked to comment, representatives for Amazon referred BI back to Jassy's online statement. Jump to

Title: Amazon's strict new RTO rule creates an awkward situation for One Medical

One Medical may have been the first big exception to Amazon's strict new RTO mandate. One Medical told its employees earlier this month that they must come into the office three times a week starting in October 2025, according to people familiar with the matter. The company gave employees over a year before the in-office mandate kicks in so that they can adjust and relocate if needed, the people said. They asked not to be identified discussing sensitive topics, but their identities are known to Business Insider. Most One Medical employees were asked to be in one of four "hub" cities, Seattle, Austin, San Francisco, or Boston, the people said. Currently, almost 40% of One Medical employees are working outside these locations, one of the people added. While this was a big change for One Medical employees, it was softer approach than Amazon's new return-to-office policy. On Monday, CEO Andy Jassy announced that Amazon's corporate employees must work in an office five days a week starting in January. Many Amazon employees criticized the order in internal messages. Now, it looks like One Medical's new policy is mostly scrapped, after just a couple of weeks. "Starting in October 2025, all Amazon One Medical employees will be asked to come into the office five days a week in line with the rest of Amazon," an Amazon spokesperson told BI. One Medical staff have an extra 10 months to prepare. But otherwise, they must get on board with Jassy's full-time in-office approach. One Medical employees had been allowed to work remotely full time, even after Amazon acquired the company for $3.9 billion early last year. One Medical CEO Trent Green this year even highlighted remote work as a major perk as the company went through layoffs and a major reorganization. Even the brief existence of One Medical's three-day rule was causing uncertainty and frustration at the healthcare unit, some of the people said. Amazon has been more tightly integrating with One Medical lately, rolling out Amazon's own human-resources and benefits policy as well as compensation structure to the division. Amazon is also scrutinizing One Medical's financial performance, ordering drastic cost cuts to control losses. People on Amazon's side have been equally frustrated with One Medical, one of the people said. One Medical has struggled to adapt to Amazon's faster pace of work and rigid culture centered around its leadership principles. One Medical's staff, meanwhile, feels Amazon is disrupting a business that had performed well and grew faster before the acquisition, some of the people said. The messaging from One Medical's leadership earlier this month was that working in the same physical space could be more productive, echoing Jassy's thinking, these people said.

Amazon is putting middle managers under the microscope as it seeks to thin out the layers of the sprawling company. The move furthers the Big Tech trend of flattening org charts that Mark Zuckerberg and others like Elon Musk have talked about in recent years while preaching the need for efficiency. CEO Andy Jassy announced the changes on Monday alongside an RTO mandate that will require Amazon employees to return to the office 5 days a week starting in January. The Amazon CEO wrote that he's also asking senior leadership teams "to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of Q1 2025." "Having fewer managers will remove layers and flatten organizations more than they are today," Jassy wrote in a memo to staff. "If we do this work well, it will increase our teammates' ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership, drive decision-making closer to the front lines where it most impacts customers (and the business), decrease bureaucracy, and strengthen our organizations' ability to make customers' lives better and easier every day," Jassy added. You can bet that somewhere in Silicon Valley, Mark Zuckerberg nodded his head when he heard the news — after all, he's been speaking out in favor of flattening org charts both publicly and in private for a while now. "I don't think you want a management structure that's just managers managing managers, managing managers, managing managers, managing the people who are doing the work," the Meta CEO reportedly said in an internal meeting in January 2023. In an earnings call a month later, Zuckerberg said the company was "working on flattening our org structure and removing some layers of middle management to make decisions faster." Zuckerberg also proclaimed a "year of efficiency" at Meta last year, following two rounds of layoffs that cumulatively cost roughly 21,000 people their jobs. The Meta CEO said in a podcast interview that same year that he believed "a lot" in the need for managers, pointing to how managers help younger people "grow and learn in their career." But he said there was "a mathematical way" to think about the ratio of employees to managers. Before Meta's layoffs, Zuckerberg said he inquired about the average number of direct reports each manager had at Meta and learned it was around three to four. He felt it should be more like seven to eight. But, at the time, the lower numbers made sense as Meta was hiring a ton and helping newcomers ramp up. "So in a world where we're not adding so many people as quickly, is it as valuable to have a lot of managers who have extra capacity waiting for new people? No, right?" Zuckerberg said. "So, now we could sort of defragment the organization and get to a place where the average is closer to that seven or eight," he added. "It just ends up being a somewhat more kind of compact management structure, which, you know, decreases the latency on information going up and down the chain and I think empowers people more." Meta's emphasis on leanness paid off and was rewarded by Wall Street and investors: Meta hit a $1 trillion market cap earlier this year. The broader industry has followed suit in trimming management. Middle-managers made up 31.5% of layoffs in 2023, up from 19.7% in 2018, according to analysis. Shopify announced last year that it would flatten its organization by grouping employees into either individual contributors or managers and incentivizing more of them to become the former. Under pressure from activist investors to become more efficient, Salesforce last year aimed to reduce "layers of control" by giving managers a specific number of direct reports in order to trim management layers, people familiar with the matter previously told Business Insider. At Airbnb, CEO Brian Chesky has said the company "got rid of the classic product management function" and instead changed it into an "Apple-style product marketing function." As for Amazon, the company hasn't yet said publicly if layoffs are part of its strategy to increase the number of individual contributors to managers. But if Amazon is following Meta and other Big Tech companies' lead — don't be surprised if a middle-management culling is on the horizon. Just look at what Amazon's internal document said about potential job cuts, as first reported by Business Insider's Ashley Stewart. "It's possible that organizations may identify roles that are no longer required." Jump to

Title: Why Hiring Is Slowing Down —And How To Get Hired Anyway

I got the job! America is currently experiencing a significant hiring slowdown. A noticeable change has occurred over the last six months, affecting people at all levels and in many industries. As a career counselor, I work with job hunters every day. I pay close attention to what they say and what they are experiencing in the job market. I notice what industries are hiring, which job titles more employers are advertising, and how many openings we see are the right fit for a candidate to apply for. I’ve been observing that many areas now offer fewer opportunities One group I’ve noticed that has had a struggle with landing a job is mature workers. Professionals over 55, especially those who have been hard hit with layoffs, report that there is little to apply for and a lot of competition. Most say their age is a problem hampering them from finding a job. Those over 60 have had a real struggle to find new employment. The technology industry has been hard hit with limited hiring and plenty of layoffs. New college grads face a tough search because entry-level roles have been harder to find. Some grads have been looking for a year, and they are getting very little employer attention, only rejections. Lacking an internship has been a real deficit for many grads, as employers want that experience Much to the disappointment of people insisting they want remote work; the tides have changed. Employers are now in the driver’s seat, insisting on hybrid in-office work. Amazon told employees that they are implementing a “5 days a week Return-to-Office” policy. Aside from the typical summer slowdown, hiring is not picking up now. A notable change in hiring has blanketed the country. Job hunters feel it, employers know it, and career counselors and HR people are acknowledging it. From our view of the world, those of us in the trenches dealing with hiring and job search, we see these key factors interacting together and impacting the job market. 1. The Election. Employers are pausing and waiting to see which way the country will go for the next four years. Democrats will head in a different direction than Republicans. So, many companies want to know the answer before they invest in new employees or promote existing employees. 2. Holidays. From mid-November through early January, hiring will be very slow as employers deal with holiday vacations, reassess their staffing needs, and try to do more with fewer people. 3. AI technology impacts. Most organizations are considering how AI might impact their company and employee productivity and are slowing down to determine their needs. They are questioning how using new AI technology in their office may change who they need to hire and the type of skills that a person needs to have. 4. Layoffs. These will continue. No one is immune. Many different roles have disappeared across the entire work spectrum. 5. Stay-put Employees. Layoffs have scared people into holding onto their positions. They worry about stability and aren’t moving on, which reduces the opportunities for someone else to take over their job. 6. Employers are cherry-picking. They are in no hurry to find—or hire—new staff. Even when a candidate’s background completely matches the job description, some report that they may be interviewing but aren’t getting a job offer. 7. Hybrid work. Nothing has reduced job opportunities as much as this change has. Job seekers must look for positions where they live, and most employers are not paying to relocate them. 8. Fewer recruiters. As the job market changed, recruiters were hard-hit, with heavy layoffs as employers responded to the new job market conditions. This means fewer HR recruiters are scouring LinkedIn looking for talent. People who often got “hit up” on LinkedIn to consider a new job have found that this has happened much less frequently or stopped altogether. Hannah Morgan, one of the country’s top job search strategists also agrees that job seekers are having more difficulty finding employment. Morgan said, “Some of these factors mentioned above are expected to tweak hiring, such as the election or holidays. Normally, they will have an impact. But with all eight things happening simultaneously, that is what has made job search so challenging.” But, in any economy, there are always good jobs to be found and landed.

Title: How CTOs Can Boost Company Health During Economic Downturns

In recent years, there’s been a widespread drive to encourage companies to think of their technology teams and tools not as cost centers, but as revenue drivers. And with technology playing such a large role in today’s businesses, it’s time for leadership teams to think of CTOs as more than just experts in “keeping the lights on.” Companies are accustomed to trusting their CTOs to oversee the creation and acquisition of new technologies when business is humming. But on the flip side, CTOs can also be key players in finding ways to cut costs and/or boost revenues during economic downturns. Below, 20 members of Forbes Technology Council discuss practical, meaningful ways CTOs can positively impact organizational health during difficult times (and why they’re perfectly positioned to do so). CTOs can guide an organization in effectively using its resources, striking a balance between innovation and improvement. In the tech industry, there is always a tug-of-war between investing in new product features to attract new customer segments and improving existing offerings to increase upselling. CTOs can effectively align development goals to optimize returns. - Amrit Jassal, Egnyte Economic cycles continually fluctuate. Some useful questions for a CTO to answer are: How do we rigorously prioritize the existing demand funnel to optimize outcomes? Where can we double down on reusable services and architecture to maximize investments and velocity? What accelerators can we add so that when the cycle rebounds, we can outpace our competitors? This exercise helps a CTO balance “defense” with “offense.” - Micheline Casey, Siemens Energy Forbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives. Do I qualify? During an economic downturn, a CTO can positively impact the organization by addressing technical debt and strengthening infrastructure. This prepares the company for future growth and sudden demand increases when the market rebounds, ensuring resilience and agility in changing conditions. - Dzmitry Lubneuski, a1qa During an economic downturn, it’s typical to try to reduce costs by improving operational efficiency. For a CTO in the current market, it’s critical to see how your company can leverage artificial intelligence to do more with less. A couple of practical examples: Improve engineering productivity through introducing a coding assistant like Copilot, and enhance knowledge discovery by leveraging a finely tuned large language model to analyze organizational data. - Bhavdeep Sethi, Frec Markets, Inc. One practical and meaningful way for a CTO to help is to view an economic downturn as an opportunity for innovation. “Do more with less” is the mindset a CTO should drive. A CTO must work with the business to identify and solve challenges through innovation and collaboration. A design-thinking workshop or hackathons can help teams imagine new ways of operating in a new normal. Thus, the CTO becomes an agile change agent. - Alvaro Rozo, Arcus Power Corp. Perform an IT audit that looks for shadow IT, outdated or underutilized software, and gaps in cybersecurity risk mitigation—both for your organization and any key suppliers or vendors that have access to company or customer data. Audits can also trigger new policy and procedure development, potentially saving an organization from financial and regulatory headaches down the road. - Ogie Sheehy, ViClarity During an economic downturn, budgets are constrained and there’s a limited infusion of talent from external sources. A CTO’s blueprint for organizational success must focus on driving the efficiency and effectiveness of the core business processes, operating models and digital workflow capabilities that create competitive differentiation in the marketplace. Look toward leveraging digital transformation, artificial intelligence, machine learning and the cloud. - Hemant Ahire, Amazon Web Services A meaningful way a CTO can positively impact the health of their organization during an economic downturn is to help the business prioritize technology projects that have the best near-term return on investment. What can be done relatively quickly and for the least amount of money while still moving the needle on both cost and revenue? - Laura Merling CTOs must be honest with the team about the situation, looking for outside-the-box solutions, offering assurance and trying to avoid layoffs. People are the most important aspect of any organization and should always be treated as such. Find ways to cut costs beyond the obvious—automation, enabling new technologies and doing more with what is available are some aspects to consider. - Sameer Zaveri, Datamotive.io One practical and meaningful way a CTO can positively impact the health of their organization during an economic downturn is by prioritizing technology investments that drive operational efficiency and cost savings. This can include automating routine tasks, optimizing exi... (truncated)

Title: Amazon cracks down on remote work, wants butts in office seats five days a week

What just happened? Amazon is ending the pandemic-era remote and hybrid work arrangements that many of its corporate employees have become accustomed to over the past few years. In a memo this week, CEO Andy Jassy made it clear that starting in 2025, employees will be required to work in the office five days a week, unless they have an approved exception. The new stance marks a significant shift from earlier this year, when Amazon required corporate employees to come into the office at least three days a week. However, Jassy believes being together full-time makes "collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing" easier and more effective. He also emphasized that it helps employees better learn, practice, and strengthen Amazon's "corporate culture" while staying connected as a team. "Our expectation is that people will be in the office outside of extenuating circumstances," Jassy wrote, noting that employees could still work remotely for things like sick days, family emergencies, business travel or just needing "a day or two to finish coding in a more isolated environment." However, the general expectation is regular attendance at the office. The transition to pre-pandemic norms won't happen immediately. Amazon is giving employees until January 2025 to begin adhering to the updated policy, acknowledging that some may need time to adjust. In addition to the office mandate, Jassy revealed that Amazon is also streamlining its corporate structure. The goal is to "remove layers and flatten organizations" by increasing the staff-to-manager ratio across teams by at least 15 percent by early 2025. He also called for the creation of a "bureaucracy mailbox" where employees can report excessive rules or processes. It's worth noting that Amazon rapidly expanded its workforce during the pandemic before Jassy took over as CEO in 2021. Since then, he has implemented significant cuts, including the largest layoffs in Amazon's 27-year history, starting in 2022. Jassy's stance reflects a broader trend of companies bringing employees back to the office full-time. Last month, London-based hardware company Nothing stated that remote work is "not compatible with a high ambition level plus high speed," demanding that employees return to the office five days a week or leave the company. Whether the shift will result in higher productivity remains to be seen. Research on the effects of working from home versus working from the office has been mixed. A study from August 2023 found that productivity among remote workers declined by 18 percent, while a survey from the same period showed that a majority of employees felt more productive working from home.

Amazon announced Monday that it is ending remote work — much to the dismay of some of its employees. Online and in internal channels, employees sounded off on CEO Andy Jassy’s mandate that workers return to the office five days a week starting Jan 2, 2025. “Amazon (AMZN) has announced 5 day RTO, which is unfortunate because I’m interested in working for a living, not live-action role playing and virtue signaling,” CJ Felli, a system development engineer for Amazon Web Services, wrote on Linkedin. “If you have remote opportunities available, please message me. Nothing is off the table. I’d rather go back to school than work in an office again.” Tamia Reed, a data center technician at Amazon Web Services, wrote on LinkedIn that she was “disheartened” by the decision. “For many of us, remote work was not just a convenience but a necessary shift towards a more flexible and balanced professional life. This abrupt change undermines the progress we’ve made in embracing diverse work styles and accommodating different personal needs,” Reed wrote. “I hope Amazon will reconsider and find a way to support both their business needs and their employees’ diverse work preferences.” Others took to internal channels to express their frustration, especially that Jassy said the company was returning to its policy before the pandemic. One employee wrote that new policy is “significantly more strict and out of its mind than many teams operated under pre-covid. This is not ‘going back’ to how it was before. It’s just going backward,” according to Business Insider. “What ever happened to ‘Striving to be Earth’s Best Employer,” another employee, referencing Amazon’s principles, wrote in a message viewed by BI. “Can I negotiate my manager to PIP me,” a different employee said, referencing a performance improvement plan. “Take my money and leave?” Amazon also announced on Monday that it plans to increase the worker-to-manager ratio, which could lead to layoffs. Jassy, who was led the retail giant since 2021, said the move will “remove layers and flatten organizations more than they are today.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Intel Developing AI Chips for Amazon in Multibillion-Dollar Deal

After a summer of mass layoffs and crashing chips, Intel is moving forward with a multiyear, multibillion-dollar chip deal with Amazon's cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services. As part of the deal announced Monday, Intel will design and produce at least two different AI-capable chips for AWS. One of the Intel AI chips will use its 18A process node, while the other will be a chip based on Intel's Xeon 6, built on Intel 3. The companies have already been working together for years, and plan to deepen their ties through the chip deal. Amazon and Intel are also continuing to pour money into their operations in Ohio, with Amazon making plans for a multibillion-dollar data center and Intel building two chip factories in the state's New Albany region. Intel alone hopes its Ohio plans will create over 3,000 jobs in the area. "This collaboration between Intel and AWS is a great development for US-based manufacturing and solidifying Ohio as a leader in AI," said Ohio Governor Mike DeWine in a statement. "Today’s announcement furthers Intel’s commitment to US manufacturing sites, like Ohio’s, as well as AWS’s commitment to its nearly decade-long investment in our state." Like much of big tech, Amazon has bet big on the promise of generative AI. It's invested in Anthropic, which makes the Claude chatbots, and has added generative AI features across Amazon's shopping site through AI-generated descriptions and its "Rufus" chatbot. AWS is also offering AI-as-a-service through its cloud computing division, including a coding assistant dubbed "Q" and an AI app generator. Intel, in turn, could stand to gain financially from the AI boom as one of the US's largest chip manufacturers. But Intel has faced some challenges this year, specifically with its 13th and 14th-generation core desktop chips. The crashing chips have sparked legal investigations, and could lead to multiple class-action lawsuits, though Intel has said its laptop chips aren't impacted by the bug. Over the summer, Intel also confirmed it was making dramatic cuts to its workforce, laying off 15,000 employees, reportedly to improve its financial situation. Earlier this year, the Biden administration announced $8.5 billion for Intel to build more chip factories in the US through the 2022 Chips Act. This week, Intel received another $3 billion in direct funding under the Chips Act for the US "Secure Enclave" program, which is intended to help design advanced chips for government purposes.

Title: Watch These Intel Price Levels as Stock Surges After CEO Provides Business Update

Intel (INTC) shares surged in extended trading on Monday after the embattled chipmaker’s CEO Pat Gelsinger provided an update on the company’s plans to slash costs and turn around its business. Gelsinger said in a note to employees released after the closing bell that Intel has made progress in lowering costs through layoffs, trimming its real estate footprint, and selling part of its stake in its Altera programmable chip unit, among other steps. The company also plans to turn its chipmaking arm into a separate subsidiary and said it would produce chips for Amazon (AMZN), as well as the U.S. military. Intel shares rose 7.9% in after-hours trading to $22.56. The stock had risen more than 6% during regular trading hours following a report from Bloomberg on the contract to produce custom chips for the military. Even with Monday’s gains, the stock has shed more than half its value since the start of the year. Below, we’ll take a closer look at Intel’s monthly chart and use technical analysis to identify key historical price levels worth watching. After encountering significant selling pressure at the closely watched 50-day moving average (MA) in December last year, Intel shares have trended sharply lower, falling as much as 64% since that time. Importantly, trading volumes have increased during the stock’s sell-off, indicating conviction behind the move. Although the shares hit a new multi-year low this month, they have made a partial recovery to currently trade near their September high, potentially forming a hammer—a candlestick pattern that suggests a bullish reversal. Looking ahead, investors should monitor several key price levels on Intel’s chart that will likely gain close attention. Firstly, it’s worth keeping a close eye on the $20 area, a price level the stock reclaimed on Monday. This location on the chart finds a confluence of support from the psychological round number and a horizontal line that connects a range of historical trading levels in the chipmaker’s stock from 1997 to 2012. Confirmation of a September hammer pattern at this key level would register a significant win for the bulls. However, a continuation of Intel’s downtrend could see the shares fall to around $17, where they would likely find support from a period of consolidation in the stock between 1997 and 1998, an area that also closely aligns with troughs in 2006 and 2010. Longer-term weakness may bring the $14 region into play, an area on the chart where buy-and-hold investors would likely seek entry points near prominent swing lows that formed during the dotcom bubble correction of 2002 and great recession in 2009. If an upside reversal takes place in Intel shares, investors should initially keep an eye on the $25 level, a key overhead area where the stock could run into resistance from a horizontal line linking multiple peaks and troughs between 1997 and February last year. A move above this area could see the shares climb to $35, where they may encounter selling pressure near a trendline joining a series of price action from 1999 to October 2023 with the closely-aligned 200-day moving average.

This means that cheaper capital might be on the horizon, with the rate cuts coming just as the labor market starts to feel the pinch through lower growth. It also means that consumer spending can pick up if economic output remains robust. For investors, it creates an opportunity to gain an early foothold into stocks that could benefit from the new environment. On this front, investment banks have been analyzing the situation diligently for quite some time. One bank that's out with regular reports is Morgan Stanley. It releases monthly reports that cover the latest trends in the economy and the stock market. The bank's August report covered some recent trends. It shared that the labor market was one of its most closely watched economic indicators as it was "vulnerable to a further deceleration in economic activity." To explain why, the bank shared that US excess labor supply, that is the demand minus supply, was at pre pandemic levels that had sustained since 2018. This implies that employers no longer have the incentive to offer lucrative pay packages to attract workers, which in turn leads to less money flowing into the economy to contribute to inflation. MS added that the three month national unemployment average was 0.5% above the 12 month average, which is a warning bell for the economy. This is because according to one of the most widely used recession indicators, the Sahm Rule, a recession has started once the rate is 0.5% or higher than the 12 month average. MS is not the only one that is ringing warning bells on this front, as JPM also confirmed in early August that the rule was triggered when the unemployment rate jumped to 4.3%. However, it did add that we "do not think a recession is imminent" and "remain constructive on U.S. equities despite increased volatility, and see opportunity to lock in rates before they fall." SEE ALSO 15 Best European AI Stocks According to Morgan Stanley and Best Humanoid Robot Stocks According to Morgan Stanley Returning to MS, it also sees an opportunity in the battered commercial real estate market. It cites the commercial real estate cap rate, which is the rate of return based on its income generation capability, to argue that commercial real estate valuations are currently depressed enough to warrant an investment. The office real estate market had a cap rate of 9% in March 2024 as per MS, for a two percentage point and three percentage point lead over retail and residential real estate, respectively. As for the stock market, the bank shared in August that it still prefers large cap stocks (an important point as you'll find out when you check out the stocks in this piece). The bank believes that small caps "are lower in quality, more volatile and carry greater exposure to cyclical sectors relative to large cap," meaning that their outperformance "requires economic growth acceleration with lower interest rates." MS warned that "softer economic data may constrain" small cap performance. In terms of data, it argues that small cap performance is dependent on bond yields. This data set shows that when we assume an index value of 100 for US small caps had led benchmark S&P stocks except the Magnificent 7 at a time when 10 year US bond yields were around 1.5% in July 2021, the indexed returns dropped to 90 in July 2023 when the yields were approximately 4.3%. August's final week was pivotal for the stock market as Fed Chair Jerome Powell finally signaled that the time for interest rates had come. "The time has come for policy to adjust," stated Powell at Jackson Hole, Wyoming. "The direction of travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks," he added. Following the Fed Chair's remarks, MS was out with its September report. Commenting on the economy, the bank shared that it does not "believe the economy is set to accelerate over the next few months, which makes the S&P 500 around 5650 our near-term upper bound. At the same time, the economy is not collapsing, which makes 5200 attractive and 5350 seem fair. We plan to trade around the ranges." MS also shares key details for the unemployment rate, which are important when analyzed in tandem with the Sahm Rule. It comments that higher immigration "may be supporting a higher labor force participation rate, which in turn would contribute to a higher reported unemployment rate. From this perspective, a higher unemployment rate is not signaling weakness but rather an increase in the labor supply that would help bring inflation down without affecting growth." Subsequen...

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Intel’s struggling chip-making business got a boost Monday from a high-profile client: Amazon. The announcement came after Intel said earlier in the day it would receive up to $3 billion in funding under the CHIPS and Science Act to manufacture chips for the military. Intel Foundry and Amazon Web Services will coinvest in a custom chip design for the latter and “announced a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar framework,” according to a release. “Specifically, Intel Foundry will produce an AI fabric chip for AWS on Intel 18A,” Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said in the statement Monday. Intel, once the world’s most dominant chipmaker, with a stranglehold on PCs and Macs, has struggled to keep up with the mobile computing wave and has been surpassed in market value by Qualcomm and Texas Instruments, both leaders in mobile chips. And, of course, there’s Nvidia, which rode the subsequent AI boom to become one of the most valuable public companies in the world. Intel’s partnership with AWS is part of the chipmaker’s attempt to play catch-up. The new deal, along with a $3 billion grant from the US government to boost domestic chip making and make chips for the US military, “demonstrates the continued progress we are making to build a world-class foundry business,” Intel said in the statement. Intel is continuing to build plants in US states Arizona, Oregon, New Mexico and Ohio but is pausing its production in Germany and Poland for about two years. Intel shares jumped 6% in after-hours trading after the announcement. Gelsinger also provided updates on the company’s goal to cut $10 billion by 2025. Intel has changed its business model to try to become a global chip manufacturer to rival Taiwan’s TSMC. The note said the company is more than halfway through its goal to cut 15,000 employees by the end of the year and will notify more employees of layoffs in mid-October. It’s also planning to slash its global real estate footprint by about two-thirds by the end of 2024. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. CBA - which owns ASB - is experimenting with advanced AI chatbots running on a new Amazon and Nvidia-powered system. Image / 123RF Commonwealth Bank of Australia - owner of ASB - is exploring the possibility of replacing thousands of its call centre staff with AI, according to an AFR report. The bank, which has some 2400 local call centre staff, announced on Tuesday it’s conducting trials with a generative AI chatbot called “Hey CommBank”, testing the technology on employees of the bank who are also customers. Could it happen on this side of the ditch? “We believe it’s our people that set us apart at ASB and they’ll always be integral to our customer offering,” an ASB spokeswoman told the Herald. “We continue to explore how advancements in tech, including AI, can support our people to do their jobs efficiently but have no plans to replace a large number of roles any time soon. “We’re already using a range of technology, including AI, alongside our team, to enhance the experience we offer our customers. For example, our chatbot Josie has been supporting customers using our digital channels since 2018.” “There’s emerging evidence that AI-driven voice and chatbot interfaces, powered by frontier LLMs [large language models] such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Anthropic’s Claude are approaching human-level capability interacting with human callers and resolving customer service inquiries first time,” said Ben Reid, the founding executive director of AI Forum NZ, who’s now running his own future technology consultancy, Memia. “Clearly if this removes the need to wait on hold listening to muzak for hours then most people will welcome this as a positive development,” he says. “But in reality, as with all AI solutions, the reliability and accuracy of these AI voice solutions is still not quite good enough for prime-time.” “It is inevitable that AI will replace aspects of customer service,” Victoria University senior lecturer in artificial intelligence Andrew Lensen said. “And for some customers, that’s a positive thing. Many ‘digital natives’ would much prefer a high-quality chatbot than talking to a person. But we need to manage the transition fairly and justly.” CommBank’s announcement of its AI trial earlier this week drew fire from Australia’s Finance Sector Union, which said it was not consulted before the launch. Finance Sector Union assistant secretary Nicole McPherson told the AFR the rollout of the new technology was “disrespectful and tricky”. “I’ve been concerned about AI replacing jobs for a few years now – and it looks like it’s finally being publicly acknowledged. Salaries are some of the biggest costs to businesses, so I am not surprised to see a bank moving forward with replacing customer service with AI,” Lensen said. “We can be sure that if the Aussie banks are exploring this, then it will affect Kiwis as well. After all, our banks are nearly all Australian-owned. “What is the plan for workers who are being made redundant by AI? Will the banks help them to re/upskill? Are the Australian and New Zealand Governments prepared for what could be significant layoffs in the workforce (on top of the existing government cuts)? I don’t see anyone answering these questions – we need to take this very seriously as a society and the coalition Government needs to show leadership in addressing these real issues, rather than just promoting AI as being good for productivity and economic growth.” Technology Minister Judith Collins sent a strategy paper to Cabinet centred on light policing of AI, saying new rules would stifle innovation at a time when New Zealand needed to catch up with other countries. Lensen said that by “all but ruling out AI regulation”, Collins was taking a different path to most of our trading partners. He wanted to see the Government at the very least map the lay of the land, surveying which industries and jobs would be affected by AI - and when and how. “Beyond job losses, we should also be concerned about the automation of financial advice and services. Even the very best-designed chatbots can fail – for example, we saw Air Canada in the news a few months ago when their AI chatbot hallucinated a new bereavement policy,” Lensen said. “Air Canada had to pay out in court – so there’s a risk for businesses, too. What happens when a bank AI chatbot gives somebody the wrong advice on their mortgage? Will the bank put aside some of its profits to self-insurance against these mistakes?” AI is already being used to augment helpdesk operations. One NZ’s Jason Paris recently noted that’s been the case for years, well before ChatGPT’s public release threw artificial intelligence into the mainstream. Paris has also been among those who have argued that many customers prefer a smooth, quick digital experience to talking to a human for the likes of simple queries and account changes. CBA is ramping up its artificial intelligence efforts. On T... (truncated)

Title: Amazon staff lose WFH option as company forces employees to return to the office permanently

Local news: Amazon’s move to rope corporate workers back into the office five days a week from January could lead some staff to quit the company, according to one Australian-based expert who believes the e-commerce giant has failed to properly justify the decision. Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy announced in a note to staff the company is taking a major step away from its pandemic-era arrangements, with workers required “in the office the way we were before the onset of COVID”. Jassy said it is a move that will “strengthen our culture and teams” and help staff “deliver the absolute best for customers and the business”. Know the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today Its white-collar workers have been required to swipe into the office at least three days a week for the past 15 months. That will move to five days from January 2. Jassy, who took over from founder Jeff Bezos in 2021, said: “We continue to believe the advantages of being together in the office are significant. “It’s easier for our teammates to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture; collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and, teams tend to be better connected to one another.” The company said there would be exceptions — including for emergencies and parents who need to take care of a sick child — and there will be flexibility for those who were not in the office full-time prior to COVID-19, but conceded the shift will “require some adjustments”. “Before the pandemic, it was not a given that folks could work remotely two days a week and that will also be true moving forward,” Jassy said. “Our expectation is that people will be in the office outside of extenuating circumstances.” Amazon has a global workforce of more than 1.5 million and employs about 7000 staff in Australia. Hundreds of Amazon staff staged a walkout in 2023 to protest return-to-office mandates and layoffs. University of Sydney Business School professor of management Angela Knox, who specialises in work and employment, said one size no longer fits all. “I would expect a lot of workers at Amazon will be dissatisfied — the reaction from workers (during the previous return-to-office mandate) was dissatisfaction,” Knox told 7NEWS.com.au. “It’s not unexpected that a bigger request to return to the office five days a week will lead to high levels of dissatisfaction among some workers. “Some workers prefer working from the office, others from home, and others both. There’s not a one-size-fits-all solution.” Knox flagged some staff could quit in favour of a job that is better catered to how they want to work and live. “If workers don’t want to go into the office they will look for employment that satisfies that,” Knox said “Things have changed so fundamentally. Employees want options and flexibility and will go where they can get that.” Thirty-seven per cent of Australians were regularly working from home in late 2023, according to ABS data. It was down from about 40 per cent in 2021 but still higher than pre-pandemic levels. Close to two-thirds of Australian managers and professionals, like those Amazon is returning to the office, were working from home. “Interestingly, while the pandemic has seen a large shift in people working from home, there haven’t been similarly large changes in other arrangements like working flexible hours,” ABS head of labour statistics Bjorn Jarvis said when the data was released. “Apart from working from home, most other arrangements have generally followed pre-pandemic trends.” One thing that Knox said stood out in the messaging to Amazon staff was a lack of data to justify the decision. “Workers would appreciate a stronger rationale for the decision including data on productivity and performance, (comparing) working in the office against working from home,” Knox said. “It’s not unreasonable to expect staff to come into the office for some activities and meetings but there is insufficient justification for a full return to the office.” Knox said working from home did require management, ensuring staff remain productive, but argued working in the office could potentially be less productive, considering time spent chatting with colleagues and attending meetings that could be handled in an email. “Being visible does not mean being productive,” she said. Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox said the current trend is “very much” with employees wanting staff to return to the office because of concerns over productivity, collaboration, culture and accountability. “We’re more than five years on from COVID and the labor market is changing,” he told 7NEWS.com.au. “Employers are in a position to seek more in terms of everyone turning up (to the office).” He said not all will choose a five-day in-office policy, adding flexible and hybrid workplaces will remain. “There’s no hard or fast rule. We’re kind of in unknown territory and it will vary f... (truncated)

Amazon is asking workers to return to the office five days a week starting in January, marking the first of the Big Tech companies to require a full week in-office. Chief executive Andy Jassy announced the news in a message to employees Monday, telling them they will be expected to follow the new policy beginning Jan. 2. Before the change, Amazon employees were required to be in the office three days a week. “When we look back over the last five years, we continue to believe that the advantages of being together in the office are significant,” Jassy’s note to staff said. “We’ve observed that it’s easier for our teammates to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture; collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and, teams tend to be better connected to one another.” Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post. The news at Amazon comes as more companies pull back on remote work and crack down on enforcing return-to-office policies. Though Amazon is the first Big Tech company requiring a full week in the office, other tech companies have slowly been tweaking their policies over the past couple of years and taking some hard-line stances. SAP, AT&T and Dell are among those that have rolled back more flexible policies. As a result, some workers have pushed back with threats and protests, or even quit over the new policies. That was then. Jassy said Amazon’s new policy would be similar to the pre-pandemic era: Employees may still have some exceptions to the rule if their child is sick, they have an emergency or they need to work in an isolated environment, for example. But they will no longer be able to work from home two days a week without a reason, unless they have a remote work exception approved by their supervisor. The company did not comment on how it intends to enforce the rule. And while Jassy recognizes that some employees “may have set up their personal lives in such a way that returning to the office consistently five days per week will require some adjustments,” he expects everyone to be compliant by Jan. 2. Jassy also said he plans to increase the ratio of employees to managers to flatten the organization and allow teams to move faster and decrease bureaucracy. Moves such as Amazon’s come with consequences, said Prithwiraj Choudhury, a Harvard Business School professor who studies remote work. Choudhury said that research has shown that when companies roll back flexible work policies, they often lose top performers, diverse workers and job candidates. It is also often a way for companies to lower their head count without layoffs. “This seems to be a step back in time,” he said. “It’s regressive leadership.” Choudhury doesn’t believe the tide is turning on hybrid work. About 41 percent of people did their jobs with hybrid arrangements as of Sept. 1, according to data from the Survey of Working Arrangements and Attitudes conducted by WFH Research, a group of researchers from the University of Chicago, MIT, Stanford University and Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México. That number has hovered between 40 and 50 percent since January. “We are squarely in the hybrid world,” Choudhury said. “The challenge is how to figure out hybrid.” The best way is to leave it up to teams to determine how often, when and where they should be meeting, Choudhury said. While Amazon is rolling flexibility back, other companies like job review service Glassdoor are doubling down. The company closed its last remaining two offices in the U.S. as it continues to be remote-first. -Washington Post Take your Radio, Podcasts and Music with you Get more of the radio, music and podcasts you love with the FREE iHeartRadio app. Scan the QR code to download now.

Working from home is over, Amazon told its corporate employees on Monday—at least on weekdays. The most recent guidance was that staff members needed to show up at least three days a week. That minimum has gone the way of social distancing, CNBC reports. "Before the pandemic, it was not a given that folks could work remotely two days a week, and that will also be true moving forward," CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a company memo, adding that "our expectation is that people will be in the office outside of extenuating circumstances." The policy takes effect Jan. 2. Jassy has told employees before that having them in the same place improves the company culture, per CNN, and he told them he realized teams needed time to figure out how that will work best for them. On Monday, Jassy said being in the office will help help staff members "invent, collaborate, and be connected enough to each other and our culture to deliver the absolute best for customers and the business." He also said Amazon is simplifying its corporate structure. The company will have fewer managers, Jassy said, to "remove layers and flatten organizations." Corporate organizations are to increase the ratio of "individual contributors"—employees who typically don't manage other employees—to managers by at least 15%. It wasn't made clear whether positions will be cut, per CNBC, and a company spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company had added employees during the pandemic, until Jassy ordered thousands of layoffs. (More Amazon stories.)

By Emma Roth, a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO. Intel is spinning off its chipmaking business as part of its plans to reverse billions in losses and a tumbling stock price. In an announcement on Monday, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said the Intel Foundry will become an independent subsidiary with “clearer separation and independence” from Intel. With the change, the Intel Foundry will have its own operating board and report its financial earnings separately from Intel. Intel will also stop work on the factories it’s building in Poland and Germany for two years “based on anticipated market demand.” The company is still moving forward with its plants in Arizona, Oregon, New Mexico, and Ohio, however. Additionally, Intel plans on selling part of its stake in Altera, the programmable chip company it acquired in 2015. It will also cut around two-thirds of its global real estate footprint. As part of this announcement, Intel revealed that the Biden administration awarded the company up to $3 billion in funding to make chips for the US military. These changes will likely be crucial in getting Intel back on track as a leading chipmaker. On top of widespread issues affecting 13th and 14th Gen CPUs, the company reported $1.6 billion in the first quarter of 2024, with its chipmaking business alone racking up $7 billion in operating losses in 2023. In August, Intel announced layoffs affecting 15,000 workers, and now it says it is “more than halfway” to this goal. “As I’ve said before, this is the most significant transformation of Intel in over four decades. Not since the memory to microprocessor transition have we attempted something so essential,” Gelsinger says. “We succeeded then — and we will meet this moment and build a stronger Intel for decades to come.” Even though Intel is betting that its new 18A chipmaking process will help stem some of its losses, a recent report from Reuters suggests that early tests have failed when creating Broadcom’s silicon wafers. Starting next year, Intel is planning to produce chips with the 18A process for partners like Microsoft — and now Amazon. / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Title: Amazon Plans to Have Fewer Managers, More Days in Office

Amazon plans to reduce the number of managers in each of its organizations and to require employees to work primarily in an office. The company is making these changes as part of its efforts to “operate like the world’s largest startup,” Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a message shared with the company’s employees and posted online Monday (Sept. 16). In the case of managers, Amazon aims to flatten organizations by asking each of its S-teams, or senior leadership teams, to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of the first quarter of 2025, according to the message. As the company grew its teams over the last several years, it also added managers and more layers than it had before, per the message. This has led to more meetings and more managers reviewing topics before they move forward. “If we do this work well,” Jassy said of the move to have having fewer managers, “it will increase our teammates’ ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership, drive decision-making closer to the front lines where it most impacts customers (and the business), decrease bureaucracy, and strengthen our organizations’ ability to make customers’ lives better and easier every day,” Jassy wrote. Amazon began a series of layoffs in November 2022, with Jassy saying at the time that the company had hired rapidly over the previous several years. In January 2023, he said the number of layoffs would amount to more than 18,000. On the issue of working from an office, Amazon is going to return to the practices it had before the pandemic, according to the message. That means employees being in the office except in “extenuating circumstances” like when their child is sick, there’s an emergency at home, they’re visiting customers or partners, or they need a day or two to finish coding in a more isolated environment, Jassy wrote. Over the last 15 months, employees have been back in the office at least three days a week, per the message. But now it will no longer be “a given” that they can work remotely two days a week. This change will take effect Jan. 2. Jassy wrote in the message that working from an office will make Amazon’s teams “better set up to invent, collaborate, and be connected enough to each other and our culture to deliver the absolute best for customers and the business.” It was reported in July 2023 that Amazon was ramping up its return-to-the-office mandate by requiring employees working remotely or in smaller remote offices to return to the company’s “main hub” locations. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Amazon workers must return to office full time, CEO says

Amazon is requiring its workers to return to the office full time. In a note published Monday by the e-commerce giant, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, who took over from founder Jeff Bezos in 2020, said the move to end the company's hybrid model was designed toward "being better set up to invent, collaborate, and be connected enough to each other and our culture to deliver the absolute best for customers and the business." He noted that the company's three-day-a-week policy, instituted in 2023, had only reinforced the view that a full return was necessary. "When we look back over the last five years, we continue to believe that the advantages of being together in the office are significant," Jassy said. The change will take effect starting in January 2025. The company will still respect extenuating circumstances, like caring for a sick child, and pre-approved work-from-home or hybrid arrangements. Amazon joins a growing list of major U.S. firms returning to a five-days-a-week office policy, including Boeing, JP Morgan Chase and UPS. However, according to data from FlexIndex, a firm that tracks company office policies, a majority of U.S. firms still offer hybrid arrangements. The data does show bigger companies leading the way in pushing for more in-office full-time policies. But notably, Jassy said he wants Amazon to operate as if it were "the world's largest startup" — a sentiment Bezos, Amazon's founder, often stressed. “That means having a passion for constantly inventing for customers," Jassy said, "strong urgency (for most big opportunities, it’s a race!), high ownership, fast decision-making, scrappiness and frugality, deeply-connected collaboration (you need to be joined at the hip with your teammates when inventing and solving hard problems), and a shared commitment to each other.” Jassy also announced a move to reduce "bureaucracy" within the firm, hinting at unintended consequences from Amazon's aggressive hiring following pandemic reopenings — and possibly opening the door for layoffs. Jassy asked employee units to "increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers" by at least 15% by the end of Q1 2025. "As we have grown our teams as quickly and substantially as we have the last many years, we have understandably added a lot of managers," Jassy said. "In that process, we have also added more layers than we had before. It’s created artifacts that we’d like to change." An Amazon spokesperson did not respond to a follow-up request for comment. This article was originally published on NBCNews.com Amazon CEO Andy Jassy is calling for a full return to office at the start of 2025. For the last 15 months, employees have been expected to work in the office three days per week. Now employees will be expected to be in the office five days a week, with work from home being OK only in extenuating circumstances.

Intel (INTC) shares surged in extended trading Monday after CEO Pat Gelsinger offered an update on the chipmaker's plans to cut costs and bolster its business, with investors awaiting signs of a turnaround for its stock. Shares were up over 8% shortly after the closing bell, after gaining 6% during the regular trading session. Even with those gains, though, Intel's shares have lost more than half their value since the start of the year. Gelsinger said Intel has made progress in lowering expenses through layoffs, trimming its real estate footprint, and selling part of its stake in its Altera programmable chip unit, among other steps to cut costs. The company also said it plans to turn Intel Foundry, which makes chips for other companies, into a separate subsidiary, a move that Intel said will give it greater independence, allow it to seek financing independently, and help Intel “optimize the capital structure of each business.” Recent reports had suggested that Intel might sell the operation. Intel also announced multibillion-dollar agreements to produce custom chips for Amazon (AMZN), as well as the U.S. military. The Pentagon news was first reported by Bloomberg. "This news, combined with our [Amazon Web Services] announcement, demonstrates the continued progress we are making to build a world-class foundry business," Gelsinger said in a release. Gelsinger added the chipmaker will still be moving forward with projects in Arizona, Oregon, New Mexico and Ohio, adding that Intel remains “well-positioned to scale up production around the world based on market demand.”

Title: Amazon mandates five days a week in office starting next year

Business The Amazon logo is seen outside its JFK8 distribution centre in Staten Island, New York, US, Nov 25, 2020. (File photo: REUTERS/Brendan McDermid) Tech giant Amazon will require employees to return to working at company offices five days per week beginning next year, toughening a prior three-day mandate. "When we look back over the last five years, we continue to believe that the advantages of being together in the office are significant," CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a letter to employees globally on Monday (Sep 16). He said the experience of a three-day mandate "strengthened our conviction about the benefits" of in-office work. "We've observed that it's easier for our teammates to learn, model, practice and strengthen our culture; collaborating, brainstorming and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and teams tend to be better connected to one another," he added. Companies have been allowing many employees to work from home since the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving downtown offices nearly empty in a number of US cities such as San Francisco and Seattle. However, some tech firms are beginning to mandate employees to return to their offices two or three days per week. Amazon has taken a tougher stance than many of its rivals as the pandemic has become less of a daily threat. Employees have described to Reuters how Amazon has required them to report to, in some cases, distant offices or move to Seattle to keep their jobs. And some employees who were consistently out of compliance with the existing three-day mandate were told they were "voluntarily resigning", and were locked out of Amazon's systems. A spokesperson for Amazon did not immediately respond to say whether the new mandate will be as stringent, nor did an employee Q&A shared with Reuters on Monday make it clear. The mandate has been deeply unpopular among a vocal group of employees who have said working from home is both effective and spares time and money for commuting. In May last year, workers at Amazon's Seattle headquarters staged a walkout protesting changes to the e-commerce giant's climate policy, layoffs and a return-to-office mandate. As part of an organisational restructuring, Amazon is looking to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15 per cent by the end of the first quarter of 2025. In the Q&A, Amazon said "some organisations may identify roles that are no longer required" without giving additional details. Amazon also is eliminating a prior programme that allowed workers the option to work from anywhere for four months per year, according to the Q&A. Jassy said that to accommodate the lifestyle changes necessary, the new policy would start on Jan 2, 2025. After a wave of layoffs, in 2023 Amazon was reported to have 300,000 to 350,000 corporate employees globally. This number is separate from their warehouse and delivery workers, who make up a much larger portion of Amazon's total workforce of about 1.5 million.

Title: The Subprime AI Crisis

Time Published: 2024-09-16T20:31:07Z
Full Content:
None of what I write in this newsletter is about sowing doubt or "hating," but a sober evaluation of where we are today and where we may end up on the current path. I believe that the artificial intelligence boom — which would be better described as a generative AI boom — is (as I've said before) unsustainable, and will ultimately collapse. I also fear that said collapse could be ruinous to big tech, deeply damaging to the startup ecosystem, and will further sour public support for the tech industry. The reason I'm writing this today is that it feels like the tides are rapidly turning, and multiple pale horses of the AI apocalypse have emerged: “a big, stupid magic trick” in the form of OpenAI's (rushed) launch of its "o1 (codenamed: strawberry") model, rumored price increases for future OpenAI models (and elsewhere), layoffs at Scale AI, and leaders fleeing OpenAI. These are all signs that things are beginning to collapse. As a result, I think it’s important to explain how precarious things are, and why we are in a trough of magical thinking. I want to express my concerns about the fragility of this movement and the obsessiveness and directionlessness that brought us here, and I want some of us to do better. I also — and this, perhaps, is something I haven’t focused on as much as I should have — want to highlight the potential human cost of an AI bubble implosion. Whether Microsoft and Google (and the other big generative AI backers) slowly wind down their positions, or cannibalize their companies to keep OpenAI and Anthropic (as well as their own generative AI efforts) alive, I’m convinced that the end result will be the same. I fear tens of thousands of people will lose their jobs, and much of the tech industry will suffer as they realize that the only thing that can grow forever is cancer. There won’t be much levity in this piece. I’m going to paint you a bleak picture — not just for the big AI players, but for tech more widely, and for the people who work at tech companies — and tell you why I think the conclusion to this sordid saga, as brutal and damaging as it will be, is coming sooner than you think. Let's begin. As we speak, OpenAI — the ostensible non-profit that may soon become a for-profit — is currently raising a funding round at a valuation of at least $150 billion, and is expected to raise at least $6.5 billion — but potentially as much as $7 billion — led by Josh Kushner's Thrive Capital, with rumored participation from both NVIDIA and Apple. As I've explained in agonizing detail in the past, OpenAI will have to continue to raise more money than any startup has ever raised in history, in perpetuity, to survive. Worse still, OpenAI also is trying to raise $5 billion in debt from banks “in the form of a revolving credit facility” according to Bloomberg, and the terms on revolving credit facilities tend to have higher rates of interest. The Information also reports that OpenAI is in talks with MGX, a $100 billion investment fund backed by the United Arab Emirates to invest primarily in AI and semiconductor companies, as well as potentially raising from the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. This should be the biggest warning sign that things are going poorly, because absolutely nobody raises from the UAE or Saudis because they want to. They’re the place you go if you need a lot of money and you’re not confident anybody else will give it to you. Sidenote: as CNBC points out, one of the foundational partners of MGX, Mubadala, owns around $500m in Anthropic equity, which it acquired from the bankruptcy of FTX’s assets. I’m sure Amazon and Google are thrilled about that conflict of interest! As I discussed at the end of July, OpenAI needs to raise at least $3 billion — but more like $10 billion to survive, as it is on course to lose $5 billion in 2024, a number that's likely to increase as more complex models demand more compute and more training data, with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei predicting that future models may cost as much as $100 billion to train. OpenAI has already tried to raise at a $100 billion valuation earlier in the year, with some investors balking at the price tag, in part because (and I paraphrase The Information's Kate Clark and Natasha Mascarenhas) of a growing concern over the overvaluation of generative AI companies. To get the round done, OpenAI may also convert from a non-profit to a for-profit entity, but the most confusing part of this story appears to be what investors are actually getting. Kate Clark of The Information reports that investors in the round are being told, and I quote, that they "don't get traditional equity for their cash...instead, they receive units that promise a slice of the company's profits — once it starts to generate them." It's unclear whether a conversion to a for-profit entity would fix this problem, as OpenAI's bizarre non-profit-with-a-for-profit-arm corporate structure means that Microsoft has the rights to 75% of OpenAI's profits as part of it...

Amazon becomes the first of the Big Tech companies to require a full week in the office. Photo / 123RF Amazon is asking workers to return to the office five days a week from January, marking the first of the Big Tech companies to require a full week in-office. Chief executive Andy Jassy announced the news in a message to employees, telling them they would be expected to follow the new policy from January 2. Before the change, Amazon employees were required to be in the office three days a week. “When we look back over the last five years, we continue to believe that the advantages of being together in the office are significant,” Jassy’s note to staff said. “We’ve observed that it’s easier for our teammates to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture. Collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective. Teaching and learning from one another are more seamless and teams tend to be better connected to one another.” Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post. The news at Amazon comes as more companies pull back on remote work and crack down on enforcing return-to-office policies. Though Amazon is the first Big Tech company requiring a full week in the office, other tech companies have slowly been tweaking their policies over the past couple of years and taking some hard-line stances. SAP, AT&T and Dell are among those that have rolled back more flexible policies. As a result, some workers have pushed back with threats and protests, or even quit over the new policies. Jassy said Amazon’s new policy would be similar to the pre-pandemic era. Employees may still have some exceptions to the rule if their child is sick, they have an emergency or they need to work in an isolated environment, for example, but will no longer be able to work from home two days a week without a reason - unless they have a remote work exception approved by their supervisor. The company did not comment on how it intends to enforce the rule. And while Jassy recognised some employees “may have set up their personal lives in such a way that returning to the office consistently five days per week will require some adjustments,” he expected everyone to be compliant by January 2. Jassy planned to increase the ratio of employees to managers to flatten the organisation and allow teams to move faster and decrease bureaucracy. Moves such as Amazon’s come with consequences, said Prithwiraj Choudhury, a Harvard Business School professor who studies remote work. Choudhury said research had shown when companies roll back flexible work policies, they often lose top performers, diverse workers and job candidates. It was also often a way for companies to lower their headcount without layoffs. “This seems to be a step back in time,” he said. “It’s regressive leadership.” Choudhury did not believe the tide was turning on hybrid work. About 41% of people did their jobs with hybrid arrangements as of September 1, according to data from the Survey of Working Arrangements and Attitudes conducted by WFH Research, a group of researchers from the University of Chicago, MIT, Stanford University and Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México. That number has hovered between 40% and 50% since January. “We are squarely in the hybrid world,” Choudhury said. “The challenge is how to figure out hybrid.” The best way was to leave it up to teams to determine how often, when and where they should be meeting, Choudhury said. While Amazon is rolling flexibility back, other companies, such as job review service Glassdoor, are doubling down. The company closed its last remaining two offices in the United States as it continues to be remote-first. CEO tells staff: 'I know that ... uncertainty about job security is unsettling.'

As part of CEO Pat Gelsinger's effort to turn around the struggling chipmaker, Intel said in a memo to employees that it will also sell off part of its stake in Altera. Gelsinger said the restructuring would allow the foundry business to "evaluate independent sources of funding," and comes days after Intel's board met to assess the direction and future of the company. The foundry business, which Intel plans to use to manufacture chips for other customers, has been a big drag on its bottom line, with the company spending roughly $25 billion on it in each of the last two years. Beyond just considering outside funding, Intel is weighing whether to spin off the foundry business, possibly into a separate publicly traded company, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who declined to be named in order to discuss confidential information. With a standalone "operating board" and a cleaner corporate structure, the mechanics of a separation become far easier than trying to turn a fully integrated unit into a separate company. Prior to the postmarket pop, Intel had lost almost 60% of its value this year. The company has given up market share in its core PC and data center business and watched Nvidia run away with the market for chips that power artificial intelligence workloads. In August, Intel reported disappointing quarterly results, sparking the sharpest sell-off in 50 years, and said it would lay off more than 15% of its workforce as part of a $10 billion cost-reduction plan. Gelsinger said the company is about halfway through the layoffs. Intel will also pause its fabrication efforts in Poland and Germany "by approximately two years based on anticipated market demand," Gelsinger said, and pull back on its plans for its Malaysian factory. U.S. manufacturing projects will remain unaffected, the company said. Earlier on Monday, Intel was awarded up to $3 billion from the Biden administration and the CHIPS and Science Act, an effort to bring chipmaking to the U.S. The funding is for the "Secure Enclave" program, which furthers a project between Intel and the Department of Defense.

Earlier this year, Intel announced its current financial situation was not looking good. Among other things, the company announced mass layoffs of 15,000 team members in early August. Today, as previously rumored, Intel announced more details of its plan to make major change to get things back on track. In a blog post, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger announced it would be making changes to its foundry business. That division will now become an independent subsidiary of the company. Gelsinger stated: A subsidiary structure will unlock important benefits. It provides our external foundry customers and suppliers with clearer separation and independence from the rest of Intel. Importantly, it also gives us future flexibility to evaluate independent sources of funding and optimize the capital structure of each business to maximize growth and shareholder value creation. Intel will also put the construction of two foundry plants, one in Poland and one in Germany, on hold for at least two years. It still plans to complete the construction of its packaging plant in Malaysia but added that it will "align the startup with market conditions and increased utilization of our existing capacity." Intel also announced a new collaboration with Amazon Web Services. That will include Intel making an "AI fabric chip" for AWS. The company said it will put its focus on its own x86 chip portfolio. It added: Our top priority is to maximize the value of our x86 franchise across client, edge and data center markets, including with a broader range of custom chiplets and other customized offerings that meet emerging customer needs, as demonstrated by today’s AWS announcement. Intel said that it is currently over halfway through the process of cutting its previously announced 15,000 workers, either through layoffs or early retirement. The rest of the job cuts will happen before the end of October.

Title: Amazon orders employees to return to office 5 days a week, warns of corporate restructuring

Amazon is mandating that corporate workers return to the office five days a week, CEO Andy Jassy said in a note on Monday. The return-to-office mandate is a sharp change from its current hybrid policy, which requires employees to work from the office at least three days a week. Amazon employees will have until Jan. 2 to switch to the new policy. Amazon will also be streamlining its corporate structure — management positions in particular — to “remove layers and flatten organizations,” Jassy said. The Seattle, Wash.-based company rapidly expanded during the pandemic before Jassy took the helm in 2021 and implemented cost-cutting measures and widespread layoffs. During his tenure, Jassy orchestrated the largest layoffs in Amazon’s 27 years as a public company. As a result of growing the company so quickly, Amazon hired a lot of managers and “added more layers than we had before,” Jassy said. Those layers clogged up the food chain — creating pre-meetings for meetings and a more convoluted chain of command. “So, we’re asking each s-team organization to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of Q1 2025,” Jassy wrote. The company has created a “bureaucracy mailbox,” or email alias, dedicated to rooting out unnecessary steps in the company, Jassy said. In addition to tweaking the company’s structure, Jassy said a main focus of the return-to-office mandate was making sure employees are set up with the ability to interact. “We want to operate like the world’s largest startup,” Jassy said. “That means having a passion for constantly inventing for customers, strong urgency (for most big opportunities, it’s a race!), high ownership, fast decision-making, scrappiness and frugality, deeply-connected collaboration (you need to be joined at the hip with your teammates when inventing and solving hard problems), and a shared commitment to each other.” So the five-day-a-week mandate is an effort to foster collaboration seen pre-pandemic, making it easier for teammates to “learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture,” Jassy said. Jassy said the new mandate will operate like most office environments prior to the pandemic. It will be “understood” if an employee has an exceptional circumstance, like a child who is home sick, a house emergency or time spent on the road meeting with clients or partners. Amazon directed further inquiries to review Jassy’s note. Advertisement

Amazon is ordering workers back to the office five days a week and wants corporate managers to oversee more employees in a move it says will improve the company’s culture. CEO Andy Jassy said in a memo to staff, “We’ve decided that we’re going to return to being in the office the way we were before the onset of COVID.” Jassy said he believes the move will better set up Amazon “to invent, collaborate, and be connected enough to each other and our culture to deliver the absolute best for customers and the business.” The policy will go into effect on Jan 2, 2025. The CEO of the retail giant did carve out some exceptions to the new policy, saying, “Before the pandemic, not everybody was in the office five days a week, every week. If you or your child were sick, if you had some sort of house emergency, if you were on the road seeing customers or partners, if you needed a day or two to finish coding in a more isolated environment, people worked remotely.” That policy will remain, but people will no longer be able to voluntarily work remotely two days a week, as is the current policy. Jassy also said that the company wants each s-team organization to “to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of Q1 2025.” It wasn’t clear if this meant the company would hire more people, conduct layoffs, or do both to achieve this new ratio. He said the move will “remove layers and flatten organizations more than they are today.” “If we do this work well, it will increase our teammates’ ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership, drive decision-making closer to the front lines where it most impacts customers (and the business), decrease bureaucracy, and strengthen our organizations’ ability to make customers’ lives better and easier every day,” he said. Jassy also said Amazon (AMZN) will return to having assigned desk arrangements at its U.S. headquarters in Puget Sound, Washington and Arlington, Virginia. Previous reports showed that Amazon was keeping tabs on how much its employees were coming into the office and sending messages to delinquent employees. It also wanted to make sure employees weren’t clocking into the office and then leaving soon after, telling workers they needed to be in for at least two hours to get credit for a day in the office.

SEATTLE - Amazon.com chief executive officer Andy Jassy is moving to streamline the world’s largest online retailer and cloud-computing company, cutting management layers and ordering employees to return to the office five days a week beginning in January. The shake-up, announced in a memo to employees on Sept 16, echoed what some company veterans have been whispering for years: It’s become harder to get things done at Amazon. Stories of endless deliberation, unnecessary meetings and layers of approval have become commonplace at a company that fashions itself as a collection of teams charged with operating like start-ups. Mr Jassy called out some of those phenomena in his note, citing “pre-meetings for the pre-meetings for the decision meetings, a longer line of managers feeling like they need to review a topic before it moves forward, owners of initiatives feeling less like they should make recommendations because the decision will be made elsewhere.” Each major organisation within Amazon will be required to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by 15 per cent by the end of March 2025, Mr Jassy said. He also announced a bureaucracy tipline for employees to raise concerns about unnecessary processes. “We want to operate like the world’s largest startup,” he said in the message, which was also posted on Amazon’s corporate blog. “That means having a passion for constantly inventing for customers, strong urgency (for most big opportunities, it’s a race!), high ownership, fast decision-making, scrappiness and frugality, deeply-connected collaboration (you need to be joined at the hip with your teammates when inventing and solving hard problems), and a shared commitment to each other.” It also means an end to Amazon’s relative flexibility on where office workers do their jobs. Previously, Amazon had required employees to badge in at least three days a week, depending on the requirements of their team. Amazon’s new return to office plans will make exceptions for extenuating circumstances or cases where managers had already approved a fully remote position, and employees have a few months to prepare, Jassy said. “We understand that some of our teammates may have set up their personal lives in such a way that returning to the office consistently five days per week will require some adjustments,” Mr Jassy wrote. Most of Amazon’s roughly 1.5 million employees around the world are hourly employees who retrieve items and ship packages, people for whom remote work was never an option. But the company employs hundreds of thousands of office workers – it had roughly 350,000 of them on the eve of its largest-ever layoffs, which began in late 2022. The news will likely mean a boost in downtown foot traffic in the cities where Amazon operates. That includes Seattle, where the company is by far the largest corporate tenant; suburban Bellevue, Washington; as well as places like Arlington, Virginia; the San Francisco Bay Area; Austin; Boston; and Nashville. The company’s prior efforts to get workers back in the office were met with resistance by some employees who charged that the company was inflexible and failed to provide data showing in-person work achieved better results. “Keeping your culture strong is not a birthright,” Mr Jassy wrote. “You have to work at it all the time.” BLOOMBERG Join ST's Telegram channel and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News There are no new alerts at this time Amazon is requiring its workers to return to the office full time. In a note published Monday by the e-commerce giant, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, who took over from founder Jeff Bezos in 2020, said the move to end the company's hybrid model was designed toward "being better set up to invent, collaborate, and be connected enough to each other and our culture to deliver the absolute best for customers and the business." He noted that the company's three-day-a-week policy, instituted in 2023, had only reinforced the view that a full return was necessary. "When we look back over the last five years, we continue to believe that the advantages of being together in the office are significant," Jassy said. The change will take effect starting in January 2025. The company will still respect extenuating circumstances, like caring for a sick child, and pre-approved work-from-home or hybrid arrangements. Amazon joins a growing list of major U.S. firms returning to a five-days-a-week office policy, including Boeing, JP Morgan Chase and UPS. However, according to data from FlexIndex, a firm that tracks company office policies, a majority of U.S. firms still offer hybrid arrangements. The data does show bigger companies leading the way in pushing for more in-office full-time policies. But notably, Jassy said he wants Amazon to operate as if it were "the world's largest startup" — a sentiment Bezos, Amazon's founder, often stressed. “That means having a passion for constantly inventing for customers," Jassy said, "strong urgency (for most big opportunities, it’s a race!), high ownership, fast decision-making, scrappiness and frugality, deeply-connected collaboration (you need to be joined at the hip with your teammates when inventing and solving hard problems), and a shared commitment to each other.” Jassy also announced a move to reduce "bureaucracy" within the firm, hinting at unintended consequences from Amazon's aggressive hiring following pandemic reopenings — and possibly opening the door for layoffs. Jassy asked employee units to "increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers" by at least 15% by the end of Q1 2025. "As we have grown our teams as quickly and substantially as we have the last many years, we have understandably added a lot of managers," Jassy said. "In that process, we have also added more layers than we had before. It’s created artifacts that we’d like to change." An Amazon spokesperson did not respond to a follow-up request for comment.
