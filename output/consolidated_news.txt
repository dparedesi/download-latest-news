[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, Aug. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) and reminds investors of the September 30, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Novo’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Title: Solana Price Rebound Ignites Buying; Traders Stock Up on Pepe and This L2 Gem with 200x Potential

The recent surge in Solana price has reignited enthusiasm across the meme coin sector, drawing fresh attention to both the established meme coin Pepe and the hot new $LBRETT. As investors seek the next high-yield meme coin, comparisons between Solana’s performance and the rapid ascent of newer tokens like $LBRETT have intensified, especially given the ongoing presale, remarkable staking rewards, and technological advantages on offer. SOL has overcome numerous network challenges to secure its place as a top-tier crypto asset. Its high throughput, low transaction fees, and robust developer ecosystem have cemented its reputation among leading blockchains. SOL Technical indicators such as EMA and MACD signal a bullish continuation, with analysts projecting further Solana price upside in the near term. These positive forecasts are fostering increased interest in meme coins built on newer, more scalable platforms. PEPE, the prominent meme coin, has ridden waves of viral popularity and speculative trading. Despite the absence of major recent price news, its established brand presence continues to attract traders. Technical models for PEPE suggest that it remains a force in the meme coin arena. Its upside potential to explode is still there and has prompted many savvy investors to stock up on it, expecting the meme coin season to start soon. Unlike its rivals, $LBRETT is widely considered to possess the capacity to surpass both SOL and PEPE in terms of price appreciation. Analysts point to the project’s rapid community growth, innovative staking model, and presale momentum as drivers for an anticipated 200x increase from current entry levels. With the presale price rising at each round, even the current $0.004 price tag is still deeply discounted. The upside potential is drawing significant attention from both seasoned and new investors. Industry experts are predicting 200x not on hot hair, but are basing this on facts. The live presale has already raised over $190,000, underscoring rising demand. Available for immediate staking, the $LBRETT APY is exceptionally high, even though it has dropped significantly from its original 25,000%. The falling reward has created a stir in the market, with traders rushing to join and take advantage of the APY before it is too late. Layer Brett leverages high-speed, low-cost, and scalable infrastructure, benefiting from the security of Ethereum’s smart contract ecosystem and enabling fast transactions with very low gas fees. Here are just a few things that combine meme power and actual utility: With Solana price action invigorating the meme coin markets, both Pepe and $LBRETT are capturing investor interest. However, $LBRETT’s combination of explosive meme attraction, exceptional staking rewards, Layer 2 Ethereum technology, and innovative features positions it as the meme coin most likely to achieve the coveted 200x potential.Don’t Miss Out On Crypto’s Newest 100x Meme!

August 12, 2025 12:00 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, Aug. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming September 30, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) securities between May 7, 2025, to July 28, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR NOVO NORDISK INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On July 29, 2025, Novo Nordisk cut its previously issued fiscal year 2025 guidance, lowering sales growth from 13-21% to 8-14%, and operating profit from 16-24% to 10-16%. The Company cited lower growth expectations for both Ozempic and Wegovy on the back of a slowdown in market expansion, competition, and the alleged continued use of compounded GLP-1s. On this news, Novo Nordisk’s stock price fell $15.06, or 21.8%, to close at $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, thereby injuring investors. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Novo Nordisk repeatedly ignored and minimized the significance of the personalization exception for GLP-1 compounding, greatly overestimated its ability to capture patients coming off of compounded treatments, and was ultimately ill equipped to capitalize upon the purported significant unmet patient population; and (2) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than September 30, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Title: Crunchyroll Announces Layoffs Amid Global Reorganization

By Jamie Lang | 08/12/2025 8:11 am | Be the First to Comment! Email Address* A day after unveiling a major deal with Delta Airlines, Crunchyroll has announced a sweeping internal reorganization that includes layoffs in the U.S., new global engineering hubs, and role changes for staff. In a letter to employees, published by Variety, president Rahul Purini framed the shake-up as a proactive step to position the anime streamer for “scale and success” over the next three to five years. The changes include the creation of “centers of excellence” in the U.S., India, and Mexico, along with a shift toward regionally empowered teams. Purini stressed the move was “not a cost-cutting measure or driven by financial performance,” but rather part of a strategy to lean more deeply into anime fandom worldwide. The announcement comes amid a period of both rapid growth and mounting challenges for the Sony-owned platform. Since Sony Group Corp. bought Crunchyroll in 2021 for $1.2 billion, subscribers to its service have tripled to 15 million, and the number of new shows released each quarter has doubled. But the rising popularity of anime has brought fierce competition from the likes of Netflix, Disney, and Amazon, driving up licensing costs and making it harder for Crunchyroll to hold onto its corner of the market. Internally, the company has undergone at least three rounds of layoffs since the Sony acquisition, with staff surveys showing declining confidence in leadership. According to internal polling shared by Bloomberg, only 39% of employees recently agreed that management communicates a motivating strategy, down from 51% in a prior survey. Some current and former staffers have described the post-acquisition leadership, many from Sony’s Funimation division, as “out-of-touch” with anime fans and culture. Crunchyroll has also faced strategic setbacks. Its “25 by 25” initiative, aiming for 25 million subscribers by the end of 2025, appears increasingly out of reach. Plans to drive growth through video games and e-commerce have stumbled, with several game titles shuttered and its Right Stuf merchandise business shrinking since Sony removed adult products that had contributed to sales. Competition for top anime titles has intensified. Other top streamers have secured exclusives for key IPs such as Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure, Tokyo Revengers, and Delicious in Dungeon, while major Japanese studios such as Toei and Toho have explored partnerships beyond Crunchyroll. At the same time, industry sources say rising licensing fees are squeezing margins. Despite the turbulence, Crunchyroll is pursuing new markets, offering subscriptions in India for about $1 a month, expanding dubbing into multiple local languages, and creating free, ad-supported channels on platforms like Roku and Pluto TV. The new Delta Airlines partnership, announced just a day before the layoffs, will bring over 50,000 episodes of anime to in-flight screens later this year, marking a high-profile bid to expand the brand’s reach. Whether the restructuring will stabilize internal morale and sharpen Crunchyroll’s competitive positioning remains to be seen. For now, the company’s message is one of optimism: doubling down on fandom, investing in regional teams, and betting that its blend of exclusive titles, events, and merchandise can keep pace with an increasingly crowded anime streaming market.

Title: This ‘Buffett Favorite’ Dividend Is An Incredible CEF Bargain (For Now)

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. When it comes to a closed-end fund (CEF), many investors are always focused on one thing: the dividend. It makes sense: CEFs pay 8.5% yields, on average, according to data from my CEF Insider service. But sometimes it pays to look beyond those big payouts, because by doing so, you could find a CEF with a track record so strong that its total return (dividends and gains combined) beats that of a CEF with a high yield. I don’t know about you, but I’m willing to take more of my return in the form of price gains if it means, say, doubling my money in five years! That’s been the case with the SRH Total Return Fund (STEW), whose dividend—at 3.8%—is pretty, well, meh, for a CEF. As a result, it’s often overlooked, which is what’s happening now. We can see that in the fund’s discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio), which is just under 20% today (more on this shortly). That ridiculous discount is an insult to this proven fund, which has doubled an investor’s money, with dividends reinvested, in the last half-decade. That’s a fantastic return by any measure. It even beat the S&P 500, which is up around 103% since then. The funny thing is, the strategy behind this money-making fund is simple, which is why its bargain valuation is so surprising. Inspired by Warren Buffett, STEW uses a value-investing approach that makes the fund less volatile than the broader market while helping it rise in value over the long haul. Its largest investment is in Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B), which is about 45% of the fund’s assets. Additionally, STEW looks for valuable underpriced stocks, which is why it also holds JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), pipeline operator Enterprise Products Partners (EPD), Microsoft (MSFT) and other high-quality firms with long histories of returning cash to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. This is all good stuff, but now let me show you the best part: that bargain valuation I mentioned a second ago. This is where a big difference between CEFs and ETFs comes in: ETFs can issue shares as necessary, so they don’t trade at discounts (or at least significant ones). But STEW, as a CEF, has a fixed number of shares (hence the “closed” in the term “closed-end fund”). As a result, a CEF’s shares can trade up or down depending on market demand, in addition to their movements on the value of the fund’s assets. That, in turn, means CEFs can sometimes trade well below NAV. And STEW’s discount, as I mentioned a second ago, is truly massive: just under 20%! Note that this markdown was even wider in recent months. In fact, STEW’s discount has slowly grown larger over the last five years despite the fact that the fund beat the market. This inefficiency can’t last, which is why STEW’s discount suddenly shrank in recent weeks. Its discount is likely to shrink further as more investors catch on. All of this might sound familiar if you’ve been reading my articles for a while, because in a March 31, 2025, piece, I pointed out that STEW’s massive (then 23.1%) discount was unlikely to last. It has shrunk a bit since then, and I see it shrinking more. Now, let me wheel back to the dividend part of the picture here. To be sure, that 3.8% payout is, as mentioned, on the small side for a CEF. But it’s also masking something else, besides STEW’s strong total return: dividend growth. That too has been strong, with the payout soaring 62% in the last five years. And lately, STEW’s payout growth has been accelerating: It’s just another reason why with CEFs (or any income investment, really), it pays to look beyond the yield. STEW, with its discount, performance history and growing payout, is a perfect example of that. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

It has shrunk a bit since then, and I see it shrinking more. Now, let me wheel back to the dividend part of the picture here. To be sure, that 3.8% payout is, as mentioned, on the small side for a CEF. But it’s also masking something else, besides STEW’s strong total return: dividend growth. That too has been strong, with the payout soaring 62% in the last five years. And lately, STEW’s payout growth has been accelerating: It’s just another reason why with CEFs (or any income investment, really), it pays to look beyond the yield. STEW, with its discount, performance history and growing payout, is a perfect example of that. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: ‘Take some time to look up’: Perseid meteor shower could be visible from Ireland tonight

One of the most eagerly awaited astronomical events of the year – which promised one or two meteors or “shooting stars” a minute – is set to continue in Irish skies on Wednesday night. Tuesday night saw about 60 meteors an hour darting across the sky and stargazers can expect about half that amount on Wednesday night. “The Perseids will be half as strong tonight as they were last night, so that’s still 10 times more meteors tonight than a normal night, so well worth viewing,” said David Moore from astronomy.ie. “The best time to view is dusk until dawn,” he said. “We had people sending us counts of how many they saw every 15 minutes from 10:30pm last night when it got dark enough to see them. I saw some after 4am when dawn was breaking.” “Dublin gets much the same view as the rest of the country, indeed, all of Europe,” Mr Moore said. “This year the moon is in the sky so even those in the countryside will have moonlit skies so even suburban viewers will get the same view.” Met Éireann has forecast a humid night with clear spells on Wednesday, however a few showers are possible which could be heavy or thundery. Mr Moore advised stargazers to ensure they are comfortable while looking up. “Standing with your neck craned back for hours is not comfortable. “Look anywhere in the sky. If there are clouds look in the clear patches. If totally clear stand with your back to the moon so it does not dazzle you,” he said. “The paths of the meteors will all point back to the constellation Perseus but you do not have to look at Perseus.” The Perseid meteors are caused by dust particles shed by the comet Swift-Tuttle. The comet, which takes 133 years to orbit the sun, was last seen in Irish skies in 1992. At this time of year, Earth moves through this debris cloud, making one of the most celebrated astronomical events and arguably the most predictable. Particles from the debris cloud subsequently burn up on entering Earth’s atmosphere and create flashes of light. The shower is active for several weeks. “It’s such a special time of the year,” said astronomer Danielle Wilcox from Blackrock Castle Observatory, Cork. “It’s a really good meteor shower in particular because it gives us a lot of meteors per hour compared to other meteor showers,” she said. “That’s what’s so exciting about it, especially for people who have never seen ‘shooting stars’, this is your chance to get out there and see that,” she said. “Take some time to look up,” she said.

Sec. Litig. (Genius II), 97 F.4th 1171, 1190 (9th Cir. 2024).

Title: XRP Double-Bottom Breakout Sets Sights On $34, Predicts Analyst

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Gert van Lagen says the macro structure of XRP has finally done the one thing it needed to do: break the neckline of a seven-year base and hold it. “XRP [2W] – Ripple is ready to rip. The 7-year double bottom has broken out at ❌ The neckline was successfully retested at 🔵 ATH cleared — first target near ~$34, at 2.00 fib. extension of double bottom. → Compare with 2014–2017 setup,” the analyst wrote. His chart is drawn on a logarithmic scale with two-week candles, framing the move as a multi-cycle reversal rather than a short-term pop. The geometry is clear on the chart. A broad W-shaped base stretching from the 2018–2024 bear market carved twin lows in the sub-$0.20–$0.30 region, then returned to a horizontal neckline that sits just above the $2 handle. Van Lagen marks an initial breakout attempt with a red cross just over that barrier, followed by a decisive surge and a pullback that tags support around the $2 area, annotated with a blue dot. On a log chart, that textbook breakout-retest sequence is the confirmation step technicians typically look for before projecting targets. Price at the time of the snapshot is labeled $3.19 on the right axis, meaning XRP is trading above the neckline but still below the 2018 all-time high at $3.40. That placement matters because the prior macro cap now acts as support; staying north of roughly $2.00 keeps the double-bottom thesis intact. The measured arrow drawn from the neckline replicates the height of the base on a multiplicative (log) basis, which is why the upside extension leaps into the mid-double digits rather than adding only a few dollars. Van Lagen’s first objective is derived explicitly from Fibonacci proportions. He sets the 2.00 extension of the double-bottom as the initial target, landing “near ~$34.” On his scale the projected path peaks above the $27 and $20 grid lines and briefly tags the mid-$30s before mean-reverting, consistent with how log-scale extensions translate when a long consolidation unwinds quickly. The left side of the graphic provides the historical rhyme he wants readers to notice. Between 2014 and 2017, XRP built a smaller double-bottom within a shaded accumulation zone, broke its neckline, retested it, and then accelerated vertically. Van Lagen marks that sequence with the same red cross at breakout and blue dot at the retest, plus a vertical measuring arrow to illustrate how the earlier base resolved. The current pattern, shaded across 2018–2025, repeats that choreography at a far larger scale. His sketch includes a time-and-price roadmap using twelve forward candles—two-week bars—implying a five- to six-month arc for the entire move if it were to echo the prior cycle. The first projected bar vaults XRP above $11. After three candles, the blue path tops out above $36, roughly six weeks into the run. The fourth candle traces a deep retracement back toward the $11 region, followed by a sharp recovery above $30 on the fifth. The next three candles stabilize around the $30 area before the path draws another slide to ~$11 and the onset of a cooling phase. The sequence is illustrative rather than prescriptive, but it visually anchors the extension math to possible market behavior. Whether XRP can follow the steep path sketched in blue is a separate question from whether the double-bottom has technically activated. Van Lagen’s chart answers the second with a yes: the breakout and retest sequence is complete. The first answer—delivery toward the ~$34 Fib extension—will be determined by how the next several two-week candles will look like. At press time, XRP traded at $3.14.

Title: How deals with Apple and Trump’s Pentagon turned rare earth miner MP Materials into a red-hot stock

Jordan Blum is the Energy editor at Fortune, overseeing coverage of a growing global energy sector for oil and gas, transition businesses, renewables, and critical minerals. California miner MP Materials struck metaphorical gold in July when it announced a landmark deal with the Trump administration to make the Defense Department its largest shareholder, followed up days later by an expansion agreement with Apple. But what MP actually mines—so-called rare earth elements that are central to many of the world’s most important technologies—appears to be even more precious than gold to investors. MP is the nation’s only rare earths miner, at a time when the U.S. aspires to compete against China’s supply-chain dominance in the field. Its share price has spiked an astonishing 365% year to date, including a 150% surge in just over a month. MP’s market cap has risen from just over $2 billion to $13 billion, entering large-cap territory—not bad for a company that brought in just $204 million in revenue last year. It’s a rise comparable to that of Silicon Valley defense firm Palantir—but with all due respect to that AI-fueled company, Palantir’s stock has risen by only 140% year to date. “I give MP credit for having the foresight and for being in the right place at the right time,” Ben Kallo, Baird senior research analyst, told Fortune. “I think it’s surprising because I didn’t believe the government would react in such a quick and forceful way. “I think the fire is in the belly of supply-chain managers to move away from China right now.” MP also is the nation’s only vertically integrated miner and specialty magnets producer, having just opened a metals and neodymium magnets plant in Fort Worth. Not one to miss a marketing opportunity, MP named that plant “Independence.” The powerful magnets are as critically important as they are little-known. They are used in electric vehicles, renewable energy, mobile phones, military equipment, and, most recently, AI data centers. General Motors was MP’s first flagship customer for magnets. From a military standpoint, the magnets are just as crucial: They’re used in drones, fighter jets, missile systems, and nuclear submarines. More than 80% of the world’s neodymium magnet supply is manufactured in China. The U.S. counts a few manufacturers, while China has a few hundred. “Rare earth” materials actually are not rare, but they are expensive to separate and refine. That growth takes financial support. The Defense Department bought $400 million worth of MP shares in July to become a 15% shareholder; on Aug. 10, it backed up its initial deal with an additional $150 million loan to MP to help expand its mining operations in Mountain Pass, Calif. “We are taking decisive action to restore our domestic critical minerals supply chain, revive our industrial base, and rebuild our military to achieve President Trump’s goal of peace through strength,” said Emil Michael, defense undersecretary for research and engineering, in a statement. Michael is a former top executive at Uber. Even apart from the military, both MP and the administration see the company growing because of the AI boom. “We have the platform, the partners, and the perspective to seize another enormous runway of opportunity,” said MP founder, chairman, and CEO James Litinsky on the company’s Aug. 7 earnings call. “And it does not hurt that we have a front-row seat and an important role in what may well become the most significant business transformation of our generation, the era of physical AI.” MP is built on the ashes of the former mine owner Molycorp and its Mountain Pass facilities. A decade ago, Molycorp was failing because of heavy indebtedness and China’s price dumping into the global rare earths markets. Seeing the thesis case for domestic rare earths mining, Litinsky and his eponymously named JHL Capital Group hedge fund bought into Molycorp’s bonds during its 2015 bankruptcy proceedings. Litinsky eventually folded his fund to buy the Mountain Pass assets outright and form MP Materials in 2017. Litinsky had previously worked at the New York–based Fortress Investment Group, and MP Materials went public in 2020 when it merged with one of Fortress’s several special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, in a $1.47 billion deal. “One of the biggest question marks and pushback was, ‘How can these finance guys operate a mine and make it work?’” Kallo said. But MP cleaned up its mining operations, kept debt low, and focused on vertical integration and growth. “They’ve surprised to the upside.” The Independence plant opened in January, and MP was looking at a smoother growth trajectory. But in the spring, the onslaught of Trump’s tariff war shook things up, and companies began to realize they shouldn’t rely on Chinese supply chains so heavily. “A lot of companies didn’t realize their magnets came from China,” Kallo said. “It woke a lot of people up. These magnets go into everything.” This is when the Wall Street–ization of the Defense Department under the second Trump administration came into play. Steve Feinberg, the new U.S. deputy secretary of defense, is the billionaire cofounder of Cerberus Capital Management. Feinberg spearheaded the unusual, landmark deal with Litinsky. It not only made the Pentagon a 15% shareholder, it included the pledge of a multibillion-dollar total investment as MP aims to expand its magnet production capacity 10-fold. That expansion is expected to be completed in 2028. The deal also puts a floor on pricing for MP’s rare earth materials for 10 years, helping offset the possibility of foreign price dumping. A Defense Department spokesperson told Fortune: “Rebuilding the critical minerals and rare earth magnet sectors of the U.S. industrial base won’t happen overnight, but DOD is taking immediate action to streamline processes and identify opportunities to strengthen critical minerals production.” Four days after the Pentagon deal announcement, on July 15, MP announced a $500 million partnership with Apple to supply rare earth magnets that are fully manufactured from recycled materials, a pledge that would entail recycling expansions at both the Mountain Pass and Fort Worth facilities. MP and Apple had piloted advanced recycling technologies for five years before announcing the deal. “American innovation drives everything we do at Apple, and we’re proud to deepen our investment in the U.S. economy,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook in a statement. “Rare earth materials are essential for making advanced technology, and this partnership will help strengthen the supply of these vital materials here in the United States.” MP used to ship more of its raw materials to China because of a lack of U.S. refining capacity. One potential stumbling block for MP was its smaller ownership stake still held by China’s Shenghe Resources, which had helped Litinsky buy out Molycorp in 2017. But the larger U.S. government ownership position combined with the new pricing floor and Chinese tariffs on U.S. exports has allowed MP to cease its exports to China as of April. “We are maniacally focused on investing and executing in the United States of America,” Litinsky said on his earnings call. He emphasized, “Through years of relentless execution, this team has transformed a bankrupted and abandoned mine site into a vertically integrated American national champion with a strategic and economic platform that matters.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Bullish Cryptocurrency Exchange Expands IPO Plans To $5 Billion

Peter Thiel-backed cryptocurrency exchange Bullish has announced a significant increase in the size of its initial public offering (IPO), aiming to raise approximately $990 million. According to a recent filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company plans to offer 30 million shares priced between $32 and $33 each, targeting a market valuation of around $4.8 billion. This marks a notable shift from its earlier proposal, which included the sale of 20.3 million shares at a lower price range of $28 to $31, with a valuation goal of $4.2 billion. Led by former New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) president Tom Farley, Bullish has granted its underwriters—comprising JPMorgan, Jefferies, and Citigroup—a 30-day option to sell an additional 4.5 million shares. Once the new offering is completed, the crypto exchange’s stock will be traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “BLSH.” In a show of confidence, major investment firms such as the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, and Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management, have expressed interest in acquiring up to $200 million worth of BLSH shares. This interest reflects a broader trend of renewed investor enthusiasm and regulatory support for the cryptocurrency sector under President Donald Trump’s new administration, as evidenced by recent successful market entries, including the notable debut of stablecoin issuer Circle (CRLC). The Bullish crypto exchange founded in the “year of the bull,” 2021, has also outlined plans to convert a significant portion of the initial public offering proceeds into stablecoins, collaborating with one or more dollar-pegged cryptocurrency issuers to facilitate this transition. This decision follows the recent signing of the GENIUS Act into law by President Donald Trump. The country’s first crypto bill establishes a new framework for stablecoins to thrive and integrate into the traditional finance sector. Despite its ambitious plans and the positive market climate, Bullish reported a loss of $349 million for the quarter ending March 31, a stark contrast to the $105 million profit it recorded during the same period last year. As Bullish prepares for its IPO, it joins a wave of crypto firms entering public markets, including Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital, which recently uplisted to Nasdaq, and eToro, which has opened trading to the public. Additionally, crypto custody startup BitGo and the Winklevoss-run Gemini crypto exchange have both confidentially filed for US listings, signaling a renewed interest in cryptocurrency investments under a more favorable regulatory environment in the US. Amid these developments, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization hit a new record high of $4 trillion on Monday, with Bitcoin (BTC) once again surpassing the $120,000 threshold. However, despite Monday’s early momentum, the total market cap has since retraced and stabilized at around $3.93 trillion.

Title: Tesla’s Stock's Next Surge: 4 Catalysts To Watch
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/08/12/teslas-stocks-next-surge-4-catalysts-to-watch/
Time Published: 2025-08-12T09:00:00Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Tesla stock (NASDAQ:TSLA) has encountered a challenging year in 2025, marked by political conflicts, declining sales, and increasing competition. Nonetheless, it might not be entirely bleak for Tesla, as a series of new catalysts could be rejuvenating the stock’s long-term bullish outlook. With opportunities presented by AI and a favorable cost structure in a changing tariff environment, Tesla is regaining the attention of investors, and its shares have appreciated nearly 6% in the last five trading days. While valuations remain high at approximately 195x forward earnings, the narrative might be shifting in favor of Tesla. Here’s a brief overview of the positive factors fostering optimism in the stock. Elon Musk’s significant and very visible discord with President Donald Trump, following a brief political alliance during the 2024 campaign and initial months of the Trump presidency, created uncertainty regarding Tesla’s regulatory outlook. However, public sentiment seems to be changing. Recently, Trump has softened his rhetoric, stating, “I desire for Elon’s business to thrive,” and has generally been more lenient towards his friend-turned-adversary. While there are still policy risks, a more amicable relationship could alleviate a major burden. In addition, Elon Musk is back in charge at Tesla after a temporary stay in Washington, now fully concentrating on Tesla’s mission – enhancing EV production, launching robotaxis, and envisioning AI-powered robotics. Tesla has recently communicated to its shareholders a new compensation agreement for Musk, which includes 96 million restricted shares valued potentially at nearly $30 billion, contingent on ambitious performance targets. This indicates that Musk is directly motivated to provide substantial returns for shareholders. However, investing in a single stock carries considerable risk. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio is intended to mitigate stock-specific risk while still offering upside potential. AI computing has been the most significant trend in the technology sector over the past three years, driving valuations to unmatched levels. Nvidia is now valued at nearly $4.5 trillion and Broadcom around $1.5 trillion, primarily due to the demand for AI computing infrastructure. Just as AI computing became the foundational component for the digital AI explosion, “physical AI” might emerge as the next significant opportunity. We believe that the markets could be beginning to perceive Tesla as a type of proxy for physical AI. The company uniquely integrates cutting-edge software, advanced hardware, and extensive manufacturing know-how – three essential elements for leading this budding sector. Tesla’s extensive experience in autonomous driving has provided it with a substantial advantage in AI software, its robotics proficiency is deeply ingrained in its highly automated factories, and its vertical integration ensures oversight from chip design to final assembly. Besides self-driving vehicles, Optimus, Tesla’s humanoid robot designed to carry out repetitive, hazardous, or mundane tasks in factories, warehouses, and homes, could represent a significant revenue stream for Tesla. The goal for Tesla is to mass-produce millions of units annually by 2030 at a price point below $20,000, thus opening a new market with immense potential. Unlike many small robotics startups, Tesla possesses the financial resources, engineering expertise, and manufacturing capacity to transition from prototype to mass production. Check the analysis on How Tesla stock soars to $1500 While Tesla’s deliveries declined by 13.5% to 384,122 vehicles in Q2, investors seem to be overlooking this drop. Recent regulatory alterations under the Trump Administration, which are generally viewed as detrimental for the automotive industry, might actually benefit Tesla. A 25% tariff on all imported passenger vehicles and light trucks was implemented in April 2025, followed by tariffs on specific imported auto components in May. Tesla could emerge as a net winner, building all U.S. vehicles in California and Texas, thereby avoiding these tariffs, while competitors such as GM and Ford manufacture some EVs in Mexico and may incur higher costs. As these tariffs ripple through the supply chain, Tesla’s price competitiveness could enhance, aiding it in defending and expanding its U.S. market share. Furthermore, although the federal electric vehicle mandate has been eliminated, Tesla’s standing as one of the lowest-cost EV manufacturers remains solid, giving it an edge over other competitors who may have leaned more heavily to compensate for a higher cost structure. The company’s prudent management of fixed costs, including R&D and SG&A, has allowed it to maintain profitability even in tough market conditions. Also see: Will Slowing Cloud Business drag Amazon stock to $100? One of the most exciting prospects for Tesla could be its robotaxi service. Admittedly, Tesla will need to catch up to Google's Waymo, which has been providing autonomous rides in several cities for nearly five years. Nevertheless, Tesla has several advantages. The company manages the entire process: it manufactures the EVs, develops the software, and runs the charging infrastructure. Additionally, it has a large fleet of vehicles already on the road that can be integrated into its robotaxi service. In contrast, Waymo's vehicles are significantly more expensive, with modifications necessary for self-driving estimated to cost as much as $100,000. This gives Tesla a considerable advantage. Tesla has now secured a ride-share license in Texas, paving the way for its autonomous robotaxi service to function under the state’s new self-driving laws alongside established competitors like Uber and Lyft. The ride-hailing market is already substantial. Uber managed over 230 million rides weekly in Q4 2024 alone. At approximately $30 per ride, this equates to a $375 billion annual revenue pool, and that’s just for human-driven rides. Autonomous rides could potentially yield even more – possibly reaching $750 billion annually. This represents a significant revenue opportunity for Tesla. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which consists of 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably outperforming its benchmark, which includes all three – S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. What is the reason for this? As a collective, the HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; a much more stable experience, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Tonight, tomorrow best times to see Perseid meteor shower
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2025/0812/1528037-perseid-meteor-shower/

The Perseid meteor shower will reach its peak tonight and tomorrow, making it the best time for stargazers to view the celestial fireworks. The event is associated with the dusty debris left by Comet Swift-Tuttle, which orbits the sun once every 133 years. The meteoroids from the comet, mostly no bigger than a grain of sand, burn up as they hit the Earth's atmosphere at 36 miles per second, to produce a shooting stream of light in the sky. Peak temperatures can reach anywhere from 1,648C to 5,537C as they hit the atmosphere. The meteors are called Perseids because they seem to dart out of the constellation Perseus. Speaking on RTÉ's Morning Ireland, Resident Astronomer at Blackrock Observatory in Cork Danielle Wilcox said the best time to view the spectacle is after sunset and before the moon rise as it will be the darkest time. Ms Wilcox said there are around 12 meteor showers every year but Perseid has the most and brightest meteors. "These are very predictable, they happen every year at the same time," she said. "What is happening is we have comets that come from the outer solar system and they come in from the sun and they come near the sun and start to break up. "So you have all this debris that comes from the comet, so you will have ice, rock and different things that are coming from the comet. "And it leaves this cloud and it is in the same spot in space, so as we are going around the sun, Earth slams into this cloud and passes through all this debris in August every year," Ms Wilcox said. She said if anyone misses meteor shower tonight or tomorrow, not to worry as it continues for the next week. © RTÉ 2025.

Title: OpenAI and SpaceX are making it big without an IPO. That's bad news for young investors.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-z-investors-generation-defining-moment-private-markets-openai-2025-8
Time Published: 2025-08-12T08:15:02Z
Full Content:
Ed Elson, a 26-year-old research analyst and co-host of the Prof G Markets podcast, has heard plenty of stories about generations before him getting rich on stocks. His own co-host, New York University business school professor and entrepreneur Scott Galloway, who's 60, invested $800,000 in both Apple and Amazon back in 2009. Today, those investments total $40 million, a cornerstone of his $150 million net worth. Elson wants the same opportunity to invest in the tech companies defining his generation. He sees those chances in OpenAI and SpaceX, standout innovators that have soared to valuations of $300 billion or more. The problem? Both companies are private. OpenAI and SpaceX top a growing class of companies making it big without the public markets. Rather than expose themselves to public market scrutiny and quarterly earnings pressures, these companies are raising round after round of fresh funds from venture capital firms. Over the last 10 years, global startup funding has more than tripled, with VC investments projected to hit $400 billion this year, according to data from PitchBook. "The people who have access to the highest quality companies that are creating the most amount of value, i.e., OpenAI and SpaceX, are the people in VC who are already rich," Elson said. "That's a big problem for our generation." Seduced by fabulous success stories like Galloway's, and empowered by the proliferation of digital trading platforms plus the investing advice on platforms like TikTok, Zoomers have become a generation of investors. The average Gen Z investor starts trading at 19 years old, compared to baby boomers' typical kickoff at 35 years old. But there's also a gnawing sense that Gen Z missed out on the boom times. And they're not entirely wrong. The public markets now offer fewer stocks to choose from and higher price tags. Companies are waiting 14 years on average to go public, Jay Ritter, a professor of finance at the University of Florida's Warrington School of Business, has found. More private companies are valued in the tens and even hundreds of billions, a feat usually reserved for public companies. In 2025, an IPO is less a promise of what's to come for a company and more a signal that you've already missed out on its biggest gains. That shift has more investors setting their sights on secondary markets, where stock purchases of private companies are limited to traders accredited by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. And whereas the public markets are open to anyone with a brokerage account, just 13% of Americans qualify for that accreditation. "It almost feels like a private members-only club," says Vivian Tu, the 31-year-old personal finance educator behind 'Your Rich BFF.' "If you're already rich, you can invest in this stuff, and if you're not, sucks to suck. You're locked out of the club." Those rules aren't sitting well with Gen Z investors. Warren Buffett famously advised traders to invest in what they know. That's what Galloway did back in 2009 when he bought shares in Apple. The iPhone was still relatively new, but it was clear the technology was a game changer. He could get in relatively early and profit from the stock's exponential rise as Apple built on the momentum of its spectacular innovation. These days, some of the most exciting tech companies innovate without needing to IPO. Elson points to OpenAI's release of ChatGPT in 2022, which drew 1 million users in 5 days. "If we were living in the 1980s, there's a very, very high likelihood that OpenAI would've been public at that point," Elson says. Investors would have said: "Oh my God, this is an incredible tool. I want to buy some stock." But most investors were frozen out. In March, OpenAI was valued at $300 billion — a 900% spike in two years. The major beneficiaries included Microsoft, VC megafirm Sequoia Capital, and tech billionaire Peter Thiel. The critique that the public markets don't create enough value for mom and pop investors is virtually as old as public markets themselves. But the markets hit an inflection point in 2021 when a record 1,035 IPOs, raising a staggering $286 billion, were followed by an abrupt collapse. Investors, desperate for liquidity, began turning more to secondary markets to sell portions of their stakes. If companies can raise plenty of capital while keeping their investors happy, that has increasingly allowed them to put off their IPOs indefinitely. "It's pretty simple: Why go public if you have access to all the benefits while staying private?" says Deedy Das, a principal at Menlo Ventures. Das sums up the thinking of top-dollar startups this way: "I have all this administrative burden off my shoulders; I don't have to have that predictable revenue; I can take riskier bets; I don't have to explain to retail investors what my vision is. I can just run my business." With so much pent-up demand, it's been extraordinarily expensive for retail investors to get in when a hot company finally goes public. Take Figma, the design software maker, and its recent red-hot IPO. When it debuted in July, Figma's stock opened at $85 a share, more than double its $33-a-share IPO price. Since the overwhelming majority of IPO shares were allocated to institutional investors and not retail investors — which is typical for public listings — most retail investors paid a significant premium. At the end of the day, the frenzy had sent Figma's valuation soaring to more than 60 times its revenue in the biggest first-day jump for a multibillion-dollar tech company in decades. By the first week of August, however, Figma had shed billions of dollars in market value as the stock came back down to earth, leaving many of those same retail investors holding the bag. As of August 11, Figma's stock was valued less than its opening day price, meaning any retail investor who backed the company on its first day of trading has since lost money. Institutions that bought in at the IPO price, on the other hand, are holding stock that's still worth more than double what they paid for it. Of course, there are still plenty of public companies creating massive wealth for shareholders. Palantir's stock has surged over 1,800% since it began trading in 2020. Circle's shares have jumped 140% above their opening price in the crypto company's June IPO, though the stock has fluctuated wildly in that period. The public markets are still broadly considered the best place for companies to get returns to their employees and investors, since their liquid nature allows shareholders to cash out anytime. But the biggest stock gains will always be reserved for the savvy investor who spots a big opportunity early. And increasingly, these opportunities are not in the public markets. Lots of investors — including Zoomers like Elson — want in on the action happening on secondary markets. "Because of this dynamic where great companies have no incentive to go public, giving access to retail is heavily in our generation's financial interest," Elson said. While this might present bigger opportunities, it also carries significant risks. It's galling to retail investors that there's so much private company stock floating around — but they can't get to it. Getting your hands on private stocks generally means buying them from early investors that hold large chunks of equity or from early employees, who got stock as part of their compensation agreements. These so-called secondary sales generally must be approved by, if not facilitated by, the startup itself. And not a lot of companies, OpenAI included, are inclined to allow their employees or investors to sell shares on secondary platforms. In an attempt to democratize access to private company equity, platforms like EquityZen, Forge Global and Hiive, which broker secondary investments into pre-IPO companies, are picking up steam. UBS projects the secondary market will hit a record-breaking $180 billion this year, up from $156 billion in secondary transactions in 2024. EquityZen, which launched in 2013, says its user base has doubled in the past year; more than 770,000 individual investors and institutions are now registered on the marketplace. The company says it has brokered secondary sales for companies like Circle and Omada Health before their IPOs, as well as other startups that still haven't gone public, like Impossible Foods. The company wouldn't comment on whether it's facilitated any deals with OpenAI or SpaceX. These deals tend to be costlier than regular trading. Most secondary market platforms charge fees, often 5% of the sale, and require investors to put up anywhere from $5,000 to $100,000 or more to participate. The bigger catch is that not just anyone can access these platforms. On most major secondary platforms, investors must meet the SEC's stringent bar for accreditation: a net worth of over $1 million, excluding their primary residence, or a salary of at least $200,000 for the past two years and the expectation of earning that same income again. The SEC says the rule was set up to protect retail investors, who tend to underperform the broader market with their stock picks. These investors are generally advised to back index funds over individual stocks to minimize the chance of catastrophic losses. The private markets are even more risky since, without disclosure requirements, private deals can obscure key details about a startup's operations and pricing. But the requirement has been criticized by some as paternalistic, particularly amid surging activity on the private markets. After all, Americans can engage in plenty of high-risk activities with their money, from gambling to cryptocurrency investing to prediction market betting, with little to no regulation. "In a world in which anyone can invest in any meme coin they want, how reasonable is it that you're not allowed to invest in startups?" said Peter Walker, head of insights at Carta, a software platform that helps private companies manage their cap tables. In June, the US House of Representatives passed the Equal Opportunity for All Investors Act, which would allow investors who passed a financial literacy test to qualify for accreditation, paving the way for them to make private market bets. The Senate isn't yet scheduled to review the bill, however, and President Donald Trump has not said if he would support it. In a burgeoning market with minimal oversight, the stakes are high. Linqto, once a prominent marketplace for pre-IPO shares, declared bankruptcy in July. The SEC is currently investigating claims that the platform sold securities to non-accredited investors and charged its users excessive margins. The company told BI it had also discovered "serious defects" in the business "that raise questions about what customers actually own." It's unclear whether the thousands of investors who locked their cash away in Linqto will ever see that money again. Linqto said it's working with an unsecured creditors committee in its bankruptcy proceedings to develop a plan to reorganize the company and "maximize value for customers." As for getting a piece of OpenAI or SpaceX, a few financial firms are creating workarounds. In one example, exchange-traded funds like the ERShares Private-Public Crossover ETF can buy stakes in top private companies, and retail traders can buy those ETFs on the public markets. In December, the fund announced that SpaceX had become its top holding. But without regular public disclosures of SpaceX's finances, investors can only guess at the company's real-time value. In Europe, where SEC regulations don't apply, the stock trading app Robinhood has sold blockchain "tokens" of OpenAI and SpaceX stock. The tokens attempt to mirror the price of stocks without actually giving retail traders any stake in the company. Last month, OpenAI posted a statement on X saying the company had not partnered with Robinhood and that the tokens "are not OpenAI equity." Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev explained the app's approach in an interview with Bloomberg last month. "One of the biggest opportunities and also a big tragedy is that private markets are where the bulk of the interesting appreciation and exposure is nowadays," he said. "It's a shame that it's so difficult to get exposure in the US. We're obviously working to solve that." Matt Kennedy, a senior strategist at the IPO-focused firm Renaissance Capital, says it's perfectly understandable that the market's slowdown may be frustrating to new investors. Back in 2021, new subscribers to the firm's newsletter asked one question more than any other: How can I invest in pre-IPO companies? "There's this sense that, at the IPO, it's already too late. They want to get in on the ground floor," Kennedy said. But the firm advises investors to "be careful what you wish for." "Yes, you're not going to get that $20-million-in-annual-sales, fast-growing tech company that could be a behemoth," Kennedy said. "But you're also not going to get those less established companies without a solid track record. There's more margin of safety with a company that has $100 million or more in revenue." Barry Ritholtz, the founder of Ritholtz Wealth Management, echoed that sentiment. "A private company like OpenAI comes along, and suddenly people are salivating and getting FOMO and saying, I could pick the next one," Ritholtz said. "History tells us, the odds are you cannot." Many young investors see those risks as worth taking — if not for the potential financial upside, then for the crash course in market literacy. Juliette Richert, a senior associate at The Artemis Fund, has made three angel investments since joining the fund three years ago. Richert, who's now 26, says she hasn't seen any returns yet. Even if she never does, she thinks those bets were valuable opportunities for her early investment learnings. "Can I burn the money for the sake of learning something rather than anticipating any specific return?" she said. "For early investors like myself, I think that's a really healthy way to go about it." It's the Gen Z way. Rather than follow well-trodden paths of previous generations, Gen Z investors are determined to pounce on opportunities where they find them and seize their financial destinies. "There's this desire for control and autonomy, the 'American dynamism' mindset: make your own way, versus depending on the system," Richert said. Throw in prediction markets, fractional real estate, and collectibles from sports cards to sneakers, and it's clear that Gen Z isn't just investing differently — they're redefining what "investing" even means. "Young people are smart," Galloway said in conversation with Elson on a recent episode of their podcast. "They said, you know what, fuck this. I can't buy a home. Stocks are crazy expensive. So what am I going to do? I'm going to create my own asset classes. And I'm going to create my own volatility."

Share this article US-listed spot Ethereum ETFs listed in the US pulled in more than $1 billion in net inflows on Monday, their highest daily total since debut, according to data tracked by Farside Investors. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) and Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) also posted their largest single-day inflows, drawing about $640 million and $277 million, respectively. Except for Invesco’s fund, all other Ether ETFs posted positive results. BlackRock has maintained its top position, with assets under management exceeding $13 billion as of August 11. Monday’s gains pushed Ethereum funds into a five-day winning streak. Their longest winning streak on record took place between July 3 and July 31. The strong performance came as ETH hovered around $4,300, its highest level since December 2021. The digital asset is now around 12% away from its all-time high of $4,868 set in November 2021 during the bull run market, TradingView data shows. Ethereum’s price surge comes amid aggressive accumulations from publicly traded companies, such as Tom Lee’s BitMine and SharpLink Gaming. Furthermore, on Monday, Fundamental Global, soon to be renamed FG Nexus, which recently filed a $5 billion shelf registration with the SEC to expand its Ethereum accumulation strategy, announced it had acquired 47,331 ETH as part of its ambition to take a 10% stake in the network.

Title: China and the U.S. clash at the U.N. over the Panama Canal

By The Associated Press A cargo ship navigates through the Panama Canal, seen from the Cerro Ancon in Panama City. Matias Delacroix/AP hide caption UNITED NATIONS — The United States and China clashed over the Panama Canal at the United Nations on Monday, with the U.S. warning that Beijing's influence over the key waterway could threaten global trade and security and China calling U.S. accusations a pretext to take over the canal. The clash took place at a U.N. Security Council meeting where Panama's President José Raúl Mulino stressed the neutrality of the canal and his country's ownership of the waterway linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Panama holds the council presidency this month, and Mulino was chairing a meeting on challenges to maritime security. Interpol Secretary General Valdecy Urquiza told members these include piracy, armed robbery, transnational crime and cyber criminals weaponizing artificial intelligence to attack ports where there is "minimal cyber security, maximum exposure." U.S. President Donald Trump thrust Panama into the spotlight even before winning election last November by suggesting that his country should consider retaking control of the Panama Canal and accusing Panama of ceding influence to China. The U.S. built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Control of the waterway transferred to Panama in 1999 under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. China's U.N. Ambassador Fu Cong emphasized to the council that "Panama has consistently and effectively managed the canal, making significant contributions to global shipping and trade." "China has always respected the permanent neutrality of the canal and firmly supports Panama in safeguarding its sovereignty over the canal to ensure its openness and smooth operation," he said. Acting U.S. Ambassador Dorothy Shea, who spoke afterward, went after China, expressing concern about its "outsized influence over the Panama Canal area, especially over critical infrastructure and port operations." Alluding to its claims in the South China Sea, she said, "China's expansive and unlawful maritime claims and aggressive actions demonstrate its threat to maritime security and commerce." She said the U.S. rejects these claims and supports countries opposing them. "China's influence in the canal area is not just a risk to Panama and the United States, but rather a potential threat to global trade and security," Shea said. The Trump administration has pressured China to have the Hong Kong-based operator of ports at either end of the canal sell those interests to a U.S. consortium that includes BlackRock Inc. Panama has vehemently rejected a takeover of the canal, but in April, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth visited Panama and agreed with Mulino to step up security coordination. The agreement also gives U.S. troops access to strategic air and naval facilities in the Central American nation, which sparked large protests in Panama's capital. China's Fu asked for the floor to respond to Shea's accusations after all council members spoke, this time lashing out at the Trump administration. "The United States' fabrication of lies and groundless attacks against China are nothing but a pretext for seeking control of the canal," he said. The Chinese envoy called the U.S. and its deployment of offensive weapons in the South China Sea area "the biggest disrupter of peace and stability" in the region, and he accused the administration of exacerbating risks to global maritime security. "China firmly opposes economic coercion and bullying practices and urges the United States to stop fabricating rumors, lies and creating trouble," Fu said. Murillo then responded, saying he wanted to stress Panama's sovereignty "in terms of the ownership of the canal" and the multilateral treaty governing its administration. He called the canal's neutrality "the only and the best defense" to any specific or global threats. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor

Title: Price And Promo; Reddit Ditches The Wayback Machine

Beverage brand AriZona Iced Tea requires essentially zero advertising. A can has cost 99 cents for 30 years. Price and promotions are intrinsically related.

Title: Ad Tech Briefing: Can The Trade Desk turn walled gardens’ retreat into open web gains?

Hear from execs at The New York Times, Thomson Reuters, Trusted Media Brands and many others This Ad Tech Briefing covers the latest in ad tech and platforms for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Tuesday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → If you’re reading this, you’ll likely have seen at least some of the latest financial results posted by the ad tech sector’s coterie of publicly listed companies, with AppLovin and The Trade Desk leading the pack in earnings (see below). Both companies, talismans of independent ad tech, saw their stock prices dip in early hours after issuing Q2 earnings — despite reporting a 77% and 19% annual increase in revenues, respectively.In The Trade Desk’s case, this included an immediate 30% plunge. The declines were tied to “the narrative,” with analysts deeming guidance remarks underwhelming. AppLovin retained its lead as top earner, with The Trade Desk, now in the S&P 500, nearing $700 million in revenue for the period. Indies eye gains from Google’s troubles and walled garden retreat A common thread across several earnings was the potential to benefit from Google’s mounting legal troubles with the Justice Department. The week began with news that OpenX is seeking compensation for Google’s anticompetitive actions as part of an ongoing ad tech antitrust case. Meanwhile, Magnite leadership expressed similar concerns during their Q2 earnings call (see above). In a Q&A after The Trade Desk’s August 7 earnings call, CEO Jeff Green said these trials are creating opportunity for independent ad tech as marketers grow wary of Google and other Big Tech platforms. Green noted “the supply-side demand imbalance” favoring “the open internet” over walled gardens like Amazon, Google, and Meta. “Consumers spend more of their time in the premium open internet than they do inside of walled gardens,” he said, adding that walled gardens have an inherent conflict of interest. “I believe TTD and the open internet have a bigger TAM than Facebook has… Our goal is to buy the entire open Internet objectively for buyers.” He also claimed, “As Google and Facebook have largely abandoned the open internet, The Trade Desk is the largest source of third-party demand for many publishers around the world.” Profit trumps transparency in adland and finance While investors punished perceived weak growth forecasts, they appeared forgiving of structural flaws in the ecosystem. Several high-profile criticisms of the cohort barely registered in analyst questioning across calls. The last 12 months have been turbulent for the sector, with short-sellers targeting multiple companies, including AppLovin and Zeta Global, causing stock price volatility. Yet Q2 results suggest advertisers largely ignored these claims. In Q1, AppLovin’s stock fell 20% after Muddy Waters alleged unethical data use, prompting a rare off-calendar defense from leadership. In Q2 disclosures, executives emphasized plans to drive advertiser growth via AI and greater adoption of its self-serve platform, reducing reliance on sales or product teams. It also aims to expand internationally so its customer base is evenly split between the U.S. and global markets. With a Q4 rollout, AppLovin is targeting SMBs, expanding beyond in-app into broader web and e-commerce. CEO Adam Foroughi said testing has brought in hundreds of advertisers, “The new type of platform that comes to our platform is extremely incremental to our business… We expect that will increase the advertiser count quite quickly, and also allow us to go through live examples of advertisers coming in self-service [and then] all the way to scale on our product.” Despite revenues of $1.2 billion, up 77% year-over-year and beating expectations, AppLovin’s stock still fell 7% after the announcement — a sign of investors’ counterintuitive moves. Earlier in the week, Zeta Global, which faced short-seller reports late last year, posted similarly strong results. Earnings rose 35% year-over-year to exceed $300 million, signaling client confidence despite prior allegations. Analysts focused more on Zeta’s competitive positioning, particularly with agencies under pressure to develop high-margin software tools. Also under scrutiny in 2025 have been ad measurement and brand safety giants DoubleVerify and Integral Ad Science. Both reported Q2 growth: DoubleVerify at $198 million, up 21% year-over-year, and IAS at $149.2 million, up 16%. These gains came despite reports highlighting brand safety shortcomings. In March, Adalytics alleged DoubleVerify and IAS failed to block ads to declared bots despite advertisers paying for pre-bid bot filtration, and routinely allowed general invalid traffic, implying advertisers were misled about protection levels. This followed an earlier report claiming both allowed ads on sites with child abuse content, triggering a class-action suit against DoubleVerify. The company has responded with its own defamation case against Adalytics. Despite the controversy, revenue momentum and advertiser contracts appear to be sustaining both companies. On DoubleVerify’s August 5 call, leadership highlighted rising activity in social and CTV — up 14% and 45% annually, respectively — while fielding questions about relevance as the open web wanes. CEO Mark Zargorski, discussing AI’s rise, said, “So many of the AI solutions don’t include a lot of transparency on what’s going on… That’s part of our role, to drive transparency and open up that black box a bit.” He added that value remains strong among customers on Meta and other platforms using AI tools “without a lot of transparency or clarity on how we’re getting there.” LiveRamp also posted results for the quarter ending June 30 — “Q1 2026” in its reporting. Revenue rose 11% year-over-year to $195 million. Guidance for the next quarter was $197 million, with a full-year forecast of up to $818 million. “Google went from organizing the world’s information to stealing it, taking a sledgehammer to the implied contract the open web has relied on for so long.” –Odysseas Papadimitriou, WalletHub CEO, in a blog post explaining how his company has removed 40,000 pages of its financial content from the reach of Google and other AI search engines. Instead, this content will now be exclusively available to logged-in WalletHub users. Future of TV Briefing: 5 reasons CTV’s ROI comes up short for advertisers Despite the hype, CTV is still not the miracle media channel for advertisers. The reason? It’s still impossible to justify the costs, according to UM Worldwide chief investment officer Marcy Greenberger. ‘You can nullify the effects of what looks like change’: OpenX CEO John Gentry on its legal quarrel with Google After filing legal papers citing Google’s alleged misdeeds to subvert and dominate the online display ad ecosystem, notably in the Eastern District of Virginia, the same jurisdiction where the biggest company in advertising is doing battle with the Justice Department, seeking damages, and adding to calls for a structural remedy. Omnicom’s Samardzija To Join Stagwell In The Fall After Digiday first covered news of a pending leadership shakeup at Omnicom Media Group, with the pending exit of Annalect CEO Slavi Samardzija, it has subsequently been announced that he will join independent media agency Stagwell, with precise details of his role yet to be confirmed. The State of Digital, 2025, by LUMA Partners The macroeconomic environment improved throughout 2024, but uncertainty over the tariff policies to be enacted by the current U.S. administration caused market instability. Despite this, digital ad spend has rebounded, and AI is now considered a fundamental requirement for marketers, with the amount of mergers and acquisitions in the space experiencing a notable uptick in the opening quarter of 2025. More Like No Yield: A New Book Explores How Google Soaked Up The Web’s Ad Profits AdExchanger’s James Hercher sums up Ari Paparo’s book, “Yield: how Google bought, built and bullied its way to advertising dominance.” It features a host of familiar names such as Stephanie Layser, Jana Meron, Brian O’Kelley, Michael Barrett, Michael Rubenstein and many other industry leaders play prominent roles, all of whom help chronicle how Google ingested DoubleClick, and later went on to cross almost every tier of the market with a series of rollouts such as Project Poirot, Project Bell, Project Bernanke, Project Jedi Blue, Project Liberty, Project Wolf and Project Centillion.

Contributors to the latest Series A round include Greycroft and Bessemer Partners, along with S4S Ventures, Aperiam Ventures, plus LiveRamp’s investment arm. The adoption of AI tools like agentic offerings and smarts in new hires to power more of media agency workings continues to pick up pace. The Amazon threat to The Trade Desk is inevitable — just not immediate. The marketing services group has enjoyed an under-the-radar success story in recent years.

Title: All-Time High For Crypto Market: Ethereum Leads The Charge Above $4,000
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/all-time-high-for-crypto-market-ethereum-leads-the-charge-above-4000/

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. On Monday, the total crypto market capitalization (TOTAL) reached an all-time high (ATH) of $4.03 trillion, driven by significant gains in leading cryptocurrencies Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), reflecting renewed optimism in the crypto space fueled by favorable regulatory developments from the US. Ethereum notably broke through the $4,000 barrier for the first time in almost nine months, closing the gap to its all-time high of $4,878, now just 13% away. This upward momentum has been attributed to growing interest in cryptocurrencies, bolstered by pro-crypto regulatory measures that have enhanced market sentiment. Notably, the US has spearheaded a new wave of pro-crypto regulations, sparking a surge in investment in the digital asset market with the passage and signing of the first crypto bill, the GENIUS Act. This new legislation aims to create a more favorable regulatory framework for stablecoins, which are dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies. Ethereum plays a key role in the stablecoin market, as a large portion of stablecoin activity occurs on its blockchain. In contrast, Bitcoin approached its current record high of $123,000 earlier in the day but ultimately fell short of the critical $120,000 mark, which is seen as essential for entering a new price discovery phase. Despite this, the overall market sentiment remains buoyant, particularly in light of recent executive orders from President Donald Trump aimed at fostering a more favorable environment for digital assets. On Thursday, Trump issued directives calling for a reevaluation of federal guidance on integrating cryptocurrencies into employer-sponsored retirement plans like 401(k)s. Analysts view this shift as a potential boom for the crypto industry, especially considering that 401(k) assets totaled $8.7 trillion in the first quarter of 2025, according to the Investment Company Institute. As such, Ethereum has outperformed many of its peers among the top ten cryptocurrencies, posting gains of just over 13% in the past week. The only token to surpass this growth has been Cronos (CRO), which saw an 18% rally during the same period. Crypto analyst Doctor Profit has weighed in on Ethereum’s performance, suggesting that breaking the $4,000 barrier signals a massive breakout from an ascending triangle pattern on the monthly chart. This pattern is considered bullish, indicating that Ethereum could continue its upward trajectory in the coming months. In a recent analysis shared on X (formerly Twitter), Doctor Profit projected that Ethereum might reach new heights, potentially hitting $8,000. If this forecast holds true, it would represent an impressive 88% increase from ETH’s current trading price of $4,250 as of late Monday.

Title: How safe is your sunscreen and how long does it last after opening?

Consumer concerns have been raised about the protection offered by sunscreens after some well known brands were found in independent studies to contain less SPF (sun protection factor) than they indicated on the label. The consumer groups Choice and Which? sent a variety of popular sunscreen brands to be tested in accredited independent laboratories to see if they met their stated SPF claims. The brands Ultra Violette and Ultrasun were found to offer much lower levels of SPF than their labels indicated. Choice found that Ultra Violette’s Lean Screen SPF50+ Mattifying Zinc Skinscreen, which retails for €39 at Space NK, returned a SPF rating of just 4 when tested. Separately, Which? revealed that the Ultrasun Family SPF30 lotion, which retails for €35 at Boots, did not meet the minimum required UVA level in their tests. Both Ultra Violette and Ultrasun strongly disputed the claims citing their own testing protocols as superior to those employed in Choice and Which?’s research. Lidl and Aldi’s own-brand products were Which?’s best value sunscreens. Aldi’s Lacura SPF50+ Sensitive Lotion and Lidl’s Cien Sun Spray SPF30, which both retail for €3.99, passed key sun safety tests and were significantly cheaper than their big brand rivals. However, Choice found that another Aldi own-brand sunscreen, Ombra Everyday Sunscreen Lotion 50+, which is not available in Ireland but is sold abroad, returned an SPF rating of just 26. We put Choice and Which?’s findings to three consultant dermatologists, each of whom say they would not be concerned by the results. “Sunscreen testing is technically complex and highly sensitive to variations in methodology,” says Prof Caitríona Ryan, consultant dermatologist at the Institute of Dermatologists and Blackrock Clinic. “In the case of the recent Choice report, several products were tested using a small sample size, which is well below the standard required for international SPF testing. Ultra Violette have since provided retesting data from accredited labs showing that their products do meet or exceed SPF 50+ claims under proper conditions.” Prof Anne-Marie Tobin, consultant dermatologist and professor of clinical medicine at Trinity College Dublin, is more concerned by lack of awareness around the exposure risks of applying expired sunscreen. “You should not use any old sun cream out of your bathroom cabinet, as it may have expired. Expired sun cream will not give you protection against UVA or UVB rays, as the active ingredient in the sun cream will have degraded,” Prof Tobin says. “You can check if your sun cream has expired by looking for a small drawing of a jar with a lid that has a number inside it, which is on every bottle of sun cream. The number tells you how many months you can use your sun cream for after you have opened it.” Prof Ryan adds that while UVB rays are primarily responsible for sunburn and direct DNA damage, UVA rays penetrate deeper into the skin, accelerating photo-ageing and increasing the long-term risk of skin cancer. “Unlike UVB, UVA levels remain constant throughout the year and can penetrate through cloud and glass. This is why choosing a sun cream that offers broad-spectrum protection, which shields against both UVA and UVB, is essential, even on cloudy days or when indoors near windows and particularly when driving,” Prof Ryan says. When it comes to the difference in protection between SPF30 and SPF50, Prof Ryan explains: “The SPF is a time-based measure, it indicates how much longer someone can stay in the sun without burning, compared to wearing no sunscreen. If you would normally burn after 10 minutes of sun exposure, an SPF30 theoretically allows you to stay protected for 300 minutes, while SPF50 would extend that to 500 minutes. SPF30 filters out around 97 per cent of UVB rays, and SPF50 filters about 98 per cent.” Prof Tobin and London-based consultant dermatologist Dr Aamna Adel agree that more people than ever are practising sun safety whether that is because people have aesthetic concerns around skin ageing or they are worried about developing skin cancer. Prof Tobin notes that while patients are very good at applying protection to their faces, they are not as good at protecting their chest, shoulders, neck and back. All three experts agreed that most skin cancers arise from cumulative UV exposure. “You can get skin cancer from being continuously exposed to low levels of UV over many years, rather than a one-off burn. It is best to turn putting on sun cream into an everyday habit like brushing your teeth. However, sun cream is only as effective as the person who applies it and most people don’t apply enough sun cream or don’t reapply their sun cream as frequently as they should,” Dr Adel says. [ Sunscreen: All you need to know to pick the best SPF for your face, scalp and bodyOpens in new window ] Prof Ryan also points to an alarming trend among younger people, using UV index data, not to avoid harm, but to maximise tanning. “Some social media influencers now promote the idea of ‘safe tanning’ during peak UV hours, but UV radiation is a Group 1 carcinogen, and tanning, even without burning, still causes cumulative DNA damage that can lead to skin cancer. There is also a common misconception that sunscreen blocks all vitamin D production, but research shows that people produce adequate vitamin D while wearing SPF.” Prof Ryan has seen an increase in the number of younger adults being diagnosed with melanomas. “Particularly women in their 20s and 30s, which is likely linked to intermittent high-intensity UV exposure from tanning beds and sun holidays.” Prof Tobin advises that most sun protection should be provided by clothing, and staying out of the sun when the UV is strongest between 12pm and 3pm. Skin cancer is the most common cancer in Ireland, with more than 11,000 people diagnosed annually according to the Irish Cancer Society. The National Skin Cancer Registry Ireland expects the number of diagnoses to double by 2040. However, Prof Tobin believes the official diagnosis statistics are actually underestimated because statisticians must verify every case and so are “likely quite behind with the figures they publish”. There are two main categories of skin cancer: melanoma and non-melanoma. Dr Adel says that the symptoms of melanoma are “a mole that is in any way changing in size, colour, texture or even if it begins to itch”. While the symptoms of non-melanoma are: “a spot or scab that is oozing, crusting over or just not healing”. Prof Tobin wants there to be greater awareness around the symptoms of non-melanoma skin cancer as it is the most common form of skin cancer. “About 1,200 people are diagnosed with melanoma skin cancers every year, the rest are all non-melanoma.” Dr Adel frequently encounters people who delay getting checked because they worry that they will be wasting the doctor’s time. “I would much rather have people come to see me with something that does not turn out to need treatment than to wait longer and potentially put themselves at risk. Early detection gives patients the best chance of making a full recovery,” Dr Adel says. [ Six of the best budget sunscreens for summer 2025Opens in new window ] In response to Choice’s SPF protection findings Ultra Violette issued this statement: “Ultra Violette is deeply committed to the health and safety of our customers and only work with reputable, TGA licensed manufacturers who perform substantial quality release testing in accordance with the strictest SPF standards in the world. We do not accept these results as even remotely accurate.” Likewise, Ultrasun disputed Which?’s findings: “Ultrasun is fully confident in our testing protocols. Our chosen testing protocol is one of the strictest available, and our UVB and UVA filters are tested both in vitro and in vivo. We conclusively support the result of our independent tests which found that the Ultrasun Family SPF30 reached a UVB-SPF in vivo of 31.4 and a UVA-PF in vitro of 13.1, which equates to a 92 per cent UVA absorbance.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Trump says Nvidia's 15% duty applies to ‘old’ H20 chips, may permit export of up to 50% downgraded Blackwell chip

US President Donald Trump stated that the current duties over Nvidia's export deal with China only cover the older H20 chip, which he described as “essentially old." Speaking to the reporters on Monday (E.T.), Trump said he would consider a deal that would let Nvidia send its Blackwell chips to China if the company could make them less advanced. “It’s possible I’d make a deal” on a “somewhat enhanced — in a negative way — Blackwell” processor, he said.. “In other words, take 30% to 50% off of it.” Additionally, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is expected to visit this week to discuss the new chip, Blackwell. Earlier, Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) had agreed to give 15% of their Chinese AI chip sales revenues to the US government. This deal is meant to secure export licenses and is considered an unusual arrangement that could unsettle both US companies and Beijing, reported Bloomberg News. Trump mentioned he initially asked Nvidia for a 20% cut for the US if he approved H20 sales to China, but he ultimately agreed to a 15% share. The two negotiated “a little deal,” he said. Nvidia intends to allocate 15% of its revenue from H20 AI accelerator sales China, the report noted citing a person familiar with the matter, while AMD will pay the same share from MI308 revenues. The revenue-sharing agreement for Nvidia's H20 chip and the possibility of another one for Blackwell chip highlight Trump’s consistent effort to orchestrate a financial gain for America in exchange for trade concessions. Such unprecedented arrangements, however, risk setting a precedent for all American companies operating in the Asian nation and may undermine the US government’s justification for export controls, the report said, citing experts. Over the past week, Trump has criticised chipmakers with various statements that unsettled firms from Silicon Valley to Asia. On Wednesday, he threatened to impose 100% tariffs on imported chips unless companies invested more in the US. However, these new tariffs would likely affect very few companies, as most major chipmakers are already covered by existing investments or trade agreements.

Title: A US senator from Colombia emerges as a Trump link for Latin America's conservatives

U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno has emerged as an interlocutor for conservatives in Latin America seeking to connect with the Trump administration MIAMI -- When Republican Sen. Bernie Moreno visits Colombia this week as part of a three-nation tour of Latin America, it will be something of a homecoming. Ohio’s first Latino senator, who defeated an incumbent last year with the help of Donald Trump’s endorsement, was born in the Colombian capital of Bogota, and even as he was chasing the American dream, he kept close tabs on the country through older brothers who are heavyweights in politics and business there. Moreno, 58, has emerged as an interlocutor for conservatives in Latin America seeking to connect with the Trump administration. In an interview with The Associated Press ahead of the trip, he expressed deep concern about Colombia’s direction under left-wing President Gustavo Petro and suggested that U.S. sanctions, higher tariffs or other retaliatory action might be needed to steer it straight. The recent criminal conviction of former President Alvaro Uribe, a conservative icon, was an attempt to “silence” the man who saved Colombia from guerrilla violence, Moreno said. Meanwhile, record cocaine production has left the United States less secure — and Colombia vulnerable to being decertified by the White House for failing to cooperate in the war on drugs. “The purpose of the trip is to understand all the dynamics before any decision is made,” said Moreno, who will meet with both Petro and Uribe, as well as business leaders and local officials. “But there’s nothing that’s taken off the table at this point and there’s nothing that’s directly being contemplated.” Moreno, a luxury car dealer from Cleveland, defeated incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown last year with the help of $441 million in political ad spending — the most in U.S. Senate race history. He became Ohio’s senior senator on practically his first day in office after his close friend JD Vance resigned the Senate to become vice president. In Congress, Moreno has mimicked Trump’s rhetoric to attack top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer as a “miserable old man out of a Dickens novel,” called on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates and threatened to subpoena California officials over their response to anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles. On Latin America, he’s been similarly outspoken, slamming Petro on social media as a “socialist dictator” and accusing Mexico of being on the path to becoming a “narco state.” He also surprised many hardliners in the GOP early on by suggesting in January that Trump should engage with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro despite his re-election in what the U.S., European Union and other governments condemned as a rigged vote. While referring to Maduro as a “gang leader” and "terrorist," Moreno nonetheless expressed support for the Trump administration's decision last month to allow energy giant Chevron to resume drilling in Venezuela following a deal with Maduro to free 10 jailed Americans held there. “What people wanted to hear in January is that we’re going to fly F-16s into Caracas and wage war against the country and that just wasn’t going to happen,” said Moreno in the interview. “If we take actions that are too much in that direction, we end up turning Venezuela over to China.” Such comments barely register in blue-collar Ohio, but they’ve garnered attention in Latin America. That despite the fact Moreno hasn’t lived in the region for decades and doesn’t sit on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “He’s somebody to watch,” said Michael Shifter, the former president of the Inter-American Dialogue in Washington. “He’s one of the most loyal Trump supporters in the Senate, and, given his background in Latin America, he could be influential on policy.” Moreno starts his first congressional delegation to Latin America on Monday for two days of meetings in Mexico City with officials including President Claudia Sheinbaum. Moreno, in the pre-trip interview, said that Sheinbaum has done more to combat the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. than her predecessor and mentor Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who he described as a “total disaster.” But he said more cooperation is needed, and he’d like to see Mexico allow the DEA to participate in judicial wiretaps like it has for decades in Colombia and allow it to bring back a plane used in bilateral investigations that López Obrador grounded. “The corruption becomes so pervasive, that if it’s left unchecked, it’s kind of like treating cancer,” said Moreno. “Mexico has to just come to the realization that it does not have the resources to completely wipe out the drug cartels. And it’s only going to be by asking the U.S. for help that we can actually accomplish that.” From Mexico, Moreno heads to Panama, where he’ll tour the Panama Canal with Trump’s new ambassador to the country, Kevin Marino Cabrera. In March, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate struck a deal that would have handed control of two ports on either end of the U.S.-built canal to American investment firm BlackRock Inc. The deal was heralded by Trump, who had threatened to take back the canal to curb Chinese influence. However, the deal has since drawn scrutiny from antitrust authorities in Beijing and last month the seller said it was seeking to add a strategic partner from mainland China — reportedly state-owned shipping company Cosco — to the deal. “Cosco, you might as well say, is the actual communist party,” said Moreno. “There’s no scenario in which Cosco can be part of the Panamanian ports.” On the final leg of the tour in Colombia, Moreno will be joined by another Colombian American senator: Ruben Gallego, Democrat of Arizona. In contrast to Moreno, who was born into privilege and counts among his siblings a former ambassador to the U.S., Gallego and his three sisters were raised by an immigrant single mother on a secretary’s paycheck. Despite their different upbringings, the two have made common cause in seeking to uphold the tradition of bilateral U.S. support for Colombia, for decades Washington’s staunchest ally in the region. It’s a task made harder by deepening polarization in both countries. The recent sentencing of Uribe to 12 years of house arrest in a long-running witness tampering case has jolted the nation’s politics with nine months to go before decisive presidential elections. The former president is barred from running but remains a powerful leader, and Moreno said his absence from the campaign trail could alter the playing field. He also worries that surging cocaine production could once again lead to a “narcotization” of a bilateral relationship that should be about trade, investment and mutual prosperity. “We want Colombia to be strong, we want Colombia to be healthy, we want Colombia to be prosperous and secure, and I think the people of Colombia want the exact same thing,” he added. “So, the question is, how do we get there?” ___ Smyth reported from Columbus, Ohio. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Q1FY26 revenue beat estimates on broad-based strength, while EBITDA margin expanded sharply QoQ. ~Q1FY26 revenue grew 3.8% QoQ / 23.9% YoY to Rs 2.49bn, led by healthy organic traction and ~60–80 bps positive FX impact. EBITDA rose 25.9% QoQ / 30.8% YoY to Rs 458mn with margins at 18.4% (+220bps QoQ / +100bps YoY) on lower third-party charges and other expenses. ~Client mining efforts were showcased ; by the company converting a 0.5 mn$ client to $1mn client (shipping org in Singapore) in commerce vertical and adding a new $0.5mn client (B2B commerce play in US) in logistics. Top 10 clients contributed 59% (vs 55% in Q4), reflecting deeper wallet share. ~Strategic acquisitions (Augmento, Zetechno, Ceptes) continue to bolster Salesforce & ServiceNow capabilities, driving large account conversions and 20%+ growth in Augmento post-acquisition. Utilisation steady at 86%; employee count flat QoQ. ~Management guided for 15%+ organic growth in FY26E, with EBITDA margin stabilising in the 16–17% range. ~We estimate 19.0%/19.8%/22.3% Revenue/EBITDA/PAT CAGR over FY25–27E. Valuing at 25x Q1FY28E PE, TP of Rs 320 implies 51% upside. Key risks: 1) Slowdown in any of the 4 key segments 2) Lower SMB spends in US & Europe. CMP: Rs 5,155 | TP: Rs 6,880 (UR) | Rating: Buy (UR) Revenue: Rs 3,520 mn (+6.8% YoY, -4.3% QoQ). EBITDA: Rs 592 mn (-4.7% YoY, -10% QoQ). EBITDA margin was at 16.8% vs 18.8% YoY and 17.9% QoQ mainly due to a 16% jump in SG&A expenses, primarily employee costs. PAT: Rs 409 mn (-7.9% YoY, -13.7% QoQ). PAT margin was at 11.6% vs 13.5% YoY and 12.9% in QoQ. Our view: ESAB India’s Q1-FY26 topline growth was soft but in-line with our estimates, though EBITDA and PAT growth was more disappointing coming in at 10-14% lower than our expectations. We will shortly review our TP and rating on the stock. 1. Record-Breaking Q1 FY26 Performance Sales: ₹235Cr, +39% YoY / +17% QoQ EBITDA: ₹47Cr, +38% YoY / +19% QoQ EBITDA Margins 20%, +41bps QoQ PAT: ₹34Cr, +53% YoY / +45% QoQ Cash and Cash equivalents: 280cr Strong history of dividend and buyback | 200cr distributed in last 5 years Key Drivers - Deeper client penetration and growing share of lab-grown diamond (LGD) jewellery - LGD jewellery commanding premium realisations over mined diamonds - Omnichannel strategy driving demand in US retail (clients include JCPenney, Sears, Walmart) - India’s emerging LGD jewellery market 2. LGD Leadership & Backward Integration LGD share of revenue: 88% in Q1 Acquisition of Eco Diamond LLP (EDL) enables: - In-house LGD production at competitive costs - Margin expansion through cost efficiencies Design-led approach → faster inventory turnover, reduced working capital needs 3. Strong Growth Visibility 72% of inventory already placed with customers — signalling healthy demand Retail Expansion Plan: - 100–125 ORIGEM stores in 24–36 months - Targeting leadership as India’s largest exclusive LGD jewellery chain 4. Attractive ORIGEM Unit Economics Capex-light model: ₹2–2.5 Cr inventory per store Rapid breakeven: Some stores achieve breakeven in Month 1 with ~₹20 Lakh monthly sales High gross margins: 42–45% vs 25–35% for funded peers Competitive pricing: 5–30% lower than competitors, yet higher margins — driven by backward integration and cost advantage Goldiam International combines record financial performance with structural tailwinds from the fast-growing LGD segment. -> Integrated supply chain -> Strong global & domestic retail presence -> Resilience in passing on tariffs -> High-margin ORIGEM retail model position it for sustained earnings growth and market leadership in the global LGD space Trades at 17x FY27E earnings | Undervalued vs growth potential in LGD retail CMP: INR 176 | TP: INR 295 | Rating: BUY ~ We retain BUY rating on Sequent and increased our TP to INR 295 (previously INR 275) due to roll-over to Q1FY28E. ~ Sequent delivered revenue of INR 4.4bn (+13% YoY, +10% QoQ) helped by rebound in the API segment, increased exports, new market growth and price hikes. EBITDA margin (pre-ESOP) stood at 13.6% (vs 12.4% LY). SSL continue to focus on high-value products and operational efficiencies. ~Viyash reported a soft revenue growth (3.7% YoY and -4.9% QoQ); EBITDA margin (Pre-ESOP) stood at 19.5% (vs 17.1% LY) driven by product mix optimization. R&D pipeline remains robust, with 16+ products in development, reinforcing future growth visibility. ~ The combined entity delivered Q1FY26 revenue of INR 7.9bn, (up 8.8% YoY and 2.8% QoQ), with EBITDA margins (Pre-ESOPs) expanding to 16.2% (vs. 14.6% LY). Margin momentum is expected to sustain and improve for both SSL and Viyash, supported by synergy realisation and the ramp-up of Viyash’s operations beyond 60-65% utilisation. ~ We expect the merger to unlock meaningful synergies, driving a revenue and EBITDA CAGR of 17.1% and 35%, respectively, over FY25-28E. The combined entity is well-positioned with enhanced operational efficiency and a strong balance sheet, supporting margin expansion and improved return profiles.

This is a testament to sustained investor confidence and disciplined participation. Equity mutual funds recorded their highest-ever monthly inflow of ₹42,702 crore, with DIIs maintaining strong support. SIP contributions hit a new record of ₹28,464 crore, and contributing accounts grew 5.4% to 9.11 crore - clear evidence of disciplined investing even amid volatility. AMFI remains committed to investor education and fostering a transparent, well-regulated ecosystem that supports long-term wealth creation.” Hindalco’s subsidiary Novelis reports a weak Q1FY26 with EBITDA/tonne at $432, below the expected $445–450, due to high scrap prices, a weaker product mix, and a $28 million tariff hit ($60 million expected in Q2). Management believes EBITDA has bottomed out, with tariff mitigation and a $100 million+ cost-cutting program set to improve 2HFY26 performance. Net debt rose 8% QoQ to $5.29 billion, a 19-quarter high, driven by Bay Minette plant investments, with leverage at 3.2x. Despite near-term pressures, strong beverage packaging demand and cost reductions support long-term growth, though rising debt and tariffs remain risks. Hindalco’s stock was stable at ₹672.85–676.

Title: Stripe Is Building A Blockchain: Can Openness Survive Branded Rails?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/christiancatalini/2025/08/11/stripe-is-building-a-blockchain-can-openness-survive-branded-rails/
Time Published: 2025-08-12T00:20:00Z
Full Content:
ByChristian Catalini ByChristian Catalini, Contributor. Fintech powerhouse Stripe is secretly building a high-performance blockchain called “Tempo,” per a now-removed job posting and Fortune’s reporting. This payments-optimized chain would fill a critical gap in Stripe’s crypto stack, complementing its recent acquisitions of stablecoin startup Bridge and wallet infrastructure provider Privy. Stablecoins promise to make crypto mainstream by delivering faster, cheaper, more interconnected global payments. The paradox: the same move could undercut what the technology set out to achieve. Add the rush to branded rails—Robinhood’s chain on Arbitrum, Coinbase’s Base on the OP Stack, and now Stripe’s Tempo—and we could end up close to where we started, just with block explorers. Worse, market concentration may rise if a few players use stablecoins to reach previously unimaginable scale. With the GENIUS Act now law, the next 12–18 months will likely determine the outcome. We’ve seen this tension before in the early internet’s open web versus walled gardens. In the history of technology, the pendulum regularly swings between centralization and decentralization. Even when a technology has a decentralizing effect, economies of scale in a new dimension—whether complementary resources, talent, brand, or distribution—inevitably become vectors of concentration. Once concentration becomes too high, the ingenuity of entrepreneurs and developers invents a new approach to reverse it. A prominent example is the early internet, which brought a wave of entry and competition to the heavily concentrated industries of telecommunications, retail, and media—only to create the perfect conditions for today’s tech giants to scale through network effects and capture a sizable share of value. Although the underlying internet protocols remained open and neutral, massive digital platforms at the application layer walled off participants from competing services by strategically breaking interoperability. From email to social media to payments, we spend most of our time and money within the confines of what the tech giants have designed for us. And while we are clearly better off—more choice, lower prices—it’s increasingly clear that some would prefer a world where platforms do not have as much power and influence over them. Crypto’s reason for existence was to break free from centralized intermediaries. After the 2008 financial crisis, Satoshi wanted to create a world where anyone could exchange value without having to trust a central bank or financial institution ever again. And while the original Bitcoin vision of a fully democratic network—“one‑CPU‑one‑vote”—didn’t pan out due to economies of scale in mining, Bitcoin did deliver what more and more financial institutions and some governments now recognize as a novel and neutral financial asset. Inspired by Bitcoin, entrepreneurs and developers have applied the same principles in an attempt to bring decentralization back to other digital platforms—starting with payments, but branching out into finance, marketplaces, messaging, and social media. Overall, progress toward decentralization is mixed: while it’s true that Bitcoin allows anyone around the world to be their own bank, the vast majority of consumers and institutions rely heavily on intermediaries for custody and use. Similarly, solutions that offer consumers greater control over their private data and the content they create have stayed niche—often because they lag in usability and convenience relative to the centralized counterparts they’re trying to replace. Convenience eats privacy for lunch any day—and it’s difficult to undo the entrenched network effects of the leading digital platforms. In payments, the most critical battle is unfolding now. Legacy infrastructure is siloed, and incumbents have tremendous power over what we can access—and on what terms. Because of winner‑take‑all dynamics, markets can become so concentrated that the public sector has to step in—the most salient example is China’s introduction of a central bank digital currency to unravel the payments oligopoly established by Ant Group and Tencent. Crypto is a natural, market‑driven solution to this. It provides neutral and decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether, as well as truly open and interoperable financial rails via their base layers. But as the technology has matured, two core problems have emerged. The first problem is that cryptocurrencies are volatile and therefore expensive for payments and financial contracts. To address this, the market has focused on fiat‑backed stablecoins; this inevitably leads to centralization because issuance and sound management require a regulated financial entity to be in charge of—and accountable for—reserve operations. While distributed governance of a stablecoin network is technically possible, it is extremely difficult to get the design right. Libra is the most prominent example: despite backing from more than two dozen leading global companies and countless resources dedicated to establishing credible distributed governance, the project was always perceived as Meta’s initiative. Banks have tried for more than a decade to come together as consortia in response to crypto, and, to date, no joint project has delivered anything tangible. The reason is obvious: until the situation is truly dire, competitors are unlikely to commit to a joint solution—so, in the meantime, everyone hedges their bets across multiple tracks. Intuitively, distributed ownership of a stablecoin network makes sense and is not that different from what ultimately made Visa scale in the 1970s—when Bank of America relinquished control of the BankAmericard credit card program to respond to increasing competition from the consortium that would become Mastercard. Networks of crypto exchanges and fintechs, such as the Global Dollar Network, may be able to move faster, given the agility of the new entrants backing them, but they will still need to strike the right balance between economic incentives and governance to shift members from a wait‑and‑see mode—where everyone hopes to free‑ride on others’ efforts—into action. Even Circle’s Centre Consortium, which had only Circle and Coinbase as members, was dissolved and converted into a simple revenue‑sharing agreement. So, while there might be a solution to the decentralized governance of a stablecoin, what we know is that, to date, the only working model is one that places a single entity in charge of everything. This is, of course, problematic in the long term, and while issuers today control only the asset, they have already started expanding their offerings in ways that limit openness. For example, Circle announced its payment network (CPN), which places it at the center of how payments are executed—from defining rules and eligibility, to inserting itself into every API interaction and price and liquidity discovery, to, of course, collecting a fee. Put together, this setup is not that different from the model that has allowed Visa and Mastercard to dominate payments for decades. The second problem crypto has run into is one that is deeply tied to its roots: decentralization is expensive. The economic consequence is that you can only afford it where it truly matters. To date, among networks at scale, that’s been true only for the base layers of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. At most, that yields a few thousand decentralized transactions per second globally across all of them combined—a far cry from what global payments would require, even before you layer financial services on top. As a result, most transactions no longer occur on the base layers (L1s) but on a sprawling ecosystem of high‑throughput scaling solutions (L2s). L2s offer near‑zero fees and instant settlement, and they’re profitable because they internalize Maximal Extractable Value (MEV)—the gains from reordering, inserting, or omitting transactions in a block. While crypto purists might decry this trend, it aligns precisely with economic theory: users are willing to pay a premium for decentralization and censorship resistance at the core settlement layer, yet they readily trade some of that for greater centralization in higher layers to gain lower costs and faster speeds. The base layers remain open and trustless, and depending on the application, participants may compromise further—even embracing fully trusted, centralized solutions. This trade‑off is broader than a user’s decision to be their own bank and self‑custody funds versus accepting some degree of trust in a third‑party wallet. When building products, Coinbase, Robinhood, and the like care deeply that the underlying network stays neutral and does not play favorites among applications, developers, or businesses—the way the tech giants do on their platforms. Essentially, they are willing to pay for decentralization and neutrality to reduce the risk of hold‑up and expropriation—something that has repeatedly played out on traditional digital platforms. To fully grasp what fast, low‑cost L2s will do to payments and competition in crypto, look no further than what the internet did to news and media: as the cost of distributing—and now, with AI, also generating—large swaths of content fell to zero, business models had to evolve drastically, and massive aggregators (Google, Facebook, Spotify, etc.) emerged to take advantage of the new economics at play. Because L2s remove friction, offer convenience, and allow builders to deliver experiences much closer to traditional fintech products, they are the obvious layer where most of the value will be created—and appropriated. Furthermore, as basic money becomes free and commoditized, competition shifts to the value‑added services and workflows associated with it. That’s exactly where fintechs, neobanks, crypto exchanges, and even traditional financial institutions have a significant advantage. Any one of these players, if it executes well over the next couple of years, can use the technology to establish the first truly massive and global financial network. Once it reaches scale, it could also progressively degrade interoperability, appropriating more of the value—much as today’s internet giants did. So what’s the most likely scenario? Based on how strong and persistent network effects have been in crypto over the last decade, it’s safe to assume that payments and financial services will disproportionately gravitate toward a couple of leading blockchains. The remaining chains will need to specialize within an industry vertical to stay relevant. Most activity will take place not on their decentralized base layers but on scaling layers branded and shaped by crypto and fintech players (e.g., Base, Robinhood Chain), applications (e.g., Unichain, World Chain), and financial institutions (e.g., Kinexys, Fnality, Partior). Players that control distribution—whether on the consumer, merchant, or institutional side—have a massive advantage, as they own the interface between the blockchain and the real world. Blockchains drastically lower the cost of verifying and coordinating onchain data, but their value is limited without a strong nexus with complementary offchain information—identity, compliance, credentials, creditworthiness, and more. That’s where friction persists—and where economies of scale will decide winners and losers. This is why stablecoin issuers have strong incentives either to commoditize the rails—by issuing on multiple networks and positioning themselves at the center of interoperability across them (e.g., Circle’s Cross‑Chain Transfer Protocol)—or to nudge most activity to a network they control, such as a new L2 or a higher‑level protocol like CPN. Either strategy gives them a shot at becoming massive global fintech leaders and capturing most of the value the technology creates. Meanwhile, crypto and fintech players will want to shift those same valuable transactions to a network over which they have more sway, such as a branded L2. In doing so, they’ll also want either to commoditize stablecoins and other tokenized assets, or to issue their own. In the latter scenario, stablecoins may well be used as a loss leader to expand the reach of a fintech’s offering, and domestic stablecoins will be issued to gain more control over the FX market and support local use cases. Real‑world assets (RWAs), memecoins, other tokens, and applications that are truly differentiated and exclusive to those networks may also help these branded chains retain volume within their borders. The same companies will be able to develop clever rewards and loyalty programs that increase consumer and business stickiness within their ecosystems. As convenience and economic reality win over dogmatism, crypto will look very different than it is today. The good news is that, as part of that transformation, it will be far more useful. And while that may come with more centralization, the fact that the underlying protocols are open source and forkable means that, no matter how large some players may become, they face more pressure to retain greater interoperability than under the status quo. It is also possible that because crypto protocols allow for new market design and incentives, the ultimate solution will be something that was not quite achievable for the internet protocols—which did not have built‑in monetization mechanisms. Regardless, once centralization materializes, some clever group of developers will work hard to undo it, and the cycle will repeat.

Search The Points Guy As soon as people find out that I work for The Points Guy, they almost always follow up with one question: "What's the best credit card?" My answer is usually, "It depends" — because there truly is no one-size-fits-all credit card that's best for everyone. Several factors go into determining the best credit card for your situation, including your spending habits, your credit score and the type of rewards you want to earn. Some regular contenders frequently make the cut when I recommend new credit cards since they offer solid value for a variety of spenders and their lifestyles. I've had my fair share of them over my 20-plus years of collecting points and miles. Here are my top picks for the best credit cards you can add to your wallet. *TPG founder Brian Kelly is a Bilt adviser and investor. **The information for the Hilton Honors American Express Aspire has been collected independently by The Points Guy. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer. Check out how my top recommendations for the best credit cards stack up against each other. †You must use the card five times each statement period to earn points on rent and qualifying net purchases. Standout benefits: The Chase Sapphire Preferred was one of the first cards I opened that carried an annual fee. Initially, I got the card because it didn't charge foreign transaction fees, but I quickly fell in love with the rewards I was earning — both abroad and back in the U.S. By signing up, you will receive newsletters and promotional content and agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge the data practices in our Privacy Policy. You may unsubscribe at any time. Chase Ultimate Rewards points are among the most valuable currencies out there, pegged at 2.05 cents each per TPG's August 2025 valuations. As a Sapphire Preferred cardholder, you can redeem your points through Chase Travel at a rate of 1.25 cents apiece, but my favorite way to use Chase points is by transferring them to travel partners like Air Canada Aeroplan and World of Hyatt. Hyatt is my go-to redemption option here, as I almost always get well over 2 cents per point in value from my award stays. For example, I splurged for four nights at the Hyatt Centric Park City earlier this year, and even though it set me back 180,000 points, the paid rate would've been nearly $6,000. I was even able to apply a suite upgrade as a Hyatt Globalist. Related: Why the Chase Sapphire Preferred should be your first card out of college Beyond that, the card offers an incredible set of travel protections if things go wrong on your trip, including primary car rental coverage. You'll also enjoy a $50 annual hotel credit for reservations made through Chase Travel. I eventually upgraded to the card's more premium sibling — the Chase Sapphire Reserve® (see rates and fees) — a few years ago, but my wife continues to hold her Sapphire Preferred and still gets incredible value from it. New applicants can earn 75,000 points after spending $5,000 on purchases within the first three months from account opening. The Sapphire Preferred features a $95 annual fee. For more information, check out our review of the Chase Sapphire Preferred. Apply here: Chase Sapphire Preferred Card Standout benefits: I picked up the Capital One Venture X shortly after it launched in November 2021, and it quickly became a workhorse in my wallet because it earns at least 2 miles per dollar spent on every purchase. I charge my utility bills and most of my online shopping to it, since those purchases generally aren't eligible for bonuses on other cards. The card also offers a ton of premium perks without a premium price tag. You'll enjoy access to Capital One Lounges and a Priority Pass Select membership, along with the ability to enjoy value-added benefits on luxury hotel stays via the Premier Collection and Lifestyle Collection. All of this comes with an annual fee of just $395. However, even that is super easy to offset with other perks on the card. You'll get an annual $300 credit for purchases via Capital One Travel — including flights, hotels and rental cars. You can also use the card for up to $120 in statement credits to cover the cost of a Global Entry or TSA PreCheck membership every four years. Related: Capital One Venture Rewards vs. Capital One Venture X Finally, when you renew your card, you'll receive 10,000 bonus miles on your account anniversary. Those are worth at least $100 if used for travel, but they have the potential for even more value when you redeem them with Capital One's 15-plus transfer partners. I recently transferred 70,000 Capital One miles to Air Canada Aeroplan to book a one-way business-class flight to Europe for Thanksgiving — a trip that would've otherwise set me back over $3,000. And that's just one method of maximizing your Capital One miles. New applicants can earn 75,000 miles after spending $4,000 on purchases within the first three months from account opening. This card features a $395 annual fee. For more information, check out our review of the Capital One Venture X. Learn more: Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card Standout benefits: Believe it or not, I first added the Amex Gold to my wallet without earning a welcome bonus. I held an earlier version of the card, so I wasn't eligible. However, I still earn tens of thousands of points on the card every year — and last year's refresh made me love it even more. I love dining out and cooking in, and the Amex Gold rewards you in both categories. You'll earn 4 points per dollar spent at restaurants worldwide (on up to $50,000 in purchases each year, then 1 point per dollar) and 4 points per dollar spent at U.S. supermarkets (on up to $25,000 in purchases each year, then 1 point per dollar). Membership Rewards points are super valuable — with partners like ANA Mileage Club and Air France-KLM Flying Blue. Related: How to maximize the Amex Gold's benefits However, the card can also save you money on everyday purchases as well, thanks to the following benefits (enrollment required): ***Uber Cash is valid on purchases in the U.S. and you must first add your Amex Gold to your Uber account. You can then redeem with any Amex card. In fact, I was getting so much value out of this card that my wife was convinced to get her own Amex Gold card last year — essentially doubling the value we can get from these statement credits every year. With the Amex Gold, you can find out your offer and see if you are eligible for as high as 100,000 Membership Rewards points after spending $6,000 on purchases within the first six months of card membership. Welcome offers vary, and you may not be eligible for an offer. This card's annual fee is $325. For more information, check out our review of the Amex Gold Card. Apply here: American Express Gold Card Standout benefits: Before I got the Capital One Venture X, I had the regular Venture Card — which is a great alternative for those who aren't willing to pay for a premium rewards card. You'll enjoy the same base earning rate of 2 miles per dollar spent on all purchases, and you'll enjoy access to Capital One's Lifestyle Collection of hotels around the world. The card also includes up to $120 in statement credits for a Global Entry or TSA PreCheck membership every four years — a rarity for a card with just a $95 annual fee. In addition, the Venture Card can be the perfect option for those just getting started who value simplicity but may want the option of maximizing rewards in the future. Capital One miles can be used to offset any travel purchase charged to the card at a value of 1 cent per point. However, you also have the ability to leverage Capital One's transfer partners for even more value. This gives you a great starting point — with the chance to unlock more rewards down the road. New applicants can earn 75,000 miles after spending $4,000 on purchases within the first three months from account opening. This card features a $95 annual fee. For more information, check out our review of the Capital One Venture Rewards. Learn more: Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card Standout benefits: I've held the Amex Platinum for years, and it's among the priciest travel cards out there, with a massive $695 annual fee. However, each time my card comes up for renewal, I crunch the numbers and realize that I easily get that much in value every year — and then some. For example, when you add the Amex Platinum to your Uber account, you'll receive $15 a month in Uber Cash plus a one-time bonus of $20 in the month of December (valid for rides and Uber Eats orders in the U.S.; can pay using any Amex card). I also enjoy the up to $20 a month in statement credits I receive for select digital entertainment providers, which I use to offset the cost of my daughter's Disney+ obsession (enrollment is required). Then there's the up to $200 airline fee statement credit each calendar year — which I mainly use for Sky Club guest access for my daughter. These three perks alone can offer me up to $640 in annual benefits, nearly covering the card's entire annual fee. Enrollment is required. Related: Maximizing the Amex Platinum's benefits Beyond these statement credits, the Amex Platinum offers unparalleled airport lounge access, including Centurion Lounges, Priority Pass lounges (enrollment is required) and Plaza Premium locations. You can also access Delta Sky Clubs when flying Delta Air Lines, though you are capped at 10 visits per year unless you spent $75,000 in the current (or previous) calendar year. There's nothing I love more than relaxing in a quiet space prior to a flight — and the Platinum Card delivers just that. With the Amex Platinum, you can find out your offer and see if you are eligible for as 175,000 Membership Rewards points after spending $8,000 on purchases in the first six months of card membership. Welcome offers vary, and you may not be eligible for an offer. This card's annual fee is $695. For more information, check out our review of the Amex Platinum Card. Apply here: Amex Platinum Standout benefits: I've been a longtime Delta flyer. In fact, I was a charter Diamond Medallion member when that elite status first launched in 2010 — qualifying entirely on domestic segments, no less. And even though I'm no longer a road warrior, I still love flying Delta. And the Delta Reserve Card helps make those trips even more rewarding. Even though it carries a hefty annual fee, the perks are extensive. You'll receive 2,500 Medallion Qualification Dollars (MQDs) each year just for having the card, putting you halfway to Silver Medallion status. You can then earn 1 MQD for every $10 spent on the card, allowing you to spend your way to status. The card also includes 15 visits to Sky Clubs every year plus four, one-time-use guest passes — though you can unlock unlimited visits as the primary cardmember when you spend $75,000 on purchases in a calendar year. But my favorite perk is the annual companion certificate you receive upon renewal. This allows you to bring a travel companion on select Delta-operated flights just by paying the taxes and fees. It's even valid on select Comfort+ and first-class tickets. Last year, I used this for a flight to Salt Lake City International Airport (SLC) for me and my daughter to go skiing, a ticket that would've otherwise been over $900. New applicants can earn 70,000 miles after spending $5,000 on purchases within the first six months of card membership. This card's annual fee is $650. For more information, check out our review of the Delta SkyMiles Reserve. Apply here: Delta SkyMiles Reserve Amex Standout benefits: You may be surprised to see a cash-back credit card on this list, but the Freedom Flex is so much more — let's start with the earning rates. Cardholders earn 5% cash back on the first $1,500 in combined purchases you spend each quarter in rotating bonus categories (after activation). With a wife and 10-year-old daughter, I spend a ton at Amazon, so that's a great return on purchases I'm already making. However, I'm not just earning cash back. Instead, since I also have the Chase Sapphire Reserve, I have the ability to combine these rewards in my Sapphire account — which effectively converts them to fully transferable Ultimate Rewards points. In other words, this card allows me to earn 5 Ultimate Rewards points per dollar spent on these rotating categories. Related: 4 reasons I recommend the Chase Freedom Flex to beginners In fact, I max out the quarterly bonus so frequently that I have both this card and the old Chase Freedom card (no longer available to new applicants) — which means I have double the earning potential each month. With this no-annual-fee card, new applicants can earn $200 after spending $500 on eligible purchases within the first three months of account opening. For more information, check out our review of the Chase Freedom Flex. Apply here: Chase Freedom Flex Standout benefits: The Ink Business Preferred can be a great fit for virtually any small business — but especially those with a big online presence. That's because of the bonus categories on the card. Each year, you'll earn 3 points per dollar on up to $150,000 in combined spending across the following categories: If you fully max out that bonus, you'll take home 450,000 Chase Ultimate Rewards points — which can then be used for cash back, gift cards or trips through Chase's lucrative transfer partners. It also has no foreign transaction fees when you're outside the country, and with extensive travel and purchase protections for business trips, it can give you valuable peace of mind when on the road. New applicants can earn 90,000 points after spending $8,000 on purchases within the first three months from account opening. This card features a $95 annual fee. For more information, check out our review of the Ink Business Preferred. Apply here: Ink Business Preferred Standout benefits: The Bilt Mastercard is the one card on this list that I've never had. However, that's solely due to the fact that I own my home. If you're a renter, and you're not currently earning points on your monthly rent, this card should absolutely be in your wallet. That's because you can earn 1 point per dollar spent on rent (up to 100,000 points each calendar year) without paying any transaction fees (see rates and fees), as long as you charge at least five purchases to the card each month. This holds true even if your landlord or apartment management company isn't part of the Bilt Rewards program and doesn't accept credit cards. You can log in to the Bilt Rewards app and use your Bilt Mastercard to send a monthly rent check or direct deposit, earning points in the process. Related: Guide to the Bilt Rewards program In addition to rent, you also earn 5 points per dollar spent on Lyft (after you link your Bilt and Lyft accounts), 3 points per dollar spent on dining, 2 points per dollar spent on travel and 1 point per dollar spent on all other purchases. And Bilt Rewards Points are incredibly valuable, with a wildly lucrative list of transfer partners — including World of Hyatt and Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan. Plus, Bilt runs Rent Day promotions that allow you to earn even more points on your everyday purchases — and potentially get even more value from your redemptions. The Bilt card does not come with a welcome offer and does not charge an annual fee (see rates and fees). For more information, check out our review of the Bilt Mastercard. Apply here: Bilt Mastercard Standout benefits: It's true that I have a lot of premium credit cards, but if you're looking to up your hotel game, the Hilton Aspire Card can be a great option. Beyond the hefty welcome bonus, it also unlocks a ton of perks — both when staying at Hilton properties and across other spending activities. For starters, you'll enjoy automatic top-tier Hilton Honors Diamond status, just by holding the card. This grants you complimentary upgrades as well as a daily food-and-beverage credit at eligible properties in the U.S. (or complimentary breakfast at international locations). This status normally requires 60 nights to achieve, so this is a remarkable shortcut. Related: 7 reasons to get the Hilton Amex Aspire card In addition, you get a free night certificate when you open the card and then every year after renewal, and this can be used at virtually any Hilton property worldwide (with just a few exceptions). In addition, you'll enjoy up to $400 in annual statement credits at Hilton resort properties — up to $200 from January to June and up to $200 from July to December. Last year, I used the certificate to book the Conrad Fort Lauderdale Beach when the room rates were over $800 per night — and I used the $200 credit for the second half of the year to cover most of a spa treatment for my wife (it was her birthday). Talk about rewarding! Finally, I love the up to $200 in statement credits for airline purchases each year, broken up as $50 each quarter. I've used this for taxes and fees on award tickets as well as inflight food and beverage purchases. New applicants can earn 175,000 points after spending $6,000 on purchases in your first six months of card membership. This card features an annual fee of $550. For more information, check out our review of the Hilton Aspire Card. There's no denying that there are a lot of credit card options from which to choose. However, there are a few important things to consider when trying to pick the one that's best for you. However, one of the great things about having so many cards at your disposal is that you're not locked into a long-term commitment. If you want to try a new card, you can earn the welcome bonus and utilize the perks for the first year. Then, if it's not worth keeping, you can cancel it. (Just don't do it before the first year is up.) First, it's critical to think about your preferred rewards currency. Do you want cash back or travel points? Are you interested in rewards in a specific airline or hotel loyalty program? Part of this may be geographical. After all, earning American miles if you're based in Atlanta may not be worthwhile, given Delta's hub. However, if you live in Charlotte or Philadelphia, American may be a much better option. Alternatively, consider earning transferable rewards on cards like the Sapphire Preferred, Amex Gold or Capital One Venture. These points or miles convert to a number of airline and hotel partners, allowing you to book premium flights or luxury hotels by leveraging program sweet spots. Most cards offer welcome bonuses to new applicants, and these are a great way to quickly boost your account balance. Cards sometimes offer limited-time, elevated offers, so if you time it right, you could take home a ton of points or miles that can go a long way toward your next trip. Before you commit to a new card, take stock of your everyday spending habits. Most cards offer extra rewards in select categories of purchases, so you should pick one that matches where you spend your money. Are you a prolific chef at home? Go for a card with a category bonus at grocery stores. Love dining out? Get one with a bonus at restaurants. Or, if your spending is all over the place, get a card that offers a solid earning rate on all purchases. Finally, consider whether the cost of the card is worth it. The most rewarding cards out there typically impose an annual fee, and while this confers many perks, not all of them may be useful to you. While the welcome bonus typically offers enough value in year one, it's a harder decision after that. Crunch the actual, real-world value you can get from the card to make sure you get at least enough to cover the annual fee. Related: The 7 best credit cards with annual fees under $100 We chose the best credit cards based on a range of factors, including earning rates, welcome offers, benefits and perks. To read more about how TPG evaluates and chooses cards to spotlight in our roundups, check out our methodology. It's no coincidence that the vast majority of the cards on this list earn transferable rewards (the only exceptions are the Delta SkyMiles Reserve and the Chase Freedom Flex, though the latter becomes transferable in my wallet when paired with the Sapphire Reserve). That's because this type of rewards offers immense flexibility to book incredibly valuable trips. For example, let's say you want to book a flight to London by leveraging your Amex Platinum. Your first option is through American Express Travel, which offers a value of 1 cent per point. Alternatively, you can transfer Amex points to Delta, though SkyMiles award rates tend to be sky high. However, there's another option: Transfer your Amex points to Virgin Atlantic Flying Club, which can offer incredibly low rates to Europe — including economy and business class. Whenever someone asks me to name the best credit card, I always say that it depends. There are so many cards that could work for the average traveler, so it's critical to take some time to analyze what you want out of a card and where you spend your money. And if you're still overwhelmed, you really can't go wrong with any of the cards on this list — especially if you want to dip your toes into maximizing your rewards for your next trip.

Title: Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. Reminds Investors in IRobot (IRBT) of the Class Action Lawsuit and Encourages Investors to Inquire About Their Rights

August 11, 2025 19:37 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. Litigation Attorneys Encourage Investors Who Suffered Losses IRobot (IRBT) To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you purchased or acquired securities in any of the above companies between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Bragar Eagel & Squire partner Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore directly at (212) 355-4648 NEW YORK, Aug. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:IRBT) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until September 5, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that "there can be no assurance that [iRobot's] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies." Accordingly, "given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements." In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot's announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating "due to [a] bleak outlook," stating that "iRobot's business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses," "Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes," "iRobot's future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender," and that the Company's "survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely." That same day, in an article entitled "Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today," The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that "iRobot's costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability." On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. If you purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot shares and suffered a loss, are a long-term stockholder, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com, telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

Title: China and the US clash at the UN over the Panama Canal, a focus of Trump’s attention

By EDITH M. LEDERER UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United States and China clashed over the Panama Canal at the United Nations on Monday, with the U.S. warning that Beijing’s influence over the key waterway could threaten global trade and security and China calling U.S. accusations a pretext to take over the canal. The clash took place at a U.N. Security Council meeting where Panama’s President José Raúl Mulino stressed the neutrality of the canal and his country’s ownership of the waterway linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Panama holds the council presidency this month, and Mulino was chairing a meeting on challenges to maritime security. Interpol Secretary General Valdecy Urquiza told members these include piracy, armed robbery, transnational crime and cyber criminals weaponizing artificial intelligence to attack ports where there is “minimal cyber security, maximum exposure.” U.S. President Donald Trump thrust Panama into the spotlight even before winning election last November by suggesting that his country should consider retaking control of the Panama Canal and accusing Panama of ceding influence to China. The U.S. built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Control of the waterway transferred to Panama in 1999 under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. China’s U.N. Ambassador Fu Cong emphasized to the council that “Panama has consistently and effectively managed the canal, making significant contributions to global shipping and trade.” “China has always respected the permanent neutrality of the canal and firmly supports Panama in safeguarding its sovereignty over the canal to ensure its openness and smooth operation,” he said. Acting U.S. Ambassador Dorothy Shea, who spoke afterward, went after China, expressing concern about its “outsized influence over the Panama Canal area, especially over critical infrastructure and port operations.” Alluding to its claims in the South China Sea, she said, “China’s expansive and unlawful maritime claims and aggressive actions demonstrate its threat to maritime security and commerce.” She said the U.S. rejects these claims and supports countries opposing them. “China’s influence in the canal area is not just a risk to Panama and the United States, but rather a potential threat to global trade and security,” Shea said. The Trump administration has pressured China to have the Hong Kong-based operator of ports at either end of the canal sell those interests to a U.S. consortium that includes BlackRock Inc. Panama has vehemently rejected a takeover of the canal, but in April, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth visited Panama and agreed with Mulino to step up security coordination. The agreement also gives U.S. troops access to strategic air and naval facilities in the Central American nation, which sparked large protests in Panama’s capital. China’s Fu asked for the floor to respond to Shea’s accusations after all council members spoke, this time lashing out at the Trump administration. “The United States’ fabrication of lies and groundless attacks against China are nothing but a pretext for seeking control of the canal,” he said. The Chinese envoy called the U.S. and its deployment of offensive weapons in the South China Sea area “the biggest disrupter of peace and stability” in the region, and he accused the administration of exacerbating risks to global maritime security. “China firmly opposes economic coercion and bullying practices and urges the United States to stop fabricating rumors, lies and creating trouble,” Fu said. Murillo then responded, saying he wanted to stress Panama’s sovereignty “in terms of the ownership of the canal” and the multilateral treaty governing its administration. He called the canal’s neutrality “the only and the best defense” to any specific or global threats.

Title: TMTG moves closer to launching spot Bitcoin ETF with amended S-1 filing

The prospective Truth Social Bitcoin ETF moves closer to reality as Trump Media files amendments, intensifying focus on its ambitious crypto vision. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) has filed its first amended registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF, advancing plans to enter the fast-growing spot Bitcoin ETF market. The ETF, to be listed on NYSE Arca under the ticker B.T., will hold Bitcoin (BTC) directly and seek to track the flagship crypto’s market price. Crypto.com will act as the exclusive custodian, prime execution agent, and liquidity provider, while Yorkville America Digital will serve as the ETF’s sponsor. The ETF’s structure allocates 70% of its assets to Bitcoin, with 15% in U.S. Treasury securities and 15% in cash or cash equivalents, aiming to balance exposure to the crypto with traditional financial instruments. The launch remains subject to SEC approval of both the updated Form S-1 registration and a separate Form 19b-4 listing application. The company has not provided a specific launch date but indicated it expects the fund to go live before year-end. TMTG, parent of the Truth Social social platform, streaming service Truth+, and fintech brand Truth.Fi, said the ETF forms part of a broader Bitcoin-focused strategy. The strategy includes building a corporate Bitcoin treasury and expanding into digital asset products through its financial services division. The company has already committed substantial capital to Bitcoin acquisitions this year, positioning itself among the more aggressive corporate entrants into the sector. If approved, the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF would enter a competitive landscape dominated by heavyweight issuers such as BlackRock, whose spot Bitcoin ETF has drawn billions in inflows since the first U.S. approvals in January and set multiple records. The ETFs have attracted a mix of institutional and retail investors seeking regulated exposure to Bitcoin without the need for self-custody. The filing also highlights the political dimension of TMTG’s crypto ambitions. President Donald Trump, the company’s majority shareholder, has made digital assets a policy priority, pledging to roll back what he calls restrictive regulations and promote U.S. leadership in the crypto economy. A spot Bitcoin ETF tied to a political brand of Trump’s profile would be unprecedented in the market, potentially attracting a distinct investor base but also intensifying public and regulatory scrutiny. The timing of the filing reflects an environment where spot Bitcoin ETFs are gaining mainstream acceptance and competitive differentiation is becoming critical. While the SEC has approved multiple products this year, new entrants face the challenge of building liquidity and investor trust in a market already served by established issuers.

The main reasons are likely lack of institutional interest and the complicated structure which the ETF is based on, analysts weigh in. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate.

REX Osprey Solana (SOL) exchange-traded fund (ETF) recorded zero trading activity on four of six trading days through August 8, according to Farside Investors data. Trading under ticker SSK, the fund posted no flows on Aug. 1, Aug. 4, Aug. 5, and Aug. 7, with minimal $6.4 million in activity on Aug. 8 and $2.7 million outflows on Aug. 6. REX Osprey’s fund is the first US-listed Solana ETF to integrate native staking mechanisms. The product operates outside standard SEC-registered spot ETF frameworks, delivering SOL exposure through indirect vehicles rather than direct crypto holdings. CoinShares flow data showed Solana products attracted $874 million in year-to-date inflows, staying behind Ethereum (ETH) and XRP among major cap altcoins despite its position as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The trading pattern could reflect broader institutional hesitation toward Solana-focused investment products compared to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum alternatives. Nansen senior research analyst Jake Kennis attributed the disparity to institutional portfolio allocation strategies. He explained in a note: “ETH is seeing a lot of new activity as institutions were likely underweight ETH relative to BTC. Solana has been mostly in the backseat for this new wave of attention, but SOL ETFs would likely pick up if institutions are looking to also diversify away from BTC and ETH.” The REX Osprey fund’s design incorporates staking mechanisms and offshore ETF allocations that differentiate it from traditional spot cryptocurrency products. Stabolut founder and CEO Eneko Knörr identified these features as adoption obstacles rather than demand deficiencies. Knörr said: “SSK’s quiet tape looks more like a brand and distribution issue than a pure demand problem. Its design isn’t a simple ‘spot SOL in a wrapper’—the fund stakes SOL and can allocate a portion into other SOL ETFs/ETPs, many offshore, which adds complexity that some buyers shy away from.” The fund charges a 0.75% management fee, positioning it at the higher end of cryptocurrency ETF expense ratios. Traditional spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs from major issuers typically carry fees between 0.15% and 0.25%. Kennis, from Nansen, noted that the fee structure creates a cost-benefit analysis for institutional investors weighing direct cryptocurrency exposure against ETF convenience. He referenced Solana’s approximately 7% annual staking rewards: “The staking component seems like a major feature given the ‘passive’ yield being left on the table.” The absence of major financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity in the Solana ETF space contributes to limited market penetration. REX Shares operates as a smaller ETF issuer without the distribution networks and brand recognition of Wall Street’s largest asset managers. Knörr argued: “Early trading will likely remain lumpy until bigger brands enter the space. Structure, complexity, and limited shelf space are holding it back—interest in Solana exposure itself doesn’t appear to be the issue.” As of Aug. 11, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is still considering the approval of Solana ETFs under the more tax-friendly 1933 Act.

Title: Why The Trump Administration MAGA Stock Dreams For Fannie And Freddie Could Be A Windfall For Wall Street

BySergei Klebnikov BySergei Klebnikov, Forbes Staff. The Trump administration is teeing up what could be the biggest shakeup in U.S. housing finance since the 2008 crisis—a pair of IPOs that might value Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac at a combined $500 billion. The plan, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal and is still being finalized by the administration, would see the federal government sell between 5% and 15% of each company, potentially raising about $30 billion in what would be one of the largest stock offerings in American history. Yet behind the fanfare lies a precarious gamble on institutions still tethered to taxpayer support and whose profitability is largely cushioned by an implicit government guarantee. Senior administration officials have in recent days confirmed the plans are far along, though crucial structural decisions—such as whether to list the two separately or together—remain unresolved. President Trump himself has signaled his intention to proceed with the listings this year: “I am working on TAKING THESE AMAZING COMPANIES PUBLIC, but I want to be clear, the U.S. Government will keep its implicit GUARANTEES,” he wrote on social media last week. On Saturday, he posted an edited picture of himself ringing the opening bell at the NYSE for a hypothetical, combined entity called the Great American Mortgage Corporation trading under the ticker “MAGA.” The Treasury—which currently holds the bulk of both government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) equity—could release new shares, sell existing ones, or blend both strategies to create liquidity. Wall Street heavyweights such as JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and Bank of America have reportedly been asked to advise on pricing and structure. The history of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is a cautionary tale. Fannie’s roots stretch back to 1938, Freddie’s to 1970; Both were designed to keep mortgage credit flowing by securitizing and guaranteeing home loans. Their business model—buying mortgages from lenders, bundling them into mortgage-backed securities and guaranteeing payment to investors—helped lower borrowing costs for generations of Americans. During the mid-2000s housing boom, both ramped up exposure to riskier loans and loosened underwriting standards, leaving them vulnerable when home prices crashed. During the housing bubble the top executives of these quasi-governmental agencies benefited from compensation packages in the tens of millions. By September 2008, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) had placed them into conservatorship after a combined $187 billion Treasury rescue, wiping out most private shareholder value. In the years since, the GSEs have returned to profitability, paying dividends that exceeded the bailout amount. Yet they have remained under government control, their retained earnings capped for much of the past decade until capital buffers were gradually rebuilt. FHFA’s 2024 Annual Report to Congress shows that by year-end, Fannie Mae’s total equity had grown $17 billion to $94.7 billion, while Freddie Mac’s climbed 24.8% to $59.6 billion. In a brief published earlier this year by Jim Parrott of the Urban Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, and Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, the two highlighted the importance of keeping the implicit federal guarantee post-IPO. “Critical to the rating agencies and the Fed is not that the GSEs posed little risk, but that they enjoyed the unlimited backing of the U.S. government,” they write, warning that without that support, funding costs could climb sharply—driving up mortgage rates by 0.6 to 0.9 percentage points as well as shrinking credit access. The pair go on to caution that ending conservatorship without a clear legislative or financial framework risks delivering “no value,” and could leave the system “less liquid and stable.” “We believe it’s essential for the government to retain the explicit government guarantee if they pursue privatization, which could take years to implement,” wrote Lawrence Gillum, chief fixed income Strategist for LPL Financial. “Removing the guarantee would disrupt both markets and make housing even less affordable.” A $30 billion stock sale by the Federal government would provide a one-time boost to Treasury’s coffers but it would only represent an estimated 1.6% slice of the current fiscal year’s projected $1.9 trillion deficit. After the sale it is likely that the Federal government would still own 85% to 95% of the government sponsored mortgage companies and thus benefit from any appreciation in its share price. The windfall would also extend beyond the public purse. Hedge fund billionaires such as Bill Ackman and John Paulson, who built large positions in the mortgage giants years ago betting on their return to the market, could reap outsized rewards if the IPOs hit their targets. Ackman, who has long advocated for the privatization of the two GSEs, owns roughly 10% of the common stock of both Fannie and Freddie through his fund, Pershing Square Capital Management. Ackman’s firm first invested in Fannie and Freddie common stock in late 2013, roughly five years after they were put under government conservatorship during the financial crisis. His cost basis for each averaged just over $2 per share. Today, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae currently trade at $9 per share and $11.50 per share, respectively. According to previous filings from his firm (Pershing Square stopped disclosing these specific holdings in regular filings several years ago), he owned 115.5 million shares of Fannie and 63.5 million shares of Freddie—that stake today would be worth roughly $1.8 billion. Wall Street underwriters also stand to collect millions in advisory fees. Banks like Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase were top originators for Freddie and Fannie last year, while institutions like BlackRock and PIMCO are significant holders of mortgage backed securities. If the Trump administration pulls it off, the planned Fannie and Freddie offerings could rank among the most ambitious privatizations in modern U.S. history. Still, trying to privatize much of the nation’s mortgage infrastructure during the worst housing affordability crisis in a generation will be no easy task, as critics have pointed out. The current administration will no doubt need to be more specific and methodical than they have been so far if they want to avoid losing investor confidence and causing a shock to the financial system.

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily The case of the "missing shares" started in 2021, and has wound its way through several jurisdictions. A takeover could be next. PARIS — SMCP, the parent company of Sandro, Maje, Claudie Pierlot, and Fursac, has regained control of a 15.5 percent stake of its capital as a result of a ruling by the Singapore High Court, following a lengthy legal battle. The group said Monday after market close that the shares — previously transferred in 2021 to Dynamic Treasure Group, a trust registered in the British Virgin Islands — have officially been returned to European TopSoho, a Luxembourg-based holding entity and former majority shareholder of SMCP. The return of the shares follows a July 4 decision by the court in Singapore, where the shares were being held. Related Articles Financial SMCP Q2 Sales Up 3% With Full-price Strategy Boosting Growth Financial SMCP Secures Singapore Court Victory in Battle Over Disputed Share Transfer “The return of the shares clarifies SMCP’s shareholding situation,” the company said in a statement. “The group remains focused on executing its profitable growth strategy, leveraging the desirability of its brands, its operational agility, and ongoing efforts in cost management.” You May Also Like The 15.5 percent stake has been at the center of a years-long shareholder dispute dating back to the financial collapse of Chinese conglomerate Shandong Ruyi, which had acquired a majority stake in SMCP in 2016 through European TopSoho ahead of the group’s 2017 initial public offering. This is the latest twist of the “missing shares” case that began in 2021, when 15.5 percent of the share capital “disappeared” from Luxembourg and reappeared in the British Virgin Islands two-and-a-half months later. They reappeared in the accounts of Dynamic Treasure Group, also controlled by European TopSoho director Chenran Qiu, the daughter of Shandong Ruyi’s founder. European TopSoho had sold them to Dynamic Treasure Group for a symbolic one euro. In the interim, European TopSoho also issued a press release denying Qiu’s involvement in Dynamic Treasure Group, misleading the market. The Singapore court ruling followed a similar decision by the English High Court in July 2024, which canceled the sale of the shares to Dynamic Treasure Group. Jurisdiction moved to Singapore, where the shares were being held in local accounts. European TopSoho, which entered bankruptcy proceedings in February 2023, is now under the control of a court-appointed administrator in Luxembourg. The return of the 15.5 percent stake won’t immediately change control of SMCP but does bring greater transparency to investors. London-based GLAS currently acts as trustee for European TopSoho’s creditors, including BlackRock, Carlyle, Anchorage, Boussard and Gavaudan, who remain SMCP’s largest shareholders. Last year, GLAS revealed its intention to offload 37 percent of the group’s shares — a move that could trigger a mandatory takeover under French law if a single buyer snaps them up. In its second-quarter financial results released July 29, SMCP posted 3.3 percent organic sales growth to 304.5 million euros, as the group doubled down on full-price sales and tighter inventory controls. Chief executive officer Isabelle Guichot’s recovery strategy continues to focus on stabilizing the business following store closures in China, while expanding in new markets including India and the Philippines, and focusing investment on its core brands Sandro and Maje.

Posted in: Comics, Current News | Tagged: Ad Populum, diamond Diamond Comic Distributors was burning through 1.3 million dollars a week back in April this year A transcript from the Diamond Comic Distributors chapter 11 bankruptcy court session held on the 30th of April has been unsealed. Checking the Bleeding Cool Diamond Bankruptcy Timeline, we discover that this is the day that the courts approved of the sale of Diamond Comic Distributors to the joint back-up bid of Universal and Ad Populum. But it was also the day after the bankruptcy auction winners Alliance Entertainment or AENT sued Diamond Comic Distributors Inc, the debtors in this case, for fraud, alleging the debtors withheld information about their Wizards of the Coast contract. WOTC withdrew from supplying Diamond after the auction, a contract worth tens of millions of dollars a year, and it was AENT's contention that Diamond knew this was coming and withheld the information from AENT, as it would have affected the bid price, something they estimated at around $13 million. Without Diamond agreeing to such a price reduction, AENT pulled out of their $85 million bid for Diamond. As a result, the backup – and originally preferred – bidders of Universal and Ad Populum were chosen, albeit for only $72.3 million, a $7.6 million cut for Universal and $5.5 million for Ad Populum on their auction bids, after renegotiation. Chief Judge David Rice presided over the proceedings. Attorney Mark Minuti of Saul Ewing, representing Diamond Comic Distributors, Inc., the debtors in the chapter 11 bankruptcy case, opened by providing context on the case's rapid deterioration. "A lot has been happening in the case, Your Honor, and unfortunately, most of what's happening has not been good." Detailing the supplier fallout, Robert Gorin, co-Chief Revenue Officer at Diamond, took to the witness stand, and was asked by the Judge if they considered opening the sale to the wider market again, as they did in the original auction. He replied, "Time is not our friend here. We are burning cash… about 1.2, 1.3 million a week." Now this was back in April, of course. But there is nothing to suggest this has gone down. In the Diamond financial filings for May 2025, the most recent such document that has been filed, if we exclude the comics and games business asset sales entries, the remaining loss appears to be approximately a $12 million loss for that month. Of this, the loss on sales alone, not counting payroll, rent, and other operating expenses, was reported as a $7.5 million loss. Diamond's professional fees and expenses, to Raymond James Financial, Getzler Henrich & Associates, and lead counsel Saul Ewing, LLP, were reported to be $1,182,225 for that month. Gorin told us "On April 17th we got an unexpected email from a vendor, an important vendor that said they were not going to renew their contract with the company." This is Wizards Of The Coasts of course, efforts to reverse this included a video conference, but "ultimately they came back the next day in writing and said they were not going to change their mind." Jason Teele of Sills Cummis & Gross, representing AENT, objected to the expedited hearing, citing less than twelve hours' notice and questioning a price reduction coincidence, saying "the purchase price under the new Sale Agreement has been reduced by an aggregate of approximately 13 or so million dollars, which is almost precisely the same amount that Raymond James, the Debtors investment bankers suggested to Alliance's investment bankers would be an appropriate reduction in the purchase price given the loss of the Debtor's largest vendor contract had the Debtors negotiated that issue with Alliance in good faith, which, of course, they did not. So it's very curious that a reduction in price of the same magnitude that was called for upon discovery of this material adverse change is exactly the reduction in purchase price offered to the backup bidder." He also wasn't happy that paperwork was being redacted. "It's concerning to Alliance, and I suggest it should be concerning to the Court, that the provision of the Universal Asset Purchase Agreement discussing material adverse changes and what can and can't be done in the event of a material adverse change is redacted… what do those redactions or unredacted version of that paragraph actually disclose? We don't know. I have theories, but those are just theories and speculation." As for those theories suggested by Teele, we can read between the lines. "There was no accounting for the fraud that we encountered as part of the closing process. That is the subject — one of the subjects of the Adversary Proceeding that I expect will be fully heard by the Court in due course. But I just want to point out that but for the discovery of that information, which had been concealed from at least Alliance, perhaps other bidders as well, we would have closed last Friday." It is worth knowing that Diamond owes AENT a significant sum as well, from the auction process. Teele added, "But I suggest that Alliance does have standing, not only as a prepetition Creditor holding a small dollar claim, but also as a postpetition Creditor to the extent of the $8.5 million deposit, which the Debtors have unreasonably refused to refund" Judge Rice asked Robert Gorin if Diamond had "ever given any thought to simply shutting down the business and liquidating the inventory or the other assets that were there?" Gorin replied, "We did, and we also had these conversations with the consultation parties as well, and our liquidation analysis shows it's significantly lower recovery to liquidate than to sell." And on why an extension in the DIP funding from JPMorgan Chase was necessary, "we need to keep running the company in the ordinary course, we need to be able to make payroll, we need to be able to pay our vendors and keep the airplane flying. As I keep telling everybody, we're trying to hold the airplane together while we're flying, and that is what we're trying to do. And we need the lender's help to do that." The DIP was extended but those vendors didn't seem to get paid. At least not yet. Gianfranco Finizio of Lowenstein Sandler, representing the Unsecured Creditors' Committee, supported the sales despite frustrations, saying, "We now find ourselves pivoting to the backup bidders. They've been, unfortunately, opportunistic. You've heard Mr. Minuti describe the value degradation in the bids. But we don't have a backup to the backup bidder. We don't have the luxury of time to go out and market these assets. The Committee thinks that we need to stop the bleed immediately, whether that's the bleed of finding a new buyer, the $1.2 million burn that Mr. Minuti referenced… These sales in this case should not be run for the sole benefit of JPM. You know, two weeks ago, we were in a very different scenario where we were in the money, and there was excess proceeds. But now, a lot has changed, and this sale cannot be just for the sole benefit of paying JPMorgan down and leaving administrative Creditors exposed" and adding "it's as clear as mud to us on what the post-sale Estate looks like". That would be JPMorgan Chase, the banks, represented by Jonathan Young of Troutman Pepper Locke who echoed support for the sale but noted the burn rate's impact: "The longer it takes to get to a monetization event, the greater the burn, the more my client has to consider lending, and the less distributable value for everyone." The US Trustee Gerard Vetter observed without opposition, citing "concerning allegations" but deferring on the sale. Judge Rice approved the motions, finding them a "sound exercise of the business judgment by the Debtors." He noted the "unusual course of events" but emphasised urgency: "That it's been a little bit difficult… is the reason why approving these matters today… is really necessary to protect the value of this Estate." It has been 31 weeks since Diamond entered Chapter 11. I refer the honourable members to the case of Jarndyce vs Jarndyce in Bleak House by Charles Dickens… You can use these Diamond tabs to keep up with the latest on Bleeding Cool.

Club: Blackrock/Leinster County: Wexford Age: 22 Position: Flanker Wafer had been an injury concern after knee surgery, but is thankfully included in the World Cup squad. She won the 2025 Six Nations Player of the Tournament, was part of the 2024 World Rugby Dream Team, and was player of the match in the victory over New Zealand at the WXV1 tournament last year. Following the World Cup, she’s set for a move to Harlequins. Club: Railway Union/Munster County: Tipperary Age: 30 Position: Winger Perhaps best known for her Sevens antics, having been part of the Ireland team at the Paris Olympics, Costigan (formerly Murphy Crowe) is the Irish record-holder for most tries and was a try-scorer against England in this year’s Six Nations.

The Roscommon native has been part of the Sevens system since 2021 and got her first 15s cap in 2022, amassing a further 16 since. Club: Old Belvedere/Leinster County: Offaly Age: 22 Position: Inside centre Named in the 2025 Six Nations Team of the Tournament, and player of the match in Ireland’s win over Italy, Dalton finished last season with a Women’s Player’s Player of the Year at the Rugby Player Ireland Awards.

Club: Galwegians/Connacht County: Galway Age: 32 Position: Outhalf Last year’s Connacht Player of the Year, Fowley earned her first international cap in November 2016 against England.

Scored 52 points in this year’s Celtic Challenge. Club: Old Belvedere/Leinster County: Kildare Age: 22 Position: Second row In her first international game, Campbell started against Australia in September 2024, lasting the full 80 minutes. Her first Six Nations start came in March against France. Previously played for Naas before moving to Old Belvedere. Club: Cooke RFC/Ulster County: Donegal Age: 21 Position: Prop McGrath has had a rapid rise to the senior international squad, having got into rugby when she was 14. Since then, she’s played under-18s for Ulster and Ireland, and captained the Clovers against Byrthon Thunder. Club: Gloucester Hartpury/Ulster County: Meath Age: 32 Position: Second row Former Meath footballer, Monaghan offers leadership and experience in this young side. In 2024, she co-captained the team for the Six Nations with Edel McMahon but was unlucky to miss out on this year’s campaign due to injury. Club: Railway Union/Munster County: Clare Age: 30 Position: Prop/second row McCarthy picked up rugby after Ireland’s Grand Slam in 2013, joining Shannon RFC before eventually persuading her twin Kate to do the same, later playing together for Railway Union.

Title: On theCUBE Pod: OpenAI’s ecosystem play, Nvidia’s open-source question and the race for AI dominance
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/08/11/openai-ecosystem-play-nvidias-open-source-ai-dominance-thecubepod/
Time Published: 2025-08-11T18:01:50Z

UPDATED 14:01 EDT / AUGUST 11 2025 by Chad Wilson The OpenAI ecosystem is undergoing a rapid transformation, redefining how frontier artificial intelligence models are deployed, monetized and integrated into enterprise workflows. With moves that widen its partnerships beyond long-standing alliances, OpenAI Inc. is positioning itself for a new era of scale, developer adoption and competitive resilience. In this week’s episode of theCUBE Pod, John Furrier (pictured, left), executive analyst at theCUBE Research, and Dave Vellante (right), chief analyst at theCUBE Research, talk about how industry watchers are tracking a confluence of strategic shifts: horizontal expansion into multiple cloud environments, fresh licensing approaches through open weights and the unveiling of GPT-5 with improved coding capabilities. These developments OpenAI ecosystem come amid rising speculation about an IPO and a potential recalibration of the company’s relationship with Microsoft Corp. “This is a huge deal because it’s the open-source license. There’s a story hiding in plain sight that no one’s talking about,” Furrier said. “I think the signaling that I’m reading between the tea leaves is OpenAI is losing the relationship; there’s a breakup coming with Microsoft’s. Clearly decoupling going on.” OpenAI’s decision to launch on Amazon Web Services Inc., with models running from day one, marks a notable broadening of its cloud presence. This strategic alignment not only grants AWS a new AI asset in its portfolio but also gives OpenAI access to thousands of enterprise customers beyond Microsoft Azure. The company’s simultaneous move to make open-weight models available could further entice developers seeking to customize AI for their specific verticals, opening up the OpenAI ecosystem even more according to Vellante. “I was on the Nvidia analyst call. The big question is what’s OpenAI’s commitment to open source,” he said. “It’s not only open source, it’s open weights. To me, that’s the more interesting piece of this because if it’s open weights, then enterprises can customize it for their own needs, but it’s a GPT-3 class model. It’s now two generations behind the state-of-the-art because today GPT-5 came out.” The launch of GPT-5 underscores how quickly the competitive landscape is evolving. OpenAI’s latest model delivers notable improvements in reasoning, accuracy and code generation — areas critical to AI’s next adoption wave. Paired with a multicloud strategy, these product advances hint at an intentional decoupling from Microsoft in favor of a more balanced partner portfolio, Furrier explained. “OpenAI clearly is playing an ecosystem play,” he said. “If you look at the narratives … it is absolutely a go-to-market ecosystem move by OpenAI. they are clearly going horizontal in the execution. That is a direct counter to a relationship with Microsoft that is a decoupling hedge or intentional plan to expand the base.” Beyond the OpenAI ecosystem narrative, the discussion also touched on other significant developments shaping tech and business strategy. From policy-driven shifts in crypto markets to legacy chipmakers facing innovation pressure, theCUBE’s coverage continues to link macro trends with on-the-ground insight from key venues. At events such as Black Hat, AI security implications remain top of mind. Meanwhile, on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, conversations in the “NYSE Wired: Crypto Trailblazers” series are bringing together founders, investors and policymakers to discuss the future of digital assets — especially as the GENIUS Act introduces clearer regulations for stablecoins and institutional adoption accelerates, according to Furrier. “This is going to bring in Fidelity, it’s going to bring in all the top people,” he said. “You can now back stable coins with payments. All the deposit institutions, federal agencies, the regulatory antiquated system has been the bottleneck in crypto. GENIUS Act is one, the AI stuff that they’re doing, these are policy things that they’re grinding out and people don’t appreciate this.” Chip industry challenges were also spotlighted through analysis of Intel’s recent struggles and strategic opportunities. Calls from former Intel board members for structural and IP-related changes reflect a broader urgency for U.S. semiconductor competitiveness, particularly against ARM-based architectures and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd’s cost advantages, Vellante detailed. “The problem with their scenario … is Operation Warp Speed might work for vaccines, but it doesn’t work for silicon,” Vellante said. “The second, as I said, the cap table is too complicated. The third is it completely leaves TSM out of the picture. You take their cash and you take their commitment and you give them guaranteed supply over time.

Title: 120 Million Square Feet: Store Closings In The United States Are On Pace To Set A New Record High In 2025

Editor Economy Michael Snyder, The Economic Collapse Blog If everything is going to be just fine, why are thousands of stores closing all over the country? So far this year, the total amount of retail space that has been permanently closed has surpassed 120 million square feet. We have never seen anything like this before. Store closings spiked during the early days of the pandemic, but in 2025 stores are being permanently shuttered at an even faster pace. In fact, during the first six months of this year 5,822 store closures were recorded… Store closures across the U.S. continue to rise, and remain on track to far significantly surpass both new openings and the figures seen in 2024. According to a new report from research and advisory firm Coresight Research, cited by CoStar News, 5,822 store closures were recorded as of June 27, compared to 3,496 closures announced during the same period of 2024. If stores continue to close at this rate, we will break the old record that was established during the pandemic by a wide margin. We are also being told that the total amount of retail space that has been permanently shuttered in 2025 has reached a staggering 120 million square feet… In June, store closings by Plano, Texas-based home goods seller At Home and Philadelphia-based pharmacy chain Rite Aid, which have both filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, “pushed the total amount of retail space to close in the U.S. this year to over 120 million square feet,” Coresight said. The real estate churn is happening “as cyclical impacts confront structural shifts,” according to one executive at the research firm. Wow. You may have noticed that there are an increasing number of abandoned buildings in your particular area. Sadly, this is just the beginning. Consumers are under more financial stress than we have ever seen, and that has resulted in a substantial decline in store traffic… Many of the retail store closures are a result of declining store traffic as more consumers respond to inflation by reducing spending. There also are more consumers turning to online shopping especially for apparel, accessories and household items. The winner is not merely Amazon but increased competition from Temu and Shein marketplaces and social commerce outlets like TikTok. Needless to say, more stores are being closed down with each passing day. After filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, Claire’s announced that it will be closing 18 more stores… Claire’s, a mall-based teen accessories retailer, has identified several locations across the country it plans to close after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Claire’s U.S., which operates Claire’s and Icing stores, made the filing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware on Wednesday. It’s the second time since 2018 the company has filed for bankruptcy. While the company says the majority of its retail stores will remain open while it “continues to explore all strategic alternatives,” Claire’s said it identified 18 stores ahead of the Aug. 6 bankruptcy filing it would close, filings show. And home goods retailer At Home just announced that it will be closing 6 more stores… The home goods retailer At Home is closing an additional six stores across the country, bringing its total closure tally to more than two dozen as it grapples with high debt and dwindling sales. The furniture and home decor retailer based in Coppell, Texas, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on June 16, pointing to “broader economic and retail-specific market pressures,” in court documents. The bankruptcy filing and store closures follow several other “big box” retailers that have also significantly downsized their brick-and-mortar footprints this year, including Big Lots, Joann Fabrics, Kohl’s, JCPenney, Macy’s, and Party City. The retailer intially announced 26 store closures in June, before paring that down to 24 when it decided to keep open two stores in New Jersey and Wisconsin. The company added another six stores to the list, according to a statement by retail firm Hilco Consumer-Retail on Aug. 1, bringing the current number of stores it will shutter in the coming months to 30. We see more stories like this every single day. So what is going to happen if our economic momentum continues to take us very rapidly in the wrong direction? Earlier today, we learned that the percentage of student loans entering serious delinquency is absolutely exploding… The total amount of outstanding student loan debt was $1.64 trillion in the second quarter of 2025 after rising by $7 billion in the quarter. Additionally, the share of student loan debt entering serious delinquency, considered 90 days or more late, jumped to 12.9% at the end of June, up from 8% in March and above pre-pandemic trends that were around 9-10% from 2012 into early 2020, when the moratorium initially took effect. The American people are drowning in debt, and I expect delinquency rates of all types to continue to rise in the months ahead. We are going to see more layoffs too, and the fact that continuing claims for unemployment benefits just hit their highest level since 2021 is not a good sign at all… Recurring applications for unemployment benefits surged to the highest since November 2021, adding to recent signs that the labor market is weakening. Continuing claims, a proxy for the number of people receiving benefits, rose by 38,000 to 1.97 million in the week ended July 26, according to Labor Department data released Thursday. On top of everything else, U.S. manufacturing activity is now in contraction territory… From March to July, U.S. manufacturing activity contracted, according to the Institute for Supply Management’s monthly survey. The Manufacturing PMI last registered at 48, below the 50 score that differentiates growth and decline. The effective average tariff rate on all imported goods now stands at around roughly 18% versus 2.3% last year, the highest levels since the 1930s. We are in so much trouble. After evaluating all of the latest economic numbers that have come in, Mark Zandi has come to the conclusion that the “economy is on the precipice of recession”… Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, on Monday wrote a post on X that the “economy is on the precipice of recession” – citing the weaker-than-expected jobs report released Friday and the inflation data from the previous day that showed consumer prices rose as indicating the economy’s precarious position. “Consumer spending has flatlined, construction and manufacturing are contracting, and employment is set to fall. And with inflation on the rise, it is tough for the Fed to come to the rescue,” he wrote. It is hard to argue with him. Of course what is eventually coming is going to be so much worse than just a “recession”. As conditions deteriorate, will store closings slow down or will they speed up? The answer to that question is obvious. If there are stores in your local area that you really enjoy, I would visit them now while you still can, because they might not be there next year.

Title: The new American workplace crisis: Return-to-office mandates lead to a working mom exodus

She was previously an editorial leader at Bankrate, The Points Guy, and Business Insider, and a reporter at Bloomberg News. Ashley is a graduate of Ohio University's Scripps School of Journalism. The historic surge in employment among working mothers seen during the pandemic has reversed sharply in 2025, as new data reveal tens of thousands of American women, especially those with young children, leaving the workforce. According to federal labor statistics analyzed by the Washington Post, the labor force participation rate for women ages 25 to 44 with children under 5 fell nearly three percentage points between January and June 2025, reaching its lowest level in over three years. Fortune’s analysis integrates these workforce shifts with a broader view of corporate America’s changing priorities. Our coverage finds: This pullback follows the widespread rollback of remote and flexible work policies that initially ushered many mothers back to the job market. Major corporations and the federal government have now instituted strict return-to-office mandates, requiring five-days-a-week in-person attendance. For many mothers, the loss of flexibility means a logistical and financial reckoning. JPMorgan Chase, AT&T, and Amazon, among others, ramped up their in-office requirements in 2025, with Fortune reporting that the share of Fortune 500 companies with full-time mandates nearly doubled since late 2024. Employers report difficulty replacing departed female talent, with overall productivity suffering as a result. Compounding these changes are rising childcare costs, closures of childcare centers due to lapsing federal aid, and a noticeable trend toward traditional gender roles. Social media movements like #tradwife encourage women to prioritize home and children, amplified by calls from political leaders for more parents to stay home. For many families facing unaffordable childcare, the decision is an economic necessity rather than a cultural choice. Black women and those with college degrees have been hit especially hard. The unemployment rate for Black women climbed to its highest in nearly four years; federal layoffs and the dismantling of diversity initiatives eliminated stable jobs that disproportionately supported minority women. Experts interviewed by both the Washington Post and Fortune warn that these trends, if left unchecked, will have “huge implications” for women’s lifetime earnings, career prospects, and retirement security. With breaks in employment history, women frequently return to lower-paying jobs and face diminished opportunities for advancement. Studies, including a 2024 University of Pittsburgh analysis, similarly show that aggressive return-to-office mandates have led to a loss of senior employees—many of them women—threatening productivity and competitiveness.

Microsoft reportedly preparing to boost in-office working When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Microsoft could be the latest tech giant to explore a stricter in-office working policy, with reports claiming the company is reportedly considering enacting a three-day office-working policy for most employees. Until now, workers have been able to spend around half of their time at home (or away from the office) despite rivals like Amazon enforcing stricter full-time office-working policies. A Microsoft spokesperson told Business Insider the company had been exploring changes to the policy, but no official alterations have been made yet. The report claims an official Microsoft announcement could come as soon as September 2025, with rollout of any changes arriving as soon as January 2026, although dates and indeed policies may vary depending on location. Reports of upcoming changes come after the company has made other changes to its workforce, including ongoing worker readjustments and an updated PIP framework to more quickly exit underperforming workers. In July 2025, Microsoft laid off around 9,000 of its workers, and two months earlier in May a further 6,000 workers lost their jobs. Company CFO Amy Hood told workers in an internal memo (see by Business Insider) that they should prepare for another year of "intensity."

"We're entering FY26 with clear priorities in security, quality, and AI transformation, building on our momentum and grounded in our mission and growth-mindset culture," she added. Although the company has undergone major layoffs in recent months, hiring efforts in other areas and a broader restructuring has seen minimal changes to actual overall headcount. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently said the layoffs had been "weighing heavily" on him, likening the ongoing transformation to that of the 1990s, when PCs and software became democratized, blaming the shifts on evolving customer needs. Microsoft told us that it is looking at refreshing its flexible working guidelines, as it has done many times before. The company has a page dedicated to its flexible work approach, which reads "No 'one size fits all'."

Title: A US senator from Colombia emerges as a Trump link for Latin America’s conservatives
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/08/11/senate-moreno-latin-america/
Time Published: 2025-08-11T16:38:35Z
Full Content:
By JOSHUA GOODMAN and JULIE CARR SMYTH MIAMI (AP) — When Republican Sen. Bernie Moreno visits Colombia this week as part of a three-nation tour of Latin America, it will be something of a homecoming. The Ohio senator, who defeated an incumbent last year with the help of Donald Trump’s endorsement and the highest political ad spending in U.S. Senate race history, was born in Bogota and has brothers who are heavyweights in politics and business there. Moreno has emerged as an interlocutor for conservatives in Latin America seeking to connect with the Trump administration. In an interview with The Associated Press ahead of the trip, he expressed deep concern about Colombia’s direction under left-wing President Gustavo Petro and suggested that U.S. sanctions, higher tariffs or other retaliatory action might be needed to steer it straight. The recent criminal conviction of former President Alvaro Uribe, a conservative icon, was an attempt to “silence” the man who saved Colombia from guerrilla violence, Moreno said. Meanwhile, record cocaine production has left the United States less secure — and Colombia vulnerable to being decertified by the White House for failing to cooperate in the war on drugs. “The purpose of the trip is to understand all the dynamics before any decision is made,” said Moreno, who will meet with both Petro and Uribe, as well as business leaders and local officials. “But there’s nothing that’s taken off the table at this point and there’s nothing that’s directly being contemplated.” Moreno, a luxury car dealer from Cleveland, defeated incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown last year and became Ohio’s senior senator on practically his first day in office after his close friend JD Vance resigned the Senate to become vice president. In Congress, Moreno has mimicked Trump’s rhetoric to attack top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer as a “miserable old man out of a Dickens novel,” called on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates and threatened to subpoena California officials over their response to anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles. On Latin America, he’s been similarly outspoken, slamming Petro on social media as a “socialist dictator” and accusing Mexico of being on the path to becoming a “narco state.” Such comments barely register in blue-collar Ohio, but they’ve garnered attention in Latin America. That despite the fact Moreno hasn’t lived in the region for decades, speaks Spanish with a U.S. accent and doesn’t sit on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “He’s somebody to watch,” said Michael Shifter, the former president of the Inter-American Dialogue in Washington. “He’s one of the most loyal Trump supporters in the senate and given his background in Latin America he could be influential on policy.” Moreno, 58, starts his first congressional delegation to Latin America on Monday for two days of meetings in Mexico City with officials including President Claudia Sheinbaum. He’ll be accompanied by Terrance Cole, the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, who is making his first overseas trip since being confirmed by the Senate last month to head the premier federal narcotics agency. Moreno, in the pre-trip interview, said that Sheinbaum has done more to combat the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. than her predecessor and mentor Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who he described as a “total disaster.” But he said more cooperation is needed, and he’d like to see Mexico allow the DEA to participate in judicial wiretaps like it has for decades in Colombia and allow it to bring back a plane used in bilateral investigations that López Obrador grounded. “The corruption becomes so pervasive, that if it’s left unchecked, it’s kind of like treating cancer,” said Moreno. “Mexico has to just come to the realization that it does not have the resources to completely wipe out the drug cartels. And it’s only going to be by asking the U.S. for help that we can actually accomplish that.” From Mexico, Moreno heads to Panama, where he’ll tour the Panama Canal with Trump’s new ambassador to the country, Kevin Marino Cabrera. In March, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate struck a deal that would’ve handed control of two ports on either end of the U.S.-built canal to American investment firm BlackRock Inc. The deal was heralded by Trump, who had threatened to take back the canal to curb Chinese influence. However, the deal has since drawn scrutiny from antitrust authorities in Beijing and last month the seller said it was seeking to add a strategic partner from mainland China — reportedly state-owned shipping company Cosco — to the deal. “Cosco you might as well say is the actual communist party,” said Moreno. “There’s no scenario in which Cosco can be part of the Panamanian ports.” On the final leg of the tour in Colombia, Moreno will be joined by another Colombian American senator: Ruben Gallego, Democrat of Arizona. In contrast to Moreno, who was born into privilege and counts among his siblings a former ambassador to the U.S., Gallego and his three sisters were raised by an immigrant single mother on a secretary’s paycheck. Despite their different upbringings, the two have made common cause in seeking to uphold the tradition of bilateral U.S. support for Colombia, for decades Washington’s staunchest ally in the region. It’s a task made harder by deepening polarization in both countries. The recent sentencing of Uribe to 12 years of house arrest in a long-running witness tampering case has jolted the nation’s politics with nine months to go before decisive presidential elections. The former president is barred from running but remains a powerful leader, and Moreno said his absence from the campaign trail could alter the playing field. He also worries that surging cocaine production could once again lead to a “narcotization” of a bilateral relationship that should be about trade, investment and mutual prosperity. “We want Colombia to be strong, we want Colombia to be healthy, we want Colombia to be prosperous and secure, and I think the people of Colombia want the exact same thing,” he added. “So, the question is, how do we get there?” Smyth reported from Columbus, Ohio.

Title: Ethereum Bullish Fundamentals Clash With Short-Term Leverage Risks

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ethereum reached multi-year highs, breaking decisively above the $4,300 level after several days of strong bullish momentum. This breakout marks Ethereum’s highest level since late 2021, fueled by growing institutional demand, ETF inflows, and expanding on-chain activity. However, fresh market data from CryptoQuant suggests that caution may be warranted in the short term. The all-exchange Estimated Leverage Ratio (ELR) has climbed to 0.68, approaching historical highs and signaling excessive market-wide leverage. While Binance’s ELR sits lower at 0.52, indicating more measured positioning on the world’s largest exchange, higher relative leverage on other platforms points to elevated speculative activity elsewhere. Ethereum’s price is currently testing a critical resistance zone between $4,020 and $4,060—a historically pivotal area that has often determined whether a rally accelerates or faces a sharp pullback. Adding to the short-term risk profile, Binance netflows have spiked significantly above the all-exchange average, suggesting concentrated inflows that may lead to localized sell pressure, possibly linked to liquidations or arbitrage-driven trades. According to Crypto Onchain, a CryptoQuant analyst, Ethereum’s mid-term fundamentals remain strongly bullish despite short-term caution signals. Institutional demand is surging, with US Spot Ethereum ETFs recording a record $726.6 million in daily net inflows, driven by giants like BlackRock and Fidelity. This has pushed total ETF holdings above 5 million ETH (valued at approximately $20.3 billion), a milestone that underscores Ethereum’s growing role in institutional portfolios. Beyond ETFs, major players are increasing direct exposure. Ark Invest purchased 30,755 ETH worth $108.57 million, while Fundamental Global allocated $200 million to ETH as part of its treasury strategy. This wave of accumulation reflects deepening confidence in Ethereum’s long-term utility and value proposition. On-chain metrics also paint a bullish picture. Transaction volumes are hitting new highs, and staking participation continues to expand, locking up more ETH and reducing circulating supply. Regulatory clarity—such as the SEC closing investigations into liquid staking—has further strengthened structural demand for ETH. Upcoming network upgrades, including Pectra and Fusaka, are set to boost scalability and lower costs. This will enhance Ethereum’s appeal to both developers and enterprises. In the short term, high leverage, key resistance levels, and concentrated exchange inflows pose a risk of sharp volatility. However, the mid-term outlook remains intact, supported by sustained institutional inflows, robust network growth, and technological advancements. Even if near-term corrections occur, these factors should help cap downside pressure and maintain Ethereum’s broader bullish trajectory. Ethereum’s 4-hour chart shows a strong breakout above the key resistance at $3,860, which had capped price action in late July. Following this decisive move, ETH surged past the $4,300 level, marking its highest point since November 2021. This rally was supported by strong bullish momentum, as seen in the steep incline of the 50-period SMA (blue) and the price holding well above the 100-period (green) and 200-period (red) SMAs. Currently, ETH is consolidating just below its recent peak, around $4,240, signaling a potential pause before the next move. This consolidation at elevated levels, rather than a sharp retracement, suggests that bulls remain in control. The $3,860–$3,900 zone now acts as a critical support, and a retest could provide a healthy setup for continuation. Volume spikes during the breakout indicate strong buying interest, but the reduced volume in the latest candles suggests the market is waiting for fresh catalysts. A sustained move above $4,300 could open the door toward the $4,450–$4,500 zone, while a breakdown below $3,860 would weaken the bullish structure.

Title: Computer Science Graduates Struggle to Find Jobs During Tech Layoffs and AI Boom

Despite years of promises from tech leaders about lucrative coding careers, recent computer science graduates are facing a challenging job market due to the rise of AI programming tools and widespread layoffs in the tech industry. Some are taking jobs at fast food restaurants while they plan their next move. The New York Times reports that the allure of high-paying tech jobs has driven a surge in computer science education over the past decade, with the number of undergraduates majoring in the field more than doubling since 2014. Tech executives have long touted coding skills as a golden ticket to economic success, promising six-figure starting salaries and generous perks to those who pursue computer science degrees. However, the reality for many recent graduates is far less rosy. The spread of AI programming tools that can rapidly generate code, combined with significant layoffs at major tech companies like Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, has dimmed prospects for those seeking entry-level positions in the industry. Among college graduates aged 22 to 27, computer science and computer engineering majors are facing some of the highest unemployment rates at 6.1 percent and 7.5 percent respectively — more than double the rate for biology and art history graduates. As Breitbart News has previously reported, another factor impacting the hire of new grads at tech companies is the influx of H-1B visa workers from India and China even as the companies lay off American workers: According to data compiled by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service, Microsoft has applied for 4,712 H-1B visas in the 2025 fiscal year alone. However, anecdotal evidence from former employees and industry insiders suggests that the actual number may be closer to 6,000, although this figure has not been independently verified. The use of H-1B visas by large corporations has long been a contentious issue, with critics arguing that they allow companies to replace American workers with cheaper foreign labor. Supporters of the program, however, maintain that it enables businesses to attract top talent from around the world and remain competitive in a global marketplace. Microsoft’s history of H-1B visa applications aligns with this perspective, as the company filed 9,491 applications in the 2024 fiscal year, with nearly all of them being approved. In response to questions from the Times, more than 150 college students and recent graduates from state schools including the universities of Maryland, Texas and Washington, as well as private universities like Cornell and Stanford, shared their experiences trying to get a job. Some claim to have applied to hundreds, and in some cases thousands, of tech jobs at companies, nonprofits and government agencies. Graduates from prestigious universities and state schools alike report facing a grueling process of coding assessments, technical interviews, and ultimately, rejection. Many describe the job search experience as “demoralizing,” “disheartening,” and “soul-crushing,” with some feeling “gaslit” by the tech industry about their career prospects. Some recent grads have even resorted to taking fast food jobs to generate income as they continue to pursue a career aligned with their major. One respondent said Chipotle was the only company that actually replied to her application, while another was rejected by McDonald’s for lacking experience. The rise of AI coding assistants is a particular concern for the students, as these tools reduce the need for companies to hire junior software engineers. Entry-level positions are now the most likely to be automated, leaving new graduates struggling to find a foothold in the industry. Additionally, many universities are just beginning to train students on these cutting-edge AI tools, putting recent graduates at a disadvantage. Job seekers feel they are caught in an AI “doom loop,” using specialized tools to mass-apply to positions while companies deploy AI systems to automatically screen resumes and reject candidates. Even government tech jobs, once seen as a stable alternative, have become more difficult to secure due to cutbacks and hiring freezes. As the job market shifts, some graduates are pivoting to other areas of the tech industry, such as marketing and sales, or highlighting their uniquely human skills like creativity. Others remain determined to pursue software engineering roles, building personal projects to showcase their abilities to potential employers. Read more at the New York Times here.

Title: Ford to build EV pickup with a starting price of $30K in bid to catch China rivals
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/08/11/business/ford-to-build-ev-pickup-with-a-starting-price-of-30k/
Time Published: 2025-08-11T15:44:33Z
Full Content:
Ford plans to start rolling out its new family of affordable electric vehicles in 2027, including a midsize pickup truck with a target starting price of $30,000, the company said on Monday, as it aspires to the cost efficiency of Chinese rivals. The new midsize four-door pickup will be assembled at the automaker’s Louisville, Ky., plant. Ford is investing nearly $2 billion in the plant, which produces the Escape and Lincoln Corsair, retaining at least 2,200 jobs, it said in a statement. Chinese carmakers such as BYD have streamlined their supply chain and production system to produce EVs at a fraction of the cost of Western automakers. While these vehicles have yet to enter the US market, Ford CEO Jim Farley said they set a new standard that companies like Ford must match. “I can’t tell you with 100% certainty that this will all go just right,” Farley told a crowd at Ford’s Louisville assembly plant on Monday, noting that past efforts by US automakers to build affordable cars had fizzled. “It is a bet. There is risk.” Ford has been developing its affordable EVs through its so-called skunkworks team, filled with talent from EV rivals Tesla and Rivian. The California-based group, led by former Tesla executive Alan Clarke, has set itself so much apart from the larger Ford enterprise that Farley said even his badge could not get him into its building for some time. EVs sold for an average of about $47,000 in June, J.D. Power data showed. Many Chinese models sell for $10,000 to $25,000. Affordability is a top concern among EV shoppers, auto executives have said, and the global competition for delivering cheaper electric models is heating up. EV startup Slate, backed by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, is aiming for a starting price in the mid-$20,000s for its electric pickup. Tesla has teased a cheaper model, with production ramping up later this year. Rivian and Lucid are also planning to roll out lower-priced models for their lineups, although price points are in the $40,000s to $50,000s. Since rolling out plans earlier this decade to push hard into EVs, Ford has pulled back as the losses piled up. It has scaled back many of its EV goals, canceled an electric three-row SUV, and axed a program to develop a more advanced electrical architecture for future models. Ford last year announced it would start building its midsize truck from the skunkworks team in 2027. The automaker earlier this year estimated losing up to $5.5 billion on its EV and software division. It lost nearly $10 billion combined on those operations from 2023 to 2024. Cutting costs on battery-powered models has been one of the primary goals of Farley, who has said he expects this new family of EVs to be profitable within one year. Ford sells three EVs in the US: the Mustang Mach-E SUV, E-Transit van, and F-150 Lightning pickup. Sales of those vehicles fell 12% in the first half from the year-ago period. Meanwhile, interest in hybrids has surged, with sales up 27% over the same window. Ford recently pushed back production of its next-generation F-150 Lightning and E-Transit to 2028. The elimination of a $7,500 consumer tax credit, loosening regulations on emissions and reduced funding for charging infrastructure are expected to further dampen demand. All this makes it more important for automakers to pick their lanes, Farley has said. “The pure EV market in the US seems to us very clear: small vehicles used for commuting and around town,” Farley told analysts on an earnings call last month. By contrast, crosstown rival General Motors has electrified vehicles across its entire lineup, from the hulking Hummer to the smaller Equinox SUV. GM spent more time upfront building a ground-up platform as a base for its EV models. Meanwhile, Ford has reconfigured many of its popular gasoline-powered vehicles with batteries to get to market sooner, delaying the development and launch of a unified EV platform, details of which it unveiled on Monday. While being out front has exposed Ford to more EV demand fluctuations over the past two years, it has also learned more about the market, Farley has said. Ford is using lithium-iron-phosphate, or LFP batteries, for the forthcoming family of EVs. The batteries are produced in Marshall, Mich., using technology from Chinese EV-battery maker CATL that has helped to bring down the sticker price of electric cars. Advertisement

Title: Trump is calling Wall Street’s bluff on tariffs | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Wall Street traders embraced the term TACO — Trump always chickens out — earlier this year to describe President Donald Trump’s on-again, off-again position on tariffs. Trump liked to impose hefty import taxes but would inevitably back off when markets plunged, analysts said. Now Trump is calling the market’s bluff. Yet another round of new tariffs went effect on Thursday, lifting the average tax on US imports to the highest level since the 1930s. Trump bet markets would absorb this latest news, adapt and move on — and so far he appears to have been right. Stocks still closed higher on the week, with the Nasdaq hitting a record high on Friday and the S&P 500 notching its best week in over one month. It’s a remarkable shift from early April, when the president’s “Liberation Day” tariffs caused stocks across the globe to plunge. But with economists saying tariff effects could take weeks or months to play out, it’s too soon to declare victory just yet. “He is succeeding in implementing major tariffs without shocking the stock market,” said Ethan Harris, former head of global economics at Bank of America. “It’s surprising, and you could call it an accomplishment if you’re in favor of tariffs.” Trump may be winning the hand, but Wall Street has lots of cards left. The game isn’t over. Investors in recent months have embraced the “TACO” trade. A better description would be, “Trump always tries again,” according to Harris. With the latest import taxes, Trump is pushing forward with an average tariff rate just slightly slower than what he tried to impose on April 2, according to the Budget Lab at Yale. While stocks are hovering near record highs, Harris said he expects tariffs will inflict “real damage” on the economy, and it remains to be seen if investors will stay complacent. The inclusion of carveouts has softened the blow of tariffs, according to Kurt Reiman, head of fixed income at UBS. That has helped temper investors’ concerns. Apple (AAPL), for example, is exempt from tariffs on some imports from India and tariffs on semiconductors because of its pledge to develop production in the United States. Apple stock last week soared 13% and had its best week since 2020. “The tariff wall being built by the administration also has many holes because of numerous product exemptions, carveouts and delayed implementation dates,” Reiman said. Enthusiasm about the AI boom in the United States is also driving market momentum and drawing attention away from tariffs. While investors have been concerned about trade, blowout earnings from big tech companies like Nvidia (NVDA) and Meta (META) have helped buoy the market. In addition, trading partners have largely not retaliated, avoiding a global trade war that would have had worse outcomes for the US economy, according to David Doyle, head of economics at Macquarie. “What’s really struck me is how little Trump has had to chicken out from,” Robert Armstrong, the Financial Times columnist who coined the term “TACO,” told CNN’s Richard Quest in an August 1 interview. Wall Street’s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility index, spiked in early April above 50 points — a historic level not seen since the Covid pandemic or the 2008 financial crisis. The VIX in August just briefly breached 20 points — a level associated with slightly noticeable volatility — before retreating. Investors are maintaining faith in a “Trump put,” or the notion that if the markets do plummet, the president will refine his approach. The “Trump put” is different from chickening out, analysts say, as the president might back down just enough to satisfy markets before pushing forward again with his tariffs when he is able to. “He always tries again until the equity market punishes the policy,” Harris said. “That’s the old ‘Trump put’ idea, which is the way people used to talk about it, and is still the correct way to think about the trade war.” While Trump has implemented his tariffs, it might be too soon to call victory. Investors are awaiting data on inflation and the labor market in upcoming months to get a better sense of how tariffs are impacting the economy. “As an investor, you can talk yourself into not worrying about tariffs, but if you’re a company trying to make business plans, you can’t afford to ignore the tariffs,” Harris said. “The stock market and the economy are not the same thing.” Arun Sai, senior multi-asset strategist at Pictet Asset Management, said investors are taking two leaps of faith in believing in the resilience of the US economy and that “the stagflationary impulse of tariffs” — slower growth and stickier inflation — won’t be as bad as initially feared. Markets are a “little too complacent,” Sai said, and he will be watching the next two inflation reports ahead of the Federal Reserve’s September policy meeting for any sign of tariff-induced increases in prices. “By no means are we out of the woods,” Sai said. “ We are priced for nothing to go wrong, and yet we still have a very important inflection point ahead of us.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Advertisement August 11, 2025 | 7 min read Listen to article 4 min Barry Dudley of Green Square dissects the fledgling talks between S4 Capital and MSQ Partners, exploring strategic fit, the market forces driving the potential deal and what it could mean for Sir Martin Sorrell’s “new-age” marketing group after a turbulent few years. Sir Martin Sorrell founded S4 Capital in 2018 after leaving WPP S4 Capital, Sir Martin Sorrell’s ‘new-age’ digital marketing group, has confirmed that it is in very preliminary deal talks with MSQ Partners, the creative and technology agency network that is majority-owned by US private equity firm One Equity Partners (OEP). The potential deal – which S4 says would be structured as an acquisition of MSQ by S4 Capital rather than a takeover of S4 – comes after a bruising period for the group. S4’s share price has fallen more than 90% from its peak only a few years ago. The current market capitalization sits at around £140m, a fraction of the multibillion pound valuation it once enjoyed. I’ve heard rumors and seen reports of other interested parties in the past, including the likes of Stagwell, New Mountain Capital and Accenture. I suspect Sir Martin has had many conversations come at him, or indeed he has sought them. Probably even more are incoming right now. S4 Capital was founded in 2018 after Sorrell’s high-profile exit from WPP. Built on aggressive M&A, it focused on digital content production, programmatic advertising and data-driven marketing through acquisitions such as MediaMonks and MightyHive. Its client base reads like a tech-sector who’s-who: Alphabet, Amazon, Meta to name just a few. However, that narrow tech focus has been a double-edged sword. When the sector tightened budgets and many reallocated spend towards AI investments, S4’s revenues took a hit – compounded by accounting missteps, economic headwinds and rising interest rates. MSQ Partners, on the other hand, offers a broader spread of clients – more than 250, including Unilever, Haleon, Lego, P&G and Booking.com – across consumer goods, healthcare, financial services and B2B. It operates through a decentralized network of specialist agencies spanning advertising, PR, design, digital, and tech. Since being acquired by OEP in 2023, MSQ has invested in integrated, creative-plus-tech delivery models. We recently advised Precious Media, a connected commerce digital agency, on its sale to MSQ. So how could they fit: Complementary client bases – S4 is over-indexed to tech; MSQ brings balance through FMCG, healthcare, and finance. Capability cross-sell – MSQ’s creative brand-building could bolster S4’s digital execution; S4’s programmatic and data expertise could sharpen MSQ’s digital performance offering. Geographic scale – S4’s US and APAC strength could mesh with MSQ’s European roots, giving a broader footprint without heavy duplication. AI positioning – Both have leaned into AI narratives, but a combined group could pool their R&D resources. Advertisement The marketing services sector is undergoing its biggest structural shift since the holding-company era of the 80s and 90s. AI is reshaping creative workflows, media buying and data analytics. Clients are consolidating their agency rosters, looking for faster, integrated delivery. The network groups have been re-engineering their own businesses to face this new way of working, with WPP recently merging its media offer under one brand. All are focussed on, and investing in, AI to help them deliver across media, creative and processes. But these are big legacy firms… and big ships can find it notoriously difficult to change course quickly. This has created fertile ground for private equity–backed roll-ups and mergers of complementary mid-scale networks. We’ve seen a plethora of PE firms coming into the market and appetite isn’t abating. For OEP, combining MSQ with S4 could create another top-tier independent rival, not only to snap at the heels of the mega groups, but also some of the smaller challenger brands and the other PE-backed indies. It could also give MSQ more muscle in terms of its own future expansion, both geographically and in terms of capability infills it may need. Advertisement Will OEP take it off the stock market? I suspect it will, not least because it removes that historical peak – which was arguably a significant over-valuation – which will otherwise be a benchmark that continues to be referenced under the current listing. That said, maintaining the listing could open up other options in terms of financing future acquisitions. And where will Sir Martin end up if this goes through? His voting control and personal stake mean no deal happens without him seeing a clear path for himself. Wherever things go, he looks set for another defining chapter in his career. Or will he head for the beach, which is where I am right now… Catch up on the most important stories of the day, curated by our editorial team.

August 11, 2025 8:30am by Barry Ritholtz The transcript from this week’s, MiB: Tim Ferriss on The Productivity Mindset, is below. You can stream and download our full conversation, including any podcast extras, on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, and Bloomberg. All of our earlier podcasts on your favorite pod hosts can be found here. ~~~ Bloomberg Audio Studios, podcasts, radio News. This is Masters in business with Barry Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio Barry Ritholtz: This week on the podcast. Yes, I know I say I have an extra special guest every week. This week I have an extra, extra special guest, Tim Ferriss bestselling author of numerous books, including the Four Hour Work Week host of the Tim Ferriss podcast. He’s got a bajillion downloads on that. He’s written five number one bestselling books, including Tools of the Titans. He also has a new card game out called Coyote, which is getting a lot of buzz. He co-created this with a another gaming company called Exploding Kittens. You probably know Tim from some of his books or, or conversations or Ted Talks or what have you. I found him to just be such a thoughtful guy. He is really the chief scientist of his own experiment, the the Tim Ferriss experiment, where he’s constantly trying to figure out how his body works, how his psychology works, how his emotional world works, and has tried a variety of different things and sort of fastidiously documented what does and doesn’t work for him. That’s what led to his productivity book, the Four Hour Work Week. It’s what led to his health and fitness book, the Four Hour Body, on and on. He just tries a whole bunch of things, figures out, does the ab tests, figures out what works and what doesn’t. I thought this conversation was fascinating, and I think you will also, with no further ado, my discussion with Tim Ferriss. Tim Ferriss: Thanks for having me. Nice to be here. Barry Ritholtz: Well, it, it’s nice to have a fellow podcaster in here. I don’t, I don’t have to explain how this rolls. I, what I wanna do is I’m, I’m excited about your book. I know you have a new game out that we want to talk about, but I have to start by delving into your background, which is really fascinating. Bachelor’s in East Asian studies from Princeton. What, what were the original career plans? Tim Ferriss: So that was after a major switch. So the original career plan was actually neuroscience. Oh, kidding. So I was kidding. A neuroscience major. And there were a few reasons I wanted to focus on that. I have Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s and hereditary bipolar and so on in my family. Barry Ritholtz: So, wait, we, we could have a whole ‘nother discussion on Neurodivergency and, and I was kind of fascinated by a lot of what you have done seemed to be hacks to manage and operate around whatever deficits you’re working with. Some deficits come with separate surpluses, but how significant were all these deficits to forcing you to come up with a methodology of just navigating life? Tim Ferriss: Well, the depression piece was a huge challenge for most of my life, and thankfully that has changed with a couple of different approaches and different tools, and that’s one of the drivers for the initial neuroscience. And there was someone in the Department of Psychology, but within the focus of neuroscience named Barry Jacobs at the time. And I was interested in Barry Jacobs as a possible mentor because he was focused on the role of serotonin and sleep and mood reg regulations and the neurobiology of depression. He also, and this was early days, he had of an interest in psychoactive substances, including LSD. So my, my interest in psychedelic compounds goes back a very, very long time. That would’ve been 19 95, 96, but I couldn’t personally do. I realized, and it is important and it is necessary at this point in time, the animal testing on rats used cats for a lot of the circadian rhythm studies, but I couldn’t euthanize these rats after doing various tests. And it wasn’t actually torture of any type. I just couldn’t, I couldn’t be hands-on with that at the time. So I switched to East Asian studies, but with a focus on mostly language acquisition. So I was still in the realm of let’s just say cognitive neuroscience, but more on the linguistic side. Danny Kahneman, I actually volunteered to be a research subject in a bunch of his studies. Barry Ritholtz: No kidding. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Just to see what that was like. But at, Barry Ritholtz: At the time, had he already won the Nobel and like, I think it was 01, 02, something like that? Tim Ferriss: No, not yet. Not yet. So this was super early days. Still very well known on campus, but I guess it would’ve been Green Hall. They were pretty boring, to be honest. The tasks hitting space bars or something to indicate when you see a flashing green right box in the upper left hand corner of one of these very old school monitors. But that was one of the ways that I earned whatever it was, $5 an hour to pay for some of my expenses in Princeton? Barry Ritholtz: I kind of remember he was at Princeton and then Vancouver and then California. So my maybe, yeah, he Tim Ferriss: Bounced around, but at that time Princeton. Barry Ritholtz: Really, really interesting. So I get the transition, I guess if you’re gonna pick some space related to neuroscience, Asian studies can occasionally overlap with that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, and I had been an exchange student. My first real trip outside of the US was an exchange student at age 15 to Tokyo, Japan. Amazing. Where I went to a Japanese school for a year. Barry Ritholtz: Are you fluent at all? Tim Ferriss: I am, yes. I still speak read less. So write, because you really have to practice that to keep it up. I can still speak and read Japanese and then got a couple of others. Barry Ritholtz: , I have a friend Noah Smith, who is physics and economics, like a killer double major. And he spent summers in, in raves Kyoto. Says Tokyo, you have to go. And that must have been fascinating at 15. That has to be a little overwhelming. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. It’s a, it’s a fascinating very, for someone who grew up on Long Island and Barry Ritholtz: That’s right, you’re an East Hampton kid, right? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. And at that point, I only spoke English very alien. It has the benefit of being incredibly alien, but incredibly safe. And the additional benefit that people tend to speak if they speak at all terrible English, which means you have to learn Japanese. Huh. So in contrast with a lot of, if you go to Spain or if you go to Norway, good luck learning Norwegian because people are gonna default to English. That just doesn’t really happen in Japan. So, not to mention the fact that I got there before smartphones, so I couldn’t just escape to texting with my friends. I was stuck. Barry Ritholtz: Use Google Translate to actually talk to people!? Tim Ferriss: Didn’t exist. Yeah. You were stuck. And that was a huge, huge benefit. So that is another reason, actually another reason why I chose Princeton was because it had the, one of the strongest, if not the strongest East Asian studies programs for at that time I was most interested in Japanese and Chinese, which I would’ve taken even if I had majored in neuroscience. Barry Ritholtz: So you graduate in 2000. I’m kind of fascinated that very quickly you start writing the four hour work week, which was published in oh seven, like that is a shockingly short period of time. You’re in your twenties. Yeah. When you’re selling what essentially becomes one of the top selling books of oh seven, I mean, it was on every bestseller list. I don’t have to tell you this, but I want listeners to understand. So the first question is, what on earth motivated you five years outta college to say, I think I’m gonna write a book. 00:08:05 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. So I actually explicitly never wanted to write anything. This was a commitment I made to myself after graduation longer than an email ever. Again. That was the promise, because my senior thesis, I felt almost killed me. So I didn’t want to write anything. But one of my professors at Princeton who really changed the trajectory of my life, a professor named Ed Chao, Z-S-C-H-A-U, we’re still in touch. He was a former competitive figure skater took companies public, one of the first computer science professors at Stanford. He did everything taught at Harvard Business School, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Real polymath, Renaissance man. And he taught a class called High Tech Entrepreneurship, which was electrical engineering 4 91. But you didn’t need to be an engineer. I wasn’t. And that class is what convinced me to move west. Keep in mind the timing. This was just before the dotcom implosion to kinda chase my riches and engage in tech. 00:09:10 And in 2001, after that startup I joined, had imploded. I started my own company and I was bootstrapping it. I didn’t raise any outside financing. And so Ed asked me to come back and talk to students about bootstrapping. So I went back twice a year to do this short lecture to students. And in one of the feedback forms, after years of doing this, one of the students who was not being serious, put in his additional comments, I don’t understand why you’re teaching a class of undergrads and graduate students. Why don’t you just write a book and be done with it? And I had really bad insomnia for decades, including at that time. So I would get these half-baked ideas for chapter titles or content or whatever, and I couldn’t get to sleep. And I would just jot it down and the notes from the classes I was teaching, which changed over time to track my experiences and these insomnia, middle of the night notes, formed the backbone of something, sent it to a mentor of mine who was an author. And unbidden, without asking me, was like, I think this is a great idea here. Meet so-and-so meet So-and-so, introduced me to various editors and agents. Keeping in mind now looking back, 28 or 29 publishers, meaning imprints said no. And then Crown bought it for next to nothing. I 00:10:35 [Speaker Changed] I love all the examples. I’m a big William Goldman fan whose book and ventures in the screen trade Oh, amazing. Introduce the phrase, nobody knows anything into the popular culture. And he talks about all the studios passed on Star Wars. All the studios passed on Raiders. Was it paramount that passed on? ET ’cause hey, we have this other alien adventure called Starman. Nobody remembers today. And, and you could go to other, 00:11:05 [Speaker Changed] You can go anywhere, fields, Starbucks, everybody passed on Starbucks 00:11:09 [Speaker Changed] Squid Games. The author couldn’t get it sold for 10 years. Yeah. Ultimately had to sell his laptop. Yeah. ’cause he was so broke. I love the John Wick story. He you have like this Yeah. Top Action Hero could not get Hong Kong gun fu made in Hollywood. Ended up funding it himself along with, I’m trying to remember the other actress who kicked money in and it’s now a $2 billion franchise. Yeah. So love those. So bestselling book that all the imprints passed on. Not a surprise at all. Yeah. It is a throw everything against the wall business model and we don’t care. And we’ll see what sticks and they miss this. 00:11:48 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. It’s a, it’s a hits driven business in some ways. Very similar to the Angel investing later. I mean Sure. This type of kind of power law distribution. And the, what’s been wildest about the Four Hour Work Week, which is, is really a book on increasing per hour output, which is why it found a, a toehold in tech. And then the first New York Times coverage had Mark Andreessen, the famed entrepreneur, and now venture capitalist talking about it. He wants to work 80 hours a week, but he wants to get each of those hours to produce 10 times as much. And that’s the basic underlying theme of the book. So what’s wild about it is almost all the tech tools that I recommend and additional resources have expired. But even in 2017 when all of that stuff was irrelevant, the principles, the frameworks and so on, it ended up being on the Amazon top 10 most highlighted books of all time list in two 00:12:46 [Speaker Changed] Meaning from the Kindle version is what’s 00:12:48 [Speaker Changed] So highlighted. Yeah. In 2017. So that would’ve been eight years later when all of the tech tools were just dinosaurs at that point, which has been, it’s been cool to watch. So, 00:12:59 [Speaker Changed] So, so I have, I’m thumbing through the book over the weekend. I read it way back when, and I’m revisiting an old copy, which I should have brought in to have you sign. And my wife says, four hour work week. What’s she, she’s an art teacher, fashion, illustration, and design. She’s like, what’s that about? And I say, I know this is not gonna be a conversation that’s gonna go any place productive. So I just say the Pato principle. Mm. She’s like, what’s that? Well, 80% of the value we derive from most activities, clients, effort, whatever comes from 20% of whatever that data set is. And she’s like, oh, is that true? I’m like, yeah, kind of really seems to be true. Oh, okay. And I know immediately like, this is not her sort of book, but how grossly am I oversimplifying the four hour work week by just reducing it to open principle? 00:13:54 [Speaker Changed] I think if you had to pick one principle in the book, that’s a good one. 00:13:56 [Speaker Changed] That’s it. Right. 00:13:57 [Speaker Changed] To focus on. Now it assumes a few things that sometimes get missed. Right? So people can jump to strategy before they really interrogate their direction or reasons for doing something. So the definition phase of that book where you’re really getting very clear on which target you are aiming for, I think is a, might sound strange, but an often underemphasized precursor to then doing an 80 20 analysis. Because for 80 20 or Pareto principle analysis, you’re looking at which 20% of the inputs roughly right? It could be 10, it could be 1% are producing the outsized percentage of the returns. Now that could be looking at your customers if you run a business, right? It could be looking at your physical exercise, what’s producing the adaptations. That’s a little trickier to do, but you can figure it out. You could look at it with medications too. I mean, it’s like, there are a lot of ways to apply it. And Vilfredo, Pareto noticed this in everything from agriculture and like pea production to wealth distribution. It applies all over the place. And actually Richard Kosh, KOCH has written a a lot on this subject under the moniker of the 80 20 principle. But I’d say if you had to pick one principle, that’s the one. Sure. 00:15:22 [Speaker Changed] Since we’re sitting here in Bloomberg, I, I just have to point out, it’s very much true for your portfolio. The vast majority of your gains. And if you read some of the research by people like Bess Binder, Hendrick, Bess Binder in Arizona State, it’s not even 20% that’s generating returns. It’s one or 2%. Yeah. That creates the vast majority. So there’s Pareto principle, hyper pato principle, but it’s kind of fascinating that you use this as a way to hack your own productivity, effectiveness, comfort level, mental health. Like you’ve applied this across a wide range of items. Have you ever found a space where it doesn’t work? 00:16:05 [Speaker Changed] I haven’t, to be honest. It’s, 00:16:07 [Speaker Changed] It’s just consistent 00:16:08 [Speaker Changed] Everywhere. It seems to be practically a law of nature that a few things. The the critical few versus the trivial many, it’s, it’s almost always a few things. 00:16:19 [Speaker Changed] The critical few versus the trivial many. Yeah. That, that is a fabulous summation of that. Yeah. I really, I really like that. So let’s, let’s stick with the book for a moment. Sure. In the book, you have a lot of practices and tools and routines. I know some of them are, are still valid today. Some of them may or may not have, for lack of a better word, expired. What were the most important items you learned? What are the ones that people speak to you and say, Hey, this resonated. This really had a big impact on me? 00:16:54 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. I would say the first is, well, let me zoom out and say that I, I went back and I looked at the book, which is always tough for me on some level. ’cause I, I, I published it when I was 29, right? I’m turning 48 soon. And so there’s, there’s a little bit of chest puffing and so on. ’cause I was completely unknown at the time, which makes me wince. But overall, the principles are still things that I apply all the time. But the tech tools, like using go to my pc, no, of course not. That’s changed. That world has changed. But the principles and the, the frameworks, the exercises still apply. So there I would say a few things get echoed to me a lot. One is the practice of fear, setting fear, 00:17:38 [Speaker Changed] Fear setting, define fear setting for the audience. Sure. 00:17:41 [Speaker Changed] It’s very simple. So fear setting is based on the, I think, accurate assumption that oftentimes we are taught to set goals or we have a framework for trying to set goals like smart, right. Specific, measurable, et cetera, with a timeline. But if you have the emergency break on with some set of amorphous fears about starting a business, quitting your job, getting engaged, getting divorced, taking a vacation from your job or your business, whatever it might be, that that is the kind of rate limiter. And what you can do, and people can find this for free, if you just go to watch my TED talk, which has, I don’t know, 12 million views now, 00:18:26 [Speaker Changed] 18 tight minutes of here’s what to do with your life. 00:18:28 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. It’s, well, it just focuses on this exercise of fear setting, which I still do probably once a quarter. And the basic idea is you take whatever you’re considering that you haven’t yet done because you have some degree of fear or apprehension. You write down all of the worst things that could happen. Let’s just call it a list of 20 in excruciating detail. Make them specific. Then you have another column, which is what you could do to minimize the likelihood of each of those things happening. Last column, if e each of those happened, what could you do to recover or temporarily stop the bleeding, right? So, okay, you try business after quitting your job, which by the way, I don’t recommend. You can moonlight and do various things to hedge against risk, but then it doesn’t work. Okay. Can you temporarily Airbnb a bedroom in your house or your bed? 00:19:17 Can you get a job bar attending just to get back on your feet? Sure. Of course you can. So when you start to do that, and then there’s a separate page where you also write out the costs of inaction, which is a neglected step. When people are considering what they’re doing, they look at the risks of doing something, but they don’t look at the risks of not doing that thing. So if you telescope out a year, three years, what are the financial, emotional, familial or relationship costs of not doing the thing you’re considering? And when you then look at these things, which represent your thoughts trapped on paper, a lot of people are able to do the scary thing. So I would say that that one gets echoed a lot. And then this concept of mini retirements. So engineering a way such that you can take four weeks completely off the grid or disconnected, which is very, very, very achievable. That seems 00:20:13 [Speaker Changed] Four weeks in a row or a week, every quarter, 00:20:16 [Speaker Changed] Like three to four weeks in a row. Wow. 00:20:18 [Speaker Changed] That’s a lot. 00:20:19 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And what that forces you to do also is upgrade your sort of systems and policies and automation in your life or in your business, or even in your job by teaching subordinates how to do things autonomously. And the value of all those things outlives the mini retirement. So I’d say those are two that come back a lot. 00:20:42 [Speaker Changed] It’s interesting that you are approaching, laying out the pros and cons and things that lead to fear in a new venture. I, I contextualize that a little differently. You and I have both interviewed Ray Dalio. Yeah. And Ray’s great innovation and and contribution to finance. Finance has this very much fake it till you make it attitude. Never admit error. No, no, it’ll be great. Don’t worry if it didn’t work out this year, it’ll work out next year. And Ray very much said, no, that’s wrong. We’re all gonna make mistakes. It’s really important to learn from those mistakes. And I wanna say he’s the first guy that really put that out at all. 00:21:25 [Speaker Changed] But I, not to not to mention the transparency of having almost all meetings recorded, accessible by anyone within his firm. I mean, 00:21:35 [Speaker Changed] Which is kind of horrifying. They 00:21:36 [Speaker Changed] Did some pretty wild stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He’s a fascinating character. A 00:21:40 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. But it leads to the question, what you’re talking about is really a way to prep yourself for a fear of failure. Is, is that fair to describe it? And 00:21:54 [Speaker Changed] Sure. Yeah. Or you know what? It’s a fear of failure, but oftentimes it’s this, it’s the fact you achieve, well, very, it’s gonna be very, very hard to achieve your goals. If they’re not very specific and clear. Even if you fail partially, that’s fine. You can still do great things. I think the, the parallel is that if your fears are unclear, nebulous, it’s just a feeling in your gut, but you don’t trap the specifics on paper, they’re very difficult to overcome. They will still be a break in your life. It is just as important to address that as it is to address the goals, to identify those sort of sticking points. And I would also say that I think of risk for people is often ill-defined, and there are many ways in different contexts to define risk. But if we look at it as the likelihood of a irreversible negative outcome, very few things have a 10 out of 10 value in that category. 00:22:57 Right? And then if you look at, for instance, if you look at the, and I encourage people to do this in fear setting, it’s like, from zero to 10, transient, recoverable, or permanent. What is the potential upside of doing this scary thing that you’re considering doing? And then if you stay doing what you’re doing, like what are the zero to 10 permanent transient risks or potential outcomes of not doing the thing when, when you then see, oh, if I do this thing, there could be all of these potentially semi-permanent or permanent benefits. If I try it and fail, the downsides are transient and like three outta 10, it makes the decision much, much easier. And the decision is the hardest part. Once you commit, then it’s just execution risk and implementation. And it’s the decision that is the hardest part for most people. 00:23:47 [Speaker Changed] It, it’s amazing that everything you’re saying is so applicable to public markets investing. Yeah. Because when people are in that panic mode, when they’re fearful, oh my God, we’re down 15%, the world is gonna come to an end. It’s always, no, this is transitory, this is temporary. Yep. How can you avoid making those permanent losses? How can you avoid those decisions that lead to really bad outcomes? And it’s really understanding, hey, is this a 10 or is this more likely a 2, 3, 4 on that 00:24:18 [Speaker Changed] Scale? Yeah. And I can actually, I’ll give something else in the, in the investing world, if we’re looking at, when people neglect the other side of a coin, and this is not gonna apply to like these super ultra pros, but a lot of people who participate in the public markets, they think about what to buy, right? What’s a good buy at this moment? They don’t think about hold period. They don’t think about selling strategy. What will be the cues? What are the underlying sort of thesis if invalidated, that would mean they should sell blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. They don’t have a structured way of thinking about selling. And similarly, it’s like, if you just think about your goal, but you don’t have a structured way of thinking about fear and apprehension and so on, you’re equally handicapped. So that would be an, an easy kind of copy paste comparison, I would say. Huh. 00:25:08 [Speaker Changed] Really interesting. You come out of college with Asian language studies and then you write a book on productivity and personal efficiency. How did you then pivot to angel investing and or advising? 00:25:25 [Speaker Changed] So the pivot, I guess, was an overlap in a sense because the four hour work week, I was based in Silicon Valley for 17 years. And I seeded the four hour work week at Tech Heavy Events. In part because it talks about an information, low information diet, and selective ignorance, and basically overcoming digital overwhelm. That’s a component of the book. And that pain was most acutely felt by people in tech at the time. So my early adopters, plus the people I had access to were techies in the very early stages of figuring out how I would launch this book. And what that had as a side effect, was developing relationships with various founders. And there were a lot of fans among CEOs and co-founders of startups. 00:26:17 [Speaker Changed] Let me interrupt you, just to remind people. The book comes out in oh seven. Yep. This is before half of the companies that we think of as part of our daily lives. Oh. Well before were, you know, there was no public Alibaba, as I think that’s before Facebook, certainly long before Uber goes, goes public and Shopify, a lot of these companies were, you know, barely a gleam in the creator’s 00:26:42 [Speaker Changed] Eyes. Yeah. They didn’t, a lot of them either didn’t exist or they were very, very early stages. So I launched the book, my main launch strategy was South by Southwest, this festival in Austin, Texas in 2007, which was also the same south by Southwest, where Twitter basically went fully live in public, in full promotional mode. And the other piece of the story of angel investing is that I mentioned in the previous segment, my professor in school, ed Chao, his son-in-law at the time, Mike Maples Jr. Was a very well-known angel investor in Silicon Valley, had been an executive of various companies. And we became friendly. He wanted to lose some weight. I wanted to learn more about what he did. So we would have breakfast at this place called Hobies, and I would help him with his strategy for training and so on. At this point, also, the four hour work week could come outta nowhere and hit the New York loan up. Right. Hit the New York Times list, then went to number one and stayed on the New York Times list for four and a half years, or five years or something. That’s insane. And so he like 00:27:48 [Speaker Changed] Are, are you aware just of how lightning in a bottle that 00:27:51 [Speaker Changed] Is? Yeah. It’s bananas. It’s bananas. That’s part of the reason I haven’t wanted to go back and revise any of the writing. I’m like, I don’t wanna touch the butterfly and risk screwing it up. So he wanted to know how that happened. Like what did I do? And there were things I did for marketing and PR and so on to help catalyze that. And in exchange I’d say, tell me about your deals. What are you doing? I was always interested in investing. Eventually after a few months, all of these factors combined. I asked Mike and he was very generous with his time. If he might be open to me co-investing with him on some deals, very small checks, like I would put in 10 K so I wouldn’t eat up much of the cap table. I would put in a lot of work to try to help these companies. 00:28:33 And that is how the whole adventure started. I wanted to be the least expensive, most valuable person in terms of ratio on the cap table. So that those early founders would become my testimonials, basically for future deals. Very savvy. That’s how the whole thing started. And I decided to treat it like I would treat going to business school. I looked at Stanford at the time, ’cause I’d fantasized about going to Stanford Business School. I was like, okay, that’s 120 k over two years, I would’ve had to pay that outta pocket. So let me create the quote unquote Tim Ferris fund for Angel investing. It’s 120 K over two years, and I’m assuming that it’s sunk cost tuition, it’s gonna go to zero. None of the startups are gonna succeed. But if I can develop skills, learn a lot, and relationships that make it worthwhile, I’ll consider it a success. And that was the approach I took to doing it. And the timing was also great because I started in 2007, 2008, 2008 for a few years afterwards, was effectively considered a dotcom depression. Right. But that’s when I met Toby, the Shopify. Shopify, when they had nine employees or 12 employees Wow. And became an advisor. That’s when I started becoming involved with lots of companies of these very early stages, which ended up just to become these behemoths. 00:29:59 [Speaker Changed] I love your concept of this is a sun cost that’s going to zero. I think that’s the absolute right approach with startups. And you hinted at something that I, I have to explore a little bit. Anytime I throw money at a a small startup, it’s essentially a, this is gonna go to zero, but b, I really just want to invest in the jockey. I wanna put money into this person who, hey, this is easier than bearing a body. Yeah. Like, those are the two things I would do for this guy. Yeah. And a check. All right, I’ll, I’ll put a check into that. Yeah. And maybe it works out. I, I sense you have a similar belief in, you’re betting on, not on the horse, but the jockey 120 K is only 12 $10,000 checks. Yep. It’s not a lot. And I have to imagine there were a lot more opportunities. What criteria do you use to figure out who gets that check? Well 00:30:51 [Speaker Changed] Also, just as a side note, the reason I started trying to figure out advising and doing those agreements is that I ran outta money. I got over enthusiastic and I broke my own rules. And I think the first check I wrote was for like 40 K and immediately imploded. And I was like, uhoh, this is gonna be a problem. But leaving that aside, all of my best hits have been products that I would use personally that I could ideally be a power user of. And there have been a few exceptions, but by and large, they’re addressing problems that I feel acutely or needs that I feel or wants that I feel very acutely. So for instance, clear, how did Clear happen back in the day? It was called Clear Card and it was, it was not widely distributed. It was very little known. And I wrote a blog post back when blogs were a big deal. 00:31:45 And my blog at the time became very popular. And I wrote a huge piece on, on how to expedite travel. And a PA portion of that was about Clear card. I linked to their website and unbeknownst to me, I was one of the largest drivers of traffic to their website. And then at some point the leadership reached out to me and they said, Hey, do you wanna do something? And that’s how, that’s awesome. That relationship started. And I think I was the first advisor to clear, I mean, it was forever ago, so it must’ve been pretty 00:32:12 [Speaker Changed] Close. I wish they were in more airports just blown through JFK LaGuardia. It’s a blast with them. 00:32:17 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Yeah. They’ve done, they, they, from an execution perspective, they’ve been excellent. Also not based in Silicon Valley. And I, I don’t think that Silicon Valley’s the only place to go hunting for great companies. I mean, look at Shopify, Ottawa, Canada. Sure. Come on. That was Spotify, another one that was, that was neglected. So I also, so there were a few things. It was like, is it a problem or a need or a want that I feel and understand, is it something I can be a power user of? Therefore it makes it quite easy for me to promote to my audience. Could they be users or customers? And then lastly, for a while until this wasn’t viable, I looked for geographies that were neglected. So I actually, I went hunting in Canada a lot and works 00:32:57 [Speaker Changed] For comedy. Yeah, 00:32:59 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Or for Canadians. I mean, you look at some of the early experiences, like stumble upon, I was, I became an advisor to stumble upon and who was the founder of Stumble Upon, a guy named Garrett Camp. Stumble upon, I put tons of time into, he and I became close. We worked really well together. We enjoyed working together. Stumbled upon, ended up being a zero for me. But why is that? Okay. Because I, I talked about the relationships and the skills. Right? Okay. Relationship with Garrett Camp, what does he end up doing next? Co-founder of Uber, 00:33:31 [Speaker Changed] Not Too Shabby. Right. 00:33:32 [Speaker Changed] And then I was one of three people who had helped him with, stumble upon who became advisors to Uber Cab LLC at the time, which was I think 2008. 00:33:43 [Speaker Changed] Oh 00:33:43 [Speaker Changed] My God. By the way, everybody said no to Uber. Everybody. 00:33:46 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. That’s amazing to me because one of the things I find fascinating about VCs is they kind of put their failures on their websites as a badge of honor. Yeah. But it’s mostly, here are the companies we invested in that went belly up. They very rarely say, oh by the way, we passed on Uber, we passed on this, we passed on that. Yeah. You see less of that. 00:34:09 [Speaker Changed] You see less of it. And for me, I would say there’s lots of luck. But I was also trying to approach it in a systematic way. If you’re focused on effectively the way I would think about, let’s say I cut a $25,000 check. I’m like, okay, would I pay $25,000 just to develop these relationships and basically earn a graduate degree in whatever this startup is doing? If so, then great go. If not, then think twice. And taking that approach, all of the skills and the new knowledge and the relationships snowball over time. So I love highlighting failures that I would put in quotation marks because they’re actually just seeds and fertilizer for something that was intimately connected with the people and the skills that came right afterwards. This happens over and over and over again. So 00:35:04 [Speaker Changed] I’m, I’m hearing relationship, I’m hearing tuition for skills and then even quote unquote failures. You don’t know what act two is gonna be where it could go. 00:35:13 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And then lastly, I would say one thing I did quite differently, and maybe more people do this now, but I I had never heard of it, is I treated a portion of my total budget for that real world MBA slash you know, Tim Ferriss fund in quotation marks a portion of that for marketing budget. What does that mean? I invested in, I bought secondary, so I bought equity from employees at Facebook and Twitter. Now it ended up being very early, but to my mind at the time, they were overpriced. Super expensive. Huh. But being in those deals was coveted. So having a little bit of equity in those two companies allowed me to say, I’m in these companies. Which then helped bolster the reputation and assisted in getting new deals. So I expected those to go to zero. That’s marketing budget. Right. They ended up working out kinda very unexpectedly working out really well. But I expected those to go to zero and it was pure marketing budget. 00:36:17 [Speaker Changed] I’ve heard you mention a book by Sebastian Alibi, the Power Law. 00:36:22 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Great book. 00:36:23 [Speaker Changed] Tell us a little bit about what you learned from that book about investing in startups. 00:36:30 [Speaker Changed] That is a, a great book if you wanna learn about venture capital and angel investing. Most of the approaches I had already learned just by being in the trenches for whatever it was, a decade before that book came out, I was introduced to Sebastian through more Money than God. Yes. Which is his book about Yes. Hedge funds. That is an exceptional book. And if you want some colorful characters, oh my God, give that a read. 00:36:56 [Speaker Changed] Plus he’s British and his take on everything is just, 00:37:00 [Speaker Changed] It’s fantastic. 00:37:01 [Speaker Changed] It’s so dry and so delightfully humorous in an unintentional way. 00:37:05 [Speaker Changed] Oh, it’s so good. He’s, he’s a wonderful writer and very skilled at explaining. So what I would say about that book and what people might miss about startups is yes, it’s a hits driven business. There’s a power law distribution, meaning it’s pato principle on steroids. You’re probably gonna have one or two or three startups that give you the vast majority of your lifetime earnings, at least as an angel investor who’s not taking management fees. Right? Right. If you’re an asset accumulator and you have many, many, many overlapping billion dollar plus funds, like sure you’re gonna do great on management fees. 00:37:44 [Speaker Changed] VCs seem to do okay for themselves. It’s 00:37:47 [Speaker Changed] A pretty good business. Yeah. You have to be smart how, in how you approach it. But as an angel investor, I would say you need to have, if you’re gonna be effective in the long term, some coherent strategy or philosophy around portfolio construction so that you don’t run outta money. Right. It’s like staking someone in poker. It’s like you have to be able to sustain a string of bad luck. Right. And I would say that what Sebastian does so well is really detail how various MVPs in the world of venture capital have done that over time. And there, there are a few things I would point out also with respect to Silicon Valley that a lot of people miss. ’cause why did it happen in Silicon Valley? It’s like, sure, you can talk about like Fairchild Semiconductor, right. And I think it was the traitorous aid or whoever it was and all of this. 00:38:38 But why did that happen? Like why, why, why? I am always like ask why three times and you get to something interesting. Part of it is that non-competes are incredibly hard, if not close to, impossible to enforce in California. Yeah. What does that mean? It means that knowledge travels very freely. Talent travels very freely. So there’s a lot of competition and a lot of knowledge sharing sometimes to the chagrin of former employers. But that is part of the reason why Silicon Valley is still to this day it right now it would be the era of ai. If you wanna be in ai, if you really want to increase the likelihood of succeeding and you can raise enough money to pay for top talent, Silicon Valley’s still the place to be. Yeah. It’s not true for everything, but like it still matters. 00:39:24 [Speaker Changed] No, no, no doubt about it. So let’s stay with the concept of return on investments. I’m curious as to one of the best or most worthwhile investments you’ve made, but not in terms of monetary returns. In terms of, and I’m, I’m delving into your space in terms of time, energy, productivity, efficiency. What do you find to be the most productive, useful investments that you’ve made? 00:39:52 [Speaker Changed] There are quite a, quite a few. I would say anything related to mental health ranks very highly. And we, we could talk about some of the things that have benefited me. So I come from a family of people who have died from various types of addiction, bipolar depression, major depressive disorder. I struggled with probably, I would say three to four major depressive episodes a year for most of my life. That much. Wow. That’s a lot. And that’s that. And each episode ranging on the length of a few weeks to a few months. I mean, that is a lot of time in darkness. And now I’m at a point where it’s maybe one depressive episode of a few weeks every two to three years. Those are two completely different human experiences. How, how 00:40:40 [Speaker Changed] Did you manage to actually manage this? Because there are people who suffer from depression and that’s the word, suffer and never find a way to get on top of it. 00:40:51 [Speaker Changed] I’ll mention just a few things in the order I might suggest investigating them. One would be, let’s call it metabolic psychiatry. So looking at the work of Christopher Palmer, most recently out of Harvard, I’ve interviewed him on using diet to help mental health. And fundamentally it tends to end up being some version of a ketogenic diet. You can get a lot of those benefits by doing intermittent fasting. So let’s just say what I’m doing today and what I do a lot of the time, which is only eating between like 2:00 PM and 10:00 PM that’s an eight hour window. So you fast for 16 hours every day and your body adapts to that incredibly quickly. I would say within a week you’re pretty grumpy for a a week and then you’re fine. Then the next, so that was the metabolic psychiatry piece. The second would be different types of brain stimulation. Specifically something called accelerated TMS, which we could talk more about. People can investigate accelerated TMS and scientists named Nolan Williams out of Stanford. But this can change people over the course of five days. It’s remarkable. 00:42:01 [Speaker Changed] TMS standing for 00:42:02 [Speaker Changed] Transcranial magnetic stimulation. So it’s a type of brain stimulation and it, it takes something that looks like a large hockey puck and put it on your head. It’s non-invasive and it feels like someone’s kind of tapping your skull. And depending on if you’re trying to address anxiety or depression or OCD, the target can be different. And if people investigate accelerated TMS in some studies with major depressive disorder, complete remission in 70 to 80% of participants. Wow. And you might need a booster once a year. But compared to taking maintenance drugs every day with non-trivial side effects, accelerated TMS is fascinating. I encourage to be, to check it out there, there are a couple of different devices, but look for accelerated TMS and listen to someone like Nolan Williams. There’s a lot of nonsense floating around. The last one I would say is psychedelic assisted therapies. And I say that last because it’s 00:42:59 [Speaker Changed] Like microdosing of psilocybin or what have you, 00:43:01 [Speaker Changed] Microdosing or macro dosing, meaning most of the scientific literature. And I’ve funded a lot of this science since 2015 with my foundation. I put like double digits of my net worth into this philanthropically, which tells you how much I believe in it. The intermittent use could be once, it could be a few times. Various compounds could be say psilocybin in the case of major depressive disorder or different types of addiction like alcohol use disorder. N NYU is doing a lot of great work on that front. Or MDMA assisted psychotherapy for PTSD. I mean the results are 00:43:38 [Speaker Changed] Very strong. 00:43:39 [Speaker Changed] Mind blowing. Yeah. I mean you, you have complex PTSD people who’ve had, let’s just say an average length of diagnosis of 16, 17 years, which means many, many interventions have failed who do two or three sessions with therapists for MDMAs psychotherapy and they have effectively complete remission of symptoms. That’s 00:43:58 [Speaker Changed] Amazing. 00:43:58 [Speaker Changed] And it is, I believe there’s a psychotherapist named Stanis Leff gr quite legendary in the space who says, you know what the telescope was or is for astronomy, what the microscope is for biology psychedelics will be for the mind. Really. And I believe that these compounds in the study of these compounds, which has become very, very, very popular and de-stigmatized thankfully, will completely revolutionize how we think of neurobiology and psychiatry in, in treating some of these so-called incurable or intractable conditions, including things like anorexia. And many of the things I already mentioned, those would be three that I’d say have had a huge impact on me. And it’s, it’s seems boring. We could talk about it if you want, but exercise, I mean 00:44:48 [Speaker Changed] I was waiting for you to bring that up. ’cause every study in the world says that’s the miracle cure for so much psychological challenges. And it’s not like you haven’t written about 00:45:01 [Speaker Changed] Exercise. Yeah. At all. Did a whole book on it. So yeah, the, the exercise, I’ll just mention two other things briefly. Cold exposure, and by the way, people have been using this for hundreds of years, but 00:45:13 [Speaker Changed] Certainly in the Swedish Nord countries. Oh yeah. It’s been, 00:45:17 [Speaker Changed] You know, forever. Yeah. Cold baths used to be prescribed for melancholy, AKA depression. And there is actually something to it. It could end up being after a few minutes when you shift from solely sympathetic nervous system activation fight or flight to parasympathetic could be actually stimulation of the vagus nerve. Who knows? It’s unclear at this point. But cold exposure matters like that, that is actually very reliable for mood elevation and seems to have some durability, which is wild exercise. People think of exercise and what you read about in the media a lot is like endorphins, endorphins, endorphins. Right. But that is not the full picture. If you wanna stave off Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, et cetera, or let me just broadly say neurodegenerative disease exercise provokes the release for something called Clotho, K-L-O-T-H-O, which people can investigate. And it is critical in staving off or or mitigating the onset and progression of, of these diseases. 00:46:15 So you have cloth endorphins. Sure. You have endorphins, you have endocannabinoids, cannabinoids. Sounds familiar. Like can like cannabis. Right, right. So those ha those can explain a lot both in terms of anti-inflammatory effects of some types of exercise. The, the benefits are just insane. So I would say follow Peter Attias advice. He’s credible, you know, trained at Stanford, Johns Hopkins in terms of zone two training. People can just look him up Zone two training a few times a week and then VO two max training, say once a week and some weight training. But the, if you didn’t do it for the physical benefits at all and just the cognitive benefits, including the release of things like brain drive, neurotrophic factor, that is also just a non-negotiable. 00:47:02 [Speaker Changed] So you mentioned both Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s and Yeah, 00:47:07 [Speaker Changed] I have both in my family. Yeah. 00:47:08 [Speaker Changed] So that’s where I was gonna, the exact question I was gonna ask you were never diagnosed, you just have a genetic predisposition and you’re trying to proactively just get way out 00:47:18 [Speaker Changed] Ahead of this. I’m trying to get ahead of it. Yeah. And unfortunately, you know, a lot of the Alzheimer’s treatments as just to use that, that that disease as, as an example, a lot of the, the interventions fail. I think some scientists would, would agree with this. Not necessarily because the interventions themselves can’t work, but because the interventions are too late. By the time people have really elevated levels of amyloid plaques and tau protein and so on, by the time they have moderate to severe symptoms, it might just be too late. But there is an argument to be made. I mean, it’s very rare that late intervention is better than early intervention. So 00:47:57 [Speaker Changed] I just saw a piece in National Geographic yesterday that was kind of fascinating. It may be possible to detect Alzheimer’s risk sooner as earlier as your twenties. Yeah. So there is some sort of research going on in the space that’s productive. You’re talking about something much more aggressive and individualized to, to take care of your preventative maintenance in advance of being diagnosed with this into your own hands. 00:48:26 [Speaker Changed] Right. And by the way, all the stuff I just mentioned that has helped me from a mental health perspective and physical perspective with insulin sensitivity and so on. Like I just did, you know, I’m about to turn 48, just did my, I do blood testing at least once a quarter and my most recent labs are my best. Yeah, I 00:48:43 [Speaker Changed] See. You just had some I just went to function health. Yeah. Are you familiar with function health? I dunno. Function health. So Silicon Valley startup, they have come up with a way, it’s not a healthcare company, it’s a technology company. And they say we want to take a hundred data point screens of your blood and look at all these different markers to create a baseline. We do this twice a year. Your doctor looks at 15, 20 things normally. Yeah. They’ll go a hundred. And by the way, depending on your genetic predisposition, check all these additional boxes for things like Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, dementia, et cetera. And so now you could check 150 data points and twice a year, especially if you are younger, alright, here’s a benchmark. And you’re creating this ongoing, for lack of a better word, horizontal set of data. And when something sort of spikes or is out of the normal range, you have a baseline that you could go back and, and work. I I literally did this Tuesday. Yeah, I yeah, I can see that. And I was like, oh, that’s a lot of blood, isn’t it? Like you, you, can you leave me a little, I got stuff to do later. But yeah, that in order to do a hundred different data series, they need a lot of different blood. 00:49:55 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. They need some blood. And I, I would say I don’t spend much money on stuff, but I do, I deliberately, some might say overspend on, on health, but what I was gonna say is the, the metabolic psychiatry, the less so accelerated TMS, but all, actually I, I should pull that back. TMS also can be applied to something like Alzheimer’s and psychedelic assisted therapies, the exercise, all of these and the cloth I mentioned specifically within exercise, all of those should in theory, help prevent or mitigate or delay the onset of, of some of these neurodegenerative diseases. So I am trying to get ahead of it. Fortunately, it doesn’t have to be hyper-personalized. Like these things have clinical data or published literature behind them. There’s still a lot of unknowns, but you can do these things now. 00:50:49 [Speaker Changed] So it’s so funny you say hyper-personalized. I, I’m speaking to a buddy who’s a, a psychologist. Hey, who do you have coming up on the show? Oh, this week I’m seeing Tim Ferris and he says, oh, I love Tim. He is, I love this line. He is the chief scientist of Tim Ferriss, the person. And I’m like, that is such a great way to describe it. Yeah, that’s true. You’ve basically created an entire business model around being the chief scientist of your physical health, your mental health, even your genetic health. W was this ever part of the original game plan or did just this just evolve over time? 00:51:33 [Speaker Changed] I’ve almost always been that way in part because I was born premature. I had a ton of health issues, still have issues with thermal regulation, chronic sinusitis, all these things that, 00:51:46 [Speaker Changed] Wait, thermal regulation being thermal regulation, always hot or 00:51:49 [Speaker Changed] Cold, can’t handle hot well, the way that my body handles hot and cold is strange. So I can overheat very easily. As an example, the reason that’s relevant is the one sport that my mom put me in that thanks to her that I could be somewhat successful at. When I was a little runt, I was very small swimming up until about sixth grade wasn’t swimming, it was wrestling because the puny kid gets to go against the other puny kid. But I would overheat really quickly, which meant I needed to try to win quickly before I would hit my red zone. And that just catalyzed all sorts of bizarre, huh? Self experimentation. 00:52:27 [Speaker Changed] That’s interesting. 00:52:28 [Speaker Changed] Learning how to weight cut to use like potassium sparing diuretic. The, the reason that I wanted to make Tim Ferriss lab, this n of one set of experiments was to win at wrestling. That’s how it started. Huh. And then I realized, wait a second, you might be able to apply this stuff to the brain. And then in college I started experimenting with all sorts of stuff. Nothing illegal, but lots of weird stuff that was, I was using kind of off-label like hydrogen, various nootropics and so on. And they did have an effect, like they did have an effect on memory and cognition. Things like desmopressin for short term memory, for memorizing Chinese characters. Like that stuff worked right there. There’s no biological free lunch with that stuff. So 00:53:12 [Speaker Changed] What are the, why no free lunch? What’s the side effect? Well, 00:53:15 [Speaker Changed] You do pay, you do pay a price. I would just say a, a couple of quick tips for health tracking and so on, and I’m not a doctor, I don’t play one on the internet. But number one, since you mentioned it earlier, is I get blood tests done once a quarter at, at the very least. Now why is that? Well, I want more frame as high a frame rate as possible to look at trends. But separately, I wanna catch things early if I need to catch things. But I would say that if you do infrequent blood tests, the risk is that you get one set of lab results back and you make a ton of big decisions based on those labs. Here’s what I’ll say. There are lab errors all the time. And if you’re gonna do consistent blood tests, consistent is, is, is the key. In other words, do it on the same day of the week at the same time. Oh 00:54:05 [Speaker Changed] Really? Yes. I would not have guessed that. 00:54:07 [Speaker Changed] That’s interesting because your testosterone has diurnal, it has. 00:54:11 [Speaker Changed] So the quest diagnostics as an example. Yeah. Don’t eat, don’t take supplements, don’t take any meds, whatever’s on your, your prescription lists. Stop the night before unless your doctor says don’t stop. Yeah. Follow 00:54:23 [Speaker Changed] Your doctor. But I’m saying if you measure your, 00:54:24 [Speaker Changed] But like you’re saying Monday at 10 is more important than, how significant 00:54:29 [Speaker Changed] Is that? Just be consistent because wow, if you, let’s just say you drink on the weekends and then you do your lab test on Monday morning versus doing it on Wednesday morning, some of your results might be different 00:54:39 [Speaker Changed] Of course. I mean that’s 00:54:40 [Speaker Changed] Obvious, but No, that’s, it’s not obvious to people because then really then they might have, after a weekend with birthday party with a friend and drinking, they have elevated liver enzymes like a LT or a sd, right? All of a sudden doctor only sees it once a year. He has no idea of the context. That’s fair. Testosterone, all these things can vary tremendously. And there are lab errors. So I would say before 00:55:02 [Speaker Changed] You, plus you also just get the regular noise and range and Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes you’re low normal, sometimes you’re high normal, but it’s all, nothing is flatlined over time. Yeah. 00:55:13 [Speaker Changed] There’s gonna be normal variation. So I, I would just say that I’ll, I’ll keep it to one piece for now. Like really, if you’re about to get on a bunch of meds, unless it’s an emergency, look, there are emergencies that you need to deal with. But if it’s like, okay, you have this problem, we’re gonna put you on this med for the next year, before you do that, do the test again. Just get another blood test. Two days, two days later. 00:55:35 [Speaker Changed] Second opinion, 00:55:36 [Speaker Changed] Just confirm it. Huh. And again, not a doctor, not medical advice, informational purpose is only blah, blah, blah. But there 00:55:42 [Speaker Changed] You go. Dumb question. All the stuff you’ve done, game creation is not on your cv. Why did you decide to create a 00:55:52 [Speaker Changed] Game? Yeah, it seems like a total non sequitur. So a few reasons. Number one, I grew up feeling like I was saved by games specifically Dungeons and Dragons. 00:56:04 [Speaker Changed] Well, I know a ton. I have a ton of friends, many of whom were neurodivergent and d and d was a lifeline. Lifeline, 00:56:13 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely lifeline. So I, I may be pretty squarely in the neurodivergent camp. I’m not sure. 00:56:17 [Speaker Changed] Do you still play? 00:56:18 [Speaker Changed] I don’t, but here’s why 00:56:20 [Speaker Changed] I, I know plenty of guys. 40, 50. Yeah. Weekly games. Forget poker. It’s, 00:56:24 [Speaker Changed] It’s, it’s too much of a commitment for me now initially. So I’ve always wanted to make a game that could help produce the magic and joy and frankly, I mean, sort of the like cognitive training of d and DI think DD is just an incredible game. Kudos to, you know, TSR and Gary Ax and everybody who’s, who’s created that game. It’s unreal. But if you’re gonna be serious about DD, it’s like being serious about World of Warcraft, right? Like this is your new part-time job. Yeah. I mean, it’s many, many, many hours. So as someone now who’s like, everybody else got a lot going on, maybe I have a dinner with friends and we have an hour afterwards, there’s no way we’re gonna play d and d, right? There’s no way we’re gonna play a complex board game. I was curious to see though, if I could create something, and a lot of the, the podcast is interviewing people I might want to do something with, but that’s unspoken. 00:57:16 So I interviewed Alan Lee, who’s the founder of Exploding Kittens. Yeah. One of the most successful game development companies in the world. And I wanted to see if maybe kind of pulling from my childhood experience, I could create a game with him that would be easy to learn, hard to master, very, very fun for families, friends, whoever. Kind of goofy, but also ideally, and this is yet to be proven. So just to be clear, I’m actually hoping to do a study on this, but that could also possibly be a type of brain training and cognitive training. So I’m like, so 00:57:50 [Speaker Changed] You set the bar really low, right? Yeah. Just easy to learn. Yeah. Hard to master. Incredibly fun. Oh, with all sorts of cognitive benefits. 00:57:59 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. So, 00:58:00 [Speaker Changed] You know, large, low target. Start, start slow with your first 00:58:02 [Speaker Changed] Game. Well, that’s why it took two years to land on something. Really. 00:58:06 [Speaker Changed] Oh yeah. That’s a long time to build what’s effectively a simple, I have a copy of this at home and you guys also sent me a copy here, so I want to open this up and go over it with, but give the listeners a quick explanation of exactly what this game is about. 00:58:21 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. So the game Coyote, it’s called Coyote because of the sort of trickster, deity association and a lot of mythologies, also uniquely American Coyote or North American, I should say. It’s, it’s a, it’s very much a sort of new Americas animal, but the Trier piece is important. So Coyote is a game, you can think of it as rock paper, scissors in a group on steroids with many different hilarious movements and gestures. And basically you can play competitively where it’s last person standing wins or you can play as a team collaboratively. There are reasons that we had both options, but the basic gist is it’s a rhythmic game where you’re going around in a circle and you’re, each player’s dealing out cards that make a sequence of gestures harder and more confusing and more hilarious, and you each get three lives and last person standing in competitive mode wins. That’s it. So you can play, I have friends who’ve played with their, like 6-year-old daughters. Even though the box says 10 years old, it’s, it’s very challenging. When it gets challenging, I guess it’s 10 minutes a game, roughly, probably. Right. So pretty low lift, but if you wanna get good at it, you can play it over and over and over and over again. Every game’s gonna be totally different. 00:59:44 [Speaker Changed] One of the things I was kind of fascinated by watching the gameplay was it’s a combination of words and gestures that you have to recall and do an order while there’s the rhythmic noise going on at, at the same time that you’re creating. Tell us a little bit about how you guys came up with this and, and what was it like collaborating with Exploding kittens? 01:00:08 [Speaker Changed] We tried dozens of different prototypes before getting to this one, and we were kind of stuck because the question that I was asking myself was the wrong question. The question I was asking myself is, what types of board games or card games do I enjoy? And that didn’t get, I mean, your answers are only gonna be as good as your questions. Right. And that wasn’t working. We had done various brainstorming sprints and like La New York, long Island, and then flew to Canada to spend time with the co-founder exploiting kittens. And we did our last sprint. It was like, okay, look, we’ve been at this for a while. We’re either gonna land on something or let’s call, call it quits and just call a spade of spade. 01:00:48 [Speaker Changed] So a little pressure on at the end. 01:00:50 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Yeah. I mean, deadlines, you know, the magic of deadlines and expanded it to what games of any type have you enjoyed? And I, this might make me sound like a simple tin, but like having drinks and playing rock paper scissors with your dumb friends is I think very entertaining. Side note, especially if you try to do it with water in your mouth, try that with a friend. But 01:01:13 [Speaker Changed] What does water in your mouth affect? Rock, paper, 01:01:16 [Speaker Changed] Scissors. When, when people laugh, they spit water all over themselves. So I, it makes it increasingly challenging, especially if people have had a few drinks, not recommending everybody drink. So we started with that as this building block. It’s like, okay, well how can we make that group play? And then I was interested in the cognitive stuff, as I mentioned, and this is, look, I haven’t proven this, but I I think it’s, it’s quite similar. You’re looking at like interference effects. There are things like the Wisconsin card sorting test, blah, blah, blah, and exploding kittens. They have an amazing track record. The whole company started with this game, exploding Kittens, which was I think the largest Kickstarter of all time. Wow. At that point in time, the leaders of the company are still game designers. So it’s not a huge bureaucratic thing run by no offense to middle managers. They’re important, but it’s like people who are managers versus makers, like the people who run the company are still some of the best in the world at creating games. Right. Elon Lee was involved with developing Xbox. He’s been involved with creating entirely new genres of games, just a genius at, at creating games. So it’s been a blast. Their team is awesome. They’re scrappy, you know, it’s relatively small. Like they really punch above their weight class. 01:02:30 [Speaker Changed] Still a startup, nimble able to, 01:02:32 [Speaker Changed] It feels, yeah. It feels like a startup. Like what they do with the number of people they have is just astonishing. It’s been awesome. 01:02:39 [Speaker Changed] I get a sense that because you’re such a thoughtful person, anytime you enter a new sphere, part of you sort of floats above your body and says, what’s going on in this space? Yeah, totally. I, I’ve had that experience in publishing. Yeah. Like, wait, I don’t understand the book industry. Why, why do they behave this way? So I have to ask you that question about the game industry. Sure. When you’re looking at, at gaming generally, what was your experience like going into not only an entirely new space that you haven’t worked in in the past, but like, did you kinda look at the game industry and say, Hey, this whole place is just wacky and so different from everything else? 01:03:26 [Speaker Changed] All of the above. And I, I treated doing something like the game as I treat the startups. So it’s, if I make no money on this, will the relationships developed and the skills and knowledge be something I would pay for? Right. Would I actually pay 01:03:41 [Speaker Changed] Tuition? 01:03:42 [Speaker Changed] Exactly. Would I pay tuition for what I’m going to learn? And the answer is yes. Right. Ilan Lee genius. The people like blinks amazing, by the way. You want a scrappy creative team. If you’re gonna deal with things like tariffs, by the way, are 01:03:55 [Speaker Changed] Are tar do tariffs, I mean, I’m sure assuming these are manufactured somewhere outside of the United States. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Are, do you have to pay tariffs on 01:04:03 [Speaker Changed] Oh, every, every gaming company in the US pretty much tabletop game is getting smashed. Really? Yep. So you want people who are creative and can think outside the box. Hmm. For something like that, from the implications of something like that to contending with mass, mass retail, like Walmart and Target, for 01:04:21 [Speaker Changed] Instance. Yeah. You’re, you’re, you’re at Walmart, you’re at Target, you’re on Amazon. Yeah. These are challenging retailers to get shelf space, quote unquote from, oh, next 01:04:30 [Speaker Changed] To how did that happen to next to Impossible. 01:04:32 [Speaker Changed] And yet you hit, that’s the whole, you hit for the, for the cycle. Walmart, target, yeah. Amazon. Where else is what’s 01:04:39 [Speaker Changed] Left? If I’m gonna do it, my, you know, my, this is my maybe one and only game, and if my name’s gonna be on it, I need to be very happy with it. And so 01:04:47 [Speaker Changed] How did you guys manage to penetrate that? 01:04:49 [Speaker Changed] Well, I’ll, I’ll say first that what’s not gonna work is if you are a sole inventor who comes up with the world’s greatest game, a company like a Walmart or Target is not equipped, rightly so, to deal with thousands of independent game designers who don’t understand retail, don’t understand margins, don’t understand supply chain management, don’t understand net payment terms and returns and all of these things. So if you want to have a seat at the table or even a chance to have a seat at the table, you need to, I think this is fair to say, partner with someone who already has shelf space and multiple SKUs so that you can be added to the lineup. And that was another reason to partner with someone like an exploiting kittens. And yes, you can do a lot online and the game is on Amazon. It’s been exclusive at Walmart for the first few months. 01:05:39 And then the social video plays, like you mentioned, went completely nuts. And it’s actually now past 300 million. So it just keeps going and going and going, wow. The, the videos of people playing this game. But you can do a lot that is, say, direct to consumer via an Amazon or just your website or Kickstarter. But it’s very easy for techies to underestimate just how incredibly powerful and widely distributed the Walmarts and Targets of the world are. Sure. I mean, 90% of the US is within 10 miles of one of those or 15 minutes. Wow. It’s, I mean, even the food security of the United States depends on these companies. 01:06:16 [Speaker Changed] And you price this at 9 99. Yeah, less than 10 bucks. Very reasonable. Yep. I’m gonna assume at if, if this game is as successful as you hope it will be. And early indications are that it, it can be, you could come up with a second pack, a different focus. 01:06:34 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Expansion packs something completely different. Maybe I try a more complicated, like role-playing game, something like that. Who knows. But in my case, right, with something like this, I’m used to kind of tiptoeing into things and testing the waters and 01:06:48 [Speaker Changed] No, no, you’re jumping in z 01:06:50 [Speaker Changed] The jump band. I mean, even with say the four hour work week, it’s like, had I land on that title, I split tested all of the titles and subtitles on Google AdWords and then looked at the outlier that was many standard deviations away from the rest. And that was the four hour work week. So like that’s how I, huh. I don’t like taking risks. I actually think of myself as a risk mitigator, but in this case, 01:07:11 [Speaker Changed] I’m fascinated by that. ’cause Yeah, you very much strike me as someone who has embraced risk his whole career. Yeah. While rationalizing the potential downside. I don’t, I don’t wanna play pop psychologist, but, but you not somebody, it’s like, alright, I’m starting out as a studying biology. No, no. I’m pivoting to Asian studies. I’m living in Japan. I’m stopping what I’m doing to write a book. Oh, now I’m gonna pivot to startups. Yeah. That is not the life experience of a someone who’s risk averse. 01:07:45 [Speaker Changed] Well, I, I would on one hand agree with you. On the other hand, I would say I think that most risks are incredibly overblown. I would put agree, I would, I would put risks in quotation marks, and not to beat a dead horse, but if you’re choosing what you do, based on what you’re gonna learn, the skills you’re gonna develop, the relationships you’re gonna develop or deepen, it’s very hard to fail over time. So if, if you’re able to be, and this applies to investing, obviously, but like long-term greedy, right? 01:08:15 [Speaker Changed] That’s right. 01:08:15 [Speaker Changed] Not short-term, greedy. It’s very hard to lose over time. If you’re choosing, let me be very clear. Ideally, areas where you would pay tuition projects, where you would pay tuition for those things with relationships or skills that can transfer outside of that one project, which I’m always doing. And if you do that, like with Coyote, okay, let’s say, let’s just say hypothetically, I don’t think this is gonna happen. ’cause I, I think the tariffs are just a bargaining chip for mineral access. I hope you’re right. And other things that’ll be traded with 01:08:47 [Speaker Changed] China. That’s specific my thinking. I’m on the same page as you. Let’s hope that this is just a negotiating tack. 01:08:53 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. I mean, otherwise we’re, we’re also like cutting off our nose to spite our face. Yes. I’m just so interdependent. So it’s, it’s, it’s a bargaining chip. I don’t expect that to continue. But let’s just say that tariffs put every game company in the US out of business, except for one or two. Then will this still have been worth my time? Absolutely. 100%. Because I have no, I’m not getting an advance for this. I’m doing a profit share. Right. I want, I want incentives to be fully, fully aligned. 01:09:21 [Speaker Changed] I, I did the same thing with my book. I don’t want an advance. I wanna see what our upside there is. Yeah. By the way, I really have to push back. This is just me. Maybe there’s a little push. 01:09:31 [Speaker Changed] I love it. 01:09:32 [Speaker Changed] Maybe there’s a little projection. You are not risk averse. You really aren’t. And I love the way you’ve rationalized or it’s not an excuse, it’s an explanation. It’s like 01:09:45 [Speaker Changed] Reframing it. Yeah. 01:09:46 [Speaker Changed] You, you’ve framed this into, well, I’m gonna take this risk, but I’m hedged because my downside is I get skills, I get knowledge, I get people and, and relationships. So the worst case scenario is all these good things happen. Yep. You are very much a risk embracer. 01:10:03 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And, and also if you look at my projects, it’s, it’s not a sequence of start, finish, start finish, start finish. It’s more like a Gantt chart where things are overlapping. So you look at this game, it’s like, yeah, I put a ton, I’ve been involved with every, every single possible aspect of this game. We play tested it with a hundred plus families, blah, blah, blah. But podcast is still going. The books are still producing royalties. Right. I still have angel investments and therefore I very rarely have all of my eggs in one basket. 01:10:35 [Speaker Changed] So two last questions on the game before we’ll get to our speed round. Yeah. First, this is obviously a low tech card game. Yep. Was this a purposeful decision to avoid screens to not create more screen time? Yeah, 01:10:52 [Speaker Changed] A hundred percent. I would say, if I look at the mental health of my audience, let’s just call it 20 million people a month or something over the last 10 years, the degree of like depression, anxiety, nihilism is shocking to see, especially in my audience, which is typically antithetical to those things. Right. Maybe not depression, but very optimistic. 01:11:14 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. There’s a little self-selection there. Hey, I have this issue, Tim seems to figure this out. Yeah. Let me work my way there. There 01:11:19 [Speaker Changed] There’s a little bit of that. But if you look at, let’s just say the writing of, you know, Derek Thompson made it amazing writer at The Atlantic who does a lot more, 01:11:27 [Speaker Changed] No longer at the Atlantic. Now he has his own substack. Yeah. 01:11:29 [Speaker Changed] Right. That’s right. He went full in on Substack. And actually this piece I think is from Substack, but it was effectively, I think it’s simply Americans need to have more fun. But it talk 01:11:39 [Speaker Changed] The decline of partying in America. That’s right. 01:11:41 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. That effectively, I think it’s something atrocious like one in 25 families or people have social plans in person for any given weekend and it’s down for certain. Is 01:11:54 [Speaker Changed] That right? Yeah. That’s 01:11:55 [Speaker Changed] Amazing. And it’s down for certain age brackets. 70% in the last 10 years. And I really feel like digital isn’t inherently bad, but the dose makes the poison. Yes. And, and I think that if digital excess is the problem, then analog is the antidote. I really feel like people need to interact with other humans. We’re not evolved for pure screen time. We are not. Period. 01:12:21 [Speaker Changed] A hundred percent. You’re a hundred percent. So last question on the game. Yeah. What are your expectations for this? How do you define success? And I’m gonna prevent you from saying I’ve already succeeded due to my collaboration, the whole experience I give you. Give you a experience on that. Hold that aside. Yeah. What’s your minimum expectations and what would surprise you? To the upside 01:12:40 [Speaker Changed] Minimum expectation is that this finds a small band of diehard lovers of the game. Everybody should read 1000 True Fans by Kevin Kelly. Just go to kk.org. It’s free. Read that. That would be super gratifying. But also, I always aim high. So I, I mean I want this to be the bestselling game at all of the major retailers. That’s incredibly hard to do, by the way. I mean 01:13:07 [Speaker Changed] That’s, that’s millions of units. 01:13:09 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. I mean you’re dealing with tens of millions, the Unos and the behemoths of the space. Right? So to do that is incredibly hard. That’s what I’m aiming for. I think that the products, you know, the game can stand on its own two feet. Like people do love this game. And the reason I like to do that is not because I wanna set myself up for disappointment, but as I think it’s Larry Page of Google has said what people miss is it’s very hard to fail completely. If I aim for that and I’m 50% short, I’m still having had the excitement and the motivation and potential payoff of that huge goal, it’s still gonna exceed my expectations that I would’ve had 01:13:51 [Speaker Changed] A year or two. And just moving into a different space is its own rewards. ’cause it’s so, yeah. You know, it really exercises different parts of the brain than you normally get to, to play 01:14:00 [Speaker Changed] With. It’s, it’s also easy to pigeonhole yourself or get pigeonholed. Which is why after the success of the four Hour work week bought me permission to write more books. I didn’t do the three hour work week. I, I didn’t do the four hour work week for, you know, the sort of single mother soul or whatever. I didn’t do these line extensions ’cause I didn’t want to get pigeonholed as a business author. That’s why I did the Four Hour Body and everything on athletic performance because I wanted to be in a different category in the bookstore to see if my readers would follow me. And as soon as I proved to myself that was the case, and to publishers, well, you know, when I hit number one New York Times and blah blah blah, then I could write about whatever I wanted. And so this is another way of testing that, you know, could I play in a completely different sandbox. 01:14:44 [Speaker Changed] So before we get to our five favorite questions, I’ve pulled a few of your questions that either you ask on your pod or other people have asked you. And let’s do this as a speed round and see, lets do it. See 01:14:56 [Speaker Changed] How many it, I’ll try to keep my answer shorter. 01:14:58 [Speaker Changed] Right. Tell us about a hundred dollars or less purchase that has positively impact your life. Be specific. 01:15:05 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I will be specific. Now I’m gonna put in one shameless plug, which is, if people want to figure out this game, just go to coyote game.com. Okay. Back to our regular programming. Two things I would say that have impacted me in the last year would be, there’s something called the Alpha Ball, which is from Tuneup Fitness. And this is something you can use for soft tissue work, for a sore back, for dealing with your IT bands, anything. And it’s much better than a foam roller because you can really get into specific spots. It’s very easy to use. You can use it against a wall instead of laying on the floor. And it’s small enough to travel with. So I’d say the Alpha Ball is one, have that my luggage right now because I’m traveling. And then the other one is actually a meditation app called The Way. And it’s taught by someone named Henry Shukman. And it’s more or less a zen type of meditation. Full disclosure, I ended up becoming an advisor to these guys. ’cause I love, I ended up loving the app so much, but I use that once or twice a day. 10 minutes each session. And it’s teaching you sort of a 01:16:14 [Speaker Changed] Guided meditation, is that right? 01:16:16 [Speaker Changed] It’s a it, they’re guided meditations, but it’s a sequence of practical skills that you’re developing that you can apply outside of meditation, which is why I like it so much. So I’d say those are two that immediately come to mind. 01:16:29 [Speaker Changed] So you’ve spent your whole career delving into new areas, learning new skills and learning them quickly. What’s your favorite cheat code for that? 01:16:39 [Speaker Changed] Favorite cheat code is probably picking the skills in the first place. So what I mean by that is if you want to get the best golf coach in the world, you might not be able to afford it. You probably can’t afford it. It’s gonna be, it’s a very common sport. There are a lot of wealthy people involved. It’s gonna be hard to get direct instruction from somebody who’s top of the field. But if you choose, say almost anything, swimming, archery, whatever it might be. And you look for say, not gold medalists, but silver medalists. Right. Who are by the way, frequently just as good. They 01:17:17 [Speaker Changed] Just, right. It’s the 10th of a second. They, they 01:17:19 [Speaker Changed] Just, yeah. They just, they exactly. They just got 10 minutes less sleep than the other person that day. You can get some of the people who are best in the world to teach you at, at a cost that is next to nothing. So I would say that number one is picking, coming back to that definition that we talked about with the four hour work week with business and entrepreneurship, like picking the goal first. The second is looking at frequency of use. So for languages, for instance, a lot of people just dive into learning languages. Well I think that material beats method, in other words, like picking what you’re gonna learn very carefully is more important, at least in sequence than choosing how you’re gonna do it. A lot of people ask like, what’s the best way to learn X? And I’m like, first of all, you should ask what should I learn? And you can look at word frequency lists and things like that. And for a language like Spanish, Japanese, whatever, find the 1000 or 1500 most frequently used words. You can learn that in a few weeks. 01:18:15 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Duolingo du part of 01:18:17 [Speaker Changed] Your Duolingo is outstanding. I mean, of course I’m biased ’cause I invested in their first round. I, 01:18:21 [Speaker Changed] We just were in Paris three years ago, Amsterdam two years ago, Rome last year. And Duolingo, just for those basic phrases is amazing. 01:18:31 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, it’s great. You can, I mean, I’ve used it for Korean as well to refresh my Korean, which I studied in school. Yeah. And 01:18:36 [Speaker Changed] That’s a tough language, right? 01:18:38 [Speaker Changed] It’s tough. The grammar’s almost identical to Japanese. So I’ve a leg up there. But by the way, like people, if there’s a cartoon, I think it’s like learning how to read Korean 15 minutes. There’s a comic book that literally will teach you how to read Korean. You won’t understand what the hell you’re reading, but you’ll be able to sound out phonetically Korean. And like, it’s a bit of an exaggeration. I’d say it probably takes an hour. But Duolingo is very well designed and I, I have seen every possible language startup. My fans sent me that one. By the way, my fans also recommended that I connect with Shopify ’cause they knew I I was interested in eCommerce. Huh. So a lot of my best deals have come from my, my readers and my, my listeners. But the Duolingo came about ’cause they were enclosed beta. And a number of my fans reached out and said, you have to try this really? And so I got access and I looked at it and I was like, oh yeah, this is fundamentally different from everything else I’ve seen. 01:19:31 [Speaker Changed] Give us an example of an unusual habit or just absurd thing that you love. 01:19:37 [Speaker Changed] I like repeating numbers. Could be the OCD. Go ahead. So I take a screenshot whenever I see five fifty five on my phone. So I have hundreds of screenshots of typically 5:55 PM I just love repeating those specific, repeating numbers. I a lot of folks like 1111, nothing against 1111. I think that’s, that’s perfectly fine. But I’m just more of a 5, 5, 5 guy. 01:19:59 [Speaker Changed] Those 11, 11 people, they don’t know what’s up. It’s all about, have you seen the old style analog almost neon tubes that are clocks? 01:20:10 [Speaker Changed] Yes, I 01:20:10 [Speaker Changed] Have. They like what happens when that rolls over to 1111? Do you see something like that? And just shrug and like 01:20:16 [Speaker Changed] 5, 5, 5. I still find it pleasant. I like symmetry. So 1111 has the advantage over 5, 5, 5 that it is pleasingly symmetrical. Like this old friend I used to have Mike Kim, his name is a palindrome. It’s the 01:20:32 [Speaker Changed] Same. Right? I was gonna say 5, 5, 5 is a palindrome, but it’s not truly symmetrical vis 01:20:36 [Speaker Changed] Visually. Exactly. Yeah. 01:20:38 [Speaker Changed] So, so there is, we were talking there a diversion earlier. One of the things I kind of was shocked to learn in the A DHD world is why people will play a song over and over and over again because it tickles a part of their brain that is relevant to certain emotional expressions that tend to be more difficult or absence. And it, it makes that like, oh, you’re getting that feedback that you, you haven’t been able to get in the real world. It sounds like the 5 5 5 and the 1111 tickles a similar part of the brain. Yeah, 01:21:16 [Speaker Changed] It could be. I think for me there’s just something soothing about repetition. I don’t know what it is. I mean, it’s why, you know, I mentioned archery, like I love archery and for most people 01:21:25 [Speaker Changed] Archery. 01:21:26 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. I love archery and also language learning for most, for a lot of, there’s a lot of repetition involved. And for many people, and I think this is fair, they cannot imagine something more boring than going through conjugations or doing archery. Which by the way, if you’re doing it at a high level, you are effectively trying to do exactly the same thing over and over again. 01:21:51 [Speaker Changed] Isn’t that true for any particular athletic skill? I mean the variations multiply. You have basketball, you have five people on, on five people. Yeah. And so just extrapolate that out exponentially. And there are a million variations, the same with chess, whatever. But it really doesn’t matter. Each particular play move step is you’re trying to optimize that and do precisely what you need. Even something like darts. But there are so many variations to your musculature. Your, your thought process is any sport boring hitting a tennis ball? Yeah. I mean, it’s the same stroke over and over again. But there’s a bajillion variations of what can happen. 01:22:34 [Speaker Changed] That’s true. Which makes it interesting with archery, you’re standing in one place shooting at the same thing. Right. Thousands of times. Right. 01:22:42 [Speaker Changed] Any sharp shooting riflery darts, it’s go, go down the list’s 01:22:45 [Speaker Changed] Gonna be highly repetitive. Right Now I like the other sports too, like tennis. I would say that also confusingly, if people are interested in the accelerated learning stuff, the, the, my third book, the Four Hour Chef is basically a book on accelerated learning disguised as a cookbook. So it get, it gets into like how to learn, how to shoot three pointers, language learning, all this stuff. You can get a lot further. For instance, I think number one, adults can learn languages faster than children actually really 01:23:13 [Speaker Changed] With, if you, that, that is very an opposite to accepted wisdom. 01:23:17 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. I I absolutely believe adults can learn languages more quickly than kids with a few constraints applied. And just a couple of systems. I mean, I, I really think for, for a native English speakers, for say a romance language or something that isn’t too far flung, like Chinese is gonna be different, but eight weeks you can be conversationally pretty fluent, like pretty functional if you were to carve out not three hours a week. That’s where kids have the advantage is that they’re forced to do it all the time. And they have no choice. They have no mortgage, they have no job. That’s right. But, but if you were to put in say, 10 hours a week and take it really seriously, eight to 12 weeks, you could be very functional. 01:24:02 [Speaker Changed] Very fluent. 01:24:03 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Like you could get around and have like a, a conversation for 10 to 15 minutes with someone. 01:24:08 [Speaker Changed] Wow. Let’s jump to our favorite five questions. We ask all of our guests. Starting really simple. What are you streaming these days? Give us your favorite Netflix, Amazon Prime or podcast. What, what’s keeping you entertained? 01:24:21 [Speaker Changed] Well, I just finished the last of us, which I thought was spectacularly well done. Especially as an adaptation from a video game. I am very interested in Korean animation because I saw a film on Netflix called Lost in Starlight, which absolutely blew my mind. Just the lost 01:24:40 [Speaker Changed] In Starlight. 01:24:41 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. The, the, the quality and the visual beauty of this animation made my head spin. Because you don’t, well I think most people do not associate South Korea with animation. You might think of Japan. 01:24:54 [Speaker Changed] Isn’t that where most of our low-cost animation is coming from over the past? Well that’s not CGI. 01:24:59 [Speaker Changed] There’s, there’s a lot of lower cost animation. Yes. But when you think of, say, cinematic right. Animation and Studio Gili out of Japan, let’s just say people tend to think of Disney, Pixar, studio Ojibwe. And I think Korea’s gonna be a powerhouse for high quality feature length animation. We’ll see, we, we shall see. But Lost in Starlight is a, is a recent fave. And then I’ve got some weird ones. Like there’s a German language documentary on fasting that I found on YouTube. You can’t watch it in the US but you can use A VPN to, 01:25:33 [Speaker Changed] I was gonna say you could watch anything anyway. Yeah. 01:25:35 [Speaker Changed] You can use, you can use A VPN to pretend like you’re in Germany and then you can watch it and just use the automatic 01:25:40 [Speaker Changed] Subtitle. What’s the name of that one? 01:25:42 [Speaker Changed] Oh, some long German name. I’m just getting started with it. So unfortunately I can’t remember. But it’s, it’s looking at specifically someone who did, I wanna say a two to three week supervised fast at the Wilhelmina Institute, who has fasted many, many, many thousands of people. I, I have some bones to pick with their approach, but I, I nonetheless find that they have such a huge data set, really fascinating. So I’m looking at that one. And then podcasts, I found a new podcast recently called STEM Talk, which features interviews with scientists mostly. And I’ve listened to an interview with someone named Kevin Tracy, T-R-A-C-E-Y, who is a very widely cited scientist who’s arguably the most credible researcher who has established a lot related to the vagus nerve and vagus nerve stimulation. Sure. There’s, there’s a lot of BS and pseudoscience and nonsense floating around. He is a real signal amongst the noise. So I’m listening to a bunch of STEM talk different scientists on STEM talk. Huh. And the, the interviewers are outstanding. It, 01:26:53 [Speaker Changed] It’s interesting you referenced YouTube because mostly starting in the pandemic, but just ramping up since then, I wanna say it’s become 50, 60% of my Yeah. Television viewing. It’s amazing how 01:27:07 [Speaker Changed] It’s also great for finding documentaries that you can’t find anywhere else. Right. So I think there’s a documentary. I, I’m the name is something like Learning How to See or The Art of Seeing, and it’s about David Hockney. 01:27:23 [Speaker Changed] Oh, 01:27:23 [Speaker Changed] Okay. 01:27:24 [Speaker Changed] Big fan. The 01:27:24 [Speaker Changed] Spectacular documentary. It’s grainy, but you can find it on YouTube. And I, I I was not able to find it anywhere else. 01:27:30 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Amazing. You mentioned one of your mentors earlier. Tell us about who your mentors were and how they helped shape your career. 01:27:39 [Speaker Changed] Early mentors Steven Gork. He was a martial arts instructor when I was probably 12, 13. Just from the perspective of physical and mental toughness. ’cause the class was all adults and then it was me. They did not take it easy on me. And I was very grateful for that. They weren’t abusive, but they treated me like an adult who was training for, for real. And I think from a toughness perspective, he, he always reiterated that I could do more than I thought I could do. Much like my wrestling coach in high school, John Buxton, who even to this day, many of his wrestlers have gone on to do amazing things and they all reference back to him then Ed Chao, who is that professor in high tech entrepreneurship in Princeton. There are other people who indirectly or pretty directly, although they wouldn’t have expected it informed later what I did. For instance, John McPhee, amazing, amazing nonfiction writer who staff writer for the New Yorker. He is got at least one Pulitzer Prize for coming into the country, I think. And he taught a class at Princeton’s seminar called The Literature Fact, which was on nonfiction writing. And I took 01:28:52 [Speaker Changed] The literature of fact, what a great name. 01:28:54 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And that class in terms of thinking about structure, how to structure writing, which by the way helps you structure your thinking. So all of my grades in my other classes went up when I took that class. It was no kidding. It was wild to see. Huh. And I’m sure there are many more. I mean, right after graduation, Mike Maples Jr. In terms of teaching me the ropes of Angel investing. That that’s 01:29:16 [Speaker Changed] A good, good starter list for 01:29:18 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, it’s a pretty good roster. I was very lucky. Let’s 01:29:21 [Speaker Changed] Talk about books. What are some of your favorites? What are you reading right now? 01:29:25 [Speaker Changed] Some of my favorites would be Letters from a Stoic, which is by Marcus Seneca. Seneca in this case, meditation’s by Marcus as well. So letters from Stoic by Seneca for thriving in a high stress, high conflict world. I think that Stoicism, particularly as communicated by Seneca, is very, very, very present and applicable. And frankly fun to read too. Although that might sound odd. Applied to stoicism. So Letters from Stoic, I would say Vagabonding, a book by Rolfe Pots. I think the subtitle is The Uncommon Art of Long-Term World Travel, which is really, it’s a book on long-term travel, but it’s a book on, it’s a Phil philosophical treatise too. That’s a great fun read. Those are, those are two faves that come to mind. One More Awareness by Anthony Dello, I believe the subtitle is The Promises and Perils of Reality. It’s, it’s just about becoming more aware. So taking yourself out of the automatic loops that we all have and adopt from parents and so on. Really good book. It’s like 120 pages. And then in terms of what I’m reading right now, I just started a book called The Great Nerve, which is by Kevin Tracy, that scientist I mentioned. And it’s all about, on Vegas, it’s all about the vagus nerve research related to vagus nerve stimulation, et cetera. 01:30:56 [Speaker Changed] What’s the book that you’ve given most as a gift and why? 01:31:00 [Speaker Changed] The books I’ve given most as a gift includes some of the books that I mentioned. And if you, if someone were to stay at my guest bedroom in my house, I have shelves. Each shelf just has 15 copies of these books and I take one 01:31:14 [Speaker Changed] With you. 01:31:15 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, take, take, take whatever you like. So I would say that’s a great idea. I love that. It’s fun. It’s also very visually pleasing for someone like me. So the same, same, great. It’s very, very, very aesthetically pleasing. So Awareness by Anthony Dello for sure. I’ve gifted hundreds of copies of this book, letters from stoic, hundreds of copies of that book back in the day. Now there are a million copies, or I shouldn’t say a million copies now. There are a million different books on the subject of psychedelics and psychedelic history, psychedelic science, but How to Change Your Mind by Michael Pollen. For a while I had that in my room because I got early galleys of that book and have since ended up doing a bunch of collaborations with, with Michael, who’s amazing. But otherwise, I also gift my friends who are nonfiction purists who are too busy to meditate, too busy to read fiction. 01:32:07 I tend to give them books of poetry because I’m like, you need to slow down and if you feel like you can’t meditate for 10 minutes a day, you need to meditate for an hour a day. That type of, that type of logic leads me to give them a very short collection of, for instance, there’s a, a new translation of Rumi poetry, relatively new called Gold by Hala. Liza GRI is her name, who’s incredible. She’s based in New York City and native, native speaker also who’s able to go to the source material. So gold, which is a new compilation of short roomy poetry that is well translated. Unlike a lot of versions you might find. It’s like a hundred pages. And I just say to my friend, I’m like, look, don’t read this A to Z, just read one before you go to bed every night. And those are probably the most gifted in the last handful of years. 01:33:05 [Speaker Changed] That, that sounds really interesting. Our final two questions. What sort of advice would you give to a recent college grad interested in a career in fill in the blank, writing, podcasting, seed investing, game design. What would you tell them? 01:33:25 [Speaker Changed] If, if it’s nonfiction book writing, I would say, number one, are you really sure you want to do that? It’s not, it’s not, don’t assume it’s a good way to make money. ’cause generally it’s not. But I would say also, if it’s a recent grad, I would say if you’re gonna write nonfiction, probably go do something interesting before you try to write something interesting. That would be my advice. That’s what, you know, very fair. That’s what John McFee does. That’s what many folks have done. It’s like I get some life experience doing something first and then write about it would probably be my recommendation in the realm of investing finance, I would say that probably ensure you have an informational behavioral or network, meaning relationship advantage with whatever you choose to do. Unless you’re gonna do something like lowcost index funds, which I think actually are a great idea for a lot of people. And I, I myself also invest in very, very low cost index funds. 01:34:31 [Speaker Changed] That’s your core. You could build, you know, that’s your tree. You could throw some ornaments around it. 01:34:35 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, yeah, exactly. I wanna like keep your risk capital and your retirement capital separate. 01:34:42 [Speaker Changed] What do you know about the world today that would’ve been useful to know 25 years or so ago when you graduated? 01:34:50 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I’ll throw out a few. So the first would be from an investing perspective, you don’t need to compete in the public markets. Like you can learn a ton through being around startups or even very unsexy private sector stuff. And you can get very, very wealthy doing that. So you, you don’t have to compete against the citadels in the world. Like, I don’t wanna do that, or the rentech or whatever. Like, I like that’s bringing a knife to a gunfight. I don’t wanna deal with that. So I would say also 01:35:20 [Speaker Changed] Look for white space that you are, you can create your own area where you’re a pioneer. Not going into well trot space. Yeah, 01:35:30 [Speaker Changed] I would also say invest in what you know, and that sounds so trite, but the first, the first stock I ever bought was when I was in my teens and it was, I think it was in my teens, might have been a little bit later, but it was Pixar because I knew the world of animation. I was like, oh, this is so fundamentally different. Like this is gonna change everything. That’s it. That’s all I knew that. And so I, I would say that sort of investing from the perspective of watching main behavior on Main Street more than Wall Street is actually can be a really viable approach. And then in the world at large, I would say for me personally, 30 years ago, I would’ve said like your current experience of mental health and the buggy code that you inherited from your parents, God bless them. But like, you know, there are some bugs in the code is not a sort of psychological death sentence. Like you can actually change those things because you can, you really can impact those things and, 01:36:34 [Speaker Changed] And you’re living proof. 01:36:36 [Speaker Changed] I am living proof. And I would say that, you know, science, science is such an amazing tool, like the framework of science so necessary for not fooling ourselves. And within the world of medicine, especially psych, I don’t wanna throw psychiatry under the bus, but within the realm of medicine, I mean, anyone who’s worth their salt will say something along the lines of like, 50% of what we know is wrong. We just don’t know which 50%. And when I was growing up, I mean there were so many definitive statements about like, alright, you’re born with this number of neurons and when they die, they die. And that’s it. You can never regenerate these types of things. Totally false. And I feel like many of our assumptions about psychiatry, psychology, emotional health will be overturned in the next five years. It’s gonna happen fast. 01:37:27 [Speaker Changed] Thank you Tim, for being so generous with your time. We have been speaking with Tim Ferris, author, podcaster, angel investor.

Title: BlackRock Addresses Burning XRP ETF Question: Is A Filing Coming Or Not?
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/blackrock-on-xrp-etf-question/
Time Published: 2025-08-11T12:00:21Z
Full Content:
Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. The world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, has broken its silence on whether it intends to file for an XRP ETF. This follows months of speculation that the firm could soon file to offer this fund. A BlackRock spokesperson told The Block that they have no plans to file for an XRP ETF at this time. This ends speculations that it will join eight other asset managers who have already filed to offer this fund. The world’s largest asset manager already offers Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, and based on the statement, the firm plans to stick with only the two largest crypto assets. NovaDius Wealth President Nate Geraci was one of those who had speculated that BlackRock was going to file for an XRP ETF soon. Prior to the asset manager’s statement, Geraci opined that the firm was waiting for the Ripple SEC lawsuit to end before filing for an iShares XRP ETF. He made this prediction following Ripple and the SEC’s filing of a joint dismissal to end the XRP lawsuit. Geraci further remarked that it makes “zero” sense for BlackRock to ignore crypto assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. He added that if they do that, they are basically saying that BTC and ETH are the only crypto assets that will ever have value. Following BlackRock’s statement, the NovaDius Wealth president said that the firm’s decision not to file for an XRP ETF will be looked on as a mistake. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas also weighed in on BlackRock’s decision not to file for an XRP ETF. He asked Geraci if an XRP filing is enough or if he feels the world’s largest asset manager should also file for SOL, Tron ETFs. He further questioned where exactly the line should be drawn on how many crypto ETFs asset managers should offer. Nate Geraci believes that there will be significant demand for the XRP ETFs, which is one reason why he thinks BlackRock is making a mistake by not filing for one. He noted that futures-based XRP funds have taken in over $1 billion since their launch this year. He opined that this proves that there will be “real” demand for the spot funds. Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton is confident that BlackRock will still file for an XRP ETF. He said that he is willing to bet that this happens within a year.

Title: I'm Worried It Might Get Really Bad

Time Published: 2025-08-11T12:00:00Z

I'm starting to worry things might get very bad, very soon. Not like in a year or two, but maybe in a few months. As in spontaneous recession type of thing. In the US mostly, but perhaps globally. It sounds irrational to me as well as I think it or type it. But I can't shake the feeling, so I want to try to write it all down to see how rational it looks on paper. In no real order, here are the various things I'm stressing about. These are people who've been making over $100-200K in tech or tech-adjacent for over a decade. And they can't find work. I mean they can barely get interviews. And when I say a ton, I mean multiple dozen that I either know or I'm one degree separated from. And again, these are not low-skill people. They're legit professionals that have never in their life had trouble finding or maintaining work. Google has said this. Amazon. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff explicitly stated the company won't hire any new software engineers in 2025, citing AI-driven productivity gains. We don't even really have to believe them, because we're seeing tons of actual layoffs at the same time. Microsoft laid off 15,000+ employees in 2025, about 7% of its workforce, explicitly tied to AI investments Intel cut 15,000 jobs, Tesla laid off 14,000, and Cisco cut 10,000 in 2024 It actually goes much further back, and it's no-doubt multi-causal. We had the pandemic. We had over-hiring. We've heard all the arguments for what it could be. Tech layoffs by year: 549 companies laid off more than 150,000 employees in 2024, and we're already at 69,672 layoffs in 2025 as of July 31st. The tech unemployment rate sits at 3.4%, but that doesn't capture the full picture of experienced professionals unable to find work. Hundreds or thousands of companies, and billions of dollars, are being spent on replacing human workers. Some don't think this is possible, but they think we need to invent some super smart model that's better than anything we've ever seen. We don't need that. What we need is scaffolding and piping that connects the dots and brings the right context together in the right way to solve problem x or y. This is not as difficult as it seems, and I already have a ton of the precursors of this working, and I'm just one person. Now imagine billions of dollars and tens of thousands of people working on it. Salesforce says AI bots now do 50% of the company's work. They're pushing what they call a "digital workforce" where AI agents handle customer service, sales, and even coding tasks. Microsoft reports that 30% of software coding work is already done by AI. These aren't future promises - this is happening right now. And the prize they're chasing is worth the cost, because it means saving millions upon millions in hiring costs, payroll, health insurance, and all manner of employee-related complications in every business everywhere. Getting rid of human work forces is a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity for the companies that get part of that pie. And they're spending on the R&D accordingly. There's a frequent counter-argument to the AI taking human jobs that goes something like this: Yeah, AI might be able to do the job at a basic level, but humans are dynamic and creative! We can use our innovation and brilliance to do things way better than AI! This is, of course, true. For some workers. Some of the time. But—by definition—most workers are not exceptional. Most workers, and most work days, are just drudgery. Answering emails. Writing up quarterly plans. Reviewing metrics. Building applications that do something with data. A very large number of people dread Monday, and that's not because they show up Monday morning and bring all their creativity and brilliance. It's because it's clocking in and clocking out on a job they'd rather not be doing. These are prime targets for AI replacement. And they are not the fringe. This isn't the bottom 5% of the workforce. This is the bottom 60-80%! In other words, my read is that the replacement of jobs by AI isn't coming for the bottom few percent. It's coming for all but the top few percent. Not all at once, of course, that will take years, but I think it's already started. Then we have the macro situation. I make decent money and every single day I'm like: How the fuck did I pay $20 for a burger and a Diet Coke? And it's just everything. I use a few different services, eat out a couple of times, and I've spent $100 when that would have been like $40 or $50 dollars a few years ago. Putting me aside, I look around at everyone around me and I'm like, how in the hell is anyone affording this? And every indication points to prices going even higher as a result of the tariffs. Economists predict tariffs will raise consumer prices by 2.3% in the short-run, equivalent to an average $3,800 loss per household. Morgan Stanley expects inflation to hit 2.5% in 2025, up from their previous forecast. Goldman Sachs projects core inflation could reach 3%. I just don't know how much more we can take before something snaps. And this is what I'm actually concerned about. It's not one of these things. Or two of them. Or 10. It's the fact that they're happening at the same time. It's the fact that I think they can affect and magnify each other and become a thing. Like I said, I don't think any one of these would be that bad. The problem is several of them are either likely or are already in progress. And that doesn't even include all the compounding factors above. I just don't know what the country does if some significant percentage of our 100 million knowledge workers gets laid off because of AI, uncertainty about the future, or for whatever other combination of reasons. I think there are many things happening right now—or that could happen—that could severely impact a population just barely holding on. I'm worried we might see some kind of extraordinary spike in knowledge worker unemployment in the next 2-18 months, which triggers evictions, worker Visa cancellations, foreclosures, a general blaming/targeting of AI, which closes businesses, gets more people laid off, causes governments to overreact with legislation, all of which culminates in a general nationwide panic. Again, I'm not quite saying things are going to go bad. I'm saying that these things can combine and multiply each other if they happen at the same time, and create a feeling that's bigger than the reality. Which will then be reality. And I think that then leads to calls for: I'm not overly confident / worried that this will happen. Maybe like 60%. Using the CIA levels for predictions, I'd put this one at: Let's hope I'm wrong, and that the pressure gets released some other way.

Title: Impact Accounting Has an Equity Problem (Blog)

Is water in Sweden really 25 times more valuable than water in Mauritania? Is water in Sweden really 25 times more valuable than water in Mauritania? By Andrew A. King, Ken Pucker & Jesse Colman Aug. 11, 2025 Impact accounting is the heir apparent to ESG (environmental, social, governance) accounting and investing. Where ESG investing emphasizes risks to the firm, impact accounting measures how corporate actions help or harm people and the planet. Its advocates predict impact accounting will engender a more transparent, responsible, and sustainable capitalism. Sir Ronald Cohen (a financier and leading advocate of impact accounting) and Professor George Serafeim (head of Harvard’s Impact Weighted Accounts Initiative) claim it will “redefine success, so that its measure is not just money, but the positive impact we make during our lives.” Impact accounting has attracted influential advocates. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva describes it as “a blueprint for a hope-filled future,” while former SEC Commissioner Allison Herren Lee contends it could “ensure that those who want to make an impact will make an impact where it matters most.” Leading corporations have begun adopting impact accounting frameworks: BlackRock, Target, and Eisai have pilot-tested methodologies developed at Harvard University, while Kering—the parent company of Gucci—has created its own proprietary system for dollarizing environmental impact. But impact accounting has a dark side that makes its use dangerous. In a previous SSIR article, “Heroic Accounting,” we reviewed the potential for miscalculation and misuse of impact accounting measures. We also highlighted concerns about the feasibility and the perils of centralized, subjective pricing of externalities. There is another important problem we overlooked in that review: Impact accounting has an equity problem, because practical means for calculating impacts discriminate against poor people. This flaw is challenging to correct because it emanates from impact accounting’s core premise: that social and environmental effects can and should be priced and compared in global monetary terms. One recent example illustrates this defect in particularly stark terms. Are you enjoying this article? Read more like this, plus SSIR's full archive of content, when you subscribe. Evidence of the discriminatory tendencies inherent in impact accounting appears in a recent report by the International Foundation for Valuing Impacts (IFVI)—an organization co-founded by Sir Ronald Cohen and Tracy Palandjian (Co-founder and CEO of Social Finance). The report estimates the social cost of consuming fresh water—a resource of growing global concern—for each country. Strikingly, the IFVI assigns the lowest social cost to Mauritania, a desert nation identified by the World Resources Institute (WRI) as facing an “extremely high” risk of future water scarcity. According to the IFVI, consuming a cubic meter of groundwater in Mauritania causes only $0.13 in social harm. In contrast, Sweden—rated by the WRI as having a "low" water risk—is estimated to suffer $3.23 in social harm per cubic meter of groundwater consumed, nearly 25 times the estimate for Mauritania. These counterintuitive estimates are part of a general trend. The IFVI estimates a low cost of water consumption for other water-scarce nations, including Somalia ($0.27/m³) and South Sudan ($0.53/m³), but calculates a much higher social cost in some countries with abundant water resources. Even rain-soaked Ireland is assigned a higher social cost of water consumption ($0.74 /m3) than Mauritania, Somalia, or South Sudan. Why does the IFVI assess Mauritania, Somalia, and South Sudan as places where consuming fresh water causes minimal social harm? The answer appears to lie in their poverty. In these nations, water is primarily used to produce basic goods for local consumption, which are then sold at low prices. The IFVI’s methodology assumes that low prices reflect low social value, and consequently, it concludes that little harm is caused by sacrificing this production to divert water to other uses. By contrast, in wealthy countries like Sweden and Ireland, water is often used to produce higher-priced goods, including luxury items destined for global markets. The higher market prices of these goods are interpreted by the IFVI as indicators of higher social value, leading to greater estimated harm from water consumption. As shown in Figure 1, all countries assigned low social costs for water use by the IFVI are among the world’s poorest, while rich countries—even those with abundant water resources, such as Sweden, Ireland, and Canada—are assigned significantly higher costs. The IFVI's discriminatory estimates are not caused by a bug or error; they are an inevitable consequence of impact accounting's reason for being—the monetization of social impacts expressed in terms of a global unit of exchange. Monetization makes risky assumptions about the relationship between social value and its monetary expression—price. As scholars Garry Jacobs and Ivo Šlaus (2010) warned, "The temptation to measure all value in terms of price plays havoc with commonsense, reason, and human values." In the case of impact accounting, this temptation results in systematic bias against poor people. In Mauritania, consuming water displaces activities such as subsistence agriculture, which the IFVI methodology interprets as causing minimal social harm, even though these activities are essential for survival. Conversely, in Sweden, water extraction displaces high-priced uses like decorative landscaping and is thus mistakenly assigned higher social value despite its lower importance. As a result, impact accounting risks reinforcing global inequalities under the guise of objectivity. Sir Ronald Cohen argues “We have to be able to measure a company's performance in delivering impacts as well as profits.” But how should impact be measured? In financial accounting, price serves as a valid proxy: Managers aim to minimize the prices paid to suppliers and maximize the prices received from customers. Profit, then, reflects how effectively a firm achieves these goals. The same logic does not hold when measuring impact. Market prices do not reliably capture social and environmental outcomes and relying on price as a stand-in for value can lead to severe distortions. Consider a manager overseeing identical facilities in Sweden and Mauritania who must decide where to invest to reduce the social impact of lost work. The manager’s employees require proficiency in mathematics—and thus earn wages comparable to local math teachers: approximately $57,600 per year in Sweden and $5,000 in Mauritania. Following the IFVI’s approach, the social value of lost work is calculated as the product of wage and time, and by this logic, losing a Swedish worker imposes more than ten times the social harm of losing a Mauritanian one. Consequently, to reduce the firm’s measured impact the manager should invest much more money to reduce lost work in Sweden than in Mauritania. But this conclusion is irrational. Higher wages in Sweden reflect the country’s robust institutions and strong economy, not a greater intrinsic value of worker labor. In contrast, Mauritania’s low wages result in large part from weak governance and systemic corruption, which suppresses economic opportunity and distorts labor markets. A 2023 report estimates that at least 3 percent of Mauritanians are paid nothing at all: They are enslaved. By the IFVI’s method, their work provides no social value! The connection between good government and economic development is well established in the economics literature. “Inclusive political institutions that distribute power broadly in society and are accompanied by inclusive economic institutions create the incentives and opportunities that make a nation prosperous,” write Nobel Laureates Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson in their 2012 book, Why Nations Fail. “Institutions that lack inclusivity—where political and economic power are concentrated—tend to reproduce themselves, creating a vicious circle of deprivation and underdevelopment.” Accordingly, it is not a lack of social impact that causes a Mauritanian worker to receive a salary one-tenth the size of his Swedish counterpart; it is a consequence of his working in Mauritania. Proponents of impact accounting shrug their shoulders at such concerns and respond that any accounting of social costs, even if done inaccurately, is better than no accounting at all. For example, Sir Ronald Cohen writes, “Until now, the prevailing view has been that impact cannot be measured reliably enough to be truly useful, however, in John Maynard Keynes's words, ‘It is better to be roughly right than precisely wrong.’” Unfortunately, inaccurate information can be worse than no information at all. Impact information that directs harm to the poor and dispossessed will cause a decline in social welfare, not an increase, because income has a declining marginal influence on welfare. Depriving $1000 in income to a person in Mauritania, where the average income is $2200, may cause them to have trouble surviving. Deprive that same amount to a person in Sweden, where the average income is 22 times higher, and they may not even notice. If inaccurate information about impacts causes increased harm to poor people, social welfare will decrease. More information will not be better than no information at all. It might seem that the problem outlined above could be solved by adjusting observed prices or by using other methods to calculate impact. But such solutions are extraordinarily difficult to implement. For example, to compare the Mauritanian and Swedish teachers accurately, one would have to calculate the Mauritanian’s wage if the country were well governed and the economy booming. This requires constructing an economic model of the national economy and then simulating how it would function under better governance. Such calculations remain at the frontier of economic theory. Even the most advanced models reduce complex economies to simplified, stick-figure representations of activity. They also require extensive data and research to calibrate and are often opaque in their assumptions and outputs. Ongoing debates surrounding models of the social cost of carbon illustrate just how contested and fragile these estimates can be. Accurately determining the "true" price of every resource in every country is, in practice, impossible. What about simply weighting impacts in poor countries to match those in wealthy ones? In principle, this could work—but how should the weights be determined? One alternative is to use purchasing power parity (PPP)—a method of determining the buying power in local currencies for a basket of goods. It is thought to better capture cost-of-living differences than exchange rates. However, switching to PPP does not fully solve the problem. For example, it still leaves us with the conclusion that Swedish workers provide three times the social value of their Mauritanian counterparts, even if employed in the same job. The creators of the PPP system—the International Comparison Program—caution against using it to compare prices at the unit or industry level across countries because the appropriate valuation factor should vary by product and context. But calculating such variable factors would require building and validating comprehensive models of each national economy, and as with the previous approach, it would be prohibitively difficult to implement such a system. Limiting the scope of use for impact accounting seems to be the best option. For example, impact accounting might allow for comparisons of the impacts within the same governing institution, such as the effects of extracting water in different parts of the same U.S. state. Alternatively, impact accounting could concentrate on genuinely global effects—those that transcend national boundaries—such as the environmental impact of corporate greenhouse gas emissions or global carbon sinks, such as forests and oceanic phytoplankton. We hope our arguments will lead to significant changes in how impact is measured, but that is beyond our control. We expect the proponents of impact accounting to continue to promote it as the heir apparent to ESG. If they are successful, managers and investors may soon confront impact accounting measures. Some guidance in their use is in order: 1. Beware of claims to accuracy. Impact accounting measures present as precise and interpretable dollar values, but this is an illusion. They rest on layers and layers of approximations and assumptions. Understanding those layers is crucial. 2. Avoid cross-country comparisons. Using impact accounts to compare firms across borders—especially between rich and poor nations—risks serious misrepresentation. Impact measures are likely to discount harm to poor people. 3. Check against common sense. If impact accounting tells you water consumption is less harmful where water is scarce, ask why. Check against first principles. Scarcity should increase value, not reduce it. 4. Recognize that impact accounting may be just the latest idea for an easy fix to social and environmental problems. Over the past 40 years, many solutions have been proposed for leveraging the power of business to advance sustainability. All have come and gone, all but one: strengthened institutions. 5. Strengthen institutions. As Acemoglu and Johnston have shown, social outcomes are better where institutions are stronger. We don’t need Nobel Laureates to tell us, we know that from experience. Controlling institutions have made our air and water cleaner, our cars safer, our resources better protected, and our living standard higher. Such institutions are constantly under attack, yet they remain the best way to improve our planet. Impact accounting will likely come and go, but the effect of our institutions will remain. So, strengthen them, be it a social club, local government, national system, or international organization. Doing that will have a real impact.

Title: 5 Job Titles That Will Disappear By 2030
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelwells/2025/08/11/5-job-titles-that-will-disappear-by-2030/

ByRachel Wells ByRachel Wells, Contributor. By 2030, an alarming 50% of entry-level jobs could be eliminated due to AI gains, Anthropic CEO warned in May this year. And in my exclusive interview a couple weeks ago with Oliver Yonchev, investor and co-founder of Flight Agencies (alongside Steven Bartlett), he revealed: “The entry-level layer of jobs is going to disappear." What’s taking their place? The clock is ticking. Back in 2023, Goldman Sachs predicted that nearly one-fifth of all work tasks globally would be taken over by AI, with two-thirds of U.S. jobs exposed in some way or another to partial automation. Today, that figure shows no signs of decline. We now have: So the critical question is, Is your job at risk from AI? Artificial intelligence developments are accelerating at such a rapid rate that it’s hard to tell precisely what roles will be negatively impacted in the future. However, we can use estimates and reports from McKinsey & Company, the World Economic Forum, and Coursera to guide us and to make it easier to predict what job titles are most likely to disappear in the next few years. To know if your role is in danger of elimination, ask yourself the below questions and run this test: If your answer is yes to questions one, three, and four, and especially six, your role is likely at high risk of being taken over by AI at some point now or in the near future. If you answer yes to one or more of the other questions, you’re in a good position--even if your organization is preparing to implement and roll out AI, because your strategic role could be an integral factor in getting them to that position. The online learning giant Coursera released a list of five core job categories that are exposed to AI. These are: Many of these, especially in manufacturing, retail, and admin, shouldn’t really come as a surprise, because we started seeing innovation and automation in these fields for quite a number of years now (i.e., robots in production lines, self-service checkouts, chatbots used for customer service, etc.). Still, the effects can be painful, especially if you’ve worked most of your working life in these very fields. So what should you do if you discover that your job is not AI-proof? 1. First, identify roles within your industry that leverage your existing knowledge and experience, but allow you to pivot to AI-enabled functions. For example, if you work in sales, focus on relationship-building at a strategic level, for example, B2B sales and nurturing large customer accounts as a customer success manager, or account executive for a SaaS company, while using AI tools to support each part of the sales cycle. This utilizes human-centric and decision-making skills. (At this point, no one trusts AI to fully conduct the entire sales process, especially when companies are making major enterprise purchases as part of their agreed budgets, so you’re pretty safe here.) 2. Re-invent yourself for low-risk roles. The top low-risk roles include: 3. Focus on upskilling with the necessary AI skills. Learn about the most in-demand, high-paying AI skills here in my recent article, 17 AI Skills To Put On Your Resume In 2025. 4. Re-brand your career assets, especially your resume and LinkedIn profile, to highlight your AI skills, any AI certificates or courses completed, and adaptability. Don’t wait for the very role you’re in to crumble before you decide to make a move. Be proactive, identify your vulnerabilities and skills gap, and spend time each week spotting trends in your field, upskilling, and taking small steps to pivot so you’re ready for the change.

Shares of Bitcoin treasury company Strategy (MSTR) are up by more than 3% in premarket trading, while crypto brokerage Coinbase (COIN) and mining firms Mara Holdings (MARA) and Riot Platforms (RIOT) are also higher. Shares of Albemarle (ALB), the world’s largest lithium producer, are jumping more than 10% in premarket trading as Chinese battery giant Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. (CATL) suspends production at a major lithium mine. Bloomberg News reported that the stoppage could last three months and is due to a permitting issue. Lithium is used to make electric vehicle batteries, among other industrial uses. Chile-based Sociedad Quimica y Minera, or SQM (SQM), is seeing its shares rise by more than 8%. The mining delays come after another Chinese lithium miner suspended production in July.

Business Crypto exchange Bullish is targeting a valuation of up to $4.82 billion after upsizing its initial public offering on Monday, underscoring sustained investor interest in digital assets. Venture capitalist Peter Thiel-backed Bullish's raise, still well below its $9-billion valuation target in a failed 2021 blank-check merger, showcases the expanding role that crypto companies are playing in the momentum built by the IPO markets. "In many cases the initial price range is set well below a company's last private valuation or below what the company had originally hoped for," said Kat Liu, vice president at IPO research firm IPOX. The crypto sector's recent climb to a $4-trillion market value has boosted public market sentiment.

IRELAND HEAD COACH Scott Bemand has named a 32-player squad for the 2025 Women’s Rugby World Cup in England. Munster hooker Beth Buttimer is the one uncapped player included, having impressed in the recent U20 Summer Series. Ex-England players Ellena Perry and Nancy McGillivray, and Connacht’s Ivana Kiripati, who were all capped in the warm-up games, also make the final squad. IrishRugby TV / YouTube Christy Haney misses out with a hamstring injury, while Dorothy Wall and Erin King had previously been ruled out with long-term setbacks. Aoife Wafer is named as Ireland continue to sweat on the fitness of the 2025 Six Nations player of the championship. Co-captain Edel McMahon also makes the plane having emerged as an injury concern last week. Advertisement In all, the squad is comprised of 18 forwards and 14 backs and is captained by McMahon and Sam Monaghan. Alex Codling, Denis Fogarty, Larissa Muldoon, James Scaysbrook and Gareth Steenson make up Bemand’s coaching team. Uncapped U20 hooker Beth Buttimer. Ben Brady / INPHO Ben Brady / INPHO / INPHO “When we qualified for the Rugby World Cup in April 2024, we knew it gave us a solid amount of time to prepare for the tournament,” said Bemand. “We have used that time to build depth and cultivate our ‘Green Wave’. The majority of this squad have now been together since the start of June, and we are excited to finally get going.” Ireland face Japan in their opener on Sunday, 24 August at Franklin’s Gardens, Northampton. They also meet Spain and New Zealand in Pool A as they return to the showpiece tournament for the first time since hosting in 2017. “Missing out on the last World Cup lit a fire in all of us,” McMahon added. “Getting Ireland back on the world stage means absolutely everything, it’s something we have dreamed of and fought for ever since. We’re ready, and we are going to give it everything for our country. “The ‘Green Wave’ is more than just a slogan for us — it’s the spirit we carry onto the field. Over the coming weeks, we want to make our families proud and inspire the nation. This is a moment we’ve worked tirelessly for, and we’ll leave nothing behind.” Edel McMahon and Scott Bemand.

Title: Is the A.I. Boom Turning Into an A.I. Bubble?
URL: https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-financial-page/is-the-ai-boom-turning-into-an-ai-bubble
Time Published: 2025-08-11T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
When Jensen Huang, the chief executive of the chipmaker Nvidia, met with Donald Trump in the White House last week, he had reason to be cheerful. Most of Nvidia’s chips, which are widely used to train generative artificial-intelligence models, are manufactured in Asia. Earlier this year, it pledged to increase production in the United States, and on Wednesday Trump announced that chip companies that promise to build products in the United States would be exempt from some hefty new tariffs on semiconductors that his Administration is preparing to impose. The next day, Nvidia’s stock hit a new all-time high, and its market capitalization reached $4.4 trillion, making it the world’s most valuable company, ahead of Microsoft, which is also heavily involved in A.I. Welcome to the A.I. boom, or should I say the A.I. bubble? It has been more than a quarter of a century since the bursting of the great dot-com bubble, during which hundreds of unprofitable internet startups issued stock on the Nasdaq, and the share prices of many tech companies rose into the stratosphere. In March and April of 2000, tech stocks plummeted; subsequently many, but by no means all, of the internet startups went out of business. There has been some discussion on Wall Street in the past few months about whether the current surge in tech is following a similar trajectory. In a research paper entitled “25 Years On; Lessons from the Bursting of the Technology Bubble,” which was published in March, a team of investment analysts from Goldman Sachs argued that it wasn’t: “While enthusiasm for technology stocks has risen sharply in recent years, this has not represented a bubble because the price appreciation has been justified by strong profit fundamentals.” The analysts pointed to the earnings power of the so-called Magnificent Seven companies: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. Between the first quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of this year, Nvidia’s revenues quintupled, and its after-tax profits rose more than tenfold. The Goldman paper also provided a salutary history lesson. Between 1995 and 2000, it pointed out, the tech-heavy Nasdaq index rose fivefold, and at the peak of the market a widely used valuation measure for the stocks that trade on it—the price-to-earnings ratio, or “P/E”—topped a hundred and fifty, a level not seen before or since then. By comparison, the five-year period from March, 2020, to March, 2025, had been relatively tame. It’s true, the Nasdaq had roughly doubled, and the P/E ratio had gone up considerably; but it hadn’t got anywhere near three figures. Having written extensively on the dot-com boom and bust, I found some of Goldman’s analysis persuasive. Many people have either forgotten, or are too young to remember, the extremes reached during the dot-com years. In the logic of speculative hysterias—from the seventeenth-century “tulipmania” in Holland to the rise of Pets.com—greed, FOMO, and the greater-fool theory of investing eventually combine to banish caution, common sense, and financial gravity. Back in March, there was plenty of FOMO and trend-following on Wall Street, but it hadn’t reached the levels of the late nineties. Five months on, however, echoes of the dot-com era are getting louder. Consider Palantir Technologies, whose A.I. software is used by the Pentagon, the C.I.A., and ICE, not to mention by many commercial companies. A couple of days before Huang visited the White House, Palantir released a positive earnings report. By the end of the week, according to the Yahoo Finance database, the market was valuing the company at more than six hundred times its earnings from the past twelve months, and at about a hundred and thirty times its sales in that same time span. Even during the late nineties, figures like these would have raised eyebrows. Eye-popping I.P.O.s, another feature of the dot-com era, are also making a comeback. At the end of July, Figma, a firm that makes software used by internet developers, and which has added A.I. features to its suite of products, issued stock on the New York Stock Exchange at thirty-three dollars a share. When trading started, the price jumped to eighty-five. It closed the day at $115.50—a two-hundred-and-fifty-per-cent gain on the offering price. Watching this market action, I was reminded of August 9, 1995, when Netscape, which made the Netscape Navigator web browser, went public. Its stock was priced at twenty-eight dollars, rose to seventy-five, and closed at $58.25. In percentage terms, this leap was smaller than the first-day rise in Figma’s stock, but it’s often described as the beginning of the dot-com bubble. It should be noted that, since Figma’s I.P.O., its stock has fallen back to below eighty dollars. This could be interpreted as a sign of sanity prevailing, but, given that the shares are still trading at more than double the offering price, other privately owned A.I. companies will be encouraged to enter the stock market. Renaissance Capital, a research firm that specializes in I.P.O.s, lists eight prominent candidates: OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, Databricks, SymphonyAI, Waymo, Scale AI, and Perplexity. Almost all of these companies are unicorns: they have been valued at more than a billion dollars in fund-raising deals with venture capitalists and other early investors. But, across the country, according to the research firm Tracxn, there are about seven thousand smaller and lesser-known A.I. companies, more than a thousand of which have already received Series A funding from external backers to finance their operations. The ready availability of early-stage funding means that a necessary condition for a dot-com-style bubble is in place. So are three more: excitement among investors about a pathbreaking technology—generative A.I. clearly has the potential to impact great swaths of the economy; a Wall Street production line staffed by investment bankers eager to earn fees for organizing I.P.O.s; and accommodative policy. Last month, the Trump Administration announced an “AI Action Plan,” which aims to remove barriers to the deployment of the new technology and to deter individual states from introducing “burdensome” regulatory A.I. laws. The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, appears to be preparing to cut interest rates next month, which could give another boost to the markets. There are, however, some important differences between now and the nineties, one of which is that the online economy is no longer a vast open plain on which enterprising individuals can propose to build castles to the sky. It is a redoubt of monopoly capitalism, in which Big Tech dominates the horizon. During the dot-com era, or its early stages, anyway, small startups could reasonably hope to exploit first-mover advantage, gain early traction, and create durable business franchises. In the A.I. economy, it seems possible that many of the rewards will go to top firms that can afford to build and maintain large A.I. models and can use their market power and financial might to ward off, or buy out, potential competitors. A vigorous antitrust policy could perhaps prevent this from happening, but, as the Wall Street Journal reported last week, the Administration’s pledge to pursue such a policy is now under threat from lobbyists and power brokers with close ties to the President. If investors decide that monopolies are the future of the A.I.-driven economy, the outcome in the stock market could well mean further gains for existing industry giants rather than a broad-based bubble. All of this is uncertain, of course. The A.I. boom is still in the stage of building out infrastructure—training large language models, building data centers, and so on. A.I. applications are just beginning to diffuse throughout the economy, and nobody knows for sure just how transformative, and profitable, the technology will be. In this environment, many investors are following the time-honored gold-rush strategy of buying the shovel-makers and big mine owners. But history teaches us that even this strategy is far from risk-free. In an interesting analysis that was posted on the financial-news platform Seeking Alpha, an analyst identified as KCI Research compared Nvidia to Cisco Systems, one of the firms whose stock went parabolic in 1998-99. Just as Nvidia’s G.P.U.s (graphics-processing units) are now widely regarded as must-have components of A.I. infrastructure, Cisco’s routers and other network equipment were viewed as essential components of the internet build-out; for a time, demand for them seemed virtually unlimited. Like Nvidia, Cisco was an innovative and highly profitable company. But, in April of 2000, its stock dropped by almost forty per cent, and a year later it had fallen by about eighty per cent. A quarter of a century on, it still hasn’t recovered the high it hit in early 2000, although, lately, it has come close. The Nvidia-Cisco comparison was a useful reminder of a dictum from the pioneering stock analyst Benjamin Graham, who was a mentor to Warren Buffett: in the short run, the stock market is a voting machine, but in the long run it is a weighing machine that weighs the cash flows that companies generate. Ironically, the Nvidia-Cisco analogy also inadvertently demonstrated how long the short run can last for, and how dangerous it can be to predict its end date. The analysis was posted in February of last year. Since then, Nvidia’s stock price has risen by another hundred and fifty per cent. ♦

Title: Three Numbers That Prove Arista Is An Elite Tech Stock In Disguise
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/08/11/three-numbers-that-prove-arista-is-an-elite-tech-stock-in-disguise/

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Arista Networks Inc. (NYSE: ANET) does not manufacture GPUs. It does not develop AI models. Additionally, it seldom attracts attention like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) or Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). Nonetheless, Arista has quietly emerged as one of the most impactful technology firms in the market. Strong Q2 results and elevated guidance propelled the stock to all-time highs, climbing 20% in the last five days compared to a 1.7% increase for the S&P 500. Three significant figures illustrate why Arista ranks among the most profitable and resilient players in the industry. Seeking upside with less volatility than individual stocks? The Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative, having surpassed the S&P 500 and achieved returns exceeding 91% since its launch. Separately, check out What’s Happening With Joby Stock? Arista achieved a 40.3% net margin in Q2—higher than Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG), or Microsoft. It also sells hardware. The catalyst is Arista’s cloud-native EOS (Extensible Operating System), which transforms conventional networking hardware into a software-defined platform. This leads to high margins and stable, recurring demand from hyperscalers such as Meta and Microsoft (accounting for over 40% of revenue). Over half of Arista’s revenue is converted into cash. Its 54% operating cash flow margin ranks among the top 5% of S&P 500 firms—including most SaaS companies. This cash supports innovation, growth, and a balance sheet that is already among the strongest in the tech industry. Having $8.1 billion in cash (56% of assets) and no debt allows Arista to invest during downturns, protect its market standing, and expand globally without needing external financing. This strength has been tested: Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks performed during and after the last six market crashes. Arista is valued at 23.5x sales, 50.7x earnings, and 46.2x free cash flow—significantly higher than the S&P 500 averages. On paper, it appears more like a SaaS company than a conventional networking entity. The distinction lies in execution. With established demand from major cloud providers, software-like margins, and an expanding role in AI data centers, Arista is enhancing its position in a rapidly growing market. Arista is not widely acknowledged outside of technology circles, but its profitability, strong balance sheet, and role in AI infrastructure render it a pivotal player in the sector. The stock is not inexpensive, and hazards persist, yet its performance has consistently justified its valuation. For investors seeking opportunities beyond chips and AI models, Arista provides access to the infrastructure that supports AI’s expansion—and the market is beginning to recognize this. That being said, investing in a single stock carries risks. You might consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stock benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to yield strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks offered a responsive approach to maximizing profitable market conditions while mitigating losses when markets decline, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Ireland name one uncapped player in World Cup squad

Only time will tell if Aoife Wafer’s selection by Irish women’s rugby coach Scott Bemand was a calculated risk or not. Perhaps Ireland’s most influential player, Wafer has been included among the 18 forwards and 14 backs selected ahead of the 2025 Rugby World Cup in England, which begins for Ireland in Franklin’s Garden in a few weeks. The 22-year-old, who underwent knee surgery in July after sustaining the injury against Wales, has been central to the Irish team and hopes to be fit for the World Cup Pool C opener against Japan on August 24th. An outstanding backrow, Wafer was named 2025 Six Nations Player of the Championship, but missed Ireland’s two recent warm-up games against Scotland and Canada. Clearly the Irish medics believe she can play a role at some point in the tournament. After Japan, Ireland play against Spain on August 31st and title holders New Zealand on September 7th in the remaining pool games. Japan are ranked 11th and Spain 13th to Ireland’s fifth on the world table. Defending champions New Zealand are ranked third in the world behind first placed England and Canada, who beat Ireland 26-47 last weekend in Belfast. Wafer’s power game has been a critical aspect of Ireland’s play as highlighted in scoring four tries in the Six Nations. But she missed the last game of the championship against Scotland and has been unavailable since then. Edel McMahon, who co-captain’s the squad with secondrow Sam Monaghan, is also among the 32 names. The backrow also injured her knee and did not feature against Scotland or Canada. [ Scott Bemand happy with how Ireland are shaping up for Rugby World Cup despite Canada defeatOpens in new window ] Backrows Dorothy Wall (Achilles) and the dynamic Erin King (knee) also miss out on selection due to injury as does Christy Haney. Prop Haney suffered a hamstring injury, and her place is taken by Ellena Perry, who made her debut in Saturday’s defeat to Canada. Perry won 11 caps with England but hadn’t lined out for them since 2020 and satisfies World Rugby’s stand down rules for switching nations. She is Irish-qualified via a grandparent and plays with Neve Jones and Monoghan at Gloucester. Exeter centre Nancy McGillivray, is another of the selected players, who was named in England squads in the past but was never capped, debuted after qualifying through her Irish-born father. She became available to make the switch after her England contract expired in June. Ireland will undoubtedly miss the injured players. King started at openside flanker in Ireland’s opening three Six Nations matches. Wall had involvement in all five games, playing in the secondrow and backrow, while Haney came off the bench in all the matches. Bemand has also picked one uncapped player, hooker Beth Buttimer as well as two players with one cap, Perry and McGillivray and one player with two caps, forward Ivana Kiripati. [ Ivana Kiripati: ‘I am a Samoan girl, born in New Zealand, doing life in Ireland – how cool is that?’Opens in new window ] The overall look of the side tends towards inexperience when compared to the England squad, who have a couple of players with over 100 caps and several more approaching that number. No Irish player selected has yet reached 50 caps with just five players with 30 or more. But Ireland travel with hope and some momentum, having come from behind to beat Scotland and then finished strongly in the second half of their match against Canada after trailing 33-7 at the interval. “When we qualified for the Rugby World Cup in April 2024, we knew it gave us a solid amount of time to prepare for the tournament,” said Bemand. “We have used that time to build depth and cultivate our ‘Green Wave’. The majority of this squad have now been together since the start of June, and we are excited to finally get going.” Co-captain Monaghan added that having missed out on qualification for the last World Cup in New Zealand, the energy and hope within the group remains high. “The ‘Green Wave’ is more than just a slogan for us – it’s the spirit we carry on to the field,” she said. “Over the coming weeks, we want to make our families proud and inspire the nation. This is a moment we’ve worked tirelessly for, and we’ll leave nothing behind. “Missing out on the last World Cup lit a fire in all of us. Getting Ireland back on the world stage means absolutely everything, it’s something we have dreamed of and fought forever since. We’re ready, and we are going to give it everything for our country.” In an expanded 16 team competition, countries are divided into four pools of four teams (pools A to D). Teams in each pool will play one another in a round-robin format, with the top two teams advancing to the knockout stage. Ireland are eyeing a knockout position in Pool C, which means winning the pool or finishing second. The favourites to top the pool are New Zealand.

Michael Glennon RTÉ Sport Journalist Aoife Wafer and co-captain Edel McMahon have been named in the Ireland squad for the Rugby World Cup, however, Christy Haney misses out through injury. Six Nations player of the tournament Wafer underwent knee surgery last month but the back row has been included in the 32-player squad for Pool C games against Japan, Spain and New Zealand in England, starting on 24 August. Flanker McMahon missed both of Ireland's warm-up games with a knee injury but is also included. Prop Haney suffered a hamstring injury and her place is taken by Ellena Perry, who made her debut in Saturday’s defeat to Canada in Belfast. Perry won 11 caps with England but hadn’t lined out for the Red Roses since 2020 and is Irish-qualified via a grandparent. Similarly, centre Nancy McGillivray, whose father is Irish, makes the cut having switched from the England set-up recently. The Exeter player (below) scored on her international debut against Scotland nine days ago. Flanker Ivana Kiripati, who won caps against Scotland and Canada, also makes the cut but there is no place for Deirbhile Nic a Bháird. There is one uncapped player in the squad, with Munster hooker Beth Buttimer, who impressed in the recent U20 Summer Series, getting the call-up. Forwards Erin King and Dorothy Wall had already been ruled out due to injuries picked up in the Six Nations. Head coach Scott Bemand said: "When we qualified for the Rugby World Cup in April 2024, we knew it gave us a solid amount of time to prepare for the tournament. "We have used that time to build depth and cultivate our 'Green Wave’. "The majority of this squad have now been together since the start of June, and we are excited to finally get going." The panel is made up of 18 forwards and 14 backs. McMahon, who shares the captaincy duties with Sam Monaghan, added: "Missing out on the last World Cup lit a fire in all of us. "Getting Ireland back on the world stage means absolutely everything, it’s something we have dreamed of and fought for ever since. "We’re ready, and we are going to give it everything for our country."

Title: Artificial workforce: Microsoft’s layoffs are a canary in the coal mine for white-collar jobs

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. In July, Microsoft announced it was laying off 9,000 employees, bringing the total job cuts this year to over 15,000. This isn’t a company in trouble. Quite the opposite: Microsoft just reported a quarterly net income of $27.2 billion, and its stock price has soared past $500 per share. So, why is it laying off thousands? The answer is chilling and profoundly important: Microsoft’s layoffs are not a sign of distress—they are a strategic reallocation of resources in response to a fundamental shift in how work gets done in the artificial intelligence (AI) era. These cuts are the canary in the coal mine—an early but unmistakable signal that the world of work, especially knowledge work, is about to be dramatically reshaped by AI. The implications are as important for tech leaders as they are for educators, entrepreneurs and policymakers. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella described the layoffs as a difficult but necessary part of aligning the company’s workforce with its strategic priorities. Those priorities are now unmistakably centred on AI. Also Read: Layoff riddle: Why are companies getting worse at letting employees go? So far, Microsoft has invested over $80 billion in building its AI infrastructure. Tools like GitHub Copilot are now writing as much as 30% of its code. In other words, AI is already replacing work previously done by humans—starting with highly-skilled engineers. The jobs cuts, however, swept through gaming studios, legal teams, sales departments and even marketing. Several promising creative projects, such as the long-anticipated reboot of Perfect Dark, were quietly cancelled. Some affected studios were unionized, a sign that even organized workforces are not immune. This is not a temporary cost-cutting exercise. It is a strategic reshaping of the workforce. The new mantra inside Microsoft—“Intensity, clarity, and bold execution"—isn’t just motivational. It reflects a shift toward a leaner, faster and increasingly automated workforce. Microsoft’s central position in enterprise software and cloud infrastructure gives it an unmatched view of business sentiment and technology trends. When Microsoft cuts jobs, it often foreshadows broader shifts in the economy. In this case, the warning is stark: AI is not just a tool to augment jobs—it is replacing them outright. Also Read: AI didn’t take the job. It changed what the job is. Amazon, Google, Meta, Salesforce and many others have also made deep cuts, some citing AI directly. Even traditionally ‘safe’ white-collar roles are increasingly vulnerable. A recent report from Microsoft Research listed programmers, mathematicians, customer service agents, translators, researchers, writers, legal assistants and salespeople among the first in line for disruption. This challenges a popular myth—that only routine or low-end jobs are at risk. AI excels at generating code, writing and summarizing documents, and analysing large data-sets. And it is improving rapidly. Many tech CEOs like to downplay the coming tsunami with soothing ideas such as “AI won’t replace you—a person using AI will" and “every technology destroys some jobs but creates many others and AI is no different." These are simplistic and self-serving. Be very clear: in the medium and short terms, which are what matter for most of us, AI will likely have a devastating impact on a lot of white-collar jobs and wages. For countries like India, this poses both risks and transformative opportunities. On one hand, millions of our white-collar jobs in information technology (IT) services, business process outsourcing (BPO) and content creation are at risk. These sectors have been engines of upward mobility and economic growth. If we are not proactive, AI could erode much of this progress. On the other hand, AI has the potential to unlock new solutions in education, healthcare, agriculture and public services. It can dramatically increase productivity, personalize services and bridge gaps in human capacity. But only if we invest in the right infrastructure, skills and safety nets.

Re-imagine education and skilling: We must move beyond traditional degree-based learning and embrace lifelong, flexible and tech-enabled skill development. Foundational digital literacy, data fluency and adaptability must be priorities. Support mass entrepreneurship: If formal employment is shrinking due to automation, we must create the conditions for millions to become self-employed or run micro-enterprises. In the 21st century, entrepreneurship is not a career choice—it is a life skill. Governments and the private sector should invest in promoting entrepreneurship, small businesses and strengthening local entrepreneurship ecosystems. Build an inclusive AI strategy: AI should not be designed only for the rich. India must lead the world in AI applications that serve small farmers, frontline health workers, teachers, small business owners and informal workers, ensuring that the revolution lifts the many, not just the few. Foster humane corporate cultures: The way layoffs are being handled—often without notice or severance—risks breaking trust in organizations. Companies must find a more responsible and compassionate approach to workforce transition. Culture, after all, is a competitive advantage. Create public policy for resilience: Governments must track labour market shifts in real time and build social safety nets that are fit for the AI era, whether that means unemployment insurance, portable benefits or incentives for reskilling. Also Read: Siddharth Pai: Don’t be naive, Agentic AI won’t eliminate agency costs When coal miners took canaries into their mines, it wasn’t because they didn’t expect danger. It was to act quickly when signs appeared. Microsoft’s layoffs are that sign. They tell us that AI is not something for the distant future. It’s already here, and is changing how work takes place, who gets employed and what skills matter. We simply cannot afford to sleepwalk into this future. We must act now—with clarity, courage and care. This is not just a tech issue. It is a social, economic and moral challenge that will define our generation. Let’s not waste the warning. Let’s build a future where AI empowers and uplifts, rather than excludes and displaces.

Title: Solana Price Prediction: SOL Timeline to $500 Outlined by Experts, But This Play Could Yield Superior Returns In The Interim

Solana price looks primed for a surge in the next few weeks as recent price patterns show it responding to new demand pressure. However, another project is unfolding into the spotlight with the potential to steal the shine from the Solana price prediction. Solana’s standout performance this year has attracted hundreds of whales, driving price growth that could see it at 2x this year. Whereas, while Solana price prediction suggests an incoming 2x before year-end, this other altcoin is projected for 30x in the same time frame. Here is the whole gist on why this could happen even before November. The price action indicates that the SOL price is rapidly recovering from its earlier correction a few months ago and is now poised for a significant breakout. According to the analysis, the Solana price prediction is set at around $500 this year as renewed ETF sentiment fuels institutional demand. The trending Solana price prediction sees the ongoing ETF calls as a catalyst that could see the coin double in price before the year’s end. There is an aggressive accumulation currently ongoing in the Solana ecosystem as new fundamental factors add to its visibility. New utilities such as the Solana PayPal stablecoin integration are boosting demand today. In addition, top brands like Blackrock and Fidelity keeping Solana in their reserve have further renewed hope of Solana’s continuous growth. Solana price prediction speculates a $500 growth this year as it continues to hold a position above the 200EMA. This reflects a long-term bullish momentum that could drive the SOL price to a new high by September as it reclaims old resistance. The price has maintained a position above the $165 resistance in the past few weeks, even in the face of a market drawdown. A breakout of the SOL price beyond $200 this week might see it returning to $294 as new support. Furthermore, the Solana price prediction could be achieved this year if it can hit $350b by early September. This move could fuel a new FOMO rally that can help the Solana price hit $500 as early as November. While Solana price action shows strong bullish potential, analysts say Remittix could hit 30x easily this year. This is because Remittix’s crypto-to-fiat and low-cap potential show promise to drive a strong bull run before December. The last few weeks have seen Remittix become the favourite new entry, raising $18.7 million in a short period. Analysts are saying this fast climb is showing strong market confidence in Remittix utility and could be prime for 30x before December. Remittix growth factors this year include: These catalysts have been fueling a high demand lately as anticipation grows for the Remittix breakout.

Title: The end of the mega-employer
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/americas-biggest-employers-facing-great-shrinking-corporations-ai-2025-8
Time Published: 2025-08-11T08:09:01Z

In June, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy had a blunt message for his 350,000 corporate employees: There were going to be fewer of them in the near future, thanks to the "efficiency gains" he expected from AI. The proclamation generated big headlines and an uproar from staff. But it struck me as merely honest. He was acknowledging something that pretty much every CEO who sits atop a large white-collar workforce is quietly hoping to achieve sooner or later. After all, Jassy hasn't been the only executive to hint at a future of lower headcount. The head of JPMorgan's consumer and community business predicted in May that AI will reduce the number of employees in its operations division by 10%. That same month, the CEO of Klarna said that the company's investments in AI has already driven the company's headcount to shrink by 40%. And the CEO of Ford — a company that employs tens of thousands of white-collar professionals — declared that AI will wipe out "literally half" of all white-collar jobs. Meanwhile, Kian Katanforoosh, the CEO and founder of the software startup Workera, tells me that he never wants to have much more than the 80 or so employees he has today, no matter how successful his business ends up becoming. "I truly believe we can go super super far without growing more," he says. "I'm an engineer. I don't want to have to manage so many people if I don't need to." It's not like CEOs ever enjoyed shelling out for the salaries or navigating the personnel headaches that come with the sprawling bureaucracies they employ. But for more than a century, armies of office workers were a necessary cost of doing business. To grow from tiny upstarts into titans of industry, companies needed an ever-multiplying number of HR reps, accountants, marketers, engineers, analysts, and project managers. In recent months, that 100-year-trend is starting to come undone. Everywhere you look, AI appears to be helping leaner teams take on work that used to require more people. And executives are talking about their large workforces — once their greatest competitive advantage — as if they're an unfortunate holdover from a bygone, bloated era. If today's corporate giants shrink their ranks, and if tomorrow's giants never need to bulk up in the first place, we may well be witnessing the end of a defining feature of corporate America: the mega-employer. That could give rise to a whole new generation of nimble companies that innovate faster — but also leave workers navigating a world of diminished career paths and fewer jobs. Before the Industrial Revolution, most Americans worked for themselves as farmers or craftsmen. And those who didn't worked for very small operations — say, a few journeymen training under a master shoemaker. The resulting economy was a patchwork of all these tiny businesses. That started to change with the advent of capital-intensive industries like textile manufacturing, which required organizing larger groups of people under a single employer. Then came railroads in the late 19th century. With projects that took many years to realize and stretched over thousands of miles, vast numbers of workers needed to be on the same page. "If you mess it up, there's a big explosion," says Louis Hyman, a political economy historian at Johns Hopkins. "You needed to really coordinate your mechanisms and make sure that people are doing things exactly the same way." As mass production developed, Hyman says, many of the most consequential innovations during this time weren't so much technical breakthroughs: They were social inventions to coordinate the labor of all the people it took to get the most out of the new machines. The assembly line broke down complicated work into simple, repeatable, standardized tasks; scientific management emphasized the importance of monitoring, measuring, and optimizing everyone's performance; and the M-form corporate structure created a blueprint to manage sprawling bureaucracies through a clear chain of command. In the 1930s, about a tenth of the labor force worked for businesses that employed at least 10,000 people. By the end of World War II, that share had surged to about a third. By the 1970s, some of that bigger-is-better ideology started to change. A new management philosophy set in, normalizing layoffs that took aim at bloat. And as robots automated many blue-collar jobs, IBM mainframes and word processors eliminated a whole set of white-collar clerical roles as well. Still, there was plenty of work that technology couldn't automate, which meant that companies needed large teams of college-educated professionals to keep them going. Even the most tech-forward companies saw their people — especially their coders — as mission-critical to their success. "Hiring great people — especially engineers — is one of the biggest challenges that any technology company has," Mark Zuckerberg lamented in 2013. "Our country doesn't produce the volume of engineers that the companies would want to hire." Tech giants often hired more than they needed to make sure they had a steady supply of talent, and to attract and retain the best of the best, they treated their employees like gods. If you were to pinpoint one moment the gods turned mortal, it would probably be November 9, 2022 — the day Meta laid off more than 11,000 employees. From there, virtually every tech company followed suit, with employers across other industries close behind. At first, the cuts were chalked up to overhiring in the pandemic. But two and a half years later, the layoffs haven't stopped and hiring is still down. More and more, AI appears to be driving those austerity measures. In an industry that once hoarded talent like gold, the shift is striking. CEOs no longer seem to view the bulk of their workforce as indispensable, and they say as much: A common refrain among tech leaders from Mark Zuckerberg to Elon Musk to Dara Khosrowshahi now is some version of "If you don't like it here, you should leave." Companies like Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Salesforce had reliably increased their headcounts year after year. Now, according to the workforce analytics provider Live Data, all of them employ fewer people than they did at their 2022 peak. J. Scott Hamilton, Live Data's CEO, says this is probably just the beginning. To gauge how much deeper the cuts could go, his team recently analyzed the detailed responsibilities of most roles at Microsoft to estimate the share of tasks that could, in theory, be done by AI. Their conclusion: If Microsoft were to offload all of those automatable tasks to AI, it would eliminate 36% of the work currently done by employees. That would mean the company could lay off some 80,000 employees. On the one hand, that's an aggressive scenario: Companies are rarely able to overhaul their workflows to take full advantage of a new automation technology's capabilities. If they do, that transition takes a very long time. And besides, some work is simply too high-stakes to entrust to error-prone AI — even if it's technically possible. On the other, the estimate may prove conservative: Live Data's predictions assume that AI will remain at 2025-level capabilities. Given how much better the leading large language models have become over the last two years, the best tools will almost certainly be able to handle more than what they can today. "The optimists are saying that the good companies will simply redeploy the assets elsewhere now that they can be more efficient," Hamilton says. "But I think an equal argument can be made that they'll just say, 'We're going to do the same amount with fewer people.'" If that sounds like a far-off hypothetical future, consider what's already happening today at startups. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says he's making bets with his friends on when we'll get the first "one-person billion-dollar company." And Arthur Kaneko, a general partner at Coreline Ventures, tells me he's noticed that early-stage founders are raising their initial rounds of funding with fewer employees than they would have had in the past — among the AI-fluent founders, perhaps with less than half. "The way companies are being built is just fundamentally changing right now because of AI," Kaneko says. "Through the use of AI coding, AI marketing, AI sales, people are able to do a lot more work with way fewer people." And he thinks these startups will stay lean as they scale into successful businesses. "They just won't hire the people that Meta and Microsoft had to hire to get to where they are," he says. "I do think per-company headcount will permanently be depressed in startups." There are reasons to be hopeful about a new era of smaller employers. If AI makes it cheaper and easier to launch companies, we'll probably see more of them — and that would be great for the long-term health of the economy in all kinds of ways. New businesses tend to employ people with less experience and fewer credentials who get passed up by the bigger companies. They're more willing to try new things, which drives innovation. And they create more competition for the established giants, which is good for consumers. Smaller companies may also be good for the workers inside them. There's a lot that people hate about working at big organizations: the constant turf wars, the endless layers of approval, the meetings before the meetings, the sense that you're just one tiny inconsequential cog in a giant machine. Smaller bureaucracies would minimize that, which is one reason why people often feel more motivated in leaner workplaces. According to Gallup, employees at small companies report the highest engagement, with scores dropping below the national average once organizations hit 500 employees. On the same stage where Altman made his one-person unicorn prediction, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian raved about the benefits of this possibility. "CEOs and founders are going to be so excited to get up and go to work with much smaller, much more performant, much more culturally strong teams," he said. But a world of shrunken employers could also rob workers of something essential: the long-term career paths that big companies used to offer. With so many roles under one roof, big companies made it possible for workers to try new things, move up, and build careers. Smaller firms don't offer the same range of opportunities, which means people will likely need to switch companies a lot more in the future. Smaller firms are also less likely to invest in on-the-job training — a shift that would hit early-career professionals hard, just as their roles face the greatest risk from AI. The big question is what this all means for college-educated workers. If enough startups emerge, they might create new jobs to offset the ones disappearing from big companies. But that would require an unprecedented boom in entrepreneurship — one enormous enough to make up for the retrenchment of the giants. In 2022, 29% of the American workforce worked for an organization that employed at least 10,000 people. Meanwhile, the country's education system is churning out ever more college grads, who studied hard with the expectation of a stable future in white-collar work. If big companies hire less, and small companies also hire less, where will they all go? The usual reassurance is that AI, like every disruptive technology before it, will eventually create more jobs than it destroys. That glosses over an important detail, according to Carl Benedikt Frey, an economist at Oxford. In the early stages of the Industrial Revolution, most innovations simply made existing work faster and cheaper — like the loom, which automated the work of skilled weavers but still produced more or less the same fabric. That made a handful of industrialists very rich, but for the average worker, wages barely budged for the first 80 or so years of industrialization. It was only later — with inventions like electricity and the automobile that gave rise to entirely novel industries — that economic growth surged and better, high-paying jobs emerged. Had that second wave never arrived, we'd remember the Industrial Revolution very differently. "Most productivity gains over the long run," Frey says, "come from doing new and previously inconceivable things." Right now, corporate America seems stuck in that first phase. So many executives are laser-focused on using AI to do the same work with fewer people, rather than applying it to problems we couldn't solve before — the kind of breakthroughs that would open up new lines of business and generate more demand for labor, not less. "A real risk is that we're getting leaner organizations, but they're not really creating that much new," Frey says. "That would be a bleak future, and I do worry we're moving in that direction."

Title: LendingClub CEO Warns Americans Underestimate Credit Card Interest Costs

Highlights LendingClub CEO Scott Sanborn says that the personal loan market is at its highest TAM ever as consumers face rising interest rates on credit card products and rising prices on everything they buy. LendingClub is moving from lender to a comprehensive financial ecosystem amid rekindled marketing efforts. Sanborn tells Karen Webster that new products like LevelUp Checking offer cash back on essentials and loan payments, while LevelUp Savings incentivizes consistent savings behavior. LendingClub’s latest quarter showed robust originations and profit growth, and marketplace support by heavy hitters like BlackRock.

Δ LendingClub CEO Scott Sanborn said more than half of consumers don’t know the interest rates on their credit cards. Among those who claim to know their rates, half underestimate what they’re actually paying. The findings come from LendingClub’s internal research, as credit card interest rates have risen to the high-20% range while essential expenses continue to outpace income growth over the past two decades. Credit card revolving balances have reached record levels during this period. “Add in the inflationary pressure, which doesn’t seem to be going away as fast as anyone would like,” Sanborn told PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster during a Monday Conversation session. “It’s putting pressure on consumers, who are managing…but things are tight.” Sanborn said the conditions have created the largest total addressable market for personal loans that the company has seen. LendingClub estimates that 52% of Americans are currently carrying credit card debt at historically high interest rates. LendingClub began as a peer-to-peer lending platform in 2006 before acquiring Radius Bank in 2020. Sanborn said the bank acquisition was a key strategic move to empower consumers to make what he called “smart financial decisions” and transform the company’s operations into a comprehensive financial ecosystem. Following a strong second quarter reported at the end of July, the company reactivated key marketing channels that had been curtailed during interest rate shifts and the 2023 banking crisis. These channels include online advertising, display ads, paid search, and direct mail campaigns. “Our early results came in stronger than we expected,” Sanborn said, attributing the performance to the significant interest rate savings LendingClub can offer to consumers carrying high-rate credit card debt. LevelUp Checking launched just over a month ago with features designed to reward responsible financial behavior. The account offers 1% cash back on essential purchases, including gas, groceries, and pharmaceuticals, plus 1% annual percentage yield on account balances and 2% cash back for customers who make on-time loan payments. The cash back on loan payments effectively reduces the interest rate customers pay on their loans. Since the product launch, sign-ups increased sixfold compared to previous account opening rates. Approximately 60% of new checking accounts have come from existing borrowers who are setting up direct deposits and automated loan payments, indicating strong cross-selling success between LendingClub’s lending and banking operations. LevelUp Savings has attracted $2.7 billion in deposits in what Sanborn described as a short period. The savings product offers higher interest rates for customers who maintain consistent saving behavior over time. “These offerings are good for the consumer, better than the competition, and best when they’re used together,” Sanborn explained, referring to the integrated approach across checking, savings, and lending products. The banking product growth is being supported by what Sanborn called robust momentum in the company’s core lending businesses. Second-quarter loan originations rose 32% compared to the same period last year. The company attributed this growth to strong credit performance among existing loans and high demand from institutional loan buyers. LendingClub has maintained what Sanborn described as “a pretty cautious credit stance” that has contributed to more than four years of outperformance relative to competitors. The company’s current approval rates are approximately one-third lower than the levels maintained before inflation began affecting borrower finances. When the interest rate environment first shifted upward, asset management companies that had been buying loans from LendingClub’s marketplace moved to the sidelines because their cost of capital increased dramatically. “So we pivoted to banks,” Sanborn explained. “And we went upstream in terms of credit we were sourcing, because that’s what bank buyers want.” This pivot toward higher-quality borrowers proved beneficial when the 2023 banking crisis occurred. “Luckily we were ‘up’ credit at the time when inflationary pressures were also hitting borrowers,” Sanborn said. “That really benefited us and we’re selling that higher quality credit now to both banks and asset managers.” The conservative underwriting approach has enabled LendingClub to maintain strong loan performance even as economic conditions have created stress for many borrowers across the industry. In its core business of refinancing credit card debt, LendingClub directly pays off customers’ existing card balances rather than providing cash to borrowers. This process ensures the funds are used as intended for debt consolidation and prevents customers from accumulating additional debt on top of their new personal loan. “If you tell us you’re going to pay off your credit card debt, we say, great,” Sanborn explained. “Here are your cards…we will pay those directly for you.” This approach helps consumers reduce their overall cost of debt while maintaining the same total debt level, consolidating multiple credit card accounts into a single point of interaction through the LendingClub platform. LendingClub recently announced a significant partnership with BlackRock that includes a structured certificate product with an investment-grade rating from Fitch Ratings. Sanborn described BlackRock as a “blue chip counterpart” for the partnership. The BlackRock deal includes up to $1 billion in forward flow commitments for future loan purchases, initially targeting lower-cost capital sources such as insurance companies. This partnership is designed to help power LendingClub’s online marketplace for loan sales to institutional investors. Sanborn said these partnerships distinguish LendingClub from what he called “episodic entrants” in the lending market who “come in with guns blazing using inferred bureau models” without the depth of experience that comes from extended market presence. He noted that LendingClub has two decades of operating experience, dozens of internal credit models, and $100 billion in loan originations over 17 years of operations. This track record, according to Sanborn, provides advantages over newer competitors that rely primarily on standard credit bureau data and models. The company is developing what Sanborn called a proprietary “dynamic application” system that will control LendingClub’s full mobile technology stack. Unlike most banks that rely on third-party technology solutions, LendingClub’s internally controlled system is intended to enable more data-driven, customer-focused experiences. Additionally, the company is building a mobile marketing platform to support customer acquisition and engagement efforts. These technology investments are part of LendingClub’s broader strategy to differentiate its customer experience from traditional banking and lending competitors. “We’re really pleased with the progress we’re making,” Sanborn told Webster. “We’re very bullish on the future of LendingClub and we’re running ahead of our own expectations, which is great.” The company’s strong second-quarter performance and successful product launches have exceeded internal projections, according to Sanborn, positioning LendingClub for continued growth in what the CEO sees as an expanding market opportunity driven by consumer financial pressures and limited awareness of debt costs.

IRELAND’S LATEST RISING star in athletics, Conor Kelly, has confirmed he will follow in Rhasidat Adeleke’s footsteps by attending the University of Texas. Kelly collected his 400m gold medal at the European U20 championships today, having stormed to victory in yesterday’s race, clocking a new U20 national record of 45.83 seconds while he was at it. Speaking today to Athletics Ireland after stepping off the podium, Kelly said, “I couldn’t stop smiling, it was incredible. I was probably up a little later than I should’ve been. I woke up a little late, not much sleep…This is the last week before I go to Texas (for college) so I better get a good goodbye in.” Advertisement Kelly raced alongside Adeleke in the mixed 4x400m at the world relay championships in May. Today marked the final day of the championships in Tampere, Finland, with Sean Cronin (1500m) and the Irish women’s 4x100m relay team finishing eighth in their respective finals. Racing in a stacked, tactical 1500m final. Clonliffe Harriers clubman Cronin dug deep down the home straight to cross the line in 3:50.80. “I’m really proud of how I ran that race. I think I got as much out of it as I could have,” he told Athletics Ireland. “I’m delighted with the progression I’ve made this season, I think I’ve really stepped up. I’ve not just trained harder; I’ve trained smarter and done all the little things right in between.” An hour earlier, the Women’s 4x100m relay team of Fatima Amusan (Leevale AC), Molly Daly (Kilkenny City Harriers), Leila Colfer (St Laurence O’Toole AC) and Precious Akpe-Moses (Blackrock AC) clocked a time of 45.17 seconds in finishing eighth in their relay final, which was faster than their heat time. Akpe-Moses – who was racing at these championships for the eighth time, having made the finals of both the 100m and 200m – reflected on her performance and that of the team with pride. “It’s been a long championship,” she said. “We made it to the final, did what we could do, and we’re satisfied.” After a long two days of competition, Enya Silkena (Ratoath AC) finished 17th in the Women’s Heptathlon with 4693 points. Silkena was in action in the Long Jump (5.63m), Javelin Throw (39.48m) and 800m (2:30.19) today. Seamus Clarke (Moy Valley AC) was unable to finish the final of the Men’s 10,000m Race Walk due to injury.

Title: OpenAI to give employees ‘special’ million-dollar bonuses amid AI talent wars
URL: https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-employees-special-million-dollar-bonuses-ai-talent-wars-10182286/
Time Published: 2025-08-11T05:30:08Z
Full Content:
OpenAI has announced a ‘special one-time award’ to its AI researchers and engineers across several departments, including applied engineering, scaling, and safety. The bonuses were announced a day before the Microsoft-backed AI startup unveiled GPT-5, its latest and most advanced large language model (LLM). More than 1,000 OpenAI employees are eligible for the bonus, according to a report by The Verge. The ChatGPT-maker is currently valued at $300 billion. While the exact bonus amounts are not known, it will likely depend on the role and seniority of qualified employees, with the highest million-dollar payouts reportedly going to OpenAI’s prized AI researchers, who already draw salaries worth millions of dollars every year. The engineers, on the other hand, will reportedly receive bonuses amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars on average, the report said. However, these bonuses are not likely to be paid out at once. Instead, it will be disbursed over the next two years with qualified workers having the option to receive the money in OpenAI stock, cash, or both. “As we mentioned a few weeks ago, we have been looking at comp for our technical teams given the movement in the market,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was quoted as saying by The Verge. “We very much intend to keep increasing comp as we keep doing better and better as a company. But we wanted to be transparent about this one since it’s a new thing for us,” Altman added. This is reportedly the first time that OpenAI has offered bonuses to such a large number of employees, about one-third of the company’s full workforce. The move comes against the backdrop of a rapidly intensifying war for AI talent. Several companies have poached OpenAI researchers with lucrative offers, and Meta has led the charge. Since the one-time special bonus does not apply to all employees, OpenAI risks losing more workers, who may feel overlooked, to other companies. Mark Chen, OpenAI’s research officer, has previously likened Meta’s aggressive poaching spree to a home invasion. Shengjia Zhao, one of the creators of ChatGPT, was recently named as the chief scientist of Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL). Besides Meta, Elon Musk’s xAI has also reportedly been making aggressive offers to lure away OpenAI’s top talent. Thinking Machines, an AI rival lab started by ex-OpenAI CTO Mira Murati, also comprises several of OpenAI’s technical staff. Meanwhile, OpenAI also reportedly plans to allow current and former employees to cash out with millions by selling their vested stock to investors. However, Altman has reportedly said that employees might be able to sell at a much higher share price than the current $274 per share at a higher valuation of $500 billion, according to a report by Bloomberg.

With BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale leading the buying spree, Ethereum’s breakout looks increasingly credible. Ethereum is gaining serious momentum as institutional ETF inflows surpass Bitcoin. Bullish metrics and rising open interest point to growing confidence in ETH, bringing it within an achievable distance of a new all-time high. Ethereum [ETH] just stole the spotlight from Bitcoin [BTC]. ETF inflows have flipped the usual script, on-chain trends are pointing up, and big players are quietly piling in. But will ETH be able to sustain this breakout and go further? ETFs are snapping up more Ethereum than Bitcoin, with a recent single-day haul of $461 million in ETH products compared to $404 million for BTC, according to Arkham Intelligence. Source: Arkham Intelligence The surge was led by institutional titans – BlackRock scooped up $250 million worth of ETH, Fidelity added $130 million, and Grayscale followed with $60 million. In fact, this was one of the strongest single-day institutional buying waves ETH has seen this year. Glassnode data revealed a sharp rise in first-time buyers and momentum traders, pushing new demand higher. Source: Glassnode Having said that, conviction buyers – those raising their cost basis despite elevated prices – also grew, signaling deeper market commitment. On top of that, this mix of fresh inflows and seasoned holder conviction could set the stage for an aggressive leg upward if buying pressure sustains. At press time, Ethereum’s derivatives market is heating up, with Futures Open Interest sitting at $51.61 billion – near a yearly high. Source: CoinGlass Price action remained strong despite a minor pullback, with ETH trading at $4,190, above its 9- and 21-day EMAs. Momentum indicators added to the bullish bias: RSI hovered just below overbought territory at 69.8, while MACD remained firmly positive. Source: TradingView With less than $700 to reclaim its $4,891 all-time high, ETH’s current structure suggests a shot at price discovery this year. Of course, profit-taking could slow the climb before any decisive breakout. Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Courtesy of Ed Yardeni: Source: Yardeni as edited by Chinn. In terms of assessing how the general economy is responding to tariff and other uncertainty shocks, one might want to look at the SP500 excluding the Magnificent 7. As of August 8, SP500 market cap was $54.2 trillion; ex-Magnificent 7 was $36.7 trillion. Hence, the stock market is looking quite good partly because of the performance of Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA) stocks. The question is whether this outperformance is durable. One might say that the cyclically adjusted Price-Earnings (CAPE) ratio is not quite up to 2021M11 levels, so not to worry. I’ll just note that inflation expectations adjusted 10 year rates are now much higher: 2.1% in May vs. -1.0%. Figure 1: Cyclically adjusted price-earning (CAPE) ratio (black, left scale), and ten year ex ante real rate, % (light blue +, right scale).

NBER defined peak-to-trough recession dates shaded gray. Source: Shiller, Treasury via FRED, Philadelphia Fed, NBER and author’s calculations. Cape is as high in general to 2021. So yeah, its a problem. Margin debt is even higher. This seems concerning: “SCOOP: Trump’s team is considering longtime Bureau of Labor Statistics critic E.J. Antoni to run agency just after president fired Erika McEntarfer” https://x.com/schwartzbWSJ/status/1954660412407922766 And, he’s announced Antoni’s nomination. https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/11/trump-antoni-bls-statistics.html I don’t think their relative market cap is the biggest issue. More salient is how concentrated earnings have become. In the aggregate the S&P 500 set another all time earnings record in Q2: https://advantage.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_080825.pdf But a month ago.Earnings Insight forecast that “ In aggregate, the “Magnificent 7” companies are expected to report year-over-year earnings growth of 14.1% for the second quarter. Excluding these seven companies, the blended (combines actual and estimated results) earnings growth rate for the remaining 493 companies in the S&P 500 would be 3.4% for Q2 2025”: https://insight.factset.com/are-magnificent-7-companies-still-top-contributors-to-earnings-growth-for-the-sp-500-for-q2 CNBC says today that the magnificent 7 stocks profits grew 26% in Q2: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/04/sp-500-earnings-growth-would-be-dull-without-26percent-increase-from-mag-7.html One of the important things I look at is the advance-decline line, I.e., how many of the companies’ stocks are participating in the rally? Here they are: https://www.marketinout.com/chart/market.php?breadth=advance-decline-line Every market segment is currently showing no net advances in the past month, and a few of them are showing significant declines. In other words, the vast majority of companies have shown pedestrian earnings growth, and have had pedestrian stock price advances, if at all. I don’t think the advance-decline is a big problem yet. If memory serves, the A/D line had about a 50% decline from peak before the tech bubble popped in 2000. Very nice. A question: Having never given A/D analysis much thought until now, I’m curious whether a 50% decline ahead of one of the worst stock market declines in U.S. history amounts to a special case. Did it take an investing public too engaged in speculative buying to notice anything but their object of speculative buying to create that situation? Might we look for either a smaller decline in the A/D line to lead to a decline in overall equity market value in more common cases? While we’re at it, bullishness, as measured by a good many conventional bull/bear indicators, is high. Here’s the CNNMoney indicator, with components: https://edition.cnn.com/markets/fear-and-greed To NDd’s point about market breadth, the McClellan Volume Summation Index (a component of the CNN indicato), which is one method for comparing the number of gainers to losers, is neutral. I understand that portfolio cash levels are relatively low, despite a fairly good return to cash. Another contrarian indicator; not much fuel for additional gains.

Title: The Real Reason You Haven’t Been Replaced by AI Yet

Itâs the ticking time bomb in the global economy, and every CEO knows it: AI is already powerful enough to replace millions of jobs. So why haven’t the mass layoffs begun? The answer has little to do with technology and everything to do with fear. Corporate leaders are quietly waiting to see who will be the first to pull the trigger. My discussions about Generative AI reveal a stark generational divide. Most people under 35 are convinced that AI is a reality, not a gimmick, and that the displacement of human workers is an urgent, present-day issue. For many over 35, the assessment is more cautious; they believe the replacement will happen, but not for another five or ten years. The problem is that the second group is several steps behind. The AI revolution isn’t being held back because the technology isn’t ready. It’s being held back for political reasons. CEOs are nervously looking at each other, waiting for someone else to make the first move and announce that they are eliminating a significant number of jobs because AI can do the work faster and cheaper. They are tiptoeing around what they already know. And they are telegraphing their intentions subliminally. Take Palantir’s CEO, Alex Karp. During an interview with CNBC in August, he said: âWeâre planning to grow our revenue â¦ while decreasing our number of people.â Karp then continued: âThis is a crazy, efficient revolution. The goal is to get 10x revenue and have 3,600 people. We have now 4,100.â The subtext is clear: Palantir already considers 500 of its employees to be a surplus that AI could replace. It could increase its revenue by 10x while reducing its workforce by almost 12.2%. Look at Amazon. The company has more than one million robots (Hercules, Pegasus, and Proteus, its fully autonomous robot) in its facilities and believes that AI will help increase its robot mobility by 10%. The number of its robots is nearly equivalent to the 1.546 million people (full-time and part-time) that the company employs globally. CEO Andy Jassy has already warned his workforce of what’s to come. âWe will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,â Jassy told employees in a memo last June. âItâs hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce.â CEOs are waiting for political cover that isn’t coming. None of them want to become the poster child for the revolution that killed human jobs in America. They don’t want to become the target of politicians, knowing that on this issue, the attacks will come from both the populist left and the populist right. The problem is that politicians are just as unprepared as the over-35s. They seem to believe this is a problem for the next administration, a challenge for a few years down the road. They are wrong. The problem is here now. The questions are urgent: what will the displaced workers do? What safety nets need to be built? What happens to the healthcare of millions who are still a long way from retirement? These are questions politicians have not yet addressed, likely because they don’t have the answers. So, for now, the CEOs are buying them time. Instead of mass firings, a quieter trend has emerged: hiring freezes. Increasingly, managers are being forced to justify why a human is needed for a role that an AI could potentially perform. This is already devastating the job market for young people. According to Handshake, a career platform for Gen Z employees, job listings for entry-level corporate roles have declined 15% over the past year. And for those who still think the great displacement is far away, the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported a few days ago that AI is already one of the top five factors contributing to job losses this year. Companies have announced over 806,000 private-sector job cuts since January, the highest number for that period since 2020. The tech industry is leading the charge. The machine is in motion. It’s not that AI can’t replace us, especially in knowledge jobs. It’s that your boss doesn’t yet have the courage to tell you they’re firing you for a robot. They don’t want to be the villain. Theyâre waiting for one of their peers to be crucified before they enter the stage. But for how long? CEOChatGPTlayoffsPolitics Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Title: Inside the mind of Lyn Alden: Bitcoin, AI, and the unstoppable deficit train

Renowned macro analyst Lyn Alden shares her views on fiscal deficits, 'sticky' inflation, Bitcoin cycles, and the remarkable 20-watt human brain. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Welcome to Slate Sundays, CryptoSlate’s new weekly feature showcasing in-depth interviews, expert analysis, and thought-provoking op-eds that go beyond the headlines to explore the ideas and voices shaping the future of crypto. Lyn Alden is an exceptional human. Broadly recognized as one of the top minds in macroeconomics, during a conversation with Lyn, you can feel some of her vast intellect rubbing off on you; I swear my IQ increased several points by the time our chat was over. Even navigating heavy topics like the fiscal deficit and the onset of AI, she does so with a smile on her face and more eloquence and poise than an Olympic gymnast executing a triple backflip. Founder of Lyn Alden Investment Strategy and general partner at venture firm Ego Death Capital, alongside other industry heavyweights like Jeff Booth and Preston Pysh, Lyn has earned her stripes over the years as one of the most respected macro analysts in the space. She’s also one of the most solicited for interviews, thanks to her razor-sharp insights and depth of market knowledge. As a prolific content creator, Lyn offers a free investing newsletter and frequents the virtual corridors of Crypto Twitter daily, amassing three-quarters of a million followers who rely on her timely commentary and finely-edged wit: beyond the undeniable words of wisdom and investment advice, Lyn’s something of a master when it comes to memes. Lyn is perhaps best known for her book Broken Money, which provides a comprehensive view of the history of money and a well-illustrated critique of the global monetary system. She’s also highly vocal about her thesis on the U.S. fiscal deficit, AKA, ‘Nothing stops this train’. Sky-high levels of U.S. spending are rising at a pace that far outstrips the government’s ability to pay for it, creating what Lyn dubs a “slow-motion runaway train.” She explains: “Large U.S. fiscal deficits are going to continue for the foreseeable future, five, 10 years, any sort of investable time horizon. There are a bunch of reasons why, and a lot of them have to do with political polarization. It’s very hard to either massively raise taxes or massively cut spending in a very polarized situation, as well as mechanically the kind of debt levels they find themselves in.” The total amount of money the U.S. government owes to its lenders currently amounts to an eye-watering $36.9 trillion, representing over 120% of GDP, and growing by around $1 trillion every quarter. Even the most highly skilled ringmaster with smoke and mirrors would struggle to obfuscate such an alarming level of federal debt. With a diminishing ability to pay it off, I wonder, if nothing stops this train, can anything slow it down? She replies: “There are plenty of things that can slow it down a little bit. Tariffs are one of the things that can slow it down because they bypass some of that polarization. Tariffs are basically really big tax hikes that go around Congress because of an emergency authorization executive order, so they temporarily bypass some of the frictions against them.” While tariffs may serve to fill the government coffers a little higher, Lyn says the numbers don’t add up enough to make a significant impact: the deficit is around $2 trillion, and the income from tariffs at the current level only equates to roughly a quarter of it at around $500 billion a year. Plus, “we’re already seeing exemptions.” She adds: “The last line for the ‘Nothing stops this train’ view is that the U.S. is very financialized, meaning that our government’s tax receipts are very correlated with asset prices. Any attempts at austerity at this point tend to fail to address the problem because you either slow down the stock market or slow down the economy. Therefore, with a lag, you weaken your other tax receipts and make deficit reduction on a sustained basis hard.” I nod, contemplating the enormity of the situation and the inevitable collision course the economy is on. She continues: “Just structurally, it’s growing above target almost without any way to stop it.” We turn the conversation to last week’s market slump following a weaker-than-expected jobs report that triggered former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes to sell off a chunk of his crypto holdings. I ask Lyn how significant the jobs report is and whether she echoes Hayes’ bearish near-term views on global liquidity. She frowns, pointing out that Hayes is more of a frequent trader than she is, however: “The jobs report was pretty significant. It was the biggest downward revision in quite a while, and it’s corroborated by other things as well. The ISM Purchasing Managers’ indices are also showing a similar directional weakness.” The ISM Manufacturing PMI is a key indicator of the state of the U.S. economy as it signals the level of demand for products by measuring the amount of ordering activity at U.S. factories. Lyn continues: “Now, whether that affects Bitcoin and broader crypto, I’m more hesitant to say. While it can slow down earnings that can impair the economy in various ways, it also generally means more Fed dovishness, which, around the margins, is good for Bitcoin and crypto.” Despite not making short-term trading decisions like Hayes, Lyn gives some credence to his outlook over the coming quarters based on a couple of parameters: Tariffs may make a dent in the deficit and serve to take the wind out of crypto’s sails (“slightly slower the train for a couple of quarters”), and the treasury is attempting to refill its general cash account (the TGA) after the debt ceiling was passed. That means sucking liquidity out of the system, which can negatively impact risk assets. Lyn explains: “Ironically, debt ceilings, when they’re an issue, are actually good for liquidity because they force all these pockets of liquidity to go back into the market, but then afterward, when they refill their cash levels, they’re pulling cash out of the system. They [the treasury] expect to do that through the rest of this quarter, to Arthur’s point, which is historically not amazing for asset prices across the board.” In contrast, Lyn isn’t too worried about a broader tightening of global liquidity. She says: “I would say liquidity’s in a middling place because the dollar is no longer falling as it was earlier this year, and the dollar is a really big variable for liquidity, generally. A falling dollar is overall good for global liquidity. At the other end of the spectrum, China’s credit impulse is on the upswing, which is good for global liquidity. So it’s kind of neutral at the current time.” While it’s not the perfect setup for a million-dollar Bitcoin, things could definitely be worse. Lyn affirms: “I don’t think this cycle’s over yet. I think we’re going to see higher highs in Bitcoin this cycle. That could be later this year. That could be early next year. There are lots of little variables that can affect that, but so far, we don’t see any indicators that look like a multi-year top.” In fact, she explains that we’re “nowhere near multi-year tops” based on various indicators that track market value compared to on-chain cost basis, a “kind of a measure of euphoria.” “I think liquidity still looks decent, maybe not great for a quarter, but it’s not an acute headwind per se, in my opinion, and going into next year, I still think we’re going to see most likely higher Bitcoin prices.” How high is that? Lyn pauses and says she has no firm view. Unlike other personalities in the space, she doesn’t win over more followers by making outlandish predictions. Instead, she simply says: “I think we’re going over $150k this cycle. Now the number could be much higher than that, but I always try to start conservatively, and it depends on market conditions at that time.” She believes that Bitcoin cycles are changing, and we should expect this one to be longer and “maybe less extreme” than previous runs. We should also prepare to see strong moves upward followed by periods of consolidation, “rather than going to the moon and collapsing.” “If you look at what used to be called FANG stocks, and now it’s the Mag7 stocks, basically large-cap U.S. tech stocks, they kept grinding up longer than people thought. Value investors were always shocked that these things just kept growing. “Sometimes they get over their skis and have a 30% correction, sometimes worse. Sometimes they have a flattish, choppy year, but then they keep grinding higher after they work out some steam. I think Bitcoin could resemble that model to some extent. Maybe it’s still more volatile than that, but I do think we should expect maybe longer and less extreme cycles on average.” For anyone who’s been flushed out by a Mt. Gox, China ban, or FTX-style black swan event that abruptly reversed most of Bitcoin’s gains, Lyn’s prediction may provide some relief. But is there any potential catalyst for the end of the cycle quietly chirping away like a canary in a coal mine? Bitcoin treasury companies, for example? Lyn points out that now that Bitcoin is a multitrillion-dollar asset, it’s inevitable that smart money flows in. She says: “There’s no world in which only individuals own Bitcoin and magically no large pools of capital want to own it. That only makes sense when Bitcoin is a tiny market.” She’s not concerned about the centralization threat to Bitcoin posed by entities like Strategy gobbling up BTC like it’s going out of style (Strategy’s BTC holdings currently stand at over 628,791, just shy of 3% of the entire supply). She simply shrugs and says it’s no different from previous cycles: “At one point, Mt. Gox supposedly had over 800,000 coins, and there were fewer coins back then. So that was a bigger percentage of coins than, say, BlackRock or Strategy has now. So while there’s always some degree of centralization concerns, it’s really not worse now than it was at periods of times in the past. So, no. I’m not really worried about that from a centralization perspective.” What is important to be on the lookout for, Lyn explains, is the amount of leverage in the system, since “any degree of euphoria and leverage is what causes the next downward cycle.” Bitcoin needs upward volatility to go from zero to trillions of dollars of value and become relevant on a global scale; and upward volatility, Lyn warns, breeds euphoria and leverage. “That’s when you get over your skis and you get consolidations and downside volatility. There are obviously other liquidations that happen from time to time, so they certainly could feed the next downturn, but I don’t view it as fundamentally different from prior cycles, and the current leverage in the treasury space is not that high. MicroStrategy has pretty low leverage relative to their Bitcoin. Metaplanet has relatively low leverage relative to their Bitcoin. We’ll see how the others come as they go. I certainly think that we’ll see a washout. We’ll see a lot of altcoin treasury companies get washed out, and some Bitcoin ones that are poorly managed are going to be at risk in the next downturn.” It was sometime during the COVID lockdowns that Lyn began discussing the persistent inflation that would stem from shuttering the world and inflating the money supply. She would later characterize the 2020s as the decade of inflation, as governments struggle to rein in rising costs. Does Lyn expect this trend to continue? “To some extent, I mean, we’re in 2025. We’re still above the way the Fed measures inflation. We’re still above their official target even though it has come down. Now, whether or not we have another dramatic spike comes partially down to whether energy is constrained or not. It’s pretty hard to have major inflation without energy suppression, so anything that keeps the supply of energy high is a way of keeping inflation down.” Unlike previous decades, she says, where we were able to print money and offset it with productivity gains from automating manufacturing, she sees the 2020s as “stickier” in terms of average inflation; unless we realize a major productivity increase through a technology such as AI, although even that won’t bring down the cost of store-of-value assets. She says: “The things that are truly scarce, like waterfront property, gold, fine art, high-quality stocks, and things like that, all go up dramatically because it’s hard to increase those things. So I think going forward, AI making, say, white collar types of services cheaper can suppress in some way CPI and certain wages and expenditures that people have. This could be offset by ongoing money printing, higher gold, higher Bitcoin, higher prestige properties, and just truly scarce things. So I do think that we’re still in a sticky inflation environment, even though it’s hard to get dramatic inflation without energy shortages.” Since she’s brought up AI for its productivity gains, I ask if she’s concerned about job losses and whether she believes it’s a net positive for humanity, being something of an AI skeptic myself. Lyn’s markedly more optimistic. Just like the runaway fiscal deficit train, she says AI is inevitable. “At this stage, if you try to ban it in one country, another will do it, and it will be open-sourced in some capacity. Like any technology, it can be disruptive when it hits; a lot of people can lose their jobs at once.” She likens AI to social media in the way the latter disrupted social interaction, and warns that it must be used carefully to avoid doing more harm than good. I recall reading an MIT study, to her point, that found AI to be a great learning tool; as long as people didn’t become so dependent on it that their intelligence drained away like blood from an open wound. Lyn continues: “It’s a good thing that we find ways to make repetitive white-collar work cheaper and more affordable because that allows those people or future generations to do other types of work, which is true for any time we automated textiles or farming with tractors and hydrocarbons and things like that. It’s the same thing except it’s quicker.” She points out that portable AI is different from data center AI and marvels at the mechanics of the human brain: our ability to process complex thoughts and emotions, “very high bandwidth senses,” and “self-healing” capability run on just 20 watts of power. She enthuses: “It’s remarkable. It’s less than an incandescent light bulb. The equivalent amount of processing in a data center runs on megawatts of power, so millions of watts of power… I don’t think we’re anywhere near the level where there’s nothing humans could do to add value over silicon. I think it’s more a case of disruption that then puts more people into doing other things.” I nod, wondering whether my metaphorical lightbulb requires as much energy as Lyn Alden’s giant brain. With persistent inflation, societal disruption, and broken money, to boot, this era bears all the hallmarks of a fourth turning, and I struggle to feel positive about where it all ends. I wonder what Lyn thinks. Is this a good time to be alive? She ponders: “I think so. Fewer people die from avoidable things than almost ever before globally. It’s not an accident that the population bubble is happening now… For the most part, I consider it good, but it goes through waves of getting too much, like when people get cut off from social connections. People have way more depression now than hunter-gatherers, even though in most capacities, we live longer and are less likely to die from something random… Technology is polarizing because, in some ways, it becomes like a winner-take-most, and to the extent that we get through this whole thing successfully, I think we have to learn to use technology in a more natural way than be so reliant on it. I think eventually that will be the case.” Lyn also believes that AI won’t continue to develop and improve ad infinitum, but will eventually hit a plateau, just like aviation did: progress within that industry has been fairly stagnant for years, following its mind-blowing takeoff in the 20th Century. She says: “We went from the Wright brothers to people on the moon in one human lifetime. But then, once we hit the 70s, we slowed down. We still don’t have a jet faster than the Blackbird. We still don’t have commercial aviation faster than the Concorde. We don’t even have that anymore… I think in time, similar things will happen to electronics where we’ll reach certain densities that are hard to keep dramatically improving on, and it will allow us more time to absorb what we already have.” Follow Lyn Alden on X or check out lynalden.com for in-depth analysis and insights.

Title: Number Of Million-Dollar, One-Person Businesses Keeps Growing
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/elainepofeldt/2025/08/10/number-of-million-dollar-one-person-businesses-keeps-growing/
Time Published: 2025-08-10T20:30:23Z
Full Content:
ByElaine Pofeldt ByElaine Pofeldt, Senior Contributor. Sara Connell set a big goal for herself four years ago—to break $1 million in annual revenue at her business the Thought Leader Academy. A former advertising executive, she found that workplace stress was taking a toll, contributing to depression and an eating disorder. After spotting the the memoir, Holy Hunger, written by eating disorder survivor Margaret Bullitt-Jonas, in an airport bookstore. Reading it gave Connell inspiration to leave her job and heal. “Even if I end up on the street, I’m not going to do this anymore,” she told herself. That decision, back in 2000, paid off. Connell has broken the million-dollar mark at the Thought Leader Academy, based in Chicago, for the past four years. The Thought Leader Academy helps its clients build a platform in their industries by helping them develop their writing and speaking platforms with the help of writing coaches, mastermind sessions and group mentorship programs; it also holds live events such as the upcoming three-day conference in New York City. Called Women STARTING MOVEMENTS, it is for coaches, writers and visionaries who want to build seven-figure businesses while rallying others around their mission. Along the way, Connell, who holds a master of fine arts in writing from Northwestern University, has written seven books, the latest of which is The Download, where she guides thought leaders in using neuroscience techniques to tap their biggest ideas, and built a YouTube channel, Thought Leader Media, with more than 100,000 subscribers. Connell is part of a trend that keeps accelerating: the growth of million-dollar, one person businesses. The number of nonemployer businesses breaking $1 million grew to 117,060 in 2023, up from 116,803 in 2022, according to statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau. The number in 2022 more than doubled from 2021, when it was 57,822. Nonemployer businesses, as defined by the U.S. government, don’t run payroll. They are typically run by solopreneurs but sometimes by partnerships. Although they are staffed by the owners, these businesses do include contributions from other people. They get things done through hiring contractors, outsourcing to services such as Fulfilled by Amazon, automation and increasingly, AI. There are many factors contributing to the trend. A growing number of Americans are taking control of their careers at a time corporate life is increasingly harsh, a white-collar job shortage lingers, and fears of AI loom. They are building newly optimistic futures for themselves in self-employment as an alternative. Some are starting side hustles that blossom; others, like Connell, are leaping into full-time businesses that leverage the skills, knowledge and relationships they’ve been building all along, whether in their existing careers or other parts of their lives. Still others are pushed by layoffs to pursue long-dormant business ideas. To be sure, million-dollar, one-person businesses are still outliers when it comes to their revenue. There are 30,427,808 nonemployer businesses in the U.S., and the average revenue is $57,611. That is less than the U.S. average wage of $67,920, as tracked by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. However, some of the businesses the Census Bureau tracks are part-time side hustles—not full-time pursuits that parallel full-time jobs. And million-dollar, one-person businesses are likely to continue multiplying, and learning from each other, as more people see they are a way to bypass a trend that keeps many from starting businesses: lack of access to capital. While building a startup often requires someone to have connections to private investors known as angels or venture capitalists, most one-person businesses are funded by the owners using scrappy, capital-efficient methods. If they scale up, it is usually through bootstrapping, or self-funding through cash-flow. Where the growth in million-dollar, one-person businesses is So how do you find your million-dollar opportunity? It helps to choose the right category of business in the first place--one where it’s possible for a solopreneur to get to $1 million. The largest group of million-dollar, one-person businesses is in retail niches, such as ecommerce, with $16,141 businesses at $1-2.49 million and 4,216 at $2.5 million to $4.99, the Census data shows. Closely following are professional services, with 16,654 businesses at $1 million to $2.49 million and 2,503 at $2.5 million to $4.99 million. Another hot category is wholesale, with 11,383 businesses at $1-2.49 million and 1,684 at $2.5-$4.99 million. It is also helpful to keep an eye on the categories that have had a significant growth trajectory in recent years. I have been writing about this trend since 2012, when it started taking off, and some categories have had more signficant increases than others since then. If you’re looking for an idea that will replace a traditional career, you’ll also want to keep an eye on sustainability. Some industries see cyclical booms. Examples are construction, an industry that currently has strong growth prospects, according to Deloitte, and mining, driven in part by the use of lithium in electric-car batteries. These types of industries are ideal if you like to jump quickly on economic trends when they’re hot but also accept there may be slow cycles, too. Other niches, such as professional services, have slowly and steadily offered opportunities to break $1 million in the past decade. Despite all of the warnings from business gurus not to “trade time for dollars,” some non-employer professional services firms in fields such as accounting are consistently breaking $1 million in revenue by offering valuable services to clients who keep coming back. Despite all of the ads on social media promising a way to make “passive income,” building a sustainable million-dollar, one-person business is often a multi-year effort with lots of experimentation. After leaving her advertising job, for instance, Connell took on freelance and part-time work while getting her coaching certification and starting a coaching practice in 2004. However, she says she struggled for years to earn a consistent income as a coach. “It was very difficult to put together a profitable business,” she says. Her breakthrough came when she had broken six-figure revenue as a coach in approximately 2016 and began shifting her focus--with the help of her own coaches-- from bringing in revenue to building her profits and cashflow. She also focused on her mindset, working on healing her own past trauma, using techniques such as tapping. “I have noticed a huge connection between trauma and earning, particularly for women,” she says. “I kept smacking up against an invisible ceiling until I did that work. That was the inflection point, that took us to a million dollars consistently and kept us growing." Introducing the Thought Leader Academy helped her bring the business to the $200,000 mark and beyond. This was one of her first significant shifts from offering one-on-one coaching to her clients to an academy model, focused on teaching clients in group settings. One particularly popular offering has been bootcamps, such as the Bestselling Book Bootcamp, designed to help clients determine what they will write and outline their books. On the recommendation of one of her coaches, she gave each bootcamp a theme, such as “writing a transformational book. She rolls out downloadable content that supports the bootcamps over the eight weeks beforehand to build community around the ideas. “We did eight weeks of sharing about ‘What’s the difference? Why might one want to focus on transformation versus information?’" she explains. “It created interest and curiosity and also differentiated this bootcamp from another one.” Public speaking helps her attract her ideal customers. “We went to $1 million with no ads, no social media,” she says. Today, her YouTube channel also helps attracts like-minded clients. She surveys her ideal customers before rolling out new offerings to make sure there is interest in purchasing them before fully developing an idea. Connell initially did most of the work of the business herself, but realized that to scale her revenue and profits, she needed to build a virtual team to support her. Today, she relies on six service providers: contracted writing coaches and vendors such as graphic designers, a virtual assistant and an automation contractor to extend what she can do individually. “We have wonderful people I consider part of my team, but they’re not a team from an employee standpoint,” she says. As for the future, Connell plans to keep growing the business, with an eye toward bringing clients a fresh take on what’s happening in the market. “It really lights me up to think about what’s happening in the world, and what’s happening in the marketplace, and to help someone figure out their book’s focus and how it will be positioned,” she says. Meanwhile, she’s on the front lines of defining what it means to run a million-dollar, one-person business, a phenomenon that it likely to evolve considerably as artificial intelligence (AI) makes it easier than ever before for solopreneurs to get more done with fewer resources and to combine their own intelligence with that of machines. “I want to be part of this age of AI,” she says.

August 10, 2025 12:00 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Aug. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, announces the filing of a class action lawsuit on behalf of purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2025. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s growth potential. Notably, Novo Nordisk’s asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood that such patients would switch to Novo Nordisk’s branded alternatives. Further, defendants greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise, Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

Title: Futures-Based SOL & XRP ETFs Take In $1 Billion Capital Since Launch — Spot ETFs Next?
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/futures-sol-xrp-etfs-take-in-1-billion-capital/
Time Published: 2025-08-10T15:30:52Z

The cryptocurrency industry has been about hitting new milestones in 2025, with the futures-based Solana and XRP ETFs (exchange-traded funds) among the latest to reach new achievements. According to the latest market data, the SOL and XRP ETFs have reached $1 billion in total capital inflows since their launch earlier. This feat comes on the back of rumors that the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, might look to launch a spot XRP-based exchange-traded fund. In an August 9 post on the X platform, the president of The ETF Store, Nate Geraci, revealed that the futures-based Solana and XRP ETFs have attracted over $1 billion in capital since launch. These crypto-linked investment products started trading in the United States about five months ago—around March (for SOL ETF) and April (for XRP). For context, futures-based exchange-traded funds are a type of investment product that holds the futures contracts of an asset. A futures contract is a financial instrument that allows an investor to buy an asset at a predetermined price on a predetermined date. In March 2025, Volatility Shares launched the first-ever Solana exchange-traded funds in the United States. The firm rolled out two products at the time: Volatility Shares’ Solana fund, which replicates the performance of Solana futures, and the 2x SOL ETF that offers double-leveraged exposure. While Teucrium launched the first US-based XRP ETF (a 2x leveraged fund) in April, Volatility Shares offered the first non-leveraged futures-based XRP exchange-traded fund in May. As shown in the chart below, both the SOL and XRP ETFs had posted only modest monthly performances up until July—where they each posted approximately $350 million in capital inflows. Geraci noted that these figures include REX-Osprey’s Solana staking exchange-traded fund, which boasts up to $150 million in assets under management. According to the ETF expert, this performance proves that there will be demand for spot SOL and XRP ETFs. It is worth mentioning that a slew of applications from various asset managers are awaiting approval from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch Solana and XRP ETFs. As reported by Bitcoinist, BlackRock has indicated that it currently has no plans to join the race for spot Solana and XRP ETFs. In a second post on X, Geraci reiterated his belief that BlackRock would be looking to expand its crypto ETF portfolio. “And I’m being told BlackRock doesn’t want a piece of this?” the ETF expert said, referring to the attention being enjoyed by the future-based version of the XRP exchange-traded fund.

Title: Second Quarter Earnings Season: Waiting For NVIDIA
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/08/10/second-quarter-earnings-season-waiting-for-nvidia/

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. Following the second busiest week, the second-quarter earnings season begins to slow down this week, with just 6 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. Notable companies scheduled to release earnings include: Deere (DE) and Applied Materials (AMAT). According to FactSet, 81% of S&P 500 companies have reported earnings above consensus estimates, with 90% of companies having already reported results. Companies reporting and combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at 11.8% year-over-year, well above the 4.9% expectations at the end of the quarter. Notably, the expected earnings growth rate for calendar year 2025 is 10.3%, and for 2026, the expectation is 13.3%. Following the better earnings results, the S&P 500 came within a hair of an all-time high last week, while the Magnificent 7 reached a new peak. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed primarily due to Apple and Tesla. Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 were the group to watch this earnings season, and they did not disappoint aside from Tesla (TSLA). Furthermore, the artificial intelligence (AI) related companies reinforced the positive narrative surrounding the technology. With earnings season nearing completion, all eyes now shift to NVIDIA (NVDA), which is scheduled to report on August 27. Positive earnings surprises from the healthcare and communication services sectors were the most significant contributors to the improved earnings picture last week. Better-than-expected earnings from Pfizer (PFE), Eli Lilly (LLY), Amgen (AMGN), and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) were the most essential contributors, according to FactSet. Following better-than-expected data last week, sales growth of 6.3% is ahead of the 4.2% year-over-year expectation at the end of the quarter. Better sales results in the financials and healthcare sectors were the most significant drivers of the improvement in expected revenue growth last week, according to FactSet. Earnings season slows to a crawl beginning this week. While the individual reports are crucial for that stock, none are going to change the overall color of the season at this point. Friday’s retail sales numbers will be an essential check on the US consumer. The soft monthly jobs report with massive downward revisions to start the month was worrisome for the health of the economy. Since the consumer drives the US economy, retail sales will be closely watched to see if the labor market is spilling over to spending. Consumer inflation (CPI) on Tuesday will be notable as the odds of a September short-term interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve (Fed) have risen to 90% following the weaker-than-expected jobs report. Year-over-year CPI is expected to increase to 2.8% from 2.7%, but the data will be watched for signs that the Fed needs to delay any cuts to fight inflation. There is still one more monthly jobs report before the Fed’s September meeting, and barring an abnormally large inflation surge, the labor market will be the primary driver behind any rate cuts or lack thereof. In addition, markets have now fully priced in at least two rate cuts of 25 basis points (0.25%) in 2025. Newsflow about the administration’s trade negotiations and new tariff announcements will remain a market mover. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) releases its 13F filing after the close on Thursday. Warren Buffett continues to be a net seller of stocks, but this report provides the details. An analysis of Berkshire’s quarterly earnings is here. The increase in worries about the economy in the wake of a shockingly poor jobs report eased this week, with the betting odds of recession falling to the lows of the year. The falling odds of recession and another week of better-than-expected earnings sent stocks to near record highs.

Chairman and CEO Abel Avellan said, "Our revolutionary satellites and proprietary ASICs were designed with S-Band capabilities in mind. With these new spectrum priority rights, we will be in a position to bring services in S-Band to targeted markets around the world." He added that, combined with the company's existing global 3GPP spectrum holdings and planned L-Band strategy in the U.S. and Canada, the rights would allow expansion of subscriber capacity, enabling most countries to access the full AST SpaceMobile network with speeds targeted at up to 120 Mbps. The agreement, signed August 5, 2025, covers rights to MSS frequencies from 1980-2010 MHz and 2170-2200 MHz for use in low Earth orbit. These bands will be deployed globally subject to regulatory approval, complementing AST SpaceMobile's core cellular spectrum approach. The $64.5 million deal will be paid in cash or stock at the company's discretion, with $26 million due at closing and $38.5 million deferred, partly tied to performance milestones. Closing is expected in the second half of 2025, pending customary conditions. UBS Securities LLC is serving as financial advisor, with McGuireWoods LLP providing legal counsel.

This is a very special episode for me, one I’ve been looking forward to publishing for months. It features a behind-the-scenes look at my latest creative project, my new game COYOTE.

It’s been a hit with 100+ test families, my friends, and at conferences around the world. It now produces guaranteed laughs with kids, adults, tipsy people, serious people… all who enjoy unleashing their inner trickster. If you’ve benefited from my podcast, newsletter, books, or anything at all, please grab a copy or two! It only costs $10-12 and can provide hours upon hours of fun. It takes minutes to learn and 10 minutes to play. Under the hood, it’s also designed to be a good workout for your brain. If you’ve ever wanted to learn how to get a product on the shelves of something like Walmart or Target, or simply create a game, this podcast covers it all. P.S. One last thing: read to the end for a very fun surprise that involves a mystery Hollywood party.

This is another episode of The Tim Ferriss Show. I’m Tim Ferriss and I’m sitting with a friend of mine who I brought to my podcast with a secret agenda that has ended up two years later with a very, very not-so-secret-for-long outcome that we’re going to talk about, Elan Lee. Elan Lee: Thanks. Tim Ferriss: Nice to see you again. Elan Lee: It’s nice to see you too. That was a secret agenda. That was a two-year-in-the-making secret agenda. Tim Ferriss: Two years in the making. So what we’re going to do in this conversation, and I just hijacked his bio because I’ve had too much caffeine, so I’m going to let him do the self-intro in a second. But we’re going to give you a peek behind the curtain, under the hood, open the kimono, choose your metaphor. We’re going to talk about the creative process, the development process, thinking about distribution, retail, all of these things which I have not heard discussed anywhere else in depth. Elan Lee: You buried the lead. All of that stuff of — Tim Ferriss: Of a game that we created that from the very beginning was something I’ve wanted to do my whole life, which is create a game. I was raised, protected in some ways by Dungeons & Dragons as a kid. It was my refuge from bullying and also just the straight boredom of most of my schooling at the time. And that immersive experience, the ability to get lost in a world of imagination and fun and laughter and emotion was so incredibly important. It was so formative for me that the seed was planted really early. And I think you know this because I probably sent you a photograph of this at one point. I still have all of my modules. I have The Player’s Handbook, First Edition, Dungeon Master’s Guide, all of the dice, everything from when I was a kid. I’ve kept it to this day. Elan Lee: I love this, I love this. But hold on. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: If you’re not going to say it, I’m going to say it. Tim Ferriss made a game. Tim Ferriss: I did. Elan Lee: That’s amazing. Tim Ferriss: It took me 47 years, but here we are. So the game, I’ll just show it to camera for people who want a visual who are not watching this. If you’re listening, you can go to tim.blog/coyote. So I’m giving a bit of what you might call foreshadowing in the biz. But this is the game. It is a card game. It’s called Coyote. That name did not come easily. We went through about 537 different names and lots of testing and we’ll talk about some of that. But this is the game and it’s effectively, I’d like to hear your pitch because we have slightly different approaches, but I would say it is rock-paper-scissors on steroids. So there are God knows how many, maybe 20 different gestures, something like that, 66 total cards. And you can play cooperatively where you’re all trying to beat the game together or competitively where you can sabotage individual players, throw curveballs of all different types, and that relates to the name Coyote, if you think about the trickster mythology associated with Coyote. Elan Lee: Yeah Tim Ferriss: We never got to your bio. Who the hell are you? Elan Lee: Oh, that’s the least interesting part of this whole thing. Tim Ferriss: No, I know, but it puts it in perspective and just explain the company a bit, the scope of it, et cetera Elan Lee: I love talking about games, I hate talking about myself. So I will try. Tim Ferriss: That’s why it takes someone like me to force you to do it. Elan Lee: Yeah. Okay, here we go. My name is Elan Lee. I am the co-creator and CEO of Exploding Kittens. I believe we’re the number one independent game studio in the world, something like that. I don’t know. We’ve sold a whole bunch of games. We’ve sold 60 million games at this point and been running that company for 10 years now. And before that I was the chief design officer at the Xbox and before that I worked at a pet store. Tim Ferriss: And for people who want the full journey, including the sort of magical tinderbox that was Kickstarter way back in the day, how this whole adventure started 10 plus years ago, listen to the first conversation that I did with Elan. I had wanted to make a game and quickly realized that an RPG, something like Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game, was going to be too complicated for me and my friends as adults to play. It would be too hard for me to recruit my friends where you have, let’s just say, a full day, then you have dinner, maybe you have a few drinks, and then you have an hour before people split. There’s no way I’m going to get someone to build, for instance, a chaotic good gray elf, which was my orientation, and work from there. It’s just not going to happen. And meanwhile, about maybe it was a year or two years before I invited you on the podcast, I found this game Poetry for Neanderthals and holy shit, had so much fun with that with my friends. I thought, “Okay, I think I want to tilt my game dreams,” which at that point had no real direction, “towards something more casual.” But in the meantime, I’d also been listening to all sorts of podcasts and so on that we’ll get to. But you’ve explained your background. Elan Lee: Well, hold on. So what you just described is exactly why I started Exploding Kittens, because I also — okay, a little bit different. Unlike you, I, when I encounter those crazy two and four and six-hour games, I am immediately turned off. I can’t focus for that long. I can’t understand the rules. If it takes longer than five minutes to explain a game, I am gone. I have no ability to play that game. And so the whole reason I started this company, and I think the whole reason that you made the pivot from giant role-playing games to being interested in the creation of casual fast-party games is this golden rule of two minutes to learn, 15 minutes to play because nothing’s at stake there, right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: You’re going to learn it. You’re either going to love the game or you’re going to hate it, but whatever, you committed five minutes total to that thing. And I love the games where after the five-minute commitment, you’re still going to play for two hours. But they’re going to be in these little five-minute sessions over and over and over again. And it sounds like that’s the experience you had, which makes me so happy because that means mission accomplished. That’s exactly what I wanted to build. Tim Ferriss: And we’re going to talk about different rules or tenets that you have because what I want to do in this conversation, we’re definitely going to talk about the process of building this game because I am really, really happy with it and really proud. Elan Lee: It’s so good. You should be. It’s so good. Tim Ferriss: And we’ll have a lot to talk about. But the motivation also of basically showing the cards, I’m going to use so many mixed metaphors here, is to teach people game design and explain why this has possessed such a toehold in my mind for so long. Elan Lee: Yeah. Well, you went through a journey and I’m excited looking at that journey through your eyes of, “I don’t even know what I want to build, but I know I want to build a fun experience that I would enjoy, that my friends would enjoy,” all the way through to this thing is at every Walmart and Target in North America. That journey is incredible and you got to see it for the first time. You absolutely drank from the firehose here. This was fun for me because I had to walk you through this, right? You’ve never sold a game before. So walking through the process of how you make a game and how you sell a game, it doesn’t work the way people think. So retailers have a buyer per category. So if anybody wants to sell something to a retailer, you want something in Target or Walmart or Amazon or Barnes & Noble. The way it works is you have to convince the buyer for your category to take your thing, right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: They have limited shelf space. It’s very precious real estate. So you have to convince them that your thing is better than anybody else’s thing. And twice a year they have these things called line reviews.The buyers have to buy games for next year, right? They need to put stuff on the shelf. There’s only a certain number of meetings they can physically have in a period of time because it’s usually one or two or maybe three people. So they take as many meetings as they can. It’s usually a dozen, maybe two dozen. And in those meetings — Tim Ferriss: In your case, with different game manufacturers, different studios. Elan Lee: Exactly. So they’ll take a meeting with Hasbro and they’ll take a meeting with Mattel and all the big guys. And in those meetings, 20, 30, 50 games are pitched to them in every single one of those meetings. And then they’ll make a decision on which ones they’re going to purchase and stock for the next year. So that’s line review. The tricky parts for line review is one, you got to do a great job, but even before that, you got to get that meeting, right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: They only have time for a certain number of meetings. So you have to put yourself in a position where you can get in that room. Tim Ferriss: All right, so we’re going to talk strategy and tactics for line review in a minute because, and take this as a compliment, you are one of the best in-person salespeople I’ve ever seen. Elan Lee: That could also be an insult, but I’ll take it, I’ll take it. Tim Ferriss: No, it’s not an insult. No, no, it’s not an insult. Everybody’s in sales, whether they like to admit it or not, whether you’re selling ideas, you’re selling a position, a perspective, if you want to call it deal making. This is what I used to say in my class, my guest lecture that I taught for 10 years, once or twice a year in high-tech entrepreneurship. I would start off by saying, “Who here wants to be in sales?” No hands would go up and I would say, “Well, I’ve got some good news and I’ve got some bad news. Bad news is you’re all in sales. And let me explain why. If you want to call it deal making, fine, you’re going to have to negotiate. You don’t get what you deserve. You get what you negotiate.” Elan Lee: That’s well said. Tim Ferriss: “And you get what you can present in a very persuasive way.” I was like, “The good news is you can learn it.” Elan Lee: Awesome. Tim Ferriss: This is a coachable, learnable skill, which I completely still believe. There’s some people who may have a little bit of extraversion, charismatic reality, distortion, field advantage, but you can become excellent even if you start with zero raw materials. Okay, so the journey, wanted to make a game my whole life, but it was this vague, “Maybe someday. God, wouldn’t it be nice?” Elan Lee: Let me just poke at that for a second. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, sure. Elan Lee: Why? Tim Ferriss: The why is I wanted to imbue someone else’s experience with the magic I felt playing D&D. Elan Lee: Well said. Tim Ferriss: That’s it. Or much easier games, right? It’s such a simple game. I used to play Sorry and Monopoly. And as a young kid, I just thought Sorry was the most hilarious thing when you could look someone in the eyes and go, “Sorry,” and knock their stuff off the board. I didn’t always respond well when it happened to me. It doesn’t have to be the incredibly immersive, complex game that D&D is, although I still think that is just like Gary Gygax and the team way back in the day, holy cow. Also, by the way, for people who don’t know, Gen Con, huge convention, started out around Lake Geneva and was, I believe, created by the TSR guys way back in the day. Elan Lee: I believe that’s right. Yeah. Yeah, Gen Con from Lake Geneva and then was the Generals Convention, and now is nothing. Now Gen Con doesn’t stand for anything because it’s in Indianapolis. But anyway, sorry. It was an aside. Tim Ferriss: It’s an aside. So that was the kind of impetus behind wanting to make a game, but it didn’t have any form. And then I suppose it was maybe two and a half, three years ago, I was like, “Okay, I’d like to actually take a deeper dive here.” Because there are lots of things we have on our, say, list of New Year’s resolutions. For instance, for a long time I had “Develop the side splits like Jean-Claude Van Damme.” Never happened, but it was there every fucking year and it just got punted. I was like, “Well, didn’t do it. Okay, this year is the year.” But there was no plan, there were no deadlines, there were no constraints, which is the power of constraints, which we’ll probably talk about. Elan Lee: Absolutely, yes. Tim Ferriss: It is so critical. It’s not just critical. It is additive to have constraints, which seems like a contradiction, but it’s not. Well, we’ll, I’m sure, get to that. So I started looking at different options and the catalyst for this actually was something way back in the day, some of you will remember called The Legend of CØCKPUNCH, and that was an NFT project — remember those? Which raised two million bucks for fundamental science and mechanistic studies basically related to mental health. So all the proceeds from that, if you want to look it up, it’s easy to find Legend of CØCKPUNCH. But all the proceeds went to a nonprofit foundation, which then funds mental health, therapeutic research and things related to that. But in the process of doing that, I got to, with very low stakes because I think it’s helpful when possible, especially if you’re an intrepid beginner wading into unfamiliar creative waters, make the stakes super, super low, right? And even before this podcast, it’s like, “Okay, this is a very unusual conversation where it’s like, “Look, we’re not doing this live. If we really don’t like it, we can scrap the whole thing.” So reduce, reduce, reduce the pressure and the stakes until you can get started, right? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: With writing, I got the advice long ago, two crappy pages per day. That’s it. Elan Lee: Love it. Tim Ferriss: And then you actually put pen to paper. Elan Lee: Yeah, the overlaps are enormous with games. But, yeah, yeah. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah. Super related. Also the iterative process. All right, so using The Legend of CØCKPUNCH as this pretext, basically I started writing fiction and so I wrote these very, very, it turned out to be very involved, very viable fantasy histories and pieces, tying all of these greater houses together and then having these protagonists, the father and then the son, who’s Tyrolean, and yada, yada, yada, yada. And I still think there might be something there, but in the process of creating that, I thought to myself, “This would actually make a fantastic game. And it wouldn’t have to be as complicated as D&D, but you would have allies, you would have age old amenities, would have different strengths, certain strengths that cancel out other strengths, weaknesses that can be taken advantage of.” And that led me to start listening to a podcast called Think Like a Game Designer with Justin Gary, which is outstanding. I recommend people check it out. And a lot of the focus there, not entirely, but a lot of the focus there was on trading card games, alternately called collectible card games, I guess. Wizards of the Coast who created Magic: The Gathering, patented and trademarked one of them. So they seem to be used interchangeably. But Justin, also former high-level competitive Magic: The Gathering player, has a lot of knowledge around that world. He’s developed some incredibly successful games in that genre where you’re building a deck, you’re buying certain cards or decks with the hopes of getting certain cards and assembling your toolkit basically. And that was initially where my mind went in terms of game concept. But I realized a few things really quickly. I was a D&D guy, which predated Magic: The Gathering. My brother was a Magic: The Gathering guy. But I’ve never really played Magic. And when I began to delve into it, I was like, “You know what? I would like to think of this as D&D light, but this is incredibly nuanced.” Right? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: To be good at this — Elan Lee: Oh, for sure, yeah. Tim Ferriss: — it is incredibly nuanced. And also if you’re against someone who is really experienced or just has their mind wired for it, you are going to be obliterated. Elan Lee: Absolutely right. Tim Ferriss: And that’s what happened to me playing a friend of mine, kudos to Mike, just got slayed. And God bless Mike, he’s like a number of my friends who just kind of want to watch you die slowly in this agonizing ill-fated gameplay where you’re kind of whimpering along until they put you out of your misery. Elan Lee: Yeah, yeah, you play a card, he said, “Isn’t this cute? You think you’ve got it. Watch this.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Which is just not really my thing. So I thought to myself, okay, looking at some of the casual games I really like, there is an opportunity, and this will come back later, for the underdog or the person who is behind to win. So there’s an element, it is skill-based, but there’s an element of chance and this is going to come back. So then Poetry for Neanderthals, I don’t know how I found it initially, frankly. I think I probably went into a game shop and I was like, “Hey,” and this relates to why, as an adult, I want to spend less time in front of screens and ultimately if I look back and do this thing every year called a past year review, people can find it online, you can read all about it and do it yourself. You don’t have to buy anything, past year review. Where I look at the peak positive and negative emotional experiences of the past year, I go through my whole calendar. Sometimes I’ll go through my photos, sometimes I’ll go through my text messages or my sent folder in the inbox. And lo and behold, and this is not a revelation for some people, but the activities did not matter as much as the people. So then the question is, how do I create different contexts for interacting with, let’s just say, my 10 or 15 closest friends? Some of that is doing things outside in the wilderness that are active and so on. But that’s a heavy lift, that’s a heavier lift than — Elan Lee: A high barrier of entry. Tim Ferriss: — playing a casual game, right? So it’s like if I’m here in Austin, where we are right now, and my friends or a bunch of my friends come in for South by Southwest and I manage to get them together for one night, what can we play that will get us off of our goddamn phones and deepen our relationship and create memories that we can hold onto that will stick around? That’s it. That’s it, right? Elan Lee: So good. Tim Ferriss: And then we had our conversation and that’s kind of when everything, I guess, kicked off. Just a couple of things maybe that we should mention also. After our conversation when, I think, very shyly I must have reached out to you at some point shortly thereafter, and I was kind of like, “Hey, guy, not sure if this would be interesting, but maybe kind of sort, do you want to talk about maybe making a game together or something?” Elan Lee: I remember this exact conversation. It’s like asking me out on a first date. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah, yeah, like scratching my head looking at the ground. And that’s how the whole thing got kicked off. And I want to mention something related to that, which was for the last probably three years, my New Year’s resolutions have been very — they’re very broad, but they’re pretty specific. So I had two. One is doing more delegation, which is figure it out delegation. So what that means is rather than doing what I’m hardwired to do with my OCD and perfectionism, which is, “Here, go do this thing. Let me give you a 20-page installation manual explaining exactly what to do,” versus, “Here’s roughly what I want done. Just figure it out and get it done. I don’t want to make any decisions, So don’t come back to me with 12 options. Just make the best you can.” And I’ll expect Reid Hoffman also, LinkedIn has mentioned this sort of a 10 percent footfall rate, like 10 percent of the time something’s going to go sideways and that’s fine in the interest of reducing decision fatigue and making things faster. So one was more figure it out delegation and number two was sprints with creatives. And for me what that meant as someone who has operated as a lone wolf, which by the way is a contradiction in terms, but who has been a solo operator for most of my creative projects, I was like, “You know what? It just isn’t that fun anymore to do it solo.” And it’s also antithetical to some of the creative projects I want to pursue like a game. I mean, there are some amazing solo game designers. Not to say there aren’t, but I was like, “You know what? I want to try to be more social in my creativity and collaborate with creatives and do sprints.” Now, sometimes those sprints turn into longer things, but those have been sort of my two guiding lights for the last few years, which is what then gave me the ability to build up the courage. It sounds so ridiculous to say, but to actually reach out to you and be like, “Hey, do you want to actually just bat around the possibility of something?” Elan Lee: So from my perspective, that conversation, I got very excited to work with you on something, one, because it turns out you’re just a lovely human being and so much fun to hang out with. Tim Ferriss: Thank you. Elan Lee: But two, I asked you that very fundamental question. You said, “Hey, do you want to build a game?” And I said, “Why do you want to build a game?” And your answer was almost identical to what you just related. You talked about your past experiences, you talked about childhood memories of games, you talked about what you like and what you don’t like. And what became very clear to me was there’s something special going on here. Tim wants to treat his friends and his audience to something extraordinary. And we get approached all the time by people who want to make games, big celebrities and singers and actors, all of them want to make a game. And whenever I ask them the question “Why?” the answer is invariably, “Because my agent told me to,” or, “Because I think I can make money,” or really very superficial. Often they’re not game players at all. They have no connection to the experience of game design. And when I spoke to you, none of that was present. Instead it was, “This is a very personal thing to me, and ultimately I want to give a gift.” And that’s when my brain started lighting up. It’s like, “Oh, this is going to be fun. He’s in this for all the reasons I’m in this and that means we can make something very special together.” And I think we have. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah, we definitely have. And another question that is sometimes a little tricky to apply, but that has been in my mind for a while, since Seth Godin, very well-known author, thinker, just incredibly sage and awesome human being. He reframed for me, which is the reframing of the question, “What would you do if you knew you couldn’t fail?” Right? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: That’s a good question. Like what would you do if you knew you couldn’t fail? All right, that’s freeing. But the way he tweaks that is he said, “What would you do if you knew you would fail?” In other words, like, what would you do for which the process alone would make it worth it? And for me, because I mean, we became fast friends very quickly, and I was like, “Okay, that’s rare for me as an adult, number one.” And I’ve been banging this around in my own little head for so long. Even if this ends up not making the cut for whatever reason, this seems worth it to me, right? Elan Lee: Yeah, yeah. Tim Ferriss: Because coming back to the people over activities also, I was like, “Love hanging out with Elan and connecting. I am going to learn a lot.” And at the very worst, I learn a lot and we’ve deepened our relationship. And that stuff just snowballs over time. It transcends a single project. So even if this had not manifested, it would’ve been worth it and that’s how I try to pick my projects these days. Elan Lee: So when we first started down this path together, I remember I came out, we sort of visited each other back and forth a few times. And I remember every time I would pack a suitcase full of games and we would sit with some of your friends and we’d play games all night long and you’d say, “I like this one. I don’t like this one. I like this part.” But ultimately, we weren’t making any progress. We were just learning vocabulary, essentially. And I would go home and my wife would be like, “How’d it go? What did you learn? Are you going to make a game together?” And I’d be like, “I don’t know. No, we just hung out and had fun.” And she’d be like, “Wasn’t that a huge disappointment? You traveled 2,000 miles to go see him?” I’m like, “No, it was just fun. Nah, I’m not disappointed at all. We’ll just do it again next month and we’ll see how it goes.” And we did that five or six times. And I remember walking away from each one just thinking, same thing, “If this goes nowhere, I’m having so much fun.” That’s so rare. Tim Ferriss: It is rare. And if you can orient your life or professional life, and look, I’m not saying this is possible for everyone, but it’s to some extent more possible than people realize. You might not be able to run out and invite Elan on your podcast and then awkwardly approach him like a sheepish 12-year-old boy to ask him on a date. But taking the lens of picking projects based on creating or deepening relationships and learning/developing skills, if you just do that over time, it is almost inevitable that you will win, whatever winning means to you. Elan Lee: Yeah, value the process, yeah. Tim Ferriss: So let’s talk a little bit about the origin story. Now, I’ll throw out a couple of things here and we’re going to talk about the game development, and then we’re also going to talk about how to sell this thing. How does that work? Elan Lee: And it’s worth saying, designing a game, I remember you asked me this early on. You started out from the, “Hey, let’s design a game,” and then we’re basically done. And I remember really forcing myself to think through this process because I wanted to explain it to you. “No, that’s half of it. The other half is selling the game. And just as much work goes into that. And if you’re not willing to do it or if you have no mechanism by which you can do it, might as well not design the game because one without the other, useless.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yeah. So it depends on the scale you’re going after, right? If you want to make something for your friends, you can do that. Elan Lee: Sure, Yeah, okay. Fair enough. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: But in this particular case, I mean — Elan Lee: You wanted to make something cool and share it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I wanted to share. I wanted to share it. So that kind of dictated parts of the process that we needed to weigh really heavily. So the game development process, I mean, we started off looking at the possibilities of modifying existing games, right? So looking at, say, Poetry for Neanderthals — Elan Lee: Poetry, yeah. Tim Ferriss: — with an alternate set of rules or a different deck plus A, B, or C. We looked at prototype games that you alluded to earlier, bringing the suitcase, right? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So we did that all over the country. Elan Lee: Yeah, I showed up, I remember. So I have this notebook of game ideas three, 400 in there, and I add more every month. And I remember I picked my favorites, like five or six of them, and I would show up with just the jankiest prototypes. Like, “Here’s something I scribbled on a few cards.” I took some dice and I rubbed out the little nubs on the dice and hand wrote something on all the die faces. “Instead, let’s try playing this weird game.” And you were very patient and you had a lot of vision, thankfully, to look at these just horrible, very hastily created prototypes and say, not, “This is no fun, let’s move on.” But you would always say, “Oh, I like this. I like the — that moment where we had a conversation about what you were going to do next. I like that part. I didn’t like the rest of it, but I like that part.” And that astute sense of notes, really thoughtful and forward moving notes was ultimately what guided our conversation. Because then the next time, I don’t have to pick from 400 games to bring. Now I know, “Okay, this cooperative thing, he liked that conversation aspect. There’s only six games I’ve got like that. Let me bring those six and we’ll refine it even farther.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah, totally. So we can talk about the Toronto trip. The Toronto project. Elan Lee: Mm-hmm. Tim Ferriss: That is where things started to gel. Because we’d had a number of these meetings around the country where we would do a one to three day sprint of testing, take all these notes and we’d done a few of these and we’ve both got a lot going on and your wife would ask you how it went and you’re like, “Well, I’m not really sure. I think we had fun, but no game as of yet.” And so we scheduled time. I was going to fly to Toronto to do a sprint. You were going to bring in an expert game designer, sort of game mechanic specialist — Elan Lee: Ken Gruhl, yeah. Tim Ferriss: — Ken. And it was like, “Okay, this is the trip. If we make it happen, great. If not, we’re just going to call spade a spade.” Elan Lee: Yeah. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: We were circling around this thing but not really getting it done. Elan Lee: It was like meeting number eight or nine at that point. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yeah, we tried a lot. And it was during that trip that the very primitive sort of germ of an idea started to resonate, which ended up being Coyote. And I remember a few things, and thank God also for Ken’s apparent photographic memory with the way things transpired, but we’re walking around all over the place in Toronto, the three of us, just spitballing. Then it starts to rain and we seek shelter. We failed twice, I think, with various coffee shops. Elan Lee: Yeah, can’t get in. Tim Ferriss: No room, no seats, whatever it might be. End up sitting in this weird kind of multipurpose building. And I remember where we were sitting and we played, I guess in English it’s Hanabi. Elan Lee: Hanabi. Tim Ferriss: Hanabi, which is Hanabi in Japanese, which is fireworks. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And hana’s flower. Bi in this case is fire. So it’s like flower fire. That’s Hanabi. Elan Lee: For everybody out there, if you haven’t played Hanabi, go try this game. It is very special. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So we played that game, kind of killing time, giving it a shot, because you guys had mentioned it. And I was like, “Okay, this is a very elegant game.” And from that, liked the cooperative aspect. So when people think game, I think most folks are more familiar, maybe exclusively familiar, with the sort of winner-takes-all or team-versus-team competitive type of game. But I really enjoyed, and I’d seen this in other ways in different capacities, but the cooperative option and the cooperative aspect of this. So that then gets stuck in the mind and the rain clears up. We go for a walk by the water. And I remember we were sort of — well, I’ll own it, I was kind of stalled. I’ll be the kind of hair plugging the drain in the bathtub. Because I was trying to search my mind for game examples. But I was thinking tabletop games because that was the canvas we were painting upon. And we’re walking, we’re walking. We’ve had quite a bit of caffeine by this point and it was either you or Ken, I think it was you, who asked, “Well, just broadly speaking, any kind of game, what games have you really enjoyed?” And that’s where Rock, Paper, Scissors came up, right? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Rochambeau. And I just — as dumb as it might sound, and I said this at the time, I was like, “I love Rock, Paper, Scissors.” Especially when you play over an extended period of time with friends, maybe there’s some alcohol involved or not, you don’t need to have it involved. But you start to pick up tells, you start to pick up patterns, and it’s actually very, very fun. Elan Lee: So it’s important to note, the moment you bring up Rock, Paper, Scissors in any game design discussion, that’s usually the end of the conversation, right? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: Because there’s nothing to that game. There’s three tools, deploy a tool, determine a winner, you’re done. It is only when you say, “Let’s acknowledge Rock, Paper, Scissors is no fun unless you play multiple times.” Because now we’ve made a very important transition. We’re not playing the game anymore, we’re playing each other. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: Right? Because I know what you did last time. You think I’m going to throw scissors again. And now we’re playing each other. Yes, rock, paper, scissors are the tools by which we’re playing each other, but suddenly we’re playing a very different game and it starts — it cannot start in round one. It starts in round two and it moves forward from there. And once we started having that discussion, things started to get really interesting. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, things got interesting. And do you want to show the prototype deck? Elan Lee: Yeah, I’ll show. Tim Ferriss: And part of the reason I want to show this prototype deck, and we’ll describe it for people who aren’t watching, is quick and dirty is the fucking way to go. And I will just make another recommendation for Stephen Key. So Stephen Key has a book called the One Simple Idea, which is about licensing and creating inventions. He’s got a number of books now. But Stephen has made a gajillion dollars creating games for all the biggies that you can possibly think of. And he uses construction paper and glue you would find in a second grade class and a handful of markers. Elan Lee: Love it. This is already my — Tim Ferriss: And this is by and large, that is how he creates these amazing — now, when I say — they can be games, they can be toys. He’s pretty broad spectrum. But it might be a new way to play basketball, shooting dirty laundry into a hamper, right? Elan Lee: Mm-hmm. Tim Ferriss: Something like that. And he prototypes these things incredibly quickly. And for him, for what he does, that is enough. He is able to put together a pitch, he’s able to sell it and he’s able to develop these amazing passive income streams with these annuities that just come in — Elan Lee: So good. Tim Ferriss: — from all these different places. But that relates to what we’re looking at. Elan Lee: Okay. I love that we have not even described what Coyote is yet. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yeah. Elan Lee: But that’s okay because it’s more fun I think, to walk — I think the value of this conversation is to actually talk through the creative process and talk through — I think a lot of people want to make games, this is how you do it. And we went through this two-year journey and we arrived at a very happy outcome. So I’m excited to talk about, “Well, let me show you the very ugly, very first deck we ever built.” So we had this conversation about Rock, Paper, Scissors, and I knew there was something there because we were talking about players playing — my fundamental premise behind all game design is games should not be entertaining. Games should make the players entertaining. And suddenly, when you said, “Rock, Paper, Scissors over time,” I was like, “Oh, that’s perfect.” But three tools, rock, paper and scissors, not a very robust tool set. We can’t really play a game that way. So I ran home and started scribbling on cards. These are just blank cards. I took Sharpies, I buy these by the thousands on Amazon. So I had a ton of these and we just started scribbling. And so we made a card that says rock, and we made a card that says paper, and we made a card that says scissors. And we thought, “What if we’re all on the same team? But what if these cards here are not tools to fight with each other? What if these are a challenge that we have to all solve together?” And so we started just putting down a bunch of things, rock, paper, scissors, rock, rock, paper. And we’re like, “All right, we’ll sit around the table and we’ll all just do this pattern. Everyone do scissors. Now everyone do paper. Now everyone do rock.” Tim Ferriss: And we’d been talking about these different variations and ideas on the walk and then we ended up back at your dining room table — Elan Lee: Yeah, that’s right. Tim Ferriss: — with tons — Elan Lee: Seriously scribbling. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, scribbling and modifying cards as we went. Elan Lee: Yeah, exactly. So now the modifiers are really the most interesting thing. Because the game that I’m describing right now is useless. Right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: We can all do scissors and then all do paper. Who cares, right? There’s nothing here. But now we have a baseline. We’re all going to do this thing. Cool, easy. And then we started doing these modifiers, all players do all blue cards. Right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: So we start scribbling rock, paper, scissors in different colors, and then we’ve got this modifier. So now everyone’s going to — sorry, I’m going to do scissors, but then we’re all going to do paper and then back to you just doing rock, and things like that. And so then it was like, “Okay, well, skip a player after every red card. Okay, shout every blue card,” right? Then we just started writing all these crazy modifiers. I’m just putting all these cards all over the table because the challenge got more and more interesting. And then it was like, “Okay, so something interesting is possible here. Now what if instead of just splashing cards all over the paper, what if we were responsible for this? What if one at a time everyone had to add a new card to the table to make this challenge harder and harder and harder?” And that’s when we started talking about the vocabulary of this game. What are these cards? What makes this thing harder? Rock and paper and scissors very quickly got eliminated from the game because they’re so boring. So we started talking about, “Well, okay, what if you’re making a peace sign?” And then you came up with, “Well, what if you pose a ballerina on a card? And what if you slap the shoulder or the person next to you on a card? And what if you have to — ” I remember one of our earliest notes was, “Eliminate all shouting cards,” because that was no fun at all. Tim Ferriss: We tested that. And then that got all old real quick. Elan Lee: Right, exactly. Tim Ferriss: And also as we’re play testing, right? As we’re inventing mechanics and testing different things. So we play for a few rounds being like, “Okay, that was okay, but what do you guys think of this?” “Okay, we like this aspect.” “Great, let’s make four more of those cards of different colors.” And then we played again. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And then we played again. And then we’d iterate and we played again. Elan Lee: That’s right. Tim Ferriss: And we ended up with, I mean, spreadsheets full of different cards. And this is all still now in cooperative mode at that point. Elan Lee: All in cooperative mode. Tim Ferriss: And — Elan Lee: But over the next week, I would say we designed 80 percent of the game. We were at this stalled-at-one-percent mode for months. And then in a matter of days, 80 percent done. Because we found this every time we played some version of this, the immediate answer when we were done playing was, “Let’s go again.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So is that the litmus test for you? Elan Lee: For sure. Tim Ferriss: I mean in terms of the indicators that something is worth further development, right? Elan Lee: Yeah,. Tim Ferriss: Because you have 400 in your notebook and so you’re not going to develop all of those. What are some of the — could be a water feel that you have, but what are some of the indicators where you’re like, “Oh, okay.” Elan Lee: So there’s two things to talk about here. Certainly “Let’s play again” is a great one, but to set your mind in a place where you’re willing to say, “Imagine this, but tweaked, but something a little different.” There’s this principle I love called the zero effect. Zero effect. Tim Ferriss: Zero effect? Elan Lee: Yeah, zero effect. It’s from a movie, I think, in the late ’80s, early ’90s, somewhere around there called Zero Effect. And there’s this one scene where they explain what the zero effect is. And it is as follows, if you’ve lost your car keys and you’re looking for your car keys, here you are in your living room, you’re looking for car keys, the chances of you finding your car keys are very low because there’s so many things in this room that are not your car keys. So your chances of finding that one thing very, very low. If instead you are trying to find anything, your chances of success are suddenly at a hundred percent. You will find something, as long as you don’t care what it is that you found. That’s my favorite premise for brainstorming and for early testing. Don’t lock in your head, “I’m looking for this particular thing. I must find X. I must find X.” Because the chances that you’re going to find that thing are almost non-existent. But if you can keep your brain open and say, “I’m just looking for something. I don’t care what it is, something, anything, and I’ll tweak it later, I’ll play with it later. I’ll find some way to consider this thing I found my car keys.” As long as you’re willing to make that leap, brainstorming becomes a pleasure. Tim Ferriss: And does that take the form of, “What if, blah?” “What if we blah?” “What if this card did blah?” Elan Lee: Precisely. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Is it a series of what ifs? Elan Lee: And you’re not scared for all of those to fail, right? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: Because you can come up with those all day long. And that’s what we did, right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: Over the next few days, that process, “What if, blah. Let’s try it. What if, blah, let’s try it. What if, whatever, let’s try it.” And as long as the answer is always, “Let’s try it,” you will a hundred percent find what you’re looking for. Tim Ferriss: All right, so let’s make some recommendations for people listening or watching. What books or resources would you recommend for people who are interested in game development? Now, I want to reiterate also, whether you think you’re playing games or not, you’re already playing games in life. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So for me, this is a way of putting on a table what we’ve already implicitly agreed to in our own lives in ways that we generally don’t realize, which is we’re all playing games. Now what does that mean? That means that beyond Maslow’s basic rungs on the ladder, shelter, warmth, food, et cetera, at some point, particularly as adults, maybe it’s before you go to school, maybe it’s when you’re in college, but you have decided to play or you have just ended up drafting into a game with certain rules, certain conditions for winning or losing certain ranking mechanisms. And step number one is figuring out what games you’re playing. Elan Lee: Mm-hmm. Tim Ferriss: Okay. So I would suggest that learning about building games helps you to put on x-ray vision glasses, where you start to see the world is comprised of tons of games. Elan Lee: Yeah, it’s so true. And you start to dive deeper into game theory. What is the prisoner’s dilemma? What is a zero sum game? If you can start to identify those very fundamental game design concepts in the real world, you can jump to the end of a conversation so much faster. You can avoid so many missteps because everything follows, within reason, everything follows game design principles because this practice, this art form has been so well studied and so well researched and so well documented that you get to take advantage of all of that. And I love that. I use that for my relationships. I use that as playing with my kids. I use that at work all the time. It’s just there’s these fundamental principles of game design. And I’ll talk about a book I’d love that illustrates them. But, yeah, they can be applied to anything. You’re right, you’re playing a game all the time. And the first step is to be aware that you are playing a game. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: All right, so I’ve got two books. Tim Ferriss: Let’s hear it. Elan Lee: One is, let’s see, A Theory of Fun by Raph Koster. Raph Koster? Raph Koster? R-A-P-H, Raph. It’ll outline all these fundamentals. It is the first game design book I ever read. It is the one I go back to and refer to the most often. It’s just got everything and the author is brilliant and go read that book. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: The second one is going to be a little controversial. Tim Ferriss: Memoirs of a Geisha? Elan Lee: It’s called Don’t Shoot the Dog. Tim Ferriss: Oh, this is an exceptional book. Elan Lee: Exceptional book. It is by Karen Pryor. Tim Ferriss: It is not explicitly about game design, at all. Elan Lee: It is not at all about game design. But here’s the thing, this book, the fundamental premise of this book is you are trying to teach a companion, a dog, to behave in a certain way. And the answer to how best to do that is not to, when things go wrong at least, not to blame the dog, is to fundamentally change the way you operate and the way you convey information and the way you look at the world in order to better relate to your dog and to the way that the dog understands and sees the world. It is the best game design principle I have ever encountered in my life. And true, it has nothing to do with game design, but when you’re designing a game, you’re designing it for a target, for someone who isn’t you and you’re not even going to be in the room when they encounter it. And to have in your brain from the very first step, “Every problem that comes up is my problem, not theirs. Every responsibility is my responsibility, not theirs.” And if you can get that in your head and design games that way, those are the games I have found that are the most successful. Tim Ferriss: This is Don’t Shoot the Dog, terrible title, but it is the fundamental starting point that I recommend to anyone who’s interested in dog training. And Karen Pryor is one of the popularizers of clicker training as a way of shaping behavior. I believe she had experience with marine mammals, which by the way, you can’t whack on the butt with a newspaper to punish them, so in other words, negative reinforcement. So how do you do it? You use positive reinforcement. You use clickers or whistles or different tools. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And I believe the back of the book, people will be able to fact-check this, but it basically says whether you want to get your dog to heel, your cat to stop laying on the kitchen table, or your mother-in-law to stop nagging you, the principles are all the same. And at the end of it, like you said, is this radical ownership of “It may not be your fault, but it is your responsibility.” Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: And in a lot of cases, certainly with game design and instructions and so on, it is actually your fault. If people are confused, it is your fault. Elan Lee: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, no, but it’s the best way. Before I started Exploding Kittens, I designed games for friends and I just had the hardest time. When I wasn’t in the room, people were not enjoying those games. And it was only once I read that book that I realized the fault is absolutely mine. Because I’m trying to get them to have as much fun as I want them to have and the fact that they’re not, I keep blaming them. And that’s so wrong. Tim Ferriss: So what did you do? How did you fix that? Elan Lee: There’s basically two parts. One starts with design. One says the game has to be so simple that it is almost self-correcting. And I have to strip out all complication, I have to remove all nuance. Any time I’m thinking of the rules and I say, “Okay, if this happens, then this happens, except if — ” The moment I say “except,” I’ve gone down a wrong path. I need to get rid of all of that stuff. That was the first part. And then the second part is in writing the actual instructions and figuring out how — if I’m sitting in the room, you’re going to get this game because I’m going to explain it and I’m going to be enthusiastic. And when you ask a question, I’m going to answer the question. And when you get confused, I’m going to clarify it. I can a hundred percent do that. But a piece of paper trying to do that same thing, I have to write it as if I’m in the room and I have to anticipate those questions and I have to cut them off before they come up and I have to correct behavior because I know exactly where you’re going to go off course and fix it in the instructions. And that kind of one-two punch changed my game design from like 10 percent of the people get this to 95 percent of the people get this. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, one aspect — I mean there’s so many aspects, but one aspect of this that I enjoyed was related to the instructions. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And so number one, you make it really clear in the instructions, which we both poured over ad nauseum. But reading is the worst way to learn a game. Go watch this video, QR code. So that’s number one. But if you’re going to put it into text — and I think I’m pretty good at this, but I was very impressed with your ability to identify anything that could be misunderstood or that wasn’t yet defined or that could be taken with another more broader connotation that would steer people off course. And the number of edits in that Google Doc. Elan Lee: I mean, it’s got to be in the hundreds, right? Tim Ferriss: From all of us, hundreds and hundreds of edits. Elan Lee: So the most important skill is you will write better instructions, you will convey information to people better if you can clear your mind. If you can approach any set of instructions from the perspective of the things I know I do not yet know, and the words that come out of my mouth have to not only fill my brain with the required knowledge — Tim Ferriss: I see basically beginner’s mind, right? Elan Lee: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Putting yourself in the place of someone who has never seen this before. Elan Lee: Exactly. And it’s so hard to do because you have this information in your head. It must be there, otherwise you’re not going to be able to explain the thing. But to back all the way up and say, “I’m just going to split my brain in two. There’s this one reading script and I know the information I have to get out, but the other half is the recipient of that script and it knows nothing.” If you can do that — and it’s so hard, it takes so much practice. If you can do that, you’re going to not only be able to design good games and write good instructions, but you’re also going to be able to just converse more effectively just out in the world in general. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. All right. You mentioned I think it was two minutes to learn, 15 minutes to play. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: What other golden or guiding tenets do you have for yourself when you’re doing game design within Exploding Kittens? Elan Lee: Oh, good question. If a component does not need to be in the game, remove it from the game. Tim Ferriss: Right. So an example of that would be we had these chits or little chips, like poker chips. Elan Lee: Like bingo chips. Tim Ferriss: Like bingo chips that we were using for lives or strikes, and turns out you don’t need that. You can use — Elan Lee: Yeah, because you’ve got a whole thing of cards right here, just use those. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. You can use cards by flipping them over and using the back of the card. Elan Lee: Exactly. That’s a perfect example. Right? We have this thing where we’re like, “Hey, you know what would be fun is if everybody had a big hand of cards and we’re going to play cards and you make decisions.” I’m like, “I get that.” Most games you play, you have a hand of cards and you’re going to play a card and you’re making a decision. That’s awesome. But you know what? That’s a private moment and you reveal a card. Every game you’ve ever played. When you play UNO, you’ve got a hand of cards, you’re making a decision, you play a card, you’ve revealed what card you just played. And I remember thinking, “Is there a simpler version of that?” And it turns out there is. And the simpler version in Coyote is take some cards, put them all face up on the table, and then decide which one you’re going to pick. That’s very similar to having a deck of cards, but now it’s public. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it’s public. Elan Lee: Right? Tim Ferriss: And also when the competitive version was brought in, which is the way that I like to play, the way I would suggest people play, but you can warm up with cooperative or if you have somebody in your life or in your family who just cannot lose without creating a huge pain in the ass, then the cooperative mode is really fun. But the competitive mode then allows the group decision on which card to play potentially, although ultimately that’s individual. That has implications for cooperative when it’s public. But also for competitive. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: There are a number of tweaks made to this, but I mentioned earlier, sabotaging. So we had competitive, but different minds are wired for different games. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And so, God forbid, what happens to you is what happened to one of my employees who was play testing this, where one of the people in the group was a mathematician who also is high-level chess player if I remember correctly. Elan Lee: Oh, no. Tim Ferriss: And he just smoked everyone because he had the mind for it. Elan Lee: Yeah, of course. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So what do you do for that? Well, we ended up — and this took a lot of play testing to ultimately land on this. And I want to ask you about play testing, particularly if it’s kind of hands off the wheel and you have people playing the game without you. Elan Lee: Yeah, terrifying Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Realized — and this comes back to the underdog being able to win, not getting my ass smoked in Magic over and over again by someone who’s just got better hardwiring for it. Elan Lee: Mm-hmm. Tim Ferriss: And that’s where the attack cards came from. Right? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So there are these attack cards in the deck, which to the simplification side, you can play in cooperative mode to modify a card. I don’t want to get too in the weeds. Elan Lee: Well, I want to give you more credit for this because I don’t think you’re taking enough credit. All right, let me phrase this a different way. So the basic premise of the game is we have a whole bunch of activities on the table, right? Ballerina, peace sign, whatever it is, thumbs up, thumbs down, smile, frown. Tim Ferriss: Lean and make a fart noise. Elan Lee: Yeah, exactly, lean and make a fart noise. So we’ve got all these things that we’re all going to do. And then on top of that — Tim Ferriss: It’s a fan favorite. Elan Lee: That’s right. That’s such a good card. On top of that, we have all these modifier cards and they modify — you have to skip a player after this one, ignore this card, do this one twice. Tim Ferriss: Those are generally the Coyote cards. Elan Lee: The Coyote cards. And you had this great idea, you said, “Because some players are naturally gifted at this game, far more so than others, and because some players are going to naturally fall behind and they need a way to sabotage the first place.” If you’re in last place, you need a way to sabotage the first place player. If you’ve ever played Mario Kart, you know this feeling very well. And you said, “What if we took some of these modifiers, every time — all players have to do all the blue cards with one hand instead of two.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: But what if instead of all the blue — Tim Ferriss: Or Tyrannosaurus arms. Elan Lee: Or Tyrannosaurus arms, you have to do all your movements with Tyrannosaurus arms. What if instead of playing that on all blue cards on the table, what if you just put that, slide it right in front of another player and now only they have to do it? For every single one of their turns. You’ve put a curse on them. The last place player has attacked the first place player. And I remember thinking, “Tim, you’re like a natural game designer.” That’s such a nice moment and it’s such an easy modification. And of course my answer was, “I don’t know, let’s try it.” And then we tried it and it was glorious. And I love moments like that for two reasons. One is because you had learned at that point to speak like a game designer. Right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: Instead of saying, “I think we just need to sabotage people,” instead you said, “Some people are really good at this game. We have to address that. Some people are naturally bad at this game. We need to give them a tool.” And those terms, speaking in that language, armed with that vocabulary, suddenly the answer to you became so clear, like, “Here’s how we solve those problems.” That’s great. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: I guarantee you would not have been capable of that when we started this process. Tim Ferriss: No way. Yeah, no, I wouldn’t have had the — sometimes artists talk about the visual library, just the exposure to different types of artwork, different forms, different silhouettes, different structures so that they can pull from that visual library to inform whatever they’re trying to build or solve for. And it’s the same with game design, same with everything. You need to build your ABCs so you can convey what you’re trying to say in terms that are solvable, if that makes any sense. Elan Lee: Yeah. Totally. You’re a quick study too. Tim Ferriss: Helped getting the books that you recommended. All right, so I’m not going to dox my friend in question. But as long-term listeners will know, I was, in a former life, a neuroscience major and then, in the last 10 years, have funded a lot of science. I always have just had this hankering and this dream of being involved in neuroscience; it continues to this day. And in the process of building this game — and this is not how I necessarily sell it, because this is going to sound terrible, but through many experiments with different companies and so on, I’ve concluded that even though generally Americans, I’ll throw it on Americans, I’m American, say they want to be smarter, they will typically not pay for something that is designed to make them smarter unless it’s a magic pill, and then sometimes the answer is yes. But what I was hoping to also do with this game is to create something that would — and this has not been proven, there’s no randomized controlled study examining this, although that might change at some point. — is to design something that would help those players who are not good at this, or the people who are in the middle of the bell curve or the people who are good to get better. And for people who are interested in looking at some — they’re not perfect analogs, but they’re similar. People can check out the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, WCST. It’s a neurophysiological test used to assess cognitive flexibility in executive functions, particularly the ability to shift cognitive sets and learn from feedback. All right, so participants must sort cards based on an initially unknown rule, which changes after a certain number of correct sorts. Now this is not a perfect parallel because that does not, in and of itself, make for a fun game. Right? Elan Lee: Mm-hmm. Tim Ferriss: So fun number one, lots of probably rank ordered like one, two, three, four, five. But could I also Trojan horse in — Elan Lee: Yeah, love it. Tim Ferriss: — cognitive training. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And I think the answer — this is from a lay perspective, and obviously I’m biased because I’m involved in every step, I’m making this thing, but I think it does the trick. And what people will notice is, and you know this too, the game starts off so easy. Elan Lee: There’s nothing to it. Tim Ferriss: And people are like, “There’s nothing to it.” Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And then once a modifier or two comes out, people are like, “Oh, oh, wait a second, this is getting really tricky.” And if, for instance, I’ve had lifelong insomnia, you want to sleep better, play this game before you go to bed. And by the end you will feel like you just did a workout, a full brain workout for your cognition. Elan Lee: You know what I love about that part? I learned to play the drums years and years ago, and I remember I would learn these new patterns and it was like your right hand has to do this and your left hand has to do this, and your right leg has to do this and your — and I remember thinking, “No way, no way. I can’t do that.” And you work at it and you work at it and you work at it and suddenly it starts to click, just a little bit. Like, “Oh, my right hand did the right thing.” And it’s like you can feel new neurons coming to life. Right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: Your brain is doing something that five minutes ago you could not do. This is the first game I’ve ever played that does that exact same thing. And I remember the first time I felt that way in a very early play test, my eyes got all wide and I was like, “There is something magical going on here. I know I’m psyching myself out, but I feel new things happening in my brain because five minutes ago I could not do this pattern and now I can. We can go all the way around the table and you can add a new card and I will still be able to do this pattern that I couldn’t do just five minutes ago.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah, totally. And what’s cool as well is you get to see just how specialized certain minds are and where you might have an Achilles heel. So for instance, and this is true for some folks, we have the modifiers ranked by difficulty just so you can — because ultimately with Coyote, you’re in charge of how hard you make the game. Elan Lee: Mm-hmm. That’s right. That’s right. Tim Ferriss: You are in full charge of how easy, moderate, or difficult you make it. And we didn’t even talk about how this game is designed to make you a game designer. We’ll talk about that with the blank cards. But this is a sort of creativity unlock as much as a game. That’s the intention behind it, which is part of the reason that I’m really excited to see what the hell it does when it’s released into the wild, which effectively is now. Elan Lee: That’s going to — Tim Ferriss: Now the specialization piece, I’ll just speak to that. So for instance, for me, skipping turns, skipping players, it is a blind spot. It is an Achilles heel for me. That’s true for quite a few folks. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: But for other people, for instance, if we’re going around the table, most people would be familiar with “We Will Rock You.” Elan Lee: “We Will Rock You,” yeah. Tim Ferriss: So it’s like boom, boom, boom, boom. So the way you play the game is you go around is you go “Boom, boom,” and you can hit the table with your hands. You can do it with closed fists. You could probably clap it if you want, but it’s boom, boom. And then one person does the move. Like let’s take the ballet, we’re going to do a pirouette. You have to do the motion and you have to say the motion. So then these two things can be split or confused later. We want to get — Elan Lee: We’ll get to that later. Tim Ferriss: — too deep into that. And then it’s boom, boom, next person, boom, boom, next person. And it goes around. And then it just gets more and more complicated. So I remember when we were first experimenting with the modifier that said, okay, it’s now three bumps instead of two. So it’s boom, boom, boom. And then the move. And there were, I remember, I’m not going to call them out, but there’s one person who just could not do it. Elan Lee: I know. I was one of those people. My brain would start melting out of my ears at that point. I don’t know why though. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah. It’s weird. It’s weird. So they’re very specific. You’ll find each person will have a super strength and a super weakness, and you’ll figure it out by playing this game. And just from a game design perspective also, I’d love to hear you talk about finding the sweet spot. I mean, we could talk about Bushnell’s law of Atari fame, the game, I’m paraphrasing here, but a good game is easy to learn and difficult to master. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: But how do you, in the course of play testing, working with prototypes find the sweet spot of difficulty? Because with this game, well, through making this game, I’ve just really come to appreciate how hard it is to create a game where people experience that sweet spot. Because if you were to take Coyote and make it too easy, what a simple game to make. Elan Lee: Sure. Tim Ferriss: Right? Elan Lee: Oh, yeah. Tim Ferriss: If you wanted to make it basically impossible and not fun to play, also very easy. But to find that sweet spot on the graph is incredibly challenging. Elan Lee: Yeah. So the way I think about this is when you first encounter any game, the first thought that has to go into your brain is, “I can do that.” You hear it described, and you have to think, “I can do that.” And then you have to try the game and that has to be reinforced. The game has to say, “Yep, you can do that.” And you have to feel like, “Okay, I thought I could do it. I can do it. This is great.” But that’s only going to last a few seconds. The next thought that has to go into your brain is, “I understand the path to mastery. I understand how to get better at this.” And then the next thought is, “And I can do that too.” So you have to see the moment a modifier card comes out, or the moment any complication happens in your favorite game, it has to stop you dead in your tracks. It has to be like, “Ooh, the thing I just did to start the game and was really good at, I thought I could do it. I could do it. That’s not going to work here. I have to rethink my strategy, or I have to get better at something else.” And then those two follow-up thoughts have to show up in quick succession: “I know what I have to do and I can do that too.” And that’s really the art to me of that ramping up of game design. And you have to keep hitting that “I think I can do that”; “Yes, you can. Now you can’t anymore, but you know what you have to do and you can do that too.” And then that’s going to get blocked. And you think, “Okay, now what? Now I know what I have to do and I can do that too.” And you have to just keep hitting those two things. And it’s rinse and repeat over and over and over again. And if you can hit that, you are just holding somebody’s hand from the beginning of the game to the end of the game. And they’re going to get great at it, they’re going to achieve that sense of mastery over time. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, and if you, listening or watching, have any game that you consider simple that you enjoy, rest assured there was an absurd, absurd amount of development and testing and revising that went into it. And just to give you an example, this is by all outward appearance a very simple game. And the three to eight players you could probably play with more, 10 minutes, says age is 10 plus. I’ve seen people playing with their kids who are much younger and it’s actually hilarious and super fun. There are so many levers you can pull here. You have the action cards, which are these cute little salamander cards with the different motions and gestures and so on. You’ve got just the sheer number of cards. How many variants do you have? How many total cards do you have? How many Coyote versus attack cards? When you have a fully shuffled deck, what does that actually look like? There’s so many different variables that you have to think through. Elan Lee: Yeah. And we even set up, one of my favorite things is we’re starting to see people compete now. So we set up this page of, here are table configurations. Here’s an array of cards in exactly this order with exactly these modifiers. This one’s hard, this one’s impossible. This one is going to kill you. And we’ve started to see, the game is barely available so far, but we started to see some people try to tackle those challenges. Tim Ferriss: Oh, fun. Okay. I didn’t even know that. Elan Lee: It’s incredible. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, so where this came from also is in The 4-Hour Chef a million years ago, came out in 2012, which was actually a book about accelerated learning, confusingly. But putting that aside, there were a few recipes in that book. I think one was called Dragon Force Chaconne or something like that, which was named after this video game track that people found impossible to play on guitar. And then there was something, a La Ancienne, which was this just ludicrously complex French dish that involved fish. And I was like, okay, look, if you’ve done everything up to this point and you want to take a quantum leap forward and try something that is considered effectively impossible by most people, here you go. And so that’s what we created on this particular page. Elan Lee: I will just say, having tested all of the challenges on that page, I can do exactly one of them. The last two are so hard. Tim Ferriss: They really are. Elan Lee: And we’ve already seen someone, a table of six people succeed — Tim Ferriss: Oh, wow. Okay — Elan Lee: — at the middle one. They’ve already done it. Tim Ferriss: That’s nuts. Elan Lee: Yeah. I’ve never seen anyone do the crazy hard one. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: But it’s coming. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So people can check it out. And there may or may not be a bunch of excitement around that. So I will just say there may be incentives later to be good at this game. I will leave it at that for now. So I tell you what, we’re going to come back to some of the blank cards and we’ll talk about those features. But let’s talk about a bit more of the process of making any game. We could talk about Coyote specifically of course, because you have a process for this. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: How many games per year do you guys put out on average? Elan Lee: So it’s funny, I actually built this out as a graph. So our first year we did one, our second year we did two. Our third year we did two again. Last year we did 14. This year we’ll do 23, I think. Tim Ferriss: Wow. Elan Lee: Yeah, it’s a lot. But we’ve built this, it’s really fun, we’ve built this incredibly robust pipeline from design all the way through to testing and then sales and then marketing. And I feel obligated to just keep that pipeline full because it’s such a beautiful thing we built. So we do a lot of games. Tim Ferriss: All right, let’s get some info that we wouldn’t normally have any access to. Elan Lee: All right. Tim Ferriss: If you do an 80/20 analysis, it’s not going to be exactly 80/20, but you get where I’m going, on your best-selling games, what’s on the leaderboard? What are the top X number of games? Five, three, four, whatever the number. Elan Lee: Well, up until last year, number one, the top-selling game in the world amongst all games was Exploding Kittens. Tim Ferriss: That’s nuts, man. Elan Lee: It’s nuts. Tim Ferriss: Congratulations. Elan Lee: It makes no sense, but I’ll tell you something I’m even more proud of. It’s now number two. Number one is a game called Hurry Up Chicken Butt. Hurry Up Chicken Butt is a game I designed with my four-year-old daughter, and she did most of the design. And it is outselling Exploding Kittens. It is selling one game every four seconds. Tim Ferriss: Wow. Elan Lee: Yeah, it’s nuts. And it was designed by a four-year-old. Tim Ferriss: Okay, so we’ve got a Hurry Up Chicken Butt, Exploding Kittens. Elan Lee: Yeah. The next few spots in the global sales are constantly shifting. Everybody’s fighting for those, but we always have — our entries into that list, which are constantly shifting, Poetry for Neanderthals is usually number three. Throw Throw Burrito is usually either number five or six, and the rest are just totally random. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Okay, got it. So what has made Hurry Up Chicken Butt a success? Elan Lee: Yeah. So remember what I said, if you have the best design game in the world — Tim Ferriss: And by the way, when we spoke I think two years ago — Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: — you were just beginning to talk about this. I don’t think it had launched at that point. Elan Lee: No, it hadn’t. Yeah. Yeah. It has been an absolute rocket ship. Tim Ferriss: What are the magic ingredients? Why has it worked? Because not all games do that. Elan Lee: Yeah. No, they don’t. Tim Ferriss: And you’ve had now, with the number of games that EK, Exploding Kittens, has developed, you’ve had a chance to see a lot of different ideas come through the doors and go out the doors. Elan Lee: Yeah. Some games last a season, some games last a decade. So when I was designing games — okay, so Hurry Up Chicken Butt in particular, I wrote a list of the things I wanted that game to accomplish. And my daughter had all these ideas, “Here’s what I want to do, and you’re going to do this and you’re going to run up and jump up and down and blah.” But I had a list of things that I needed to know were in this game in order for me as a parent to buy it for my kid. And they were as follows. The game has to be as much fun for me to play as it is for my daughter. That’s a hard one. Tim Ferriss: That’s hard. Elan Lee: That killed most designs that we came up with. Number two, my daughter has to be able to beat me at this game, even though I’m not letting her win. Holy crap is that a hard one. Tim Ferriss: Yep. Elan Lee: Number three, the game cannot have any losers. It can have a winner, but it cannot have any losers. Those three were my guiding lights. It was like, I need to check off these three check boxes for this game to be good. And we worked on a hundred million designs. She’s great. She’ll just be like, “Oh, you don’t like this one? Here’s another one. You don’t like that one? Here’s another one.” And she just kept firing them off. And we finally got to this game that hit all three of those. That, as I said earlier, is only half the battle. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, that’s the necessary, but not sufficient — Elan Lee: Exactly. So now we have a game that I’m in love with, that we play every single night that she can beat me at regularly. And I am trying my absolute hardest to beat her. And this four-year-old is kicking my ass at this game. Love that. Love it. And I’m having a blast. Tim Ferriss: So this is my first time hearing about these criteria. Just for people listening, this is all new to me. Elan Lee: When my daughter got old enough to start playing games right around when she turned four, we went out and bought all these games and I just hated them. They were so boring and I hated playing. And so we just designed our own. We just made them better. And it was important for me to have that list. ‘Cause unless I know what success looks like, I’ll just stay in brainstorming mode forever. So I made that list, finally hit it, and then we entered into part two. And here my daughter has very little to do with it. Here’s where I sit down with the marketing and sales team and I was like, “What the hell are we going to call this thing?” And we went through a thousand different names. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I know the feeling. Elan Lee: Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah, we did that. But once I had 10 names that I really liked, we sat down with my daughter and all her friends and I would just read them off. And there was no contest. I got to Hurry Up Chicken Butt and they’re like just laughing hysterically, jumping up and down. They didn’t even want to hear the rest of the names. I was like, okay. Sold. So that was a really nice step forward. It was like, I know I’ve got a game that’s just fire for kids. They’re just so excited about this. And the next thing was, all right, well what do we make this box look like? And I was like, I know it has to be — the game itself involves a character and a die shaker and some sound effects. It’s got all this stuff packed into this character, this chicken. And I was like, I can’t just hide that. I have to put that in a box where you can see it. And that was really hard. The difference between box design for an iPhone and a game is an iPhone will spend a hundred dollars on that box with the materials and making it beautiful. And when you open your iPhone, you take the box and you throw it away. In a game, you’ve got about 40 cents to spend on the box and it has to last forever. It sucks. The equation is totally backwards, but I needed a thing that displayed the chicken and told you it made noise and lets you shake around the die and still hold its structure as a box so that you could remove this thing, play with it, and then reinsert it into the box in a way that isn’t going to mess with the integrity of the box — its structural integrity. So that was really hard, but we finally solved that. And then — Tim Ferriss: Did you do that before or after you started testing the waters with retailers? Elan Lee: After. Tim Ferriss: After? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Okay. I don’t want to hijack, but whenever it makes sense, I would love to know how, at what point you start testing the waters with Elan Lee: Well, we do this backwards. And when we started, you have to do it the opposite way. You have to walk into those sales pitches and you have to say, “Here’s the final product. Look how beautiful it is. You don’t have to trust us that this is going to sell. You can look at this thing and know that it’s going to sell.” For this game, luckily, because we have a really good track record, we walked in with no box. All I walked in with was a rough idea, a name scribbled on a piece of paper. And I said, “Trust me, this is going to be great. We’re going to solve everything. It’s going to be amazing.” And they said, “Okay, yeah, sold. Let’s buy it.” That comes from 10 years of pitching them hit after hit after hit. Tim Ferriss: I got it. So if it were earlier in Exploding Kittens’ existence, you go in with the finished box. Elan Lee: Yeah. They’re never taking a flyer on that. Tim Ferriss: Who creates the finished box? Do you guys create it in-house? How do you prototype something like that? Elan Lee: Yeah, we have an incredible team. We have a large scale printer. We print on actual cardboard. We have a paper folder so we can actually build the boxes. Which was an investment, that’s not off-the-shelf machinery, but it helps — okay, so look, normally whatever manufacturer you’re working with, they send you a prototype box. Because they make it and they want you to see the final product and that’s what you go into the sales meetings with. You say, “Look, here’s the box. Here’s how much it’s going to weigh. Here’s the final presentation. We’ve been working on it for a year and a half. Here it is.” I walk into those meetings like, “I got an idea, I’ve been working on it for three weeks. I want you to buy it right now. I don’t have any materials to show you.” So it’s a different kind of pitch that I’m very proud of because I’ve earned that and we haven’t ever let them down. Tim Ferriss: So in the case of Coyote, there was a lot of play testing that was done before we ended up in line review meetings. Elan Lee: Yeah. Wow. We skipped that whole part, didn’t we? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah. Elan Lee: All right. Tim Ferriss: So could you talk about your secret cabal of families? Elan Lee: Yeah, yeah. Secret cabal of families. I love it. All right, so — Tim Ferriss: Another chapter for your memoir. Elan Lee: Yeah, right. That’s a good title there. So, okay, so here’s how most game companies test games. If you had partnered with a different games company, here’s what your experience would’ve been like. “All right, we got a game. We really like it. It’s really fun, lots of internal testing. Everyone’s on board. We now need external testing.” And they go to these market research groups and they pull strangers in and they sit in a room with a one-way mirror and they show the game and they play the game with people they don’t know and they order in some crappy catered lunch and they play the game and then they rate it on a scale of one to 10 and they fill out this form that’s like, “Here’s what I liked and here’s what I didn’t like and here’s what I would improve.” And then you get to watch those videos and they present you back all these forms and you get to make a determination. Okay. Nobody plays games like that. You don’t play games with strangers. When was the last time you played a board game with a stranger? Tim Ferriss: Can’t even remember. Elan Lee: It doesn’t happen. Right? The testing procedure that all these other companies go through is fundamentally flawed. They’re using a resource because it’s the only resource that exists. So I sat down, that’s what we did our first time. We went through one of those companies and they gave us all the results. And I looked at these results and I was like, oh, my God, we just burned $25,000 on this thing and it’s useless. So I realized at that moment, because nothing better exists, we’re going to have to build it ourselves. So I started reaching out to, at first our Kickstarter community and then our Discord community and then our Reddit community as we grow and grow and grow and said, “Look, I got a bunch of prototypes. I need families and friends who get together regularly to play games and I’m going to mail you a free game. You don’t even have to send it back to me, it’s yours forever. You get this amazing prototype. All I ask in return is upon receiving it within 24 hours, you play the game with your friends and family and you record the session and you send me that video. And that’s it. That’s all I want in return.” And within about 12 months, we had 400 families sign up for this thing. They are called our kiddie test pilots. And they’re this incredible group of enthusiastic game players that give us the best feedback. And we don’t have them fill out a questionnaire. All we ask them at the end of the test session, we say, “Look into the camera and answer one question. The only question we care about, do you want to play again?” And we know a game is ready when everybody looks into that lens and says, “Hell, yes!” And that’s it. That’s our testing process. Tim Ferriss: What are some of the pass/fail marks or green versus red signals that you look for? In other words, I imagine the response rate could vary, but you don’t know if that’s because people are busy or if it’s the wrong time of year or maybe they looked at the game, the box, and so on and it just didn’t sell them so they didn’t play it. Elan Lee: Totally. Tim Ferriss: Is that something you pay attention to? Are the people, I’m sure I’m not the only person wondering this, if they’re part of this special VIP get free game group, are they disincentivized to say, “Hell no, I would not play this game again.” So do you get a false positive signal? Elan Lee: I see. Tim Ferriss: How do you think through what constitutes a thumbs up versus a thumb sideways versus a thumbs down? Elan Lee: Yeah. There are a lot of false positives for sure. And there’s no way I can solve that problem. We prompt them in advance. We’re like, “Look, we need honestly — this game will get great if you tell us that something’s broken with it. We need to know that.” And they’re motivated because we also send them the final version of the game. So they know that’s coming, they know a better version is coming if they help us make it better. So some of the problem is solved that way, but not all of it. So that’s why the video is so important. Tim Ferriss: So they say, “We had a great time,” and you’re watching and you’re like, they are not having a great time. Elan Lee: Yeah, yeah. Look, count the number of eye rolls. Or you know a great one, they’ll take the instructions — I love this. They’ll open the instructions. And when you see that eyes go wide and they inhale. Tim Ferriss: Pull back and they’re like — Elan Lee: It’s like, “Oh, fuck.” Tim Ferriss: Instruction apnea. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Oh, God. Elan Lee: Something, that’s terrible. Right? And that’s really important. And there’s no survey in the world they can fill out that’s going to tell me that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: You need to watch the moment they see the instructions. Tim Ferriss: Because they may not even realize they’re doing it. Elan Lee: Yeah, exactly. Tim Ferriss: So how are they going to report it? Elan Lee: Yeah. And that’s why the video is so important. And we have very specific instructions for the video. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, what are they? Because I’m wondering how in the hell do you review 400 videos? Elan Lee: Oh, well one, we watch them at 4X speed and two is we’ve got a whole team of people that watch them and they flag moments. They don’t even say why this moment is important. Something happened here, something happened here. I’m going to go on to the next video now. And then the next group of people will go through and look at those flags and say, “Oh, big, deep inhale. Rules confusion.” Tim Ferriss: Nerd question, what do you use software wise for flagging stuff? Elan Lee: Vimeo. Tim Ferriss: Vimeo, okay. So you have people upload their videos to Vimeo? Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: Got it. Elan Lee: Yeah, so this whole process takes months and it’s really important. And the other thing is, I’ve got 400 test families, but I’m only going to send out five games at a time. The reason is I need to collect that feedback, make changes, and send out the next batch. Otherwise, I’ve got 10 results for a version and it’s useless. I know what the next five are going to be like ’cause I saw them on the first five. Tim Ferriss: I got it. So is it then, just to state my understanding, with the kiddie test pilots, you basically have — you’re not sending out the same version to 400, 600 people at once? Elan Lee: Five at a time. Tim Ferriss: Five at a time. And then you look at that cohort and see what comes back? Elan Lee: Mm-hmm. It’s always the same stuff. Tim Ferriss: Then you tweak and then it goes out to the next group. Elan Lee: Yeah, the next five. Tim Ferriss: Over what period of time do you get a prototype to the max number who are going to receive it? Elan Lee: Usually I would say six to eight months. And we’re tweaking two things. One is we’re tweaking gameplay, but much more commonly we’re tweaking the instructions. Because gameplay has already survived internal testing. So we know the game is fun. If we know this game is fun and then we watch a video of people not having fun, chances are it’s the instructions, not the game. And so that’s what we start attacking at that moment. Tim Ferriss: Got it. What are some of the risks of internal testing? ‘Cause I’ve always wondered, for instance, when I have, as I’m doing right now, doing a bunch of writing and I have people proofreading or test reading my writing, I do not only do it with professional writers. I mean they’re very good and I know I’m very fortunate to know some amazing writers, but they’re also a little too close to the material. It’s like a travel writer who can’t stop looking at their travel experience through the lens of a writer. They have lost the ability to just travel and have fun. Elan Lee: Yeah. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So what are some of the risks, if any, of internal testing? Elan Lee: So you and I have the same instinct here. I remember when we were testing this game internally, hadn’t gone out the door yet. Tim Ferriss: This game? Elan Lee: This game, Coyote. Yeah. I remember you would say, “Hey, can you show me test results? But can you have your accounting team test it instead of your game design team?” And I remember thinking, yeah, that’s what we do. I’m not interested in the game design team’s results. So I would show you the accounting team results and I would show you the sales people, the sales team’s results, who hadn’t even ever seen the game. Our internal testing starts out with the game design team, of course, but very quickly has to move on to the other teams, specifically the other teams who have never seen the game and don’t know the background. Because those are really the only tests that we care about. So your instinct is perfect there, and I’m very happy to say you didn’t have to teach us that, we already knew that part. Tim Ferriss: I mean, if I’m teaching you anything, I don’t know what it would be other than my obsessive focus on — I’m sorry for the volume of email and the volume of text messages and the volume of everything. Elan Lee: Every single one of those made the game better. Truly. Truly. I mean, okay, look, we’ve only done, we’ve done, I think two partnerships total. Three partnerships total. We did a game with Penn Jillette of Penn & Teller. We did a game with Jeff Probst of Survivor, and now we’ve done a game with Tim Ferriss. You probably sent more notes than the other two combined. Tim Ferriss: I sent a lot of notes. Sent a lot of notes. I really had a blast with it. And I remember this moment, and I’m wondering if this happened before or after the line review meetings. I think it might’ve been afterwards, but you could place it for me because this is my first game and I don’t put my name on anything. That was part of the very, very truthful pitch. It’s not like one of, I don’t have Tim Ferriss microwave enchiladas and Tim Ferriss sneakers. And then just as an aside, I have the Tim Ferriss game. It’s like, no, no, no, I don’t put my name on anything. So I take it very, very seriously. And I think it was, tell me if I’m getting this wrong, pretty sure it was Carly, who’s amazing. Elan Lee: Carly is the president of Exploding Kittens. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Carly is incredible. And because there’s always a fear, for me at least, where it’s like, maybe internally I think it’s great, and then it gets released into the wild and then, oh, shit there’s a real problem. Like Houston, we have a problem. Elan Lee: Yeah, and you can’t take it back. Tim Ferriss: Right. So what do you do? And I remember Carly, I want to say, sent a text to me. She was in, I want to say Germany at some type of gaming convention or meeting of distributors. I don’t remember the exact context, but she said Coyote was belle of the ball. She’s like, “You would not believe we had an entire huge room full of people playing, smashing on the tables over and over and over and over again.” And I was like, whew. Elan Lee: Yeah. Isn’t that a great feeling? Tim Ferriss: Okay, here we go, LFG. Elan Lee: She sent me a video of that. So just to set the stage there, there are 2,000 people that — sorry, there’s 2,000 people at this hotel of the 25 hotels that are part of this convention. And there’s one games room and there’s 10 tables in there. And the idea is there should be a different game at every table. And everyone’s testing out the games and sampling them. And we put Coyote on one table and almost immediately people started gathering around. And so those people said, “Can we just grab another copy and we’ll just put it on the next table just so not everyone has to gather around this one table?” ‘Cause it looked so intriguing. And so they sent it to another table. And then by the time Carly sent me a video, it was at every table in the room. It was just an entire hotel playing this one game because nobody wanted to play anything else. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, wild. Elan Lee: It was so neat. It was so neat. And how gratifying? We’ve been killing ourselves on this thing. And to see an audience receive it and say, thank you for the gift. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah, totally. And also, I mean, I said it to you guys and look, it says technically it says age 10 plus. So I don’t want to contradict that, but if you’re willing to modify the rules, which is something that I encourage, and we have that in the instructions, house rules, feel free to modify the rules. But I sent you guys the video of my friend’s four-year-old after she played, which was like this — Elan Lee: So good! Tim Ferriss: It was such an amazing video. And this is the first thing I’ve ever done that can include families and kids directly/ Elan Lee: Easily. Tim Ferriss: Where it’s like, four-year-old, 10-year-old is not going to have any interest or necessarily the capacity to read one of my phone books that are like 600 pages long. It’s not going to happen. So this is also so much fun to finally now that it’s kind of released into the wild to start seeing these things bubbling up that I hoped would be there. Elan Lee: It’s the reason you make a game. You want to share an experience that then the recipients get to share with those people that they love. That’s why you make a game. That’s exactly what we’ve made here. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So let’s talk about the selling process a little bit more. Because you said, there’s the game development, there’s building the game, there’s crafting the game. But there is an equally important part, which is how do you get this thing into people’s hands? And for that you need distribution. So this is going to be a callback. Remember that line review at the very beginning and then I took us on a very meandering path, but there was a point to it. How do you pitch big retailers? How does that happen? And how did you do it in the beginning of Exploding Kittens and how — I know it’s changed over time as you’ve built your track record, but nonetheless you still need to do it. And actually, here’s a data point that most people will never hear anyone talk about. What percentage of your sales are offline retail versus online? Elan Lee: Yeah. All right, we’ll start there. Yeah, we never share these numbers, but for you, Tim — Tim Ferriss: Thank you. Elan Lee: — here we go. 70 percent of our sales are in-person retail. Only 30 percent are online sales. Totally backwards than what you’d expect for almost any industry. But yeah, people like to walk into a store, they like to see and touch and feel the game and flip it over and read the back and compare it to the other games. And that’s where we sell our games. Which means not only do I need tremendous retail buy-in, those sales meetings are so important, those line reviews. But also the game has to sell itself on the shelf. When you’re walking down that games aisle, 70 percent of our audience does this. You need to look at all the game, hundreds of games, and you need to stop dead in your tracks on this one. And you need to say, “Ooh, what’s that?” And that starts at that line review, starts with getting them to say, not only are we going to commit to this game, but we’re going to put it in multiple locations. So you see it more than once. Very important. Also, we work with them to figure out the color scheme. And you and I, we did tons of surveys on the color scheme and the character and everything to stop people in their tracks. Tim Ferriss: So just a quick sidebar. I know I keep doing this, but some of you may remember, and for those who never heard it I’ll just tell you, from my very first book, 4-Hour Workweek, I used Google AdWords to test the top, let’s just call it 10 title and subtitle contenders. So I bid on keywords that were related to the subject matter in the book. And then the sponsored results, the ads were automatically split tested, like multivariate tested by Google. They will do this automatically. And then all of the URLs, I had different URLs for each title option. They just took people to an under construction page. Because I didn’t care about conversion, I cared about interest, sufficient interest click. And that is how I figured out the title. And then for the cover, back in the day, I went to Borders, which was on University Ave. in Palo Alto. And I had a counter, like you might see from a bouncer at the front of a club. And I put different covers onto a book of the same dimensions on the shelf. Elan Lee: Oh, wow. Tim Ferriss: I guess I didn’t tell you this. Under the new nonfiction. Elan Lee: Oh, my God. Tim Ferriss: And I just, during the peak hours over a couple of days, I just tracked the number of times it got picked up. Elan Lee: Oh, that’s so good. Tim Ferriss: And then I used that to determine which cover to use. Elan Lee: I love this, I love this. Tim Ferriss: Now there are better or certainly easier tools to use. So we ended up, there are a number of them, I’ll just mention a few. So we used PickFu, P-I-C-K-F-U.com. There’s also Intellivy, I-N-T-E-L-L-I-V-Y, and then there’s another one called Stickybeak also. But these allow you to do roughly the same thing, which is you can take, for instance, with this box design or any type of art, or you could probably do it with copy, many different things. You can survey people who fit a particular demographic. And so you could identify whatever the ages, the gender, if they are members of a particular service, whether they have Prime membership or this membership or that membership. You can fine slice it however you want, and then you can serve up variants. So for this coyote who you see on the cover, I’ll explain for the people, basically the box looks like a slightly enlarged box for a deck of cards and then the top of the box is this beautiful autumnal orange, almost a saffron, like Buddhist robe. Elan Lee: We spent so much time on this color. Tim Ferriss: We spent so much time on this, it is impossible to overstate how much time I spent on this and everybody spent on it. Then there’s this beautiful lime green. I remember taking photographs of particular leaves at particular times of the year with light coming through it to identify the hexadecimal or Pantone numbers for this particular grain. Elan Lee: Oh, I remember this well, yeah. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, you remember it, you remember it. And then looking at color theory and the color wheel and, oh, my God, it went on and on. But above the coyote which is in the center of the box, there is this upper portion of a cartoon coyote’s head and very much trickster. Where it ended up is there’s a little hat on the coyote, there’s an earring, there’s a wink and the snout is where it’s cut off so you don’t see the nose. And this was originally, I remember sketching this initially on a Zoom call by pen and paper and then holding it up to the Zoom call to the camera and then later sending the scan and then we worked from there. But we had variants with no hat, we had variants with no earring, we had variants with both eyes open looking to camera, so to speak, we had both eyes open looking in one direction off to the side and we were able to very quickly get a very good statistical signal on what people preferred. Elan Lee: Yes. However — Tim Ferriss: However. Elan Lee: — to your credit, when you showed me that character, I think, initially, both the coyote’s eyes were open and we had some questions about the hat and I remember asking you all these questions. “What do you think of a wink? What do you think of an earring? What do you think of a hat? What do you think of one eye closed? With both eyes closed? What do you think? What do you think?” And to your credit, your answer was always “Let’s test it. I don’t want to have an opinion about this, I do have an opinion but I don’t even want to tell you, let’s test it.” And that is such an intelligent way to approach this. And ultimately, this beautiful character that we ended up with was so clearly the winner, it wasn’t even close. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it wasn’t even close. And so we were able to get this very strong signal from thousands of people voting and, boom, here we are. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Okay. So, we were talking about the road to retail. So it’s 70 percent of your sales are in-person retail versus online. Elan Lee: Yeah, right. Tim Ferriss: And, therefore, the stakes are high for these line reviews. Elan Lee: Yeah, line reviews are a big deal. And I remember, so we really wanted to all show up in person. I remember you were trying so hard to get — our first line review was with Walmart in Bentonville, Arkansas. I remember you wanted so badly to be there and there was some scheduling conflict that just wasn’t going to let it happen. And we tried to change the date but, again, they’ve got so many meetings and you’ve got to get in in exactly this time and they couldn’t change it to anything appropriate. And I remember thinking, “Oh, we’re sunk, I don’t know how to sell this game without Tim there in the room showing how much passion he has.” And you had a great solve, you just recorded a video of all that passion and you sat down in front of the camera and you just riffed on the game. You were just like, “Here’s why I love this, here’s why this is important to me, here’s why I made this game, first time I put my name on a thing,” and you recorded this beautiful and passionate video. And I remember walking into the line review and sitting down and saying, “I have a new game. First thing I’m going to do is we’re going to play this game and I’m not going to tell you anything about it, we’re just going to play this game.” And I set up the game and, within five minutes, they’re laughing and they’re having this incredible time and they’re like, “Oh, this is amazing, this is so much fun. How are you going to sell this thing?” And I said, “I’m going to play a video for you now,” and that was it. It was that one-two punch. It was we’ve nailed game design and we’ve nailed the pitch, we know exactly who to talk to and how to talk to them. And they saw those two elements and they’re full line purchase, every single store is getting this game. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, wild, yeah. Elan Lee: That has never happened on an initial pitch for us ever. Normally, we get into a subset of stores and then, eventually, it rolls out to all the stores. This was the first time ever they said, “Whatever it takes, we need this game everywhere.” Tim Ferriss: Which is still very surreal for me and I’m so grateful, obviously, and it’s terrifying at the same time. Not going to lie, this is mister dip the toe, then one foot, then wade up to the ankles, this is just — Elan Lee: Yeah, fire hose on. Tim Ferriss: — full Monty from second zero. What are other keys to pitching in a line review? And that could also be, I’ll just offer another option, which is what are some common mistakes that people make or that you suspect people make? Elan Lee: Okay. So, the first most common mistake — Tim Ferriss: Because this could be for games but it could be for — Elan Lee: It’s for anything, yeah. Tim Ferriss: — cosmetics, it could be for anything. Elan Lee: For anything. The first question is how are you represented in that room? Remember I said they only take a certain number of meetings, it took us five years to get one of those meetings. Tim Ferriss: Wow. Elan Lee: And the way that you get the — Tim Ferriss: Even with the thunderous, crazy lightning-in-a-bottle success of Exploding Kittens? Elan Lee: They only have so many hours. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: Yeah. So what you have to do instead is you find someone who already has a meeting and you hire them as your publisher and then they represent your game in their meeting. That’s how most companies do it and that’s how we did it for years. So the first problem is you have to make sure that whoever’s representing you, assuming you can’t be in the room because 99.9 percent of the people can’t, they are representing you the right way. With enough attention, they’re pitching it the right way, they’re representing it the right way, they’re saying the right words, they’re conveying the right fun. Tim Ferriss: How do you ensure that? Elan Lee: It’s a personal relationship and you — It’s just hard, it’s really hard. And to be honest, I don’t want to name names, but we went through three different publishers and I wasn’t happy with how — Tim Ferriss: How did you, this may or may not be something you can talk about, but how did you craft the deal structure such that you could take a swing and then you’re like, “Okay, swing and a miss, we’re going to go to someone else. And then swing and a miss, we’re going to go to someone else.” Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: How are those deals structured? Elan Lee: We got very lucky. Because our Kickstarter campaign was so through the roof, that fed into our Amazon sales immediately. And so I could go from publisher to publisher saying, “Look how many games I sold the last week, look how many I sold the week before that. This is a prestigious title that you want to represent.” And then when they wouldn’t represent me properly, wouldn’t get the right sales, couldn’t get the right deal structure in place because we also demand quite a bit as far as where the game is placed, is it in aisle, is it out of aisle, meaning is it in the game section or somewhere else. Tim Ferriss: Ankle height versus eye height. Elan Lee: Exactly, right. Those bottom shelves are like a death sentence, nobody looks down there. Can we get games at checkout where they’re selling chewing gum, can we put games there? Can we get games in the catalog? All this stuff that I wanted for our games was just not being properly represented for us. So, eventually, after our sales got high enough, I finally was able to stop doing that silly dance with these publishers and we were able to publish our own games. Tim Ferriss: Quick question. So, if I’m hearing you correctly, the success of the direct to consumer, the DTC, Kickstarter, Amazon, I should say online, those successes allowed you to dictate certain deal terms with the publishers so you had flexibility. Elan Lee: Correct. And they allow us to say you want to represent us. Because, even then, they only have a one, maybe two-hour meeting and so there’s only so many games they can pitch so how do they fill that library. Tim Ferriss: And then you get to the point where you can go and book those meetings yourself. How important was having a critical mass of SKUs? Elan Lee: Oh, it’s everything, yeah. Tim Ferriss: Because I have to imagine, if I’m a major retailer, I don’t want to have a meeting with someone who only has one thing to sell. Elan Lee: Well, that’s why we couldn’t do it at first. It was only once we had, I think, 10 games was the magic number to make it worth their while. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Okay, got it. Elan Lee: Yeah. And that takes a long time. And it’s not just 10 games, it’s 10 bestsellers. And unless you’re there, they’re just like, “Yeah, just go through a publisher. We don’t have time for — “ Tim Ferriss: Don’t have time. Elan Lee: We take 10 meetings, we don’t have time for an 11th. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. All right, so what have you learned understanding but, to the extent possible, if we can put aside the element of Exploding Kittens having and developing this incredible track record which allows you to not cut corners in a bad way but you can go in without a finished prototype of the box, et cetera. If we put that aside for the moment, what have you learned about line reviews if you look at your first outing versus — Elan Lee: Yeah. Oh, I love this. Tim Ferriss: — the more refined line reviews? Elan Lee: Yeah, okay. Tim Ferriss: And I’m spending a lot of time on this, guys, because this applies to everything. It applies to so much. You have a movie? Okay, fine, how are people going to see the movie? Yeah, you can go direct but you might want a distribution partner. What we’re talking about will apply to that pitch meeting, a lot of it. And it’s the stuff that mainstream magic is made of is figuring out how to craft these meetings. Elan Lee: Yeah. Remember you said, “Like it or not, you’re in sales?” Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: Here it is. This is where the rubber meets the road. Dust off your tap dancing shoes because, holy crap, these are tough. So you have to walk into that meeting and first you have to keep in mind you are their 10th meeting. Even if you’re not their 10th meeting, you’re their 10th meeting. They’re in this “I’m tired, I want to get out of this room, I’ve been at this for too long,” they’re in that mindset. So the first thing you’ve got to do is get them out of that funk. You need them to understand that this is going to be the best of the 10 meetings. And you do that with enthusiasm, you do that with props, you do that with a cool video. The stuff that can get them out of, “Oh, this isn’t like the other meetings.” Cool, that’s where you start. So we walk into the room with two of those suitcases, not the ones that fit in the overhead, the big crazy ones you have to check and they’re filled with games, the most beautiful games we’ve got. Even stuff that we’re not pitching that day, even stuff we know will never see the light of day because we’re going to set all of those up. And the basic premise is buy into this world. Exploding Kittens is not a product, it’s a whole world and you can have this world on your store shelves. And so that’s how we start and that’s a really nice way to start. Okay. Then what they’re expecting is, “Okay, pitch us a game one at a time. Pitch this, okay, you’re done. Okay, pitch the next one. Okay, you’re done. Pitch the next one.” What we do is very different. Instead of pitching a game and then pitching the next one, just like I said, for Coyote, we’re like, “Hey, we’re going to play a game.” And usually they say, “We don’t have time to play, can you just pitch it?” And I say, “No, we’re going to play a game.” Confrontation, I get it, but I force them to play the games, every single one of them. Now, I’m not going to play all the way through, I’m not going to spend 10 or 20 minutes. Tim Ferriss: All right. This might seem like a trivial detail but I don’t think it is. You in a tuxedo and a top hat for this? Are you dressed in your Sunday’s finest? Elan Lee: Oh, yeah. Oh, it’s so funny. So I learned this in my Microsoft days. If I dress up, if I wear a tuxedo, if I wear a suit, if I even wear a button-up shirt, nobody takes me seriously because I’m supposed to be the creative guy. I have to wear the creative guy uniform, I have to wear a t-shirt, I have to wear jeans, otherwise, no one looks at me. So that’s how I show up. Luckily, it’s a really comfortable uniform for me. So I force them to play and I’m there being the game’s biggest cheerleader. I don’t usually let them win, but I usually orchestrate a scenario in the game where they’re having as much fun as possible. And my goal is for them to have exactly those emotions that we talked about. When we start, I need them to think I can do that. And then, a minute in, I need them to think, “Oh, I did that. What’s next? Oh, I can do that next thing too.” And I am just crafting that. And right at the point where they’re like, “Oh, I know what the next thing is,” I pull the game away. We’re done playing, now let me tell you how we’re going to sell this game. And it’s because, at that point, they’re drooling. And I do that 10 times in a meeting and we just keep hitting that over and over. And I am very aware that the last two games I pitch are usually not going to be purchased because they’re exhausted because that roller coaster — they’ve been up and down too many times. Tim Ferriss: Right. So, you’re going to have to figure out the sequence. Elan Lee: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Do you start with the game you hope is going to be the big purchase? How do you sequence it? Elan Lee: Yeah, yeah. We open with our shortest, easiest pitch and what that usually is an Exploding Kittens expansion. So, if I need to sell an expansion box or a new Exploding Kittens product and I know I don’t have to work very hard to sell it because they always sell, that’ll take the first spot. That just warms the waters, gets us all eased in. Tim Ferriss: A little yes momentum. Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: Doesn’t hurt. Elan Lee: Yeah. The number two spot is the glory spot. Tim Ferriss: Okay, got it. Elan Lee: Whoever is there, that’s the game I’m actually pitching today. That’s where Coyote was, that’s the big thing we’re going to talk about. And then the next five are equal, it doesn’t matter what order they are, those are — usually we’ll sell all five of those. At a typical meeting, all five. What happens after that is very iffy. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Now you mentioned you play the game, you get them super excited, hopefully, they’re drooling over it and then you say, “All right, I’m going to take the game away, here’s how we’re going to sell it.” What is included in the “Here’s how we’re going to sell it?” Elan Lee: Oh, yeah, okay. So important. So this has changed over the last three years. It used to be I have to start with the box and we still — I shouldn’t say it used to be, it still is, we start with the box. “Look how beautiful this thing is,” and we do a mock-up, here’s how it looks on the shelf and it’s usually from a photograph we took that morning. We want to show you, “Hey, Target, here’s what your shelf looks like. Hey, Walmart, here’s what your shelf looks like. Here is our game right there in line.” Tim Ferriss: And I should mention, this probably goes without saying, but you are not just showing up and winging it, you guys — Elan Lee: Oh, my God. Tim Ferriss: — rehearse like you are going to be performing once in a lifetime at Carnegie Hall. Elan Lee: It is, if we screw up this meeting, our company is screwed. We don’t survive a bad meeting so, yeah, there is nothing that matters more than this. This is, arguably, 70 percent of our business this year. If we mess up this meeting, we will see a 70 percent drop. If they bought zero games, I don’t know that our company would survive that, so it’s a big deal. We rehearse constantly, we make changes constantly, we make all these props. We try to get the spot either right after breakfast or right after lunch because that’s when they’re in the best moods. All of it is orchestrated and so carefully. Who’s in the meeting? How many chairs are we going to fill? Tim Ferriss: How do you request those time slots? Because I imagine you’re not the only people who are thinking about this, right? It makes me think of the data, it’s a meta-analysis long ago looking at judges’ verdicts before or after meals and leniency, right? Elan Lee: Yeah, right. So, how do you get the right slots, yeah. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So, how do you angle for those? Elan Lee: There’s an art to that as well. So we have agents, we have representatives, one for Target and one for Walmart, and these are people who live in those cities, and they live and breathe sales with the sales rep. So, their job is — the very cynical way to say it is they’re like lobbyists but the more — Tim Ferriss: Ambassadors. Elan Lee: Ambassadors, there we go. That’s a much more appropriate way. They have been doing the job for longer than the salespeople have, longer than the buyers have. And as a result, the relationship that they have with the buyers is actually one of education because they’ve seen all the mistakes, they know where all the landmines are, they know how to avoid them. And so part of the art of getting the best meetings, of getting yourself set up the best, is to hire the best agent. Tim Ferriss: How does someone find said agents? Elan Lee: Friends of friends of friends. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: The best ones already have too many clients. You can’t work with them. Tim Ferriss: Right, the usual situation. Elan Lee: Yeah, exactly. But if you have a good enough brand, if you have the right relationships, if you can talk to the right people and if you’re persistent, you can get the right agents. I actually thought we didn’t need an agent at all at first. I was like, “We can just do it, we’re going to show up the day before, we’re going to walk into these meetings,” and some very good friends of mine in the industry said, “You are an idiot, it’s just not going to work.” So we started working with agents and they’re incredible. They know the industry, they can — Tim Ferriss: Now, just to dig into that a little, why wouldn’t that work? Is it that the code of etiquette and the way everything has been set up involves those agents and, therefore, it wouldn’t work or are there other reasons why going in guns blazing without representation wouldn’t work? Elan Lee: Yeah, both. The answer is both. So the buyers are much less likely to take you seriously unless you have an agent in the room. And part of that is just because — Tim Ferriss: I guess part of it is just these fools don’t know how this is done. Elan Lee: Exactly right. Tim Ferriss: Right. They’re showing up to Downton Abbey wearing a tank top. Elan Lee: Exactly right. Tim Ferriss: And they don’t know how to use the silverware. Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: Why should I trust their ability to be a good partner and actually get things done on time if they haven’t done their homework? Elan Lee: Precisely. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: And the other half is you haven’t done your homework. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: You actually don’t know, you actually don’t know how to use the silverware. When we walk into a meeting, the agent has done a year’s worth of work prepping for that meeting. They have made sure the buyers know what you’re going to pitch, how many games you’re going to pitch, what the order of the games is. They’ve made sure that the sales for the previous purchases they’ve made going into the meeting so they already have the confidence in, yes, these people are going to deliver. They’ve made sure that inventory levels are where they need to be so that a meeting doesn’t get sidetracked by them saying “This game is sold out, how did you let that happen?” So many things can go wrong that the agent is fixing before they go wrong so that the meeting stays on the rails and gets you to success. Tim Ferriss: Okay, got it. Elan Lee: It’s a full-time job and, without it — Tim Ferriss: And so that agent is the person who lobbies for the appointment after breakfast for lunch? Elan Lee: Exactly, yes. But you have to know to ask for it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, right. Elan Lee: Because your agent has other clients. They’re going to sit through maybe three, sometimes four meetings in that sell cycle and they’re going to give that prime slot to the one who asks for it. So you’ve got to know to ask for it. Here I am telling you on this podcast, it’s probably going to make my job a little bit harder for the next sales round, but so be it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. People listening need to hop through a few hoops before — Elan Lee: Yeah, fair enough, all right. Tim Ferriss: — they end up being viable competition. Elan Lee: Yeah, yeah, yeah, all right. There’s a few other tricks that — Tim Ferriss: And we are going to come back to, if you’re just developing a game at your kitchen table, what are some of the first steps. So, we’re going to get to that. Elan Lee: Yeah, we’ll get there. Yeah, for sure. Tim Ferriss: But in the meantime, you said a couple of tricks of the trade? Elan Lee: Yeah, there’s a few more. I should be a little careful about what I say but, look — Tim Ferriss: We can always bleep things in edit later. Elan Lee: All right. So, you want to pay attention to, believe it or not, all of the retailers have color themes year by year. So you want to make sure that, when you walk into a meeting, your boxes match that color scheme, it makes it much easier for them to say yes. Tim Ferriss: Had no idea. Elan Lee: Yeah, right, I know. Because why would you? Because why would anybody, right? There’s things like those agents are given permission to read the notes from the all-hands meeting from the company so they know what the company’s priorities are. And so you want to sit down with your agent in advance and say, “Those buyers, what are they going to get promotions and raises based on this year? Is it more throughput at the store? Is it promote online sales? Is it match the color scheme?” Whatever it is, you want to make sure — Tim Ferriss: What are the incentives? Elan Lee: Yeah. And you want to make sure that, when they look at your games, they think, “Oh, I’m really trying to promote online sales this year, whoa, this game would do great on our website. And then the next game, this game would do great on our website as well.” And by the time you get to the end of the meeting they’re like, “Oh, my God, I can get a promotion if I just buy all 10 of these games.” That’s what you want them to walk away with. Tim Ferriss: All right. So, these meetings are huge, we’ve established this. A huge deal. Elan Lee: So important. Tim Ferriss: You mentioned a couple of tricks to the trade. And any other tips, tricks, learnings along the way? Elan Lee: So what happens after those meetings is also very important. Okay. So there’s two things we have to talk about. One is pricing structure and the other is marketing. Tim Ferriss: Yep. Elan Lee: So in the meeting you talk a little bit about both. You have to now include marketing. Remember I said three years ago things were different than today? Three years ago, the marketing plan that you show for your game is largely your own website. Maybe you’ve bought some TV commercials, things like billboards, product placement here and there, things like that. Today, none of that matters. All they care about is social media because that’s the only form of marketing for games that works anymore, so. Tim Ferriss: I should say also it particularly works on, and this is my understanding, on platforms like TikTok or now that other platforms have realized to avoid TikTok consuming their market share, they need to push and reward short-form video. Elan Lee: That’s right. Tim Ferriss: Short-form video. Casual games are perfectly suited to short-form video. Elan Lee: Yeah. And the way that you build the most effective videos for those is you need to inspire, I think, two emotions. One, “I understand what those people are experiencing right now,” And two, “I would like to experience that.” And it took me forever to get to those two sentences. At first it was, “Let’s show gameplay, let’s show setup, let’s show a memorable moment. Let’s show people screaming and yelling because they’re having so much fun.” None of that matters. None of that works. “That looks like fun. I could have that much fun.” That’s it. That’s what you’re trying to show. Tim Ferriss: How does that differ from the first? Elan Lee: Um, it’s very, very focused, you want to — remember we talked about mastery early on? Tim Ferriss: Well, I also asked you guys, because we were talking about this very early on in the process, right? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Also, because if I’m procrastinating doing something hard, I like to talk about the marketing because it just is a lot easier for me to talk about. But I wanted to see examples of videos that had worked for any of your games. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Social posts. And so they were sent over. I was like, “Okay, I think I can deduce why this works.” Often it was one person playing the other person struggling to guess what the other person was doing and one person losing it laughing. Just inconsolably, but in the best possible way, losing it, getting the giggles out of control. Elan Lee: Okay. So I’ll tell you, one of the most effective pieces of media we have ever used was for Poetry for Neanderthals. This has like at this point, I don’t know, tens of millions of views. And all it is — oh, sorry, “Here’s how you play Poetry for Neanderthals. I have to get you, I have a secret word on this card. I have to get you to say that word. And I can only speak using single syllable words. That’s the whole game. If I mess up, someone sitting next to me has a giant inflatable neanderthal club and they get to bonk me on the head.” All right. So there’s our whole game. The best video we’ve ever seen is someone who’s trying to get a person to say the word “garage.” And we know they’re trying to get the person to say the word garage because we put that right on the screen. We show you, “Here’s the secret word, it’s garage.” And they’re just saying, “Car, go here. Car, hole, car hole. This car hole, big car hole.” And everyone’s losing it. And the poor person trying to guess is like, “What the fuck is a car hole? Glove compartment? What are you trying to say?” And then they say, “Vehicle. Multiple syllable word.” And so they get bonked on the head. Okay, here’s why that video is so effective. It’s those two senses. One is, “I see the experience they’re having. I get that.” And the secondary corollary is “I could do better than that.” Tim Ferriss: Is this the video, I think I remember seeing this. This might have been a separate video, but there’s a woman who’s the poet and then there’s the guy next to her, holding the club. Elan Lee: Yeah, so menacing. Tim Ferriss: The ax is going to drop. Yeah. And everyone’s losing it, including the guy at the back. Elan Lee: Because you look at that and you say, “I understand the rules,” immediately. “I understand the experience they’re having. I would like to have that experience.” And that’s what makes for an effective social media video. Tim Ferriss: All right, so how do you pitch that? Elan Lee: Well, we show a lot of examples and we show a track record. We say, “Look, here’s how many views our last round of videos got. Here’s how many likes, here’s how many shares, here’s how many subscriptions.” All this stuff, we show them right there in the meeting. We never had to do that. This is a brand new phenomenon. And we say, “Here’s the type of video that we’re going to craft for this new game,” and we always couch it in those two sentences. “Here’s how we’re going to explain the fun people are having and here’s how we’re going to make the audience feel like they would like to have that much fun as well.” And that’s been very effective for us. So that’s now half the meeting, because every game we start by, I demo the game. Tim Ferriss: It’s social media strategy. Elan Lee: Yes. I demo the game, I pull the game back, we talk a little bit about the pricing structure and the theme and the box and all that. And then we go right into social media strategy for that game. Because I have to spend as much time on that as I did on the game design because they’re equally important now. It’s huge. Such a difference. Tim Ferriss: All right, so for somebody listening who is thinking about making a game, and I really encourage everyone to do that, and I’m just going to flash, this is as good a time as any, just to flash these blank cards that are within every Coyote box and they are color-coded. You can use these to make action cards, which are these different gestures and actions and so on. Elan Lee: Yeah. Those are the templates that we use. Tim Ferriss: These are the templates. You can use them to make Coyote cards, these modifiers. You can use them to make the attack cards which you use to sabotage other people. There are other ways to play those cards. This is intended to invite everyone to basically create their own game by modifying the rules. Elan Lee: That’s right. Tim Ferriss: Or adding new elements that are uniquely their own. You can have fun with your friends, you can have fun with your kids. I mean, this is intended to make you a part of the creative process, which you will be part of anyway, just by the way you play the game but this takes it to another level. And this was a really important element for me. So this will be a warm-up in a sense. You get to try game design, game development light, with these blank cards. But let’s say somebody then decides they want to give it a go, maybe it’s with one of their kids, like you did with your daughter. Maybe it’s by themselves. Who knows? Maybe it’s going to the game shop, local game shop, which I really recommend people do. If you’ve never been to a real proper game shop, go in on a game night when people are set up and also check out the games you might not be inclined to check out. So if you’re a casual gamer, go to a Warhammer night, see what that’s about. Elan Lee: Totally. Tim Ferriss: Check out these different worlds. Elan Lee: Another secret weapon is go to a game shop, find the owner, or even the person behind the counter, someone who knows what they’re talking about. And just say, “I’m looking for a game. What game do you wish more people would give a try?” And you’ll find the gems that way because they know. But maybe the game doesn’t have the best box or the best name or it fell short somewhere and people just aren’t buying it, but they know it’s amazing. That’s where you find them. It’s a great experience. Tim Ferriss: So start testing the waters in that way. It’s so easy to do in a place like Austin. I mean, this is Austin. People might think of game locations and X, Y, Z, they’re all over the place. There happens to be a really vibrant scene here. And if you wanted to, if one wanted to start developing their own game, let’s say they find something that starts to stick. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Okay. We’ve got a tiger by the tail. This seems to be working. They’re play testing. It might take a while, like Settlers of Catan, I think Klaus Teuber had 150 versions before, that’s a complex game. But let’s say they start to develop the game and they’re like, “All right, I would like to try to sell this.” What are the options? What would you say to someone who’s like, they’re smart, they can plan, they’ve operated in the world before, so they’re not new to adulting, but they have no experience in selling games. Elan Lee: There are three paths. I’ll tell you all three paths and then I’ll tell you my favorite one. Tim Ferriss: All right. Elan Lee: Okay. Path number one, self-publishing. Self-publishing is hard, but you can print out your own decks. You can design everything yourself. You can write the rules yourself. You can do absolutely everything yourself. And then you can spend a few thousand dollars, publish a few hundred copies, and send them out to all your friends. Okay. So that’s option one. It sucks. Don’t do that one. It’s just the worst. I mean, you’re just going to make every mistake and you’re not — Tim Ferriss: And you’re going to have to pay for your mistakes. Elan Lee: And you pay for every mistake, and then once you make the mistake, now you can’t take it back and you can’t undo it. Just don’t self-publish. It’s a terrible idea. Okay, there’s number one. That’s not my favorite one. Number two is you go to an existing publisher, Hasbro, Mattel, nowadays Exploding Kittens. You can approach big publishers, pitch your game, and then strike a deal with them where they will handle all the risk, but they will also take most of the reward. You can still honestly get very rich this way, but you have to get into their portfolio, so either you need a track record or you just have to absolutely wow them or you need some other — you have to show up with some bona fides. You can’t just say, “I’m a brand new designer, here’s my brand new game, please publish me.” Tim Ferriss: How would you, maybe there are exceptions where people have wowed them, first time game designer with a game, how does one do that? Elan Lee: You go to a convention. Tim Ferriss: You go to a convention? Elan Lee: Yeah, you go to a convention, you demo your game, they will all show up. They’re like agents recruiting for a sports team. They’re going to show up to all of those places and they’re going to walk the halls and they’re going to check even the smallest booths. And they’re going to even go to the big convention halls where everyone just has their own little folding table or even a temporary folding table. They’re going to look at all of that stuff. So it is possible to do it that way, but you have to keep in mind they have very few slots open and they usually only have one or two agents, scouts looking for games. So your chances of success there are low as a first-time person, much better if you can walk in, if you can schedule a meeting and they will take that meeting and then you can say, “Here’s why you should not say no to this.” Tim Ferriss: What are the things you can do or put in a pitch that increase the likelihood of getting a meeting, outside of being an influencer with 20 million followers on Instagram? Elan Lee: Well, yeah, that helps, but the reason that helps is, what I was going to say is the ability to sell the game, whatever it is, maybe you’re an influencer — Tim Ferriss: By the way, also true of nonfiction writing. Elan Lee: Exactly right. Tim Ferriss: If you’re selling a book. Elan Lee: And for selling a screenplay and for really selling anything, you need to be able to say, “Here’s why people are going to take notice of this thing and why you would be a fool to pass on this opportunity.” That’s hard. Oftentimes the best way to do that is to have already done it, which means your first time out, you need what I’m about to talk about, which is option three. Option three, crowdfunding. This is relatively new, like 10, 15 years old. Tim Ferriss: So it is, I guess, self-publishing in a sense, but you’re getting other people to fund the development. Elan Lee: Two things, yes to that. Exactly right. Other people are funding a hundred percent of the development, which is incredible. But also you are collecting those funds on a platform that promotes the game. People are there watching your video, you’re trying to convince them. Tim Ferriss: It is a discovery platform. Elan Lee: Exactly. Perfectly phrased. It is a discovery platform that was missing 15 years ago. “Watch my self-published YouTube video and hopefully fund my game,” it just didn’t exist. So now people are looking at crowdfunding sites looking for cool new experiences and backing them. And that’s a new invention and that’s really cool. And it’s not my favorite one either. So I just said I picked my favorite and I just pitched three and I said, “None of them are my favorite.” Here’s my actual favorite. A combination of two and three. Start on crowdfunding, especially if it’s your first time out. Learn everything you can. Your first project is probably going to fail. That’s okay. You’ve got nothing at stake. You didn’t lose anything. Fix it. Relaunch it, fix it again. Relaunch it again. Take as many times as you need. There’s nothing at risk here. You’re just learning the process. Awesome. When you get a success on whatever crowdfunding platform you love, now go to those publishers and say, “Here are my bona fides. Here’s proof that this thing is going to sell. I’ve already sold this once. I’ve already gotten 10.” Tim Ferriss: Do you do that before you have shipped the game? Elan Lee: No. Very important. No. Ship the game first. If the only thing you can prove is that you are a train wreck waiting to happen, you will get nothing from them. So ship the game, show that you’re organized, even if it’s a small fulfillment like you sell a hundred copies of your game, show that you can fulfill those hundred copies and then start to show the reactions to those. If you’ve only got a hundred people who bought the game, reach out to every single one of them and beg them to record a video about how much they love your game. And now go to publishers with that. That’s really what you’re searching for. Use crowdfunding as exactly what it is, as a way to launch your new game to then take to step two. Tim Ferriss: Let me ask this. There may be people listening or watching who think to themselves, “That sounds awesome, but wasn’t the heyday of crowdfunding three, four, or five years ago?” Elan Lee: Yes. Tim Ferriss: You hear less about it. Certainly for, let’s say, selling to a hundred people or maybe many, many more, I’m sure there are runaway success campaigns even today, but are there any tweaks that you would add to it? Elan Lee: It’s really tricky. Okay, so here’s what happened with crowdfunding. So we launched on Kickstarter, Exploding Kittens launched on Kickstarter, and by some amazing twist of fate, that was perfect timing. Very few people had heard of Kickstarter. They heard about this funny, silly thing. It was drawn by The Oatmeal. Matt already had this incredibly large audience and people showed up and they said, “Ooh, crowdfunding. Ooh, this thing costs 20 bucks. I’m going to back this thing.” And we had 219,000 people try that thing. Amazing. Unheard of success. Those people then over the next, let’s call it five years, stayed on Kickstarter and they backed other things, other games, other projects, whatever. And what they found was the nature of Kickstarter is such that only about 50 percent of those projects that shipped either the thing that shipped was nowhere close to the thing promised, or the thing never shipped, and they never got their money back. Whatever it is. Tim Ferriss: People got burned. Elan Lee: They got burned, and they had a terrible experience. And now when you say, “Hey, back my Kickstarter,” everyone’s got this memory implanted of, “Oh, that was a bad experience for me. Maybe I even had some great experiences, but I also had those bad ones and this is not worth it. And I’m not going back to that site or any crowdfunding site.” So that’s the problem. We’re not seeing the numbers we used to see because everyone’s walking in with this baggage and it sucks. My only advice is there is now a secondary ecosystem around Kickstarter, other websites that have gotten very good at promoting projects, that have gotten very good at advertising new offerings on Kickstarter and building trust, like if you get on this other — Tim Ferriss: So it’s like a curated site that vets projects. Elan Lee: Exactly right. And here’s the thing, those companies almost always take a percentage of what the maker gets in exchange for helping them with fulfillment, with creation, with everything. So not only are you buying into a trusted ecosystem, but you also know there’s multiple parties involved that are going to work very hard to make sure you get that product. Tim Ferriss: What are some of those companies? Elan Lee: I would have to look them up. Tim Ferriss: Okay. Yeah, no problem. All right, we’ll put maybe links to a few of them in the show notes. Elan Lee: Yeah. Yeah. There’s a ton of them. They all have the word backer in them somewhere, backer found and backer this and backer that. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Okay. We’ll put a couple of links in the show notes. Tim.blog/podcast, you can find it. And I will also just give a shout-out to a friend of mine who at some point you have to meet, maybe you’ve met him already. Craig Mod, does that name ring at all? Elan Lee: No. I don’t know Craig. Tim Ferriss: All right, so Craig is a gem of a human, amazing writer, also very technical as a software engineer, software development expert. And he, at one point, for his beautiful books that he has bound and crafted in Japan, these are works of art, they’re absolutely beautiful. And he created basically a, I don’t know if open source is the right term, but he does have the code available on GitHub for anybody who wants it, called, I think it’s called Craigstarter, which is effectively, if you want to host your own crowdfunding campaign and in his opinion, fix some of the bugs that were difficult to contend with. Elan Lee: Interesting. Tim Ferriss: Then boom, you can do that. Elan Lee: Oh, I love that. Tim Ferriss: And I think he incorporated Shopify and other add-ons, different services could be as modules. I’m sure I’m not using the right terminology, but incorporated into it. Elan Lee: Super clever. I love it. Tim Ferriss: So people can also check that out. And I have two interviews with Craig. You should check out both of them. They’re absolutely fantastic. Elan Lee: Lovely. Tim Ferriss: Okay, so folks can look at these services as basically a stamp of credibility. They will help not only with the promotion if you are so vetted, but with the fulfillment, like that third-party logistics. Elan Lee: That’s right. Now, I don’t think we’re going to see a crowdfunding campaign on the scale of Exploding Kittens these days. There are a few exceptions. You just interviewed one of them, in fact. Tim Ferriss: Brandon Sanderson? Elan Lee: Exactly, out of control success. Tim Ferriss: $45 million, or whatever it was, Kickstarter campaign for fantasy books. Unheard of. Elan Lee: Bonkers. Unheard of. But what I love is that that shows this is not even a remotely dead platform. Tim Ferriss: No. Elan Lee: There is success to be had here. You just have to be creative. I mean he started out with a great fan base. He picked an incredible title, the first word of his campaign was, “Surprise.” No one’s done that before. What does that mean? And just everything about it. Smart on top of smart on top of smart. I loved it. Loved it. So it’s very possible, but it’s also very rare and you have to be smart about it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Well, here’s the thing. It’s possible and who cares? It may not have the gravitational pull that it had five years ago, but if you can’t sell anything in a crowdfunding campaign, you are not going to sell any buyer at mass retail. Elan Lee: Absolutely right. Tim Ferriss: It’s not going to happen. Elan Lee: Absolutely right. Tim Ferriss: And therefore you save yourself years of banging your head against a brick wall when you’re never going to break through. If you get, and this might not sound like good news, but if it’s going to fail, you want to fail as quickly as possible. Elan Lee: It’s great news, as long as you don’t take it personally, as long as you say “This product — “ Tim Ferriss: How many games do you guys screw around with on any level? And how many make the cut? Elan Lee: We probably work on a hundred games a year and less than 20 make the cut. Tim Ferriss: And that’s with all of your experience? Elan Lee: Yeah. That’s probably way higher than it should be. I’m probably pushing forward games that have no right to be pushed forward. But again, you don’t take it personally. You say, “This game is flawed.” And the faster you can figure that out, the faster you can move on to a game that isn’t flawed. Tim Ferriss: So if I heard you correctly then, it’s crowdfunding. You establish some numbers and so on that you can share that show traction at some type, game reactions, et cetera. Then you take all of that to book a meeting at a trade show or a conference or convention with one of these publishers who already has the annual meetings and line reviews. Elan Lee: Exactly right. Tim Ferriss: And you make a pitch to do a deal with them. Elan Lee: That’s my favorite path through this. Tim Ferriss: What deal terms do you need to pay attention to? Elan Lee: Okay, so there is one very important number that you’re going to get, and it’s going to seem like a very low number, but here’s how this works. Most publishers are going to throw a number at you, like two percent. Tim Ferriss: Royalty rate? Elan Lee: Yeah. And you’re going to think, “Wait a second, I was the inventor, I get 80 percent and you’re offering me two percent?” But here’s what that number actually means. They, the publisher, are going to take on all the risk. They’re going to do all the printing, they’re going to do all the relationship management, they’re going to do that sales meeting, they’re supporting hundreds of people on their staff, they’re doing all this stuff that you are not doing. But in exchange for that, that two percent isn’t two percent of the profit, it’s two percent of the revenue. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Top line. Elan Lee: Exactly. And that is a very important distinction. That makes that two percent probably closer to 20 percent, 30 percent once you do all the math. Tim Ferriss: It’s the opposite of Hollywood accounting. Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: It’s not some percentage of net income, which is defined in some Byzantine way to fuck you every which way from Sunday. Elan Lee: Precisely right. Tim Ferriss: If it’s top line — Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So just to reiterate what you just said, two percent is more like 20 plus percent? Elan Lee: Yes, that’s exactly right. Tim Ferriss: Of profit? Elan Lee: Yeah. And you can ask them to break down that math for you. You can say, “Show me the spreadsheet, show me what you’re spending, what your responsibilities are, what mine are. After all of those numbers are crunched, what is the total amount you’re going to spend on this game? Show me your total projections on what’s coming in, show me how much I’m going to make of that.” And then you can start comparing those numbers yourself and see, “Oh, of the money that came in, I’m getting 20 percent of it. Even though this number only says two percent.” Once you crunch that math, this is a pretty decent deal. And you can get higher than two percent. Usually not as a first-time developer, but I’ve seen deals anywhere from two to 12 percent on the super high end. Tim Ferriss: 12, wow. Elan Lee: You’ve got to be a rockstar because at 12 percent, now you’re at 50 percent, and that’s tough to get to. You’ve got to really pull your weight to get numbers like that. So those are what the deals look like. And then after that, then the whole relationship moves into this like, “Okay, now what the hell are we actually making? What is the quality of the cards? What are the components in the box? Are you allowed to change rules?” Tim Ferriss: Quick question, is the deal structure similar to a book publishing contract in the sense that the game developer would get an advance against sales? Or is that — Elan Lee: Sometimes. Tim Ferriss: Sometimes? Elan Lee: Yeah. You can negotiate that. I’ve seen publishers do that or not do that. I will just say for Exploding Kittens, we never do advances. Tim Ferriss: It’s fundamentally different also from, say, nonfiction book publishing in the following sense. If you’re taking a, let’s call it conventional publishing approach, which is very similar to selling the game, it’s like you have an agent. You’ve got the editors, let’s just say, and the publishers who are the buyers of sorts, the editor might be the category buyer but they have to get the okay from the publisher for signing off on deals. Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: And you’ll have your royalty rate, which varies widely, but let’s just say somewhere depending on paperback versus hardcover, up to probably a maximum in conventional deals of 12 to 15 percent of cover, which is also, again, of cover. And then there’s the advance, but the critical difference that I was alluding to is typically when a nonfiction book is sold, you are selling a book proposal, which is a writing sample and a marketing plan. Elan Lee: Wow. Tim Ferriss: And if, and only if, a publisher decides to sign a contract and buy the book, do you get an advance to buy you the time so you can stop doing all of these other things to write the full book, whereas with the game, the game’s got to be ready. Elan Lee: It’s done. Yeah. Now let’s call it 90 percent done, to be fair. And usually when we take on games, we change them significantly just because there’s always a better version, and through testing, we discover it. But the reason we don’t do advances, partially, is exactly what you’re saying. You’re already done. We’re not trying to pull you off of other projects. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. You don’t have to stop your nine to five. Elan Lee: Exactly. Exactly. But the other reason is because I want a partnership. I’m not here to say, “You sold us this game. Now we’re never going to talk again.” I want you here every day. I want skin in the game. We’re going to all make this better together, which is why we do so few partnerships. Tim Ferriss: Now, when you do partnerships, meaning you’re the publisher, you’re paying someone a royalty, how do you typically find those? So for instance, and I imagine a lot of it is you guys canvassing and basically asking the question that you recommended people ask the store owners, “Which game do you wish people played more often?” And then you find something that has the bones of a really good game but a piece of it is shitting the bed. There’s something that is broken and you’re like, “Oh, we can fix that broken thing.” Or do you take cold submissions? How does that work? Elan Lee: We have a form. We have a submission form on our website. We almost never find anything there. It’s hard. It’s time-consuming to go through all of them and honestly, it’s just not the highest quality. We also go to conventions. We look a little bit around there. Sometimes we find a diamond in the rough. Tim Ferriss: That’s a crowded fishing hole, right? Elan Lee: Very crowded. The most effective way are those agents. We talk to those two agents and we say, “Hey, people approach you all the time wanting you to be their agent and you have to turn a lot of them down. The ones that you feel terrible about because they’re such a good game and they just can’t get in the door, send them to us.” And that works really well. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Smart. That’s super smart. Aside from a crowdfunding campaign, what would actually cut through in a submission? Are there any ingredients outside of, here are a bunch of compelling data from a crowdfunding campaign? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Or, “Hey, I’ve designed a hundred hit games.” Elan Lee: Yeah. Yeah. There’s that. Tim Ferriss: Aside from those two, what other types of lines or elements would cut through the noise? Elan Lee: So remember I said that phrase, the way we design games is we don’t make games that are entertaining, we make games that make the players entertaining. 90 percent of the game pitches I see are attempts to be entertaining games and I just immediately dismiss them. That looks like that game is working so hard to entertain the players. I don’t care. The best games, the ones that I pay very careful attention to, are when everything you do in the game creates an interaction between two players. I’m not interested in a four-player game where all four players are playing solitaire. It’s just, who cares? I’m interested in a game where the players are playing the players and I play a card — Tim Ferriss: We tweaked a lot in Coyote based on that. Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: So guiding principle. Elan Lee: And those are the best games. Those are the ones I love the most. Those are the ones I want to play over and over again. Tim Ferriss: And it could be as simple as you might, I’m saying you, the listener or viewer might remember holding your cards facing you versus having the cards available to the entire table. Elan Lee: That’s right. Because now we’re playing all together. And the card I choose, if I have a blind hand, if I have a deck of cards and I choose a card and then I play it, that is me presenting a game to the players. If I have all my available cards face up on the table and everyone can see what I choose, and everyone’s hoping I pick that first card, and I hover my hand over it and then I move to the second card instead and everyone starts groaning and then I play that second card anyway, now it’s me playing the players. And those are the best games in the world. Tim Ferriss: What are some common Achilles heels for games that have the potential to be great and huge successes? And I’m not going to mention names, but we’ve talked about a couple of games that you’ve considered buying or publishing, and I’m wondering what are some of the common weaknesses where you’re, this is a great game, but the reason it didn’t work is X or Y or Z. Elan Lee: All right, so there’s two basic places the games fall apart. One is right off the bat, their boxes suck, or the name sucks. The number of games out there called The Legendary Folklore of Gorgonzel. I can’t remember them, I don’t know what they are. I look at this — Tim Ferriss: Got to throw a CØCKPUNCH in there, and then it’s problem solved. Elan Lee: CØCKPUNCH aside, I would argue that those games, they have no chance of success. Yes, they’re going to sell 10 copies to the 10 people that bought The Legendary Tales of Gorgonzel volumes one through six, and they’re going to buy volume seven. Cool, great. I don’t care. Picking the wrong name, picking a non-descriptive name, putting a picture on the box that does not describe gameplay at all and does not provide a compelling narrative about what experience you are about to have, those games have zero chance of success. And I see that over and over and over again. You can fail right up front. And I’ve even seen the biggest publishers in the world mess this up, especially now that game shelves are so crowded and you don’t have five games to choose from, you have 500 games to choose from. And a game that doesn’t do a good job of saying, “Pick me, pick me, pick me,” you’re just not going to pick, so you will fail right there. Tim Ferriss: Or really complicated packaging too. I’ve seen that a bunch. Elan Lee: Absolutely. Tim Ferriss: Where there’s just so much going on. There’s no one dominant element. It’s like, what am I supposed to look at here? Elan Lee: Yeah, what do you look at first? Tim Ferriss: So you can’t. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: You don’t look at anything, you look at the next box. Elan Lee: It’s just noise. Just noise. We worked very hard on Coyote, on all our games, but I remember having this discussion about Coyote because this is such an important lesson. When you look at this box, we know the first thing you’re going to look at and we know the second thing you’re going to look at and we know the third thing you’re going to look at, and this is a formula, and we crafted this — Tim Ferriss: It’s a formula. Elan Lee: — very carefully. Tim Ferriss: By the way, also exactly what works in old school print advertising. Elan Lee: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Right? Elan Lee: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Header image, headline, subheading. Elan Lee: Exactly right. Tim Ferriss: Text. Elan Lee: Yeah. And those components are all present here. Tim Ferriss: And if you fuck up the order, pardon my French, the eye doesn’t know how to track or it bounces around. Elan Lee: And if there’s other better options right next door, off you go. We hit those three things on a box meticulously, and your reaction should not be, “I’m going to buy that game.” That’s not our goal. Your reaction is, “I’m going to pick up this game and I’m going to turn it over and I’m going to read the back of the box.” And now we’ve got a very different task. Now we have more real estate we can afford. We still know the first thing you’re going to look at, but now we care a little bit less about the second thing. As long as you’ve already got enough interest, you’ve already committed to picking this thing up, now you’re willing to read a little story. As long as you can see the end of that story and you know it’s not too long, you’re going to read a little story. The goal of this is now purchase. I want you to get to the end of this experience and say, “I’ve got to have it. I want this.” Tim Ferriss: And just for people who can’t see this particular visual, and there’s all sorts of stuff on the back of the card, which we won’t get into, but some people might notice interesting things on the back of the cards. The dominant element on the back of the box is how to play. And man, we worked on this a lot too, with basically three panes, step one, step two, step three. “Put cards on the table, then take turns performing them,” that’s step one. And you’ve got a little visual with the salamander action cards. Then next part is “Play cards to help or sabotage other players,” shows two examples. Elan Lee: “Sabotage” was a very carefully chosen word, by the way. Tim Ferriss: Very carefully chosen. And then the last one is “Mess up and you’re out. The last player standing wins.” That’s for competitive mode. Now, one aspect of this that I think is very clever is not sure if you should buy this game? Give us a few seconds to convince you. And then there’s a QR code. Elan Lee: Nobody does that. This is new. Tim Ferriss: I know. What’s the impetus behind this? Elan Lee: This was an idea I had that we’re demoing on this game, first time ever. My idea was “If I went to the store with you, I could convince you to buy my favorite game because I’m going to pitch the hell out of that game.” But I’m not in the store with you, so that’s a problem. My first idea was for every retail location in the world, “Will they let us install a telephone that you can pick up and talk to somebody?” And they said, “No.” My second idea was, “Can I hire a person to stand in every store and convince you to buy the game I want you to buy?” And they said, “Sort of, but you have to pay for all of that.” And I was like, “Oh, that’s not going to work.” And so this was option three. Tim Ferriss: It’s cool, it’s a lot of people. 6,000 plus people. Elan Lee: I know, right? Can you imagine? This is just a little QR code. And the idea is I can’t stand next to you for every store, but I can tell you what I would’ve said had I been standing there. And so you scan this code and it’s just a 15-second video. In this case, it’s me, Tim, saying, “Listen, you’re holding a game in your hands. It’s the greatest thing you’ll ever see. Let me try to convince you.” And it’s just a pitch. It’s just, if I were standing next to you in the store, here’s why you should buy this game. And I don’t think a lot of people are going to scan that code, to be fair. But for those who do, they’re going to have the experience of a friend telling them, “You should trust me. This is going to be great, trust me.” Tim Ferriss: And it doesn’t take up that much real estate either. It’s an easy addition to the box. Once again, test it. Right. Let’s test it. Elan Lee: Test it. And what’s the worst that can happen? Tim Ferriss: See what happens. And I also want to revisit something you mentioned earlier, which is that royalty rate, whether it’s two percent, it’s up to 12 percent in the book world. Let me take the book world and the publishing world in the book publishing sense is changing a lot, but it’s also quite consistent over time. Different things have changed, sure, audio as a format has grown tremendously and become highly prized now versus 10 years ago when I could carve out those rights, it’s a lot harder to do now if you’re going to do the conventional route. But some folks will look at the percentages and they’ll say, “Well, wait a second, max 15 percent after an escalator, I’m starting off at 12 percent for hardcover. That’s ridiculous. I wrote the whole thing, da, da, da, da, da. I want to make the lion’s share.” There are some instances where you can make that work, but I will say just a few things. When you begin, for most people, unless you are excellent at running a meticulously managed business, it’s actually pretty tough to beat those numbers. In part because you’re going to be sacrificing distribution, so the top of the funnel number is going to be different. Secondly, when you factor in paying various agents, various distributors, and all of these little costs that for you, without any scale of having a thousand skews in a department dedicated to it, you start to very quickly approach that number. Elan Lee: Very quickly. Tim Ferriss: And by the way, you’re running a real business. This is not the easiest thing in the world to do at all. And I will probably do some experiments on that side of the equation in terms of “self-publishing,” which I would put in quotation marks because it’s going to be augmented pseudo self-publishing on a few levels. But I would only have the confidence of doing that myself currently, because I’ve gone through the conventional route multiple times and I’ve also run quite a few businesses. But if you’ve never, what Stephen Key, I mentioned earlier, one simple idea for licensing, what he might call venturing, running a business, do not underestimate the value of your time and sanity also. Elan Lee: It’s so true. Tim Ferriss: Because he’s, “Hey, look, I’ll take the licensing deal, maybe I’ll negotiate the number up a little bit.” But he’s like, “I can do 12 of those a year.” Elan Lee: That’s right. That’s exactly it. Tim Ferriss: And it adds up to a lot. And I have no employees, no supply chain issues. Elan Lee: No risk. Tim Ferriss: No, “Oops, that was printed the wrong way and now I have thousands of books —” Elan Lee: You have to recall those. Oh, my God. Tim Ferriss: “— that are sitting in my garage unsold, gathering dust and mold.” Elan Lee: Let me tell you the simplest example of the difference between doing it yourself and getting help, valuing your time. Our very first game Exploding Kittens, I needed to put a barcode on the box because it has to sell in retail. I go, I’m like, I’m going to research this, this can’t be too hard. I do the research and I find this website and it’s, you’ve got to pay some little subscription, 100 bucks a year, whatever it is, and you can generate unlimited barcodes. Amazing. I generate a barcode, I put it on the box. That wasn’t so hard. Then Target’s like, “Well, this is the wrong format.” I’m like, “Okay.” I spend another 100 bucks, I get a different format bar, put it on. They’re like, “We need a different barcode based on the palette that it’s in.” And then I talk to Walmart and they’re like, “Yeah, we use a different barcode format and we need this barcode to represent whether it was picked up in China or Mexico or Poland, so you actually need three different ones. Oh, and by the way, if it’s bundled with other games, we need a fourth one. And by the way, if it ships into Arkansas, we need a fifth.” And I was just like, “Help. Oh, my God, help.” And that’s the difference. You should not get good at this. Why would you want to get good at that? Tim Ferriss: What’s funny is I was actually going to bring up the example of the UPC codes and the ISBN and all this stuff because I also went down that rabbit hole. I’m like, “How hard could it be?” Elan Lee: Right, right. Tim Ferriss: “Oh, this is easy.” And lo and behold, actually it’s a lot of brain damage. I’m not saying that no one should Venture in the sense of self-funding or self-publishing, but it is a lot harder and much more consuming than most people realize. Elan Lee: And there’s no reason, unless you want to do it for a living, there’s no reason to get good at it. There’s no upside there. Tim Ferriss: And do it for a living meaning handle those types of details. Elan Lee: Right, exactly. Tim Ferriss: Okay. Elan Lee: Anyway, we have a barcode person who does it for a living. She’s quite good. I’m so happy she’s on my team. Tim Ferriss: All right, so on the side of selling games, what else have we not touched on? Any other aspects? Elan Lee: Let’s see. Another thing I learned along the way is there’s two kinds of selling. One is everything we’ve been talking about today. And your expectation is, “I have sold you a game, the game is now your responsibility. And we’ve negotiated a price, you, the retailer, own this game now and you’re going to sell it.” The second kind is the kind that we actually engage in, which is you do own this game, but there are restrictions on how you can sell it. Tim Ferriss: Can you explain that again? When you say you own this game, you mean a retailer? Elan Lee: You, the retailer, have purchased this palette of games from me. Tim Ferriss: I get it. All right. Sorry, I was just clarifying because people might’ve heard that as you own the IP of the game. Elan Lee: Sorry, sorry, sorry. Yes. Tim Ferriss: You are buying an inventory of this game. Elan Lee: Correct. Now, what if the game doesn’t sell very well? Whose problem is that? Well, if you didn’t think that through and it’s just a straight sale, they can put it in a bargain bin or they can sell it to somebody else who’s then going to sell it. Or if you really didn’t negotiate it, they can force you to buy it back from them. The restrictions on what happens to the game, what they’re allowed to do post-sale is so meticulous and these contracts get so long. And this is another thing, you don’t want to get good at this. You just need to hire someone who has seen every imaginable mistake and knows what to argue for. And oftentimes the retailers don’t care that much about this part, especially because they have a lot of faith. This thing’s going to do well. But when it goes poorly, if it goes poorly, and we’ve had a few examples of this, what do you do next? In the case of something as simple as Amazon, Amazon has a terrible policy for returns. Namely, they will accept all returns and it is the vendor’s responsibility, my responsibility. You buy Exploding Kittens from GameKnight, you play the game, you damage all the cards because you spilled beer all over them, you put them back in the box the next day after you had a great time and you return it and now that’s my cost. And that happens hundreds of times a week. It sucks. There’s also this thing where people will buy counterfeit games and they’ll buy, then, the real version. They’ll buy a counterfeit for a dollar, they’ll buy the real version on Amazon, they’ll keep the real version, they’ll return the counterfeit and now that’s mine as well. And I just spent $20 on that stupid counterfeit version because that’s coming back to me. All of this stuff has to be thought through in advance and it’s tricky, because some retailers, the Targets and the Walmarts in the world, they are so willing to work with you on that stuff. Amazon, not so much. They’re just like, “Oh, you don’t like our policy? All right, well maybe a different platform is for you.” It’s hard. It’s really hard. Tim Ferriss: And I should say that I’ve run into, when I’ve talked about termination clauses or what do we do when everyone’s pissed off and things aren’t working? Because really that’s the only time that you’re going to go back and look at the agreement, which is why Gary Keller, famous for his real estate empire, said, “You should really call them disagreements.” The only time you’re going to look at them is when things are really going sideways. Elan Lee: That’s right. Tim Ferriss: And there are some people I’ve spoken to about the importance of these things, like, “Wow, that’s really pessimistic.” I’m like, “No, no, no.” Let’s understand the consequences of not going through this. I know so many examples of entrepreneurs who actually had a chance at a runaway success and they did not pay attention to these terms for, say, a QVC or a huge retailer. And this could happen with Kickstarter as well, of course, they get overextended because now they have orders for God knows how much inventory that is well beyond their capacity, their experience, their financial means. And in their mind, let’s take out the Kickstarter or crowdfunding, but they don’t think about the return policy and they get the hug of death. They overextend themselves financially to produce the inventory, they ship it, and then any number of things can happen. It might be net 270 payment terms. Elan Lee: Oh, God. Tim Ferriss: It could be just — Elan Lee: So brutal. Tim Ferriss: — cash flow suicide right on the front end. And on top of that you might get all of it shipped back to you — Elan Lee: All of it. Tim Ferriss: — and it’s your problem. And then that — Elan Lee: It’s so tragic. Tim Ferriss: — is the hug of death and you’re done. Elan Lee: And then you’ve seen this, you’ve seen this picture. You have this friend whose apartment is filled with products and it’s taken over their living space and they have no way to move it. Tim Ferriss: I did that myself early on. I made an audiobook product. I was going to sell millions of this thing. Oh, my God. Didn’t do any market testing, none of that stuff, just high on my own supply. And I had an entire garage full of these things that just melted in the heat ultimately. And at the time though, that was a huge financial risk. I didn’t take so much risk that it torpedoed me, but if I had had that level of self-delusion and lack of experimentation a little later on, it very easily could have been a recipe for disaster. Elan Lee: Totally. Look, there’s so many ways to mess this up. There’s so many ways to mess this up. And the only good news is there is someone out there who has messed it up in every possible way. Tim Ferriss: Or represented people who have messed it up — Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: — in every possible way. Elan Lee: And those are the people you have to work with. You have to. If you don’t, the risk you’re taking on is just massive. Luckily, I had some very good advice early on from people who said, “Don’t take this on yourself. Just don’t do this.” And it’s the best advice I ever got. Tim Ferriss: And I think maybe tell me if this is overreaching on my part, but don’t take this on yourself now in the sense that after you’ve had 10 mega successes and you actually are fluent in retailese and you have the relationships, all right, now you can take some calculated risks. Elan Lee: And now you can hire the people that you would otherwise contract, now you can pull them in-house. Because now you can afford their salaries and now you want them to only be working on your own products. Great. That’s a huge mark of success and really that is exactly the way you reinvest in your own company. Tim Ferriss: And to reiterate just a few things, if you want to develop a game, number one, you can just develop it for your family, your friends, and keep it small. And I will just say in the book world, a lot of later mega successes have started out that way. You don’t have to go for scale, which I think can be a very dangerous word out of the gate. But as you mentioned, you can also, with the blank cards in Coyote, you can get a taste of it, see if you like it, then you can use the books that you recommended. And there are certainly other resources, we’ll put things in the show notes, to play around with prototyping. Look at these initial cards. These are blank cards with Sharpie writing on them. Elan Lee: That’s it. Tim Ferriss: That’s it. Elan Lee: That’s literally it. Tim Ferriss: That’s it, that’s the entire thing. And you can also find kits online, you can find them anywhere you want. Amazon has gaming kits where there are blank dice and cards and so on so you can workshop it. Elan Lee: Easy. It’s so easy. Tim Ferriss: It’s like Build-A-Bear for games basically. Elan Lee: That’s right. Tim Ferriss: And what I would add to that is you don’t need to run a big business to be a successful game designer. Elan Lee: Absolutely. Tim Ferriss: In fact, I would imagine most of the legendary game designers are not running companies. Elan Lee: No, definitely not. Tim Ferriss: They’re designing games and licensing them. And man, there are some legends out there. Elan Lee: Legends. They’ve created incredible games and they’ve generated gigantic wealth for themselves because in success, that two percent deal, that five percent deal, whatever it is, that faucet doesn’t turn off, that’s in perpetuity. In summary, I don’t think the games business is going anywhere. Tim Ferriss: And also there is a lot of room to innovate. There still is room. There’s so many games, but I wouldn’t have even attempted to create a game had I not thought there was space. Elan Lee: The thing is, it’s like saying, is there still space in the book industry, in the movie industry? All a game is is an idea delivered in a new way. When are we going to run out of ideas? When are we going to run out of delivery mechanisms? The answer to both of those individually is never. Combine them both together and it’s just build games forever. You’ll always have a new way — Tim Ferriss: Option. Elan Lee: — to deliver it. Tim Ferriss: All right, so I’m trying to think of anything that we missed. I do have a tantalizing offer for listeners and viewers just for fun because why not? And we will have also mentioned that in the intro. But before I get to that, anything critical that we’ve forgotten? Is there anything that we have left out or any other resources, people to watch, maybe people to Google and Wikipedia maybe? Anything at all? Elan Lee: All right. I’ve got two. I’ve got two that are interesting. One is there is a podcast I quite like for game design, it’s called Fun Problems, it’s with Peter and AJ. And all they do is they talk about game design. Now, they do talk about more hardcore games than I am accustomed to. It’s a wide range of topics, but it’s fun stuff and it’s worth listening to if you want to know more about game design. And the second thing is, because of you. Because of you, because of this process, this journey that we’ve been on over the last few years, I realized that I don’t document any of this ever. I never talk about what goes into a game design, I never talk about where to buy blank cards, and I never talk about why anybody can do this and what the process is like. I’ve started recording it and I started for the first time, I can’t believe I’m saying this, I actually started a YouTube channel and you can actually go and watch these instructional videos. Literally if you want to make a game, the whole idea is: here is how to make a game from scratch. Nobody’s watching right now, but — Tim Ferriss: YouTube.com at Elan Lee, that’s E-L-A-N-L-E-E. You can also just search him on YouTube. The first result will be our podcast together. Elan Lee: That’s true. Tim Ferriss: Episode one. And then within the first few results, you’ll also find it. But I’m pretty sure the URL is YouTube.com/@ElanLee. And let’s finish up with a few things. The first will be the tantalizing offer that I mentioned. The tantalizing offer is this, there’s no purchase required whatsoever, so if any sweepstakes sharks are out there, take it easy, take it easy. This is going to be just a fun little, it’s not even a competition, just a fun little experiment that I want to run. *** [Interview pauses] 02:46:00 to 02:48:14 Tim Ferriss: Hi, everyone, Tim here with an update, as details have changed since that first conversation with Elan. Here’s the tantalizing offer that I wanted to share with you. You have two very easy ways to enter for a chance to win a trip to a secret Los Angeles mansion for an unforgettable day or evening with me and Elan and maybe some special guests. Here’s how. Option number one, simply visit any Target or Walmart and take a fun photo or video with a Coyote game. No purchase necessary. Option number two, if you already bought Coyote, record yourself playing the game with friends or family. That’s it. I would love to see it. Then share your photo or video on Instagram or Tik Tok or both and tag me and ExplodingKittens. You can find us easily, but I’m @TimFerris on both. That’s @ Tim F-e-r-r-i-s-s and Exploding Kittens is ExplodingKittens on Tik Tok and @GameOfKittens on Instagram. So share your photo and or video on Instagram and or Tik Tok. Put them everywhere. Why not? And tag both me and Exploding Kittens. Longtime listeners know that I have a love of deadlines. This is how things actually get done. So, the deadline to post is August 17. That means that 10:00 p.m. PDT August 17. By then, you need to have posted and done all this stuff. By August 31st, we’ll randomly select five winners from people who post. Each winner will receive roundtrip airfare within the US, one night at a hotel, and will join us at our secret LA mansion party. And I think the legal elves wanted me to mention that that’s going to be coach airfare. So, just to be super clear, important legal disclaimer. No purchase necessary. Open to US residents aged 18 or older. So no little kids, no minotaurs allowed. Void where prohibited. Winners selected at random. Odds depend on number of eligible entries. Travel dates must align with the event likely in September. We are still finalizing the time with the busiest man in show business, Elan Lee himself. For official rules, eligibility details, and final date, please visit tim.blog/rules. So, go ahead, post a creative Tik Tok or Insta real or a photo with Coyote by August 17th, 10 p.m. PDT. Tag us and you might just be celebrating with us in Hollywood this fall. Now, back to the episode. *** [Interview resumes] Tim Ferriss: What else? Anything else to add? I have a little bit. I have one more thing I want to say. Elan Lee: Oh, okay. I want to hear one more thing. Tim Ferriss: I just wanted to thank you so much for allowing me to be part of this incredible ride — Elan Lee: Oh, my goodness. Tim Ferriss: — and just collaborating on the game. It’s been so meaningful for me and so much fun and so great to get closer with you and your family, and we’ve all been traveling together since. Elan Lee: I love it. Tim Ferriss: And to work with the incredible team that you have at Exploding Kittens. I’m not going to mention them all because there are quite few — Elan Lee: So many. Tim Ferriss: — but it’s just been such a joy and a dream come true to actually have this thing in my mind that was floating around that I’ve always wanted to do. And now here it is and people can get it. Elan Lee: Tim Ferriss made a game. Look, here’s the thing — Tim Ferriss: I’m thinking — Elan Lee: — you’re so welcome and thank you. We have limited time here and you have to choose your endeavors wisely, and this was one of the wisest choices I’ve ever made. Tim Ferriss: Oh, thanks, man. All right. We’re going to go get a fantastic meal. It’s Texas, so probably a bunch of meat, barbecue. Who knows, maybe some tequila and make an appearance unbidden. You never know. Strange things happen out here in Austin, Texas. And for everybody listening, we will link to all sorts of things, many resources that will help you think about how you might create a game. You could start with the blank cards in Coyote. Those will actually teach you a lot, I think, as you begin to experiment with these different elements. Elan Lee: Because you’re going to fail, because your first few are not going to work and you’ll learn why. Tim Ferriss: And then if you run out of blank cards, look, just go get some blank cards. Just go buy a blank deck and you can use those. But this is something anyone can do. You did this with your daughter when she was how old? Elan Lee: Four. Tim Ferriss: Four. This is an incredibly fun family activity. It’s an incredibly fun friend activity and it gets you off of your screens. It’s not good for you folks. Elan Lee: So important. Tim Ferriss: They are tools, but there is a point at which the tools become our masters and that is where a lot of the poison seeps in around the cracks. Elan Lee: This thing builds memories. That’s what you should be doing. That’s what your phone isn’t doing. This is building memories. Tim Ferriss: Building memories with some durability, not ephemera that get pushed out of your head as soon as you watch the next 10-second clip. This is something I’ve wanted to do for so long and I’m thrilled that it’s here. Fingers crossed. I’m still nervous as hell, obviously. But we’ve done so much play testing. Hundreds of people have play tested at this point and have made these fine-tuning tweaks along the way. I would love everybody to think about your life as a collection of games. You may not be aware of which games you’re playing just yet, but rest assured in some respects you are playing games and you get to choose more games than you realize. Most of them are optional, not all of them. Sure, we have responsibilities as adults and so on, but this is a way to open up that Pandora’s box of possibility. And we’ll include a lot of resources in the show notes, so tim.blog/podcast, just search Coyote. That’ll probably be the easiest way to find it. C-O-Y-O-T-E. And another time I’ll explain the backstory there, which is pretty wild, but for another time. And until next time, as always, be a little kinder than is necessary, not just to others, also to yourself. Play wisely. Find fun problems. And I’m going to check out that podcast. And life is short, have fun while you’re here, folks. And until next time, thanks for tuning in. Δ Δ Comment Rules: Remember what Fonzie was like? Cool. That's how we're gonna be — cool.

This is a very special episode for me, one I’ve been looking forward to publishing for months. It features a behind-the-scenes look at my latest creative project, my new game COYOTE. COYOTE is a fast, casual card game I created with Elan and the Exploding Kittens team. It has been my obsession for two years. I worked really hard on every aspect of this one (concept, mechanics, art, you name it)! You can finally buy it everywhere, including Amazon, Target, Walmart, and 8,000+ retail locations worldwide. It’s been a hit with 100+ test families, my friends, and at conferences around the world. It now produces guaranteed laughs with kids, adults, tipsy people, serious people… all who enjoy unleashing their inner trickster. If you’ve benefited from my podcast, newsletter, books, or anything at all, please grab a copy or two! It only costs $10-12 and can provide hours upon hours of fun. It takes minutes to learn and 10 minutes to play. Under the hood, it’s also designed to be a good workout for your brain. If you’ve ever wanted to learn how to get a product on the shelves of something like Walmart or Target, or simply create a game, this podcast covers it all. P.S. One last thing: read to the end for a very fun surprise that involves a mystery Hollywood party.

This is another episode of The Tim Ferriss Show. I’m Tim Ferriss and I’m sitting with a friend of mine who I brought to my podcast with a secret agenda that has ended up two years later with a very, very not-so-secret-for-long outcome that we’re going to talk about, Elan Lee. Elan Lee: Thanks. Tim Ferriss: Nice to see you again. Elan Lee: It’s nice to see you too. That was a secret agenda. That was a two-year-in-the-making secret agenda. Tim Ferriss: Two years in the making. So what we’re going to do in this conversation, and I just hijacked his bio because I’ve had too much caffeine, so I’m going to let him do the self-intro in a second. But we’re going to give you a peek behind the curtain, under the hood, open the kimono, choose your metaphor. We’re going to talk about the creative process, the development process, thinking about distribution, retail, all of these things which I have not heard discussed anywhere else in depth. Elan Lee: You buried the lead. All of that stuff of — Tim Ferriss: Of a game that we created that from the very beginning was something I’ve wanted to do my whole life, which is create a game. I was raised, protected in some ways by Dungeons & Dragons as a kid. It was my refuge from bullying and also just the straight boredom of most of my schooling at the time. And that immersive experience, the ability to get lost in a world of imagination and fun and laughter and emotion was so incredibly important. It was so formative for me that the seed was planted really early. And I think you know this because I probably sent you a photograph of this at one point. I still have all of my modules. I have The Player’s Handbook, First Edition, Dungeon Master’s Guide, all of the dice, everything from when I was a kid. I’ve kept it to this day. Elan Lee: I love this, I love this. But hold on. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: If you’re not going to say it, I’m going to say it. Tim Ferriss made a game. Tim Ferriss: I did. Elan Lee: That’s amazing. Tim Ferriss: It took me 47 years, but here we are. So the game, I’ll just show it to camera for people who want a visual who are not watching this. If you’re listening, you can go to tim.blog/coyote. So I’m giving a bit of what you might call foreshadowing in the biz. But this is the game. It is a card game. It’s called Coyote. That name did not come easily. We went through about 537 different names and lots of testing and we’ll talk about some of that. But this is the game and it’s effectively, I’d like to hear your pitch because we have slightly different approaches, but I would say it is rock-paper-scissors on steroids. So there are God knows how many, maybe 20 different gestures, something like that, 66 total cards. And you can play cooperatively where you’re all trying to beat the game together or competitively where you can sabotage individual players, throw curveballs of all different types, and that relates to the name Coyote, if you think about the trickster mythology associated with Coyote. Elan Lee: Yeah Tim Ferriss: We never got to your bio. Who the hell are you? Elan Lee: Oh, that’s the least interesting part of this whole thing. Tim Ferriss: No, I know, but it puts it in perspective and just explain the company a bit, the scope of it, et cetera Elan Lee: I love talking about games, I hate talking about myself. So I will try. Tim Ferriss: That’s why it takes someone like me to force you to do it. Elan Lee: Yeah. Okay, here we go. My name is Elan Lee. I am the co-creator and CEO of Exploding Kittens. I believe we’re the number one independent game studio in the world, something like that. I don’t know. We’ve sold a whole bunch of games. We’ve sold 60 million games at this point and been running that company for 10 years now. And before that I was the chief design officer at the Xbox and before that I worked at a pet store. Tim Ferriss: And for people who want the full journey, including the sort of magical tinderbox that was Kickstarter way back in the day, how this whole adventure started 10 plus years ago, listen to the first conversation that I did with Elan. I had wanted to make a game and quickly realized that an RPG, something like Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game, was going to be too complicated for me and my friends as adults to play. It would be too hard for me to recruit my friends where you have, let’s just say, a full day, then you have dinner, maybe you have a few drinks, and then you have an hour before people split. There’s no way I’m going to get someone to build, for instance, a chaotic good gray elf, which was my orientation, and work from there. It’s just not going to happen. And meanwhile, about maybe it was a year or two years before I invited you on the podcast, I found this game Poetry for Neanderthals and holy shit, had so much fun with that with my friends. I thought, “Okay, I think I want to tilt my game dreams,” which at that point had no real direction, “towards something more casual.” But in the meantime, I’d also been listening to all sorts of podcasts and so on that we’ll get to. But you’ve explained your background. Elan Lee: Well, hold on. So what you just described is exactly why I started Exploding Kittens, because I also — okay, a little bit different. Unlike you, I, when I encounter those crazy two and four and six-hour games, I am immediately turned off. I can’t focus for that long. I can’t understand the rules. If it takes longer than five minutes to explain a game, I am gone. I have no ability to play that game. And so the whole reason I started this company, and I think the whole reason that you made the pivot from giant role-playing games to being interested in the creation of casual fast-party games is this golden rule of two minutes to learn, 15 minutes to play because nothing’s at stake there, right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: You’re going to learn it. You’re either going to love the game or you’re going to hate it, but whatever, you committed five minutes total to that thing. And I love the games where after the five-minute commitment, you’re still going to play for two hours. But they’re going to be in these little five-minute sessions over and over and over again. And it sounds like that’s the experience you had, which makes me so happy because that means mission accomplished. That’s exactly what I wanted to build. Tim Ferriss: And we’re going to talk about different rules or tenets that you have because what I want to do in this conversation, we’re definitely going to talk about the process of building this game because I am really, really happy with it and really proud. Elan Lee: It’s so good. You should be. It’s so good. Tim Ferriss: And we’ll have a lot to talk about. But the motivation also of basically showing the cards, I’m going to use so many mixed metaphors here, is to teach people game design and explain why this has possessed such a toehold in my mind for so long. Elan Lee: Yeah. Well, you went through a journey and I’m excited looking at that journey through your eyes of, “I don’t even know what I want to build, but I know I want to build a fun experience that I would enjoy, that my friends would enjoy,” all the way through to this thing is at every Walmart and Target in North America. That journey is incredible and you got to see it for the first time. You absolutely drank from the firehose here. This was fun for me because I had to walk you through this, right? You’ve never sold a game before. So walking through the process of how you make a game and how you sell a game, it doesn’t work the way people think. So retailers have a buyer per category. So if anybody wants to sell something to a retailer, you want something in Target or Walmart or Amazon or Barnes & Noble. The way it works is you have to convince the buyer for your category to take your thing, right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: They have limited shelf space. It’s very precious real estate. So you have to convince them that your thing is better than anybody else’s thing. And twice a year they have these things called line reviews.The buyers have to buy games for next year, right? They need to put stuff on the shelf. There’s only a certain number of meetings they can physically have in a period of time because it’s usually one or two or maybe three people. So they take as many meetings as they can. It’s usually a dozen, maybe two dozen. And in those meetings — Tim Ferriss: In your case, with different game manufacturers, different studios. Elan Lee: Exactly. So they’ll take a meeting with Hasbro and they’ll take a meeting with Mattel and all the big guys. And in those meetings, 20, 30, 50 games are pitched to them in every single one of those meetings. And then they’ll make a decision on which ones they’re going to purchase and stock for the next year. So that’s line review. The tricky parts for line review is one, you got to do a great job, but even before that, you got to get that meeting, right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: They only have time for a certain number of meetings. So you have to put yourself in a position where you can get in that room. Tim Ferriss: All right, so we’re going to talk strategy and tactics for line review in a minute because, and take this as a compliment, you are one of the best in-person salespeople I’ve ever seen. Elan Lee: That could also be an insult, but I’ll take it, I’ll take it. Tim Ferriss: No, it’s not an insult. No, no, it’s not an insult. Everybody’s in sales, whether they like to admit it or not, whether you’re selling ideas, you’re selling a position, a perspective, if you want to call it deal making. This is what I used to say in my class, my guest lecture that I taught for 10 years, once or twice a year in high-tech entrepreneurship. I would start off by saying, “Who here wants to be in sales?” No hands would go up and I would say, “Well, I’ve got some good news and I’ve got some bad news. Bad news is you’re all in sales. And let me explain why. If you want to call it deal making, fine, you’re going to have to negotiate. You don’t get what you deserve. You get what you negotiate.” Elan Lee: That’s well said. Tim Ferriss: “And you get what you can present in a very persuasive way.” I was like, “The good news is you can learn it.” Elan Lee: Awesome. Tim Ferriss: This is a coachable, learnable skill, which I completely still believe. There’s some people who may have a little bit of extraversion, charismatic reality, distortion, field advantage, but you can become excellent even if you start with zero raw materials. Okay, so the journey, wanted to make a game my whole life, but it was this vague, “Maybe someday. God, wouldn’t it be nice?” Elan Lee: Let me just poke at that for a second. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, sure. Elan Lee: Why? Tim Ferriss: The why is I wanted to imbue someone else’s experience with the magic I felt playing D&D. Elan Lee: Well said. Tim Ferriss: That’s it. Or much easier games, right? It’s such a simple game. I used to play Sorry and Monopoly. And as a young kid, I just thought Sorry was the most hilarious thing when you could look someone in the eyes and go, “Sorry,” and knock their stuff off the board. I didn’t always respond well when it happened to me. It doesn’t have to be the incredibly immersive, complex game that D&D is, although I still think that is just like Gary Gygax and the team way back in the day, holy cow. Also, by the way, for people who don’t know, Gen Con, huge convention, started out around Lake Geneva and was, I believe, created by the TSR guys way back in the day. Elan Lee: I believe that’s right. Yeah. Yeah, Gen Con from Lake Geneva and then was the Generals Convention, and now is nothing. Now Gen Con doesn’t stand for anything because it’s in Indianapolis. But anyway, sorry. It was an aside. Tim Ferriss: It’s an aside. So that was the kind of impetus behind wanting to make a game, but it didn’t have any form. And then I suppose it was maybe two and a half, three years ago, I was like, “Okay, I’d like to actually take a deeper dive here.” Because there are lots of things we have on our, say, list of New Year’s resolutions. For instance, for a long time I had “Develop the side splits like Jean-Claude Van Damme.” Never happened, but it was there every fucking year and it just got punted. I was like, “Well, didn’t do it. Okay, this year is the year.” But there was no plan, there were no deadlines, there were no constraints, which is the power of constraints, which we’ll probably talk about. Elan Lee: Absolutely, yes. Tim Ferriss: It is so critical. It’s not just critical. It is additive to have constraints, which seems like a contradiction, but it’s not. Well, we’ll, I’m sure, get to that. So I started looking at different options and the catalyst for this actually was something way back in the day, some of you will remember called The Legend of CØCKPUNCH, and that was an NFT project — remember those? Which raised two million bucks for fundamental science and mechanistic studies basically related to mental health. So all the proceeds from that, if you want to look it up, it’s easy to find Legend of CØCKPUNCH. But all the proceeds went to a nonprofit foundation, which then funds mental health, therapeutic research and things related to that. But in the process of doing that, I got to, with very low stakes because I think it’s helpful when possible, especially if you’re an intrepid beginner wading into unfamiliar creative waters, make the stakes super, super low, right? And even before this podcast, it’s like, “Okay, this is a very unusual conversation where it’s like, “Look, we’re not doing this live. If we really don’t like it, we can scrap the whole thing.” So reduce, reduce, reduce the pressure and the stakes until you can get started, right? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: With writing, I got the advice long ago, two crappy pages per day. That’s it. Elan Lee: Love it. Tim Ferriss: And then you actually put pen to paper. Elan Lee: Yeah, the overlaps are enormous with games. But, yeah, yeah. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah. Super related. Also the iterative process. All right, so using The Legend of CØCKPUNCH as this pretext, basically I started writing fiction and so I wrote these very, very, it turned out to be very involved, very viable fantasy histories and pieces, tying all of these greater houses together and then having these protagonists, the father and then the son, who’s Tyrolean, and yada, yada, yada, yada. And I still think there might be something there, but in the process of creating that, I thought to myself, “This would actually make a fantastic game. And it wouldn’t have to be as complicated as D&D, but you would have allies, you would have age old amenities, would have different strengths, certain strengths that cancel out other strengths, weaknesses that can be taken advantage of.” And that led me to start listening to a podcast called Think Like a Game Designer with Justin Gary, which is outstanding. I recommend people check it out. And a lot of the focus there, not entirely, but a lot of the focus there was on trading card games, alternately called collectible card games, I guess. Wizards of the Coast who created Magic: The Gathering, patented and trademarked one of them. So they seem to be used interchangeably. But Justin, also former high-level competitive Magic: The Gathering player, has a lot of knowledge around that world. He’s developed some incredibly successful games in that genre where you’re building a deck, you’re buying certain cards or decks with the hopes of getting certain cards and assembling your toolkit basically. And that was initially where my mind went in terms of game concept. But I realized a few things really quickly. I was a D&D guy, which predated Magic: The Gathering. My brother was a Magic: The Gathering guy. But I’ve never really played Magic. And when I began to delve into it, I was like, “You know what? I would like to think of this as D&D light, but this is incredibly nuanced.” Right? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: To be good at this — Elan Lee: Oh, for sure, yeah. Tim Ferriss: — it is incredibly nuanced. And also if you’re against someone who is really experienced or just has their mind wired for it, you are going to be obliterated. Elan Lee: Absolutely right. Tim Ferriss: And that’s what happened to me playing a friend of mine, kudos to Mike, just got slayed. And God bless Mike, he’s like a number of my friends who just kind of want to watch you die slowly in this agonizing ill-fated gameplay where you’re kind of whimpering along until they put you out of your misery. Elan Lee: Yeah, yeah, you play a card, he said, “Isn’t this cute? You think you’ve got it. Watch this.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Which is just not really my thing. So I thought to myself, okay, looking at some of the casual games I really like, there is an opportunity, and this will come back later, for the underdog or the person who is behind to win. So there’s an element, it is skill-based, but there’s an element of chance and this is going to come back. So then Poetry for Neanderthals, I don’t know how I found it initially, frankly. I think I probably went into a game shop and I was like, “Hey,” and this relates to why, as an adult, I want to spend less time in front of screens and ultimately if I look back and do this thing every year called a past year review, people can find it online, you can read all about it and do it yourself. You don’t have to buy anything, past year review. Where I look at the peak positive and negative emotional experiences of the past year, I go through my whole calendar. Sometimes I’ll go through my photos, sometimes I’ll go through my text messages or my sent folder in the inbox. And lo and behold, and this is not a revelation for some people, but the activities did not matter as much as the people. So then the question is, how do I create different contexts for interacting with, let’s just say, my 10 or 15 closest friends? Some of that is doing things outside in the wilderness that are active and so on. But that’s a heavy lift, that’s a heavier lift than — Elan Lee: A high barrier of entry. Tim Ferriss: — playing a casual game, right? So it’s like if I’m here in Austin, where we are right now, and my friends or a bunch of my friends come in for South by Southwest and I manage to get them together for one night, what can we play that will get us off of our goddamn phones and deepen our relationship and create memories that we can hold onto that will stick around? That’s it. That’s it, right? Elan Lee: So good. Tim Ferriss: And then we had our conversation and that’s kind of when everything, I guess, kicked off. Just a couple of things maybe that we should mention also. After our conversation when, I think, very shyly I must have reached out to you at some point shortly thereafter, and I was kind of like, “Hey, guy, not sure if this would be interesting, but maybe kind of sort, do you want to talk about maybe making a game together or something?” Elan Lee: I remember this exact conversation. It’s like asking me out on a first date. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah, yeah, like scratching my head looking at the ground. And that’s how the whole thing got kicked off. And I want to mention something related to that, which was for the last probably three years, my New Year’s resolutions have been very — they’re very broad, but they’re pretty specific. So I had two. One is doing more delegation, which is figure it out delegation. So what that means is rather than doing what I’m hardwired to do with my OCD and perfectionism, which is, “Here, go do this thing. Let me give you a 20-page installation manual explaining exactly what to do,” versus, “Here’s roughly what I want done. Just figure it out and get it done. I don’t want to make any decisions, So don’t come back to me with 12 options. Just make the best you can.” And I’ll expect Reid Hoffman also, LinkedIn has mentioned this sort of a 10 percent footfall rate, like 10 percent of the time something’s going to go sideways and that’s fine in the interest of reducing decision fatigue and making things faster. So one was more figure it out delegation and number two was sprints with creatives. And for me what that meant as someone who has operated as a lone wolf, which by the way is a contradiction in terms, but who has been a solo operator for most of my creative projects, I was like, “You know what? It just isn’t that fun anymore to do it solo.” And it’s also antithetical to some of the creative projects I want to pursue like a game. I mean, there are some amazing solo game designers. Not to say there aren’t, but I was like, “You know what? I want to try to be more social in my creativity and collaborate with creatives and do sprints.” Now, sometimes those sprints turn into longer things, but those have been sort of my two guiding lights for the last few years, which is what then gave me the ability to build up the courage. It sounds so ridiculous to say, but to actually reach out to you and be like, “Hey, do you want to actually just bat around the possibility of something?” Elan Lee: So from my perspective, that conversation, I got very excited to work with you on something, one, because it turns out you’re just a lovely human being and so much fun to hang out with. Tim Ferriss: Thank you. Elan Lee: But two, I asked you that very fundamental question. You said, “Hey, do you want to build a game?” And I said, “Why do you want to build a game?” And your answer was almost identical to what you just related. You talked about your past experiences, you talked about childhood memories of games, you talked about what you like and what you don’t like. And what became very clear to me was there’s something special going on here. Tim wants to treat his friends and his audience to something extraordinary. And we get approached all the time by people who want to make games, big celebrities and singers and actors, all of them want to make a game. And whenever I ask them the question “Why?” the answer is invariably, “Because my agent told me to,” or, “Because I think I can make money,” or really very superficial. Often they’re not game players at all. They have no connection to the experience of game design. And when I spoke to you, none of that was present. Instead it was, “This is a very personal thing to me, and ultimately I want to give a gift.” And that’s when my brain started lighting up. It’s like, “Oh, this is going to be fun. He’s in this for all the reasons I’m in this and that means we can make something very special together.” And I think we have. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah, we definitely have. And another question that is sometimes a little tricky to apply, but that has been in my mind for a while, since Seth Godin, very well-known author, thinker, just incredibly sage and awesome human being. He reframed for me, which is the reframing of the question, “What would you do if you knew you couldn’t fail?” Right? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: That’s a good question. Like what would you do if you knew you couldn’t fail? All right, that’s freeing. But the way he tweaks that is he said, “What would you do if you knew you would fail?” In other words, like, what would you do for which the process alone would make it worth it? And for me, because I mean, we became fast friends very quickly, and I was like, “Okay, that’s rare for me as an adult, number one.” And I’ve been banging this around in my own little head for so long. Even if this ends up not making the cut for whatever reason, this seems worth it to me, right? Elan Lee: Yeah, yeah. Tim Ferriss: Because coming back to the people over activities also, I was like, “Love hanging out with Elan and connecting. I am going to learn a lot.” And at the very worst, I learn a lot and we’ve deepened our relationship. And that stuff just snowballs over time. It transcends a single project. So even if this had not manifested, it would’ve been worth it and that’s how I try to pick my projects these days. Elan Lee: So when we first started down this path together, I remember I came out, we sort of visited each other back and forth a few times. And I remember every time I would pack a suitcase full of games and we would sit with some of your friends and we’d play games all night long and you’d say, “I like this one. I don’t like this one. I like this part.” But ultimately, we weren’t making any progress. We were just learning vocabulary, essentially. And I would go home and my wife would be like, “How’d it go? What did you learn? Are you going to make a game together?” And I’d be like, “I don’t know. No, we just hung out and had fun.” And she’d be like, “Wasn’t that a huge disappointment? You traveled 2,000 miles to go see him?” I’m like, “No, it was just fun. Nah, I’m not disappointed at all. We’ll just do it again next month and we’ll see how it goes.” And we did that five or six times. And I remember walking away from each one just thinking, same thing, “If this goes nowhere, I’m having so much fun.” That’s so rare. Tim Ferriss: It is rare. And if you can orient your life or professional life, and look, I’m not saying this is possible for everyone, but it’s to some extent more possible than people realize. You might not be able to run out and invite Elan on your podcast and then awkwardly approach him like a sheepish 12-year-old boy to ask him on a date. But taking the lens of picking projects based on creating or deepening relationships and learning/developing skills, if you just do that over time, it is almost inevitable that you will win, whatever winning means to you. Elan Lee: Yeah, value the process, yeah. Tim Ferriss: So let’s talk a little bit about the origin story. Now, I’ll throw out a couple of things here and we’re going to talk about the game development, and then we’re also going to talk about how to sell this thing. How does that work? Elan Lee: And it’s worth saying, designing a game, I remember you asked me this early on. You started out from the, “Hey, let’s design a game,” and then we’re basically done. And I remember really forcing myself to think through this process because I wanted to explain it to you. “No, that’s half of it. The other half is selling the game. And just as much work goes into that. And if you’re not willing to do it or if you have no mechanism by which you can do it, might as well not design the game because one without the other, useless.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yeah. So it depends on the scale you’re going after, right? If you want to make something for your friends, you can do that. Elan Lee: Sure, Yeah, okay. Fair enough. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: But in this particular case, I mean — Elan Lee: You wanted to make something cool and share it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I wanted to share. I wanted to share it. So that kind of dictated parts of the process that we needed to weigh really heavily. So the game development process, I mean, we started off looking at the possibilities of modifying existing games, right? So looking at, say, Poetry for Neanderthals — Elan Lee: Poetry, yeah. Tim Ferriss: — with an alternate set of rules or a different deck plus A, B, or C. We looked at prototype games that you alluded to earlier, bringing the suitcase, right? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So we did that all over the country. Elan Lee: Yeah, I showed up, I remember. So I have this notebook of game ideas three, 400 in there, and I add more every month. And I remember I picked my favorites, like five or six of them, and I would show up with just the jankiest prototypes. Like, “Here’s something I scribbled on a few cards.” I took some dice and I rubbed out the little nubs on the dice and hand wrote something on all the die faces. “Instead, let’s try playing this weird game.” And you were very patient and you had a lot of vision, thankfully, to look at these just horrible, very hastily created prototypes and say, not, “This is no fun, let’s move on.” But you would always say, “Oh, I like this. I like the — that moment where we had a conversation about what you were going to do next. I like that part. I didn’t like the rest of it, but I like that part.” And that astute sense of notes, really thoughtful and forward moving notes was ultimately what guided our conversation. Because then the next time, I don’t have to pick from 400 games to bring. Now I know, “Okay, this cooperative thing, he liked that conversation aspect. There’s only six games I’ve got like that. Let me bring those six and we’ll refine it even farther.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah, totally. So we can talk about the Toronto trip. The Toronto project. Elan Lee: Mm-hmm. Tim Ferriss: That is where things started to gel. Because we’d had a number of these meetings around the country where we would do a one to three day sprint of testing, take all these notes and we’d done a few of these and we’ve both got a lot going on and your wife would ask you how it went and you’re like, “Well, I’m not really sure. I think we had fun, but no game as of yet.” And so we scheduled time. I was going to fly to Toronto to do a sprint. You were going to bring in an expert game designer, sort of game mechanic specialist — Elan Lee: Ken Gruhl, yeah. Tim Ferriss: — Ken. And it was like, “Okay, this is the trip. If we make it happen, great. If not, we’re just going to call spade a spade.” Elan Lee: Yeah. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: We were circling around this thing but not really getting it done. Elan Lee: It was like meeting number eight or nine at that point. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yeah, we tried a lot. And it was during that trip that the very primitive sort of germ of an idea started to resonate, which ended up being Coyote. And I remember a few things, and thank God also for Ken’s apparent photographic memory with the way things transpired, but we’re walking around all over the place in Toronto, the three of us, just spitballing. Then it starts to rain and we seek shelter. We failed twice, I think, with various coffee shops. Elan Lee: Yeah, can’t get in. Tim Ferriss: No room, no seats, whatever it might be. End up sitting in this weird kind of multipurpose building. And I remember where we were sitting and we played, I guess in English it’s Hanabi. Elan Lee: Hanabi. Tim Ferriss: Hanabi, which is Hanabi in Japanese, which is fireworks. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And hana’s flower. Bi in this case is fire. So it’s like flower fire. That’s Hanabi. Elan Lee: For everybody out there, if you haven’t played Hanabi, go try this game. It is very special. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So we played that game, kind of killing time, giving it a shot, because you guys had mentioned it. And I was like, “Okay, this is a very elegant game.” And from that, liked the cooperative aspect. So when people think game, I think most folks are more familiar, maybe exclusively familiar, with the sort of winner-takes-all or team-versus-team competitive type of game. But I really enjoyed, and I’d seen this in other ways in different capacities, but the cooperative option and the cooperative aspect of this. So that then gets stuck in the mind and the rain clears up. We go for a walk by the water. And I remember we were sort of — well, I’ll own it, I was kind of stalled. I’ll be the kind of hair plugging the drain in the bathtub. Because I was trying to search my mind for game examples. But I was thinking tabletop games because that was the canvas we were painting upon. And we’re walking, we’re walking. We’ve had quite a bit of caffeine by this point and it was either you or Ken, I think it was you, who asked, “Well, just broadly speaking, any kind of game, what games have you really enjoyed?” And that’s where Rock, Paper, Scissors came up, right? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Rochambeau. And I just — as dumb as it might sound, and I said this at the time, I was like, “I love Rock, Paper, Scissors.” Especially when you play over an extended period of time with friends, maybe there’s some alcohol involved or not, you don’t need to have it involved. But you start to pick up tells, you start to pick up patterns, and it’s actually very, very fun. Elan Lee: So it’s important to note, the moment you bring up Rock, Paper, Scissors in any game design discussion, that’s usually the end of the conversation, right? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: Because there’s nothing to that game. There’s three tools, deploy a tool, determine a winner, you’re done. It is only when you say, “Let’s acknowledge Rock, Paper, Scissors is no fun unless you play multiple times.” Because now we’ve made a very important transition. We’re not playing the game anymore, we’re playing each other. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: Right? Because I know what you did last time. You think I’m going to throw scissors again. And now we’re playing each other. Yes, rock, paper, scissors are the tools by which we’re playing each other, but suddenly we’re playing a very different game and it starts — it cannot start in round one. It starts in round two and it moves forward from there. And once we started having that discussion, things started to get really interesting. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, things got interesting. And do you want to show the prototype deck? Elan Lee: Yeah, I’ll show. Tim Ferriss: And part of the reason I want to show this prototype deck, and we’ll describe it for people who aren’t watching, is quick and dirty is the fucking way to go. And I will just make another recommendation for Stephen Key. So Stephen Key has a book called the One Simple Idea, which is about licensing and creating inventions. He’s got a number of books now. But Stephen has made a gajillion dollars creating games for all the biggies that you can possibly think of. And he uses construction paper and glue you would find in a second grade class and a handful of markers. Elan Lee: Love it. This is already my — Tim Ferriss: And this is by and large, that is how he creates these amazing — now, when I say — they can be games, they can be toys. He’s pretty broad spectrum. But it might be a new way to play basketball, shooting dirty laundry into a hamper, right? Elan Lee: Mm-hmm. Tim Ferriss: Something like that. And he prototypes these things incredibly quickly. And for him, for what he does, that is enough. He is able to put together a pitch, he’s able to sell it and he’s able to develop these amazing passive income streams with these annuities that just come in — Elan Lee: So good. Tim Ferriss: — from all these different places. But that relates to what we’re looking at. Elan Lee: Okay. I love that we have not even described what Coyote is yet. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Yeah. Elan Lee: But that’s okay because it’s more fun I think, to walk — I think the value of this conversation is to actually talk through the creative process and talk through — I think a lot of people want to make games, this is how you do it. And we went through this two-year journey and we arrived at a very happy outcome. So I’m excited to talk about, “Well, let me show you the very ugly, very first deck we ever built.” So we had this conversation about Rock, Paper, Scissors, and I knew there was something there because we were talking about players playing — my fundamental premise behind all game design is games should not be entertaining. Games should make the players entertaining. And suddenly, when you said, “Rock, Paper, Scissors over time,” I was like, “Oh, that’s perfect.” But three tools, rock, paper and scissors, not a very robust tool set. We can’t really play a game that way. So I ran home and started scribbling on cards. These are just blank cards. I took Sharpies, I buy these by the thousands on Amazon. So I had a ton of these and we just started scribbling. And so we made a card that says rock, and we made a card that says paper, and we made a card that says scissors. And we thought, “What if we’re all on the same team? But what if these cards here are not tools to fight with each other? What if these are a challenge that we have to all solve together?” And so we started just putting down a bunch of things, rock, paper, scissors, rock, rock, paper. And we’re like, “All right, we’ll sit around the table and we’ll all just do this pattern. Everyone do scissors. Now everyone do paper. Now everyone do rock.” Tim Ferriss: And we’d been talking about these different variations and ideas on the walk and then we ended up back at your dining room table — Elan Lee: Yeah, that’s right. Tim Ferriss: — with tons — Elan Lee: Seriously scribbling. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, scribbling and modifying cards as we went. Elan Lee: Yeah, exactly. So now the modifiers are really the most interesting thing. Because the game that I’m describing right now is useless. Right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: We can all do scissors and then all do paper. Who cares, right? There’s nothing here. But now we have a baseline. We’re all going to do this thing. Cool, easy. And then we started doing these modifiers, all players do all blue cards. Right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: So we start scribbling rock, paper, scissors in different colors, and then we’ve got this modifier. So now everyone’s going to — sorry, I’m going to do scissors, but then we’re all going to do paper and then back to you just doing rock, and things like that. And so then it was like, “Okay, well, skip a player after every red card. Okay, shout every blue card,” right? Then we just started writing all these crazy modifiers. I’m just putting all these cards all over the table because the challenge got more and more interesting. And then it was like, “Okay, so something interesting is possible here. Now what if instead of just splashing cards all over the paper, what if we were responsible for this? What if one at a time everyone had to add a new card to the table to make this challenge harder and harder and harder?” And that’s when we started talking about the vocabulary of this game. What are these cards? What makes this thing harder? Rock and paper and scissors very quickly got eliminated from the game because they’re so boring. So we started talking about, “Well, okay, what if you’re making a peace sign?” And then you came up with, “Well, what if you pose a ballerina on a card? And what if you slap the shoulder or the person next to you on a card? And what if you have to — ” I remember one of our earliest notes was, “Eliminate all shouting cards,” because that was no fun at all. Tim Ferriss: We tested that. And then that got all old real quick. Elan Lee: Right, exactly. Tim Ferriss: And also as we’re play testing, right? As we’re inventing mechanics and testing different things. So we play for a few rounds being like, “Okay, that was okay, but what do you guys think of this?” “Okay, we like this aspect.” “Great, let’s make four more of those cards of different colors.” And then we played again. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And then we played again. And then we’d iterate and we played again. Elan Lee: That’s right. Tim Ferriss: And we ended up with, I mean, spreadsheets full of different cards. And this is all still now in cooperative mode at that point. Elan Lee: All in cooperative mode. Tim Ferriss: And — Elan Lee: But over the next week, I would say we designed 80 percent of the game. We were at this stalled-at-one-percent mode for months. And then in a matter of days, 80 percent done. Because we found this every time we played some version of this, the immediate answer when we were done playing was, “Let’s go again.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So is that the litmus test for you? Elan Lee: For sure. Tim Ferriss: I mean in terms of the indicators that something is worth further development, right? Elan Lee: Yeah,. Tim Ferriss: Because you have 400 in your notebook and so you’re not going to develop all of those. What are some of the — could be a water feel that you have, but what are some of the indicators where you’re like, “Oh, okay.” Elan Lee: So there’s two things to talk about here. Certainly “Let’s play again” is a great one, but to set your mind in a place where you’re willing to say, “Imagine this, but tweaked, but something a little different.” There’s this principle I love called the zero effect. Zero effect. Tim Ferriss: Zero effect? Elan Lee: Yeah, zero effect. It’s from a movie, I think, in the late ’80s, early ’90s, somewhere around there called Zero Effect. And there’s this one scene where they explain what the zero effect is. And it is as follows, if you’ve lost your car keys and you’re looking for your car keys, here you are in your living room, you’re looking for car keys, the chances of you finding your car keys are very low because there’s so many things in this room that are not your car keys. So your chances of finding that one thing very, very low. If instead you are trying to find anything, your chances of success are suddenly at a hundred percent. You will find something, as long as you don’t care what it is that you found. That’s my favorite premise for brainstorming and for early testing. Don’t lock in your head, “I’m looking for this particular thing. I must find X. I must find X.” Because the chances that you’re going to find that thing are almost non-existent. But if you can keep your brain open and say, “I’m just looking for something. I don’t care what it is, something, anything, and I’ll tweak it later, I’ll play with it later. I’ll find some way to consider this thing I found my car keys.” As long as you’re willing to make that leap, brainstorming becomes a pleasure. Tim Ferriss: And does that take the form of, “What if, blah?” “What if we blah?” “What if this card did blah?” Elan Lee: Precisely. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Is it a series of what ifs? Elan Lee: And you’re not scared for all of those to fail, right? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: Because you can come up with those all day long. And that’s what we did, right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: Over the next few days, that process, “What if, blah. Let’s try it. What if, blah, let’s try it. What if, whatever, let’s try it.” And as long as the answer is always, “Let’s try it,” you will a hundred percent find what you’re looking for. Tim Ferriss: All right, so let’s make some recommendations for people listening or watching. What books or resources would you recommend for people who are interested in game development? Now, I want to reiterate also, whether you think you’re playing games or not, you’re already playing games in life. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So for me, this is a way of putting on a table what we’ve already implicitly agreed to in our own lives in ways that we generally don’t realize, which is we’re all playing games. Now what does that mean? That means that beyond Maslow’s basic rungs on the ladder, shelter, warmth, food, et cetera, at some point, particularly as adults, maybe it’s before you go to school, maybe it’s when you’re in college, but you have decided to play or you have just ended up drafting into a game with certain rules, certain conditions for winning or losing certain ranking mechanisms. And step number one is figuring out what games you’re playing. Elan Lee: Mm-hmm. Tim Ferriss: Okay. So I would suggest that learning about building games helps you to put on x-ray vision glasses, where you start to see the world is comprised of tons of games. Elan Lee: Yeah, it’s so true. And you start to dive deeper into game theory. What is the prisoner’s dilemma? What is a zero sum game? If you can start to identify those very fundamental game design concepts in the real world, you can jump to the end of a conversation so much faster. You can avoid so many missteps because everything follows, within reason, everything follows game design principles because this practice, this art form has been so well studied and so well researched and so well documented that you get to take advantage of all of that. And I love that. I use that for my relationships. I use that as playing with my kids. I use that at work all the time. It’s just there’s these fundamental principles of game design. And I’ll talk about a book I’d love that illustrates them. But, yeah, they can be applied to anything. You’re right, you’re playing a game all the time. And the first step is to be aware that you are playing a game. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: All right, so I’ve got two books. Tim Ferriss: Let’s hear it. Elan Lee: One is, let’s see, A Theory of Fun by Raph Koster. Raph Koster? Raph Koster? R-A-P-H, Raph. It’ll outline all these fundamentals. It is the first game design book I ever read. It is the one I go back to and refer to the most often. It’s just got everything and the author is brilliant and go read that book. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: The second one is going to be a little controversial. Tim Ferriss: Memoirs of a Geisha? Elan Lee: It’s called Don’t Shoot the Dog. Tim Ferriss: Oh, this is an exceptional book. Elan Lee: Exceptional book. It is by Karen Pryor. Tim Ferriss: It is not explicitly about game design, at all. Elan Lee: It is not at all about game design. But here’s the thing, this book, the fundamental premise of this book is you are trying to teach a companion, a dog, to behave in a certain way. And the answer to how best to do that is not to, when things go wrong at least, not to blame the dog, is to fundamentally change the way you operate and the way you convey information and the way you look at the world in order to better relate to your dog and to the way that the dog understands and sees the world. It is the best game design principle I have ever encountered in my life. And true, it has nothing to do with game design, but when you’re designing a game, you’re designing it for a target, for someone who isn’t you and you’re not even going to be in the room when they encounter it. And to have in your brain from the very first step, “Every problem that comes up is my problem, not theirs. Every responsibility is my responsibility, not theirs.” And if you can get that in your head and design games that way, those are the games I have found that are the most successful. Tim Ferriss: This is Don’t Shoot the Dog, terrible title, but it is the fundamental starting point that I recommend to anyone who’s interested in dog training. And Karen Pryor is one of the popularizers of clicker training as a way of shaping behavior. I believe she had experience with marine mammals, which by the way, you can’t whack on the butt with a newspaper to punish them, so in other words, negative reinforcement. So how do you do it? You use positive reinforcement. You use clickers or whistles or different tools. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And I believe the back of the book, people will be able to fact-check this, but it basically says whether you want to get your dog to heel, your cat to stop laying on the kitchen table, or your mother-in-law to stop nagging you, the principles are all the same. And at the end of it, like you said, is this radical ownership of “It may not be your fault, but it is your responsibility.” Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: And in a lot of cases, certainly with game design and instructions and so on, it is actually your fault. If people are confused, it is your fault. Elan Lee: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, no, but it’s the best way. Before I started Exploding Kittens, I designed games for friends and I just had the hardest time. When I wasn’t in the room, people were not enjoying those games. And it was only once I read that book that I realized the fault is absolutely mine. Because I’m trying to get them to have as much fun as I want them to have and the fact that they’re not, I keep blaming them. And that’s so wrong. Tim Ferriss: So what did you do? How did you fix that? Elan Lee: There’s basically two parts. One starts with design. One says the game has to be so simple that it is almost self-correcting. And I have to strip out all complication, I have to remove all nuance. Any time I’m thinking of the rules and I say, “Okay, if this happens, then this happens, except if — ” The moment I say “except,” I’ve gone down a wrong path. I need to get rid of all of that stuff. That was the first part. And then the second part is in writing the actual instructions and figuring out how — if I’m sitting in the room, you’re going to get this game because I’m going to explain it and I’m going to be enthusiastic. And when you ask a question, I’m going to answer the question. And when you get confused, I’m going to clarify it. I can a hundred percent do that. But a piece of paper trying to do that same thing, I have to write it as if I’m in the room and I have to anticipate those questions and I have to cut them off before they come up and I have to correct behavior because I know exactly where you’re going to go off course and fix it in the instructions. And that kind of one-two punch changed my game design from like 10 percent of the people get this to 95 percent of the people get this. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, one aspect — I mean there’s so many aspects, but one aspect of this that I enjoyed was related to the instructions. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And so number one, you make it really clear in the instructions, which we both poured over ad nauseum. But reading is the worst way to learn a game. Go watch this video, QR code. So that’s number one. But if you’re going to put it into text — and I think I’m pretty good at this, but I was very impressed with your ability to identify anything that could be misunderstood or that wasn’t yet defined or that could be taken with another more broader connotation that would steer people off course. And the number of edits in that Google Doc. Elan Lee: I mean, it’s got to be in the hundreds, right? Tim Ferriss: From all of us, hundreds and hundreds of edits. Elan Lee: So the most important skill is you will write better instructions, you will convey information to people better if you can clear your mind. If you can approach any set of instructions from the perspective of the things I know I do not yet know, and the words that come out of my mouth have to not only fill my brain with the required knowledge — Tim Ferriss: I see basically beginner’s mind, right? Elan Lee: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Putting yourself in the place of someone who has never seen this before. Elan Lee: Exactly. And it’s so hard to do because you have this information in your head. It must be there, otherwise you’re not going to be able to explain the thing. But to back all the way up and say, “I’m just going to split my brain in two. There’s this one reading script and I know the information I have to get out, but the other half is the recipient of that script and it knows nothing.” If you can do that — and it’s so hard, it takes so much practice. If you can do that, you’re going to not only be able to design good games and write good instructions, but you’re also going to be able to just converse more effectively just out in the world in general. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. All right. You mentioned I think it was two minutes to learn, 15 minutes to play. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: What other golden or guiding tenets do you have for yourself when you’re doing game design within Exploding Kittens? Elan Lee: Oh, good question. If a component does not need to be in the game, remove it from the game. Tim Ferriss: Right. So an example of that would be we had these chits or little chips, like poker chips. Elan Lee: Like bingo chips. Tim Ferriss: Like bingo chips that we were using for lives or strikes, and turns out you don’t need that. You can use — Elan Lee: Yeah, because you’ve got a whole thing of cards right here, just use those. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. You can use cards by flipping them over and using the back of the card. Elan Lee: Exactly. That’s a perfect example. Right? We have this thing where we’re like, “Hey, you know what would be fun is if everybody had a big hand of cards and we’re going to play cards and you make decisions.” I’m like, “I get that.” Most games you play, you have a hand of cards and you’re going to play a card and you’re making a decision. That’s awesome. But you know what? That’s a private moment and you reveal a card. Every game you’ve ever played. When you play UNO, you’ve got a hand of cards, you’re making a decision, you play a card, you’ve revealed what card you just played. And I remember thinking, “Is there a simpler version of that?” And it turns out there is. And the simpler version in Coyote is take some cards, put them all face up on the table, and then decide which one you’re going to pick. That’s very similar to having a deck of cards, but now it’s public. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it’s public. Elan Lee: Right? Tim Ferriss: And also when the competitive version was brought in, which is the way that I like to play, the way I would suggest people play, but you can warm up with cooperative or if you have somebody in your life or in your family who just cannot lose without creating a huge pain in the ass, then the cooperative mode is really fun. But the competitive mode then allows the group decision on which card to play potentially, although ultimately that’s individual. That has implications for cooperative when it’s public. But also for competitive. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: There are a number of tweaks made to this, but I mentioned earlier, sabotaging. So we had competitive, but different minds are wired for different games. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And so, God forbid, what happens to you is what happened to one of my employees who was play testing this, where one of the people in the group was a mathematician who also is high-level chess player if I remember correctly. Elan Lee: Oh, no. Tim Ferriss: And he just smoked everyone because he had the mind for it. Elan Lee: Yeah, of course. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So what do you do for that? Well, we ended up — and this took a lot of play testing to ultimately land on this. And I want to ask you about play testing, particularly if it’s kind of hands off the wheel and you have people playing the game without you. Elan Lee: Yeah, terrifying Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Realized — and this comes back to the underdog being able to win, not getting my ass smoked in Magic over and over again by someone who’s just got better hardwiring for it. Elan Lee: Mm-hmm. Tim Ferriss: And that’s where the attack cards came from. Right? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So there are these attack cards in the deck, which to the simplification side, you can play in cooperative mode to modify a card. I don’t want to get too in the weeds. Elan Lee: Well, I want to give you more credit for this because I don’t think you’re taking enough credit. All right, let me phrase this a different way. So the basic premise of the game is we have a whole bunch of activities on the table, right? Ballerina, peace sign, whatever it is, thumbs up, thumbs down, smile, frown. Tim Ferriss: Lean and make a fart noise. Elan Lee: Yeah, exactly, lean and make a fart noise. So we’ve got all these things that we’re all going to do. And then on top of that — Tim Ferriss: It’s a fan favorite. Elan Lee: That’s right. That’s such a good card. On top of that, we have all these modifier cards and they modify — you have to skip a player after this one, ignore this card, do this one twice. Tim Ferriss: Those are generally the Coyote cards. Elan Lee: The Coyote cards. And you had this great idea, you said, “Because some players are naturally gifted at this game, far more so than others, and because some players are going to naturally fall behind and they need a way to sabotage the first place.” If you’re in last place, you need a way to sabotage the first place player. If you’ve ever played Mario Kart, you know this feeling very well. And you said, “What if we took some of these modifiers, every time — all players have to do all the blue cards with one hand instead of two.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: But what if instead of all the blue — Tim Ferriss: Or Tyrannosaurus arms. Elan Lee: Or Tyrannosaurus arms, you have to do all your movements with Tyrannosaurus arms. What if instead of playing that on all blue cards on the table, what if you just put that, slide it right in front of another player and now only they have to do it? For every single one of their turns. You’ve put a curse on them. The last place player has attacked the first place player. And I remember thinking, “Tim, you’re like a natural game designer.” That’s such a nice moment and it’s such an easy modification. And of course my answer was, “I don’t know, let’s try it.” And then we tried it and it was glorious. And I love moments like that for two reasons. One is because you had learned at that point to speak like a game designer. Right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: Instead of saying, “I think we just need to sabotage people,” instead you said, “Some people are really good at this game. We have to address that. Some people are naturally bad at this game. We need to give them a tool.” And those terms, speaking in that language, armed with that vocabulary, suddenly the answer to you became so clear, like, “Here’s how we solve those problems.” That’s great. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: I guarantee you would not have been capable of that when we started this process. Tim Ferriss: No way. Yeah, no, I wouldn’t have had the — sometimes artists talk about the visual library, just the exposure to different types of artwork, different forms, different silhouettes, different structures so that they can pull from that visual library to inform whatever they’re trying to build or solve for. And it’s the same with game design, same with everything. You need to build your ABCs so you can convey what you’re trying to say in terms that are solvable, if that makes any sense. Elan Lee: Yeah. Totally. You’re a quick study too. Tim Ferriss: Helped getting the books that you recommended. All right, so I’m not going to dox my friend in question. But as long-term listeners will know, I was, in a former life, a neuroscience major and then, in the last 10 years, have funded a lot of science. I always have just had this hankering and this dream of being involved in neuroscience; it continues to this day. And in the process of building this game — and this is not how I necessarily sell it, because this is going to sound terrible, but through many experiments with different companies and so on, I’ve concluded that even though generally Americans, I’ll throw it on Americans, I’m American, say they want to be smarter, they will typically not pay for something that is designed to make them smarter unless it’s a magic pill, and then sometimes the answer is yes. But what I was hoping to also do with this game is to create something that would — and this has not been proven, there’s no randomized controlled study examining this, although that might change at some point. — is to design something that would help those players who are not good at this, or the people who are in the middle of the bell curve or the people who are good to get better. And for people who are interested in looking at some — they’re not perfect analogs, but they’re similar. People can check out the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, WCST. It’s a neurophysiological test used to assess cognitive flexibility in executive functions, particularly the ability to shift cognitive sets and learn from feedback. All right, so participants must sort cards based on an initially unknown rule, which changes after a certain number of correct sorts. Now this is not a perfect parallel because that does not, in and of itself, make for a fun game. Right? Elan Lee: Mm-hmm. Tim Ferriss: So fun number one, lots of probably rank ordered like one, two, three, four, five. But could I also Trojan horse in — Elan Lee: Yeah, love it. Tim Ferriss: — cognitive training. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And I think the answer — this is from a lay perspective, and obviously I’m biased because I’m involved in every step, I’m making this thing, but I think it does the trick. And what people will notice is, and you know this too, the game starts off so easy. Elan Lee: There’s nothing to it. Tim Ferriss: And people are like, “There’s nothing to it.” Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: And then once a modifier or two comes out, people are like, “Oh, oh, wait a second, this is getting really tricky.” And if, for instance, I’ve had lifelong insomnia, you want to sleep better, play this game before you go to bed. And by the end you will feel like you just did a workout, a full brain workout for your cognition. Elan Lee: You know what I love about that part? I learned to play the drums years and years ago, and I remember I would learn these new patterns and it was like your right hand has to do this and your left hand has to do this, and your right leg has to do this and your — and I remember thinking, “No way, no way. I can’t do that.” And you work at it and you work at it and you work at it and suddenly it starts to click, just a little bit. Like, “Oh, my right hand did the right thing.” And it’s like you can feel new neurons coming to life. Right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Elan Lee: Your brain is doing something that five minutes ago you could not do. This is the first game I’ve ever played that does that exact same thing. And I remember the first time I felt that way in a very early play test, my eyes got all wide and I was like, “There is something magical going on here. I know I’m psyching myself out, but I feel new things happening in my brain because five minutes ago I could not do this pattern and now I can. We can go all the way around the table and you can add a new card and I will still be able to do this pattern that I couldn’t do just five minutes ago.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah, totally. And what’s cool as well is you get to see just how specialized certain minds are and where you might have an Achilles heel. So for instance, and this is true for some folks, we have the modifiers ranked by difficulty just so you can — because ultimately with Coyote, you’re in charge of how hard you make the game. Elan Lee: Mm-hmm. That’s right. That’s right. Tim Ferriss: You are in full charge of how easy, moderate, or difficult you make it. And we didn’t even talk about how this game is designed to make you a game designer. We’ll talk about that with the blank cards. But this is a sort of creativity unlock as much as a game. That’s the intention behind it, which is part of the reason that I’m really excited to see what the hell it does when it’s released into the wild, which effectively is now. Elan Lee: That’s going to — Tim Ferriss: Now the specialization piece, I’ll just speak to that. So for instance, for me, skipping turns, skipping players, it is a blind spot. It is an Achilles heel for me. That’s true for quite a few folks. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: But for other people, for instance, if we’re going around the table, most people would be familiar with “We Will Rock You.” Elan Lee: “We Will Rock You,” yeah. Tim Ferriss: So it’s like boom, boom, boom, boom. So the way you play the game is you go around is you go “Boom, boom,” and you can hit the table with your hands. You can do it with closed fists. You could probably clap it if you want, but it’s boom, boom. And then one person does the move. Like let’s take the ballet, we’re going to do a pirouette. You have to do the motion and you have to say the motion. So then these two things can be split or confused later. We want to get — Elan Lee: We’ll get to that later. Tim Ferriss: — too deep into that. And then it’s boom, boom, next person, boom, boom, next person. And it goes around. And then it just gets more and more complicated. So I remember when we were first experimenting with the modifier that said, okay, it’s now three bumps instead of two. So it’s boom, boom, boom. And then the move. And there were, I remember, I’m not going to call them out, but there’s one person who just could not do it. Elan Lee: I know. I was one of those people. My brain would start melting out of my ears at that point. I don’t know why though. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah. It’s weird. It’s weird. So they’re very specific. You’ll find each person will have a super strength and a super weakness, and you’ll figure it out by playing this game. And just from a game design perspective also, I’d love to hear you talk about finding the sweet spot. I mean, we could talk about Bushnell’s law of Atari fame, the game, I’m paraphrasing here, but a good game is easy to learn and difficult to master. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: But how do you, in the course of play testing, working with prototypes find the sweet spot of difficulty? Because with this game, well, through making this game, I’ve just really come to appreciate how hard it is to create a game where people experience that sweet spot. Because if you were to take Coyote and make it too easy, what a simple game to make. Elan Lee: Sure. Tim Ferriss: Right? Elan Lee: Oh, yeah. Tim Ferriss: If you wanted to make it basically impossible and not fun to play, also very easy. But to find that sweet spot on the graph is incredibly challenging. Elan Lee: Yeah. So the way I think about this is when you first encounter any game, the first thought that has to go into your brain is, “I can do that.” You hear it described, and you have to think, “I can do that.” And then you have to try the game and that has to be reinforced. The game has to say, “Yep, you can do that.” And you have to feel like, “Okay, I thought I could do it. I can do it. This is great.” But that’s only going to last a few seconds. The next thought that has to go into your brain is, “I understand the path to mastery. I understand how to get better at this.” And then the next thought is, “And I can do that too.” So you have to see the moment a modifier card comes out, or the moment any complication happens in your favorite game, it has to stop you dead in your tracks. It has to be like, “Ooh, the thing I just did to start the game and was really good at, I thought I could do it. I could do it. That’s not going to work here. I have to rethink my strategy, or I have to get better at something else.” And then those two follow-up thoughts have to show up in quick succession: “I know what I have to do and I can do that too.” And that’s really the art to me of that ramping up of game design. And you have to keep hitting that “I think I can do that”; “Yes, you can. Now you can’t anymore, but you know what you have to do and you can do that too.” And then that’s going to get blocked. And you think, “Okay, now what? Now I know what I have to do and I can do that too.” And you have to just keep hitting those two things. And it’s rinse and repeat over and over and over again. And if you can hit that, you are just holding somebody’s hand from the beginning of the game to the end of the game. And they’re going to get great at it, they’re going to achieve that sense of mastery over time. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, and if you, listening or watching, have any game that you consider simple that you enjoy, rest assured there was an absurd, absurd amount of development and testing and revising that went into it. And just to give you an example, this is by all outward appearance a very simple game. And the three to eight players you could probably play with more, 10 minutes, says age is 10 plus. I’ve seen people playing with their kids who are much younger and it’s actually hilarious and super fun. There are so many levers you can pull here. You have the action cards, which are these cute little salamander cards with the different motions and gestures and so on. You’ve got just the sheer number of cards. How many variants do you have? How many total cards do you have? How many Coyote versus attack cards? When you have a fully shuffled deck, what does that actually look like? There’s so many different variables that you have to think through. Elan Lee: Yeah. And we even set up, one of my favorite things is we’re starting to see people compete now. So we set up this page of, here are table configurations. Here’s an array of cards in exactly this order with exactly these modifiers. This one’s hard, this one’s impossible. This one is going to kill you. And we’ve started to see, the game is barely available so far, but we started to see some people try to tackle those challenges. Tim Ferriss: Oh, fun. Okay. I didn’t even know that. Elan Lee: It’s incredible. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, so where this came from also is in The 4-Hour Chef a million years ago, came out in 2012, which was actually a book about accelerated learning, confusingly. But putting that aside, there were a few recipes in that book. I think one was called Dragon Force Chaconne or something like that, which was named after this video game track that people found impossible to play on guitar. And then there was something, a La Ancienne, which was this just ludicrously complex French dish that involved fish. And I was like, okay, look, if you’ve done everything up to this point and you want to take a quantum leap forward and try something that is considered effectively impossible by most people, here you go. And so that’s what we created on this particular page. Elan Lee: I will just say, having tested all of the challenges on that page, I can do exactly one of them. The last two are so hard. Tim Ferriss: They really are. Elan Lee: And we’ve already seen someone, a table of six people succeed — Tim Ferriss: Oh, wow. Okay — Elan Lee: — at the middle one. They’ve already done it. Tim Ferriss: That’s nuts. Elan Lee: Yeah. I’ve never seen anyone do the crazy hard one. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: But it’s coming. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So people can check it out. And there may or may not be a bunch of excitement around that. So I will just say there may be incentives later to be good at this game. I will leave it at that for now. So I tell you what, we’re going to come back to some of the blank cards and we’ll talk about those features. But let’s talk about a bit more of the process of making any game. We could talk about Coyote specifically of course, because you have a process for this. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: How many games per year do you guys put out on average? Elan Lee: So it’s funny, I actually built this out as a graph. So our first year we did one, our second year we did two. Our third year we did two again. Last year we did 14. This year we’ll do 23, I think. Tim Ferriss: Wow. Elan Lee: Yeah, it’s a lot. But we’ve built this, it’s really fun, we’ve built this incredibly robust pipeline from design all the way through to testing and then sales and then marketing. And I feel obligated to just keep that pipeline full because it’s such a beautiful thing we built. So we do a lot of games. Tim Ferriss: All right, let’s get some info that we wouldn’t normally have any access to. Elan Lee: All right. Tim Ferriss: If you do an 80/20 analysis, it’s not going to be exactly 80/20, but you get where I’m going, on your best-selling games, what’s on the leaderboard? What are the top X number of games? Five, three, four, whatever the number. Elan Lee: Well, up until last year, number one, the top-selling game in the world amongst all games was Exploding Kittens. Tim Ferriss: That’s nuts, man. Elan Lee: It’s nuts. Tim Ferriss: Congratulations. Elan Lee: It makes no sense, but I’ll tell you something I’m even more proud of. It’s now number two. Number one is a game called Hurry Up Chicken Butt. Hurry Up Chicken Butt is a game I designed with my four-year-old daughter, and she did most of the design. And it is outselling Exploding Kittens. It is selling one game every four seconds. Tim Ferriss: Wow. Elan Lee: Yeah, it’s nuts. And it was designed by a four-year-old. Tim Ferriss: Okay, so we’ve got a Hurry Up Chicken Butt, Exploding Kittens. Elan Lee: Yeah. The next few spots in the global sales are constantly shifting. Everybody’s fighting for those, but we always have — our entries into that list, which are constantly shifting, Poetry for Neanderthals is usually number three. Throw Throw Burrito is usually either number five or six, and the rest are just totally random. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Okay, got it. So what has made Hurry Up Chicken Butt a success? Elan Lee: Yeah. So remember what I said, if you have the best design game in the world — Tim Ferriss: And by the way, when we spoke I think two years ago — Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: — you were just beginning to talk about this. I don’t think it had launched at that point. Elan Lee: No, it hadn’t. Yeah. Yeah. It has been an absolute rocket ship. Tim Ferriss: What are the magic ingredients? Why has it worked? Because not all games do that. Elan Lee: Yeah. No, they don’t. Tim Ferriss: And you’ve had now, with the number of games that EK, Exploding Kittens, has developed, you’ve had a chance to see a lot of different ideas come through the doors and go out the doors. Elan Lee: Yeah. Some games last a season, some games last a decade. So when I was designing games — okay, so Hurry Up Chicken Butt in particular, I wrote a list of the things I wanted that game to accomplish. And my daughter had all these ideas, “Here’s what I want to do, and you’re going to do this and you’re going to run up and jump up and down and blah.” But I had a list of things that I needed to know were in this game in order for me as a parent to buy it for my kid. And they were as follows. The game has to be as much fun for me to play as it is for my daughter. That’s a hard one. Tim Ferriss: That’s hard. Elan Lee: That killed most designs that we came up with. Number two, my daughter has to be able to beat me at this game, even though I’m not letting her win. Holy crap is that a hard one. Tim Ferriss: Yep. Elan Lee: Number three, the game cannot have any losers. It can have a winner, but it cannot have any losers. Those three were my guiding lights. It was like, I need to check off these three check boxes for this game to be good. And we worked on a hundred million designs. She’s great. She’ll just be like, “Oh, you don’t like this one? Here’s another one. You don’t like that one? Here’s another one.” And she just kept firing them off. And we finally got to this game that hit all three of those. That, as I said earlier, is only half the battle. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, that’s the necessary, but not sufficient — Elan Lee: Exactly. So now we have a game that I’m in love with, that we play every single night that she can beat me at regularly. And I am trying my absolute hardest to beat her. And this four-year-old is kicking my ass at this game. Love that. Love it. And I’m having a blast. Tim Ferriss: So this is my first time hearing about these criteria. Just for people listening, this is all new to me. Elan Lee: When my daughter got old enough to start playing games right around when she turned four, we went out and bought all these games and I just hated them. They were so boring and I hated playing. And so we just designed our own. We just made them better. And it was important for me to have that list. ‘Cause unless I know what success looks like, I’ll just stay in brainstorming mode forever. So I made that list, finally hit it, and then we entered into part two. And here my daughter has very little to do with it. Here’s where I sit down with the marketing and sales team and I was like, “What the hell are we going to call this thing?” And we went through a thousand different names. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I know the feeling. Elan Lee: Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah, we did that. But once I had 10 names that I really liked, we sat down with my daughter and all her friends and I would just read them off. And there was no contest. I got to Hurry Up Chicken Butt and they’re like just laughing hysterically, jumping up and down. They didn’t even want to hear the rest of the names. I was like, okay. Sold. So that was a really nice step forward. It was like, I know I’ve got a game that’s just fire for kids. They’re just so excited about this. And the next thing was, all right, well what do we make this box look like? And I was like, I know it has to be — the game itself involves a character and a die shaker and some sound effects. It’s got all this stuff packed into this character, this chicken. And I was like, I can’t just hide that. I have to put that in a box where you can see it. And that was really hard. The difference between box design for an iPhone and a game is an iPhone will spend a hundred dollars on that box with the materials and making it beautiful. And when you open your iPhone, you take the box and you throw it away. In a game, you’ve got about 40 cents to spend on the box and it has to last forever. It sucks. The equation is totally backwards, but I needed a thing that displayed the chicken and told you it made noise and lets you shake around the die and still hold its structure as a box so that you could remove this thing, play with it, and then reinsert it into the box in a way that isn’t going to mess with the integrity of the box — its structural integrity. So that was really hard, but we finally solved that. And then — Tim Ferriss: Did you do that before or after you started testing the waters with retailers? Elan Lee: After. Tim Ferriss: After? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Okay. I don’t want to hijack, but whenever it makes sense, I would love to know how, at what point you start testing the waters with Elan Lee: Well, we do this backwards. And when we started, you have to do it the opposite way. You have to walk into those sales pitches and you have to say, “Here’s the final product. Look how beautiful it is. You don’t have to trust us that this is going to sell. You can look at this thing and know that it’s going to sell.” For this game, luckily, because we have a really good track record, we walked in with no box. All I walked in with was a rough idea, a name scribbled on a piece of paper. And I said, “Trust me, this is going to be great. We’re going to solve everything. It’s going to be amazing.” And they said, “Okay, yeah, sold. Let’s buy it.” That comes from 10 years of pitching them hit after hit after hit. Tim Ferriss: I got it. So if it were earlier in Exploding Kittens’ existence, you go in with the finished box. Elan Lee: Yeah. They’re never taking a flyer on that. Tim Ferriss: Who creates the finished box? Do you guys create it in-house? How do you prototype something like that? Elan Lee: Yeah, we have an incredible team. We have a large scale printer. We print on actual cardboard. We have a paper folder so we can actually build the boxes. Which was an investment, that’s not off-the-shelf machinery, but it helps — okay, so look, normally whatever manufacturer you’re working with, they send you a prototype box. Because they make it and they want you to see the final product and that’s what you go into the sales meetings with. You say, “Look, here’s the box. Here’s how much it’s going to weigh. Here’s the final presentation. We’ve been working on it for a year and a half. Here it is.” I walk into those meetings like, “I got an idea, I’ve been working on it for three weeks. I want you to buy it right now. I don’t have any materials to show you.” So it’s a different kind of pitch that I’m very proud of because I’ve earned that and we haven’t ever let them down. Tim Ferriss: So in the case of Coyote, there was a lot of play testing that was done before we ended up in line review meetings. Elan Lee: Yeah. Wow. We skipped that whole part, didn’t we? Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah. Elan Lee: All right. Tim Ferriss: So could you talk about your secret cabal of families? Elan Lee: Yeah, yeah. Secret cabal of families. I love it. All right, so — Tim Ferriss: Another chapter for your memoir. Elan Lee: Yeah, right. That’s a good title there. So, okay, so here’s how most game companies test games. If you had partnered with a different games company, here’s what your experience would’ve been like. “All right, we got a game. We really like it. It’s really fun, lots of internal testing. Everyone’s on board. We now need external testing.” And they go to these market research groups and they pull strangers in and they sit in a room with a one-way mirror and they show the game and they play the game with people they don’t know and they order in some crappy catered lunch and they play the game and then they rate it on a scale of one to 10 and they fill out this form that’s like, “Here’s what I liked and here’s what I didn’t like and here’s what I would improve.” And then you get to watch those videos and they present you back all these forms and you get to make a determination. Okay. Nobody plays games like that. You don’t play games with strangers. When was the last time you played a board game with a stranger? Tim Ferriss: Can’t even remember. Elan Lee: It doesn’t happen. Right? The testing procedure that all these other companies go through is fundamentally flawed. They’re using a resource because it’s the only resource that exists. So I sat down, that’s what we did our first time. We went through one of those companies and they gave us all the results. And I looked at these results and I was like, oh, my God, we just burned $25,000 on this thing and it’s useless. So I realized at that moment, because nothing better exists, we’re going to have to build it ourselves. So I started reaching out to, at first our Kickstarter community and then our Discord community and then our Reddit community as we grow and grow and grow and said, “Look, I got a bunch of prototypes. I need families and friends who get together regularly to play games and I’m going to mail you a free game. You don’t even have to send it back to me, it’s yours forever. You get this amazing prototype. All I ask in return is upon receiving it within 24 hours, you play the game with your friends and family and you record the session and you send me that video. And that’s it. That’s all I want in return.” And within about 12 months, we had 400 families sign up for this thing. They are called our kiddie test pilots. And they’re this incredible group of enthusiastic game players that give us the best feedback. And we don’t have them fill out a questionnaire. All we ask them at the end of the test session, we say, “Look into the camera and answer one question. The only question we care about, do you want to play again?” And we know a game is ready when everybody looks into that lens and says, “Hell, yes!” And that’s it. That’s our testing process. Tim Ferriss: What are some of the pass/fail marks or green versus red signals that you look for? In other words, I imagine the response rate could vary, but you don’t know if that’s because people are busy or if it’s the wrong time of year or maybe they looked at the game, the box, and so on and it just didn’t sell them so they didn’t play it. Elan Lee: Totally. Tim Ferriss: Is that something you pay attention to? Are the people, I’m sure I’m not the only person wondering this, if they’re part of this special VIP get free game group, are they disincentivized to say, “Hell no, I would not play this game again.” So do you get a false positive signal? Elan Lee: I see. Tim Ferriss: How do you think through what constitutes a thumbs up versus a thumb sideways versus a thumbs down? Elan Lee: Yeah. There are a lot of false positives for sure. And there’s no way I can solve that problem. We prompt them in advance. We’re like, “Look, we need honestly — this game will get great if you tell us that something’s broken with it. We need to know that.” And they’re motivated because we also send them the final version of the game. So they know that’s coming, they know a better version is coming if they help us make it better. So some of the problem is solved that way, but not all of it. So that’s why the video is so important. Tim Ferriss: So they say, “We had a great time,” and you’re watching and you’re like, they are not having a great time. Elan Lee: Yeah, yeah. Look, count the number of eye rolls. Or you know a great one, they’ll take the instructions — I love this. They’ll open the instructions. And when you see that eyes go wide and they inhale. Tim Ferriss: Pull back and they’re like — Elan Lee: It’s like, “Oh, fuck.” Tim Ferriss: Instruction apnea. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Oh, God. Elan Lee: Something, that’s terrible. Right? And that’s really important. And there’s no survey in the world they can fill out that’s going to tell me that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: You need to watch the moment they see the instructions. Tim Ferriss: Because they may not even realize they’re doing it. Elan Lee: Yeah, exactly. Tim Ferriss: So how are they going to report it? Elan Lee: Yeah. And that’s why the video is so important. And we have very specific instructions for the video. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, what are they? Because I’m wondering how in the hell do you review 400 videos? Elan Lee: Oh, well one, we watch them at 4X speed and two is we’ve got a whole team of people that watch them and they flag moments. They don’t even say why this moment is important. Something happened here, something happened here. I’m going to go on to the next video now. And then the next group of people will go through and look at those flags and say, “Oh, big, deep inhale. Rules confusion.” Tim Ferriss: Nerd question, what do you use software wise for flagging stuff? Elan Lee: Vimeo. Tim Ferriss: Vimeo, okay. So you have people upload their videos to Vimeo? Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: Got it. Elan Lee: Yeah, so this whole process takes months and it’s really important. And the other thing is, I’ve got 400 test families, but I’m only going to send out five games at a time. The reason is I need to collect that feedback, make changes, and send out the next batch. Otherwise, I’ve got 10 results for a version and it’s useless. I know what the next five are going to be like ’cause I saw them on the first five. Tim Ferriss: I got it. So is it then, just to state my understanding, with the kiddie test pilots, you basically have — you’re not sending out the same version to 400, 600 people at once? Elan Lee: Five at a time. Tim Ferriss: Five at a time. And then you look at that cohort and see what comes back? Elan Lee: Mm-hmm. It’s always the same stuff. Tim Ferriss: Then you tweak and then it goes out to the next group. Elan Lee: Yeah, the next five. Tim Ferriss: Over what period of time do you get a prototype to the max number who are going to receive it? Elan Lee: Usually I would say six to eight months. And we’re tweaking two things. One is we’re tweaking gameplay, but much more commonly we’re tweaking the instructions. Because gameplay has already survived internal testing. So we know the game is fun. If we know this game is fun and then we watch a video of people not having fun, chances are it’s the instructions, not the game. And so that’s what we start attacking at that moment. Tim Ferriss: Got it. What are some of the risks of internal testing? ‘Cause I’ve always wondered, for instance, when I have, as I’m doing right now, doing a bunch of writing and I have people proofreading or test reading my writing, I do not only do it with professional writers. I mean they’re very good and I know I’m very fortunate to know some amazing writers, but they’re also a little too close to the material. It’s like a travel writer who can’t stop looking at their travel experience through the lens of a writer. They have lost the ability to just travel and have fun. Elan Lee: Yeah. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So what are some of the risks, if any, of internal testing? Elan Lee: So you and I have the same instinct here. I remember when we were testing this game internally, hadn’t gone out the door yet. Tim Ferriss: This game? Elan Lee: This game, Coyote. Yeah. I remember you would say, “Hey, can you show me test results? But can you have your accounting team test it instead of your game design team?” And I remember thinking, yeah, that’s what we do. I’m not interested in the game design team’s results. So I would show you the accounting team results and I would show you the sales people, the sales team’s results, who hadn’t even ever seen the game. Our internal testing starts out with the game design team, of course, but very quickly has to move on to the other teams, specifically the other teams who have never seen the game and don’t know the background. Because those are really the only tests that we care about. So your instinct is perfect there, and I’m very happy to say you didn’t have to teach us that, we already knew that part. Tim Ferriss: I mean, if I’m teaching you anything, I don’t know what it would be other than my obsessive focus on — I’m sorry for the volume of email and the volume of text messages and the volume of everything. Elan Lee: Every single one of those made the game better. Truly. Truly. I mean, okay, look, we’ve only done, we’ve done, I think two partnerships total. Three partnerships total. We did a game with Penn Jillette of Penn & Teller. We did a game with Jeff Probst of Survivor, and now we’ve done a game with Tim Ferriss. You probably sent more notes than the other two combined. Tim Ferriss: I sent a lot of notes. Sent a lot of notes. I really had a blast with it. And I remember this moment, and I’m wondering if this happened before or after the line review meetings. I think it might’ve been afterwards, but you could place it for me because this is my first game and I don’t put my name on anything. That was part of the very, very truthful pitch. It’s not like one of, I don’t have Tim Ferriss microwave enchiladas and Tim Ferriss sneakers. And then just as an aside, I have the Tim Ferriss game. It’s like, no, no, no, I don’t put my name on anything. So I take it very, very seriously. And I think it was, tell me if I’m getting this wrong, pretty sure it was Carly, who’s amazing. Elan Lee: Carly is the president of Exploding Kittens. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Carly is incredible. And because there’s always a fear, for me at least, where it’s like, maybe internally I think it’s great, and then it gets released into the wild and then, oh, shit there’s a real problem. Like Houston, we have a problem. Elan Lee: Yeah, and you can’t take it back. Tim Ferriss: Right. So what do you do? And I remember Carly, I want to say, sent a text to me. She was in, I want to say Germany at some type of gaming convention or meeting of distributors. I don’t remember the exact context, but she said Coyote was belle of the ball. She’s like, “You would not believe we had an entire huge room full of people playing, smashing on the tables over and over and over and over again.” And I was like, whew. Elan Lee: Yeah. Isn’t that a great feeling? Tim Ferriss: Okay, here we go, LFG. Elan Lee: She sent me a video of that. So just to set the stage there, there are 2,000 people that — sorry, there’s 2,000 people at this hotel of the 25 hotels that are part of this convention. And there’s one games room and there’s 10 tables in there. And the idea is there should be a different game at every table. And everyone’s testing out the games and sampling them. And we put Coyote on one table and almost immediately people started gathering around. And so those people said, “Can we just grab another copy and we’ll just put it on the next table just so not everyone has to gather around this one table?” ‘Cause it looked so intriguing. And so they sent it to another table. And then by the time Carly sent me a video, it was at every table in the room. It was just an entire hotel playing this one game because nobody wanted to play anything else. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, wild. Elan Lee: It was so neat. It was so neat. And how gratifying? We’ve been killing ourselves on this thing. And to see an audience receive it and say, thank you for the gift. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, yeah, totally. And also, I mean, I said it to you guys and look, it says technically it says age 10 plus. So I don’t want to contradict that, but if you’re willing to modify the rules, which is something that I encourage, and we have that in the instructions, house rules, feel free to modify the rules. But I sent you guys the video of my friend’s four-year-old after she played, which was like this — Elan Lee: So good! Tim Ferriss: It was such an amazing video. And this is the first thing I’ve ever done that can include families and kids directly/ Elan Lee: Easily. Tim Ferriss: Where it’s like, four-year-old, 10-year-old is not going to have any interest or necessarily the capacity to read one of my phone books that are like 600 pages long. It’s not going to happen. So this is also so much fun to finally now that it’s kind of released into the wild to start seeing these things bubbling up that I hoped would be there. Elan Lee: It’s the reason you make a game. You want to share an experience that then the recipients get to share with those people that they love. That’s why you make a game. That’s exactly what we’ve made here. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So let’s talk about the selling process a little bit more. Because you said, there’s the game development, there’s building the game, there’s crafting the game. But there is an equally important part, which is how do you get this thing into people’s hands? And for that you need distribution. So this is going to be a callback. Remember that line review at the very beginning and then I took us on a very meandering path, but there was a point to it. How do you pitch big retailers? How does that happen? And how did you do it in the beginning of Exploding Kittens and how — I know it’s changed over time as you’ve built your track record, but nonetheless you still need to do it. And actually, here’s a data point that most people will never hear anyone talk about. What percentage of your sales are offline retail versus online? Elan Lee: Yeah. All right, we’ll start there. Yeah, we never share these numbers, but for you, Tim — Tim Ferriss: Thank you. Elan Lee: — here we go. 70 percent of our sales are in-person retail. Only 30 percent are online sales. Totally backwards than what you’d expect for almost any industry. But yeah, people like to walk into a store, they like to see and touch and feel the game and flip it over and read the back and compare it to the other games. And that’s where we sell our games. Which means not only do I need tremendous retail buy-in, those sales meetings are so important, those line reviews. But also the game has to sell itself on the shelf. When you’re walking down that games aisle, 70 percent of our audience does this. You need to look at all the game, hundreds of games, and you need to stop dead in your tracks on this one. And you need to say, “Ooh, what’s that?” And that starts at that line review, starts with getting them to say, not only are we going to commit to this game, but we’re going to put it in multiple locations. So you see it more than once. Very important. Also, we work with them to figure out the color scheme. And you and I, we did tons of surveys on the color scheme and the character and everything to stop people in their tracks. Tim Ferriss: So just a quick sidebar. I know I keep doing this, but some of you may remember, and for those who never heard it I’ll just tell you, from my very first book, 4-Hour Workweek, I used Google AdWords to test the top, let’s just call it 10 title and subtitle contenders. So I bid on keywords that were related to the subject matter in the book. And then the sponsored results, the ads were automatically split tested, like multivariate tested by Google. They will do this automatically. And then all of the URLs, I had different URLs for each title option. They just took people to an under construction page. Because I didn’t care about conversion, I cared about interest, sufficient interest click. And that is how I figured out the title. And then for the cover, back in the day, I went to Borders, which was on University Ave. in Palo Alto. And I had a counter, like you might see from a bouncer at the front of a club. And I put different covers onto a book of the same dimensions on the shelf. Elan Lee: Oh, wow. Tim Ferriss: I guess I didn’t tell you this. Under the new nonfiction. Elan Lee: Oh, my God. Tim Ferriss: And I just, during the peak hours over a couple of days, I just tracked the number of times it got picked up. Elan Lee: Oh, that’s so good. Tim Ferriss: And then I used that to determine which cover to use. Elan Lee: I love this, I love this. Tim Ferriss: Now there are better or certainly easier tools to use. So we ended up, there are a number of them, I’ll just mention a few. So we used PickFu, P-I-C-K-F-U.com. There’s also Intellivy, I-N-T-E-L-L-I-V-Y, and then there’s another one called Stickybeak also. But these allow you to do roughly the same thing, which is you can take, for instance, with this box design or any type of art, or you could probably do it with copy, many different things. You can survey people who fit a particular demographic. And so you could identify whatever the ages, the gender, if they are members of a particular service, whether they have Prime membership or this membership or that membership. You can fine slice it however you want, and then you can serve up variants. So for this coyote who you see on the cover, I’ll explain for the people, basically the box looks like a slightly enlarged box for a deck of cards and then the top of the box is this beautiful autumnal orange, almost a saffron, like Buddhist robe. Elan Lee: We spent so much time on this color. Tim Ferriss: We spent so much time on this, it is impossible to overstate how much time I spent on this and everybody spent on it. Then there’s this beautiful lime green. I remember taking photographs of particular leaves at particular times of the year with light coming through it to identify the hexadecimal or Pantone numbers for this particular grain. Elan Lee: Oh, I remember this well, yeah. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, you remember it, you remember it. And then looking at color theory and the color wheel and, oh, my God, it went on and on. But above the coyote which is in the center of the box, there is this upper portion of a cartoon coyote’s head and very much trickster. Where it ended up is there’s a little hat on the coyote, there’s an earring, there’s a wink and the snout is where it’s cut off so you don’t see the nose. And this was originally, I remember sketching this initially on a Zoom call by pen and paper and then holding it up to the Zoom call to the camera and then later sending the scan and then we worked from there. But we had variants with no hat, we had variants with no earring, we had variants with both eyes open looking to camera, so to speak, we had both eyes open looking in one direction off to the side and we were able to very quickly get a very good statistical signal on what people preferred. Elan Lee: Yes. However — Tim Ferriss: However. Elan Lee: — to your credit, when you showed me that character, I think, initially, both the coyote’s eyes were open and we had some questions about the hat and I remember asking you all these questions. “What do you think of a wink? What do you think of an earring? What do you think of a hat? What do you think of one eye closed? With both eyes closed? What do you think? What do you think?” And to your credit, your answer was always “Let’s test it. I don’t want to have an opinion about this, I do have an opinion but I don’t even want to tell you, let’s test it.” And that is such an intelligent way to approach this. And ultimately, this beautiful character that we ended up with was so clearly the winner, it wasn’t even close. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it wasn’t even close. And so we were able to get this very strong signal from thousands of people voting and, boom, here we are. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Okay. So, we were talking about the road to retail. So it’s 70 percent of your sales are in-person retail versus online. Elan Lee: Yeah, right. Tim Ferriss: And, therefore, the stakes are high for these line reviews. Elan Lee: Yeah, line reviews are a big deal. And I remember, so we really wanted to all show up in person. I remember you were trying so hard to get — our first line review was with Walmart in Bentonville, Arkansas. I remember you wanted so badly to be there and there was some scheduling conflict that just wasn’t going to let it happen. And we tried to change the date but, again, they’ve got so many meetings and you’ve got to get in in exactly this time and they couldn’t change it to anything appropriate. And I remember thinking, “Oh, we’re sunk, I don’t know how to sell this game without Tim there in the room showing how much passion he has.” And you had a great solve, you just recorded a video of all that passion and you sat down in front of the camera and you just riffed on the game. You were just like, “Here’s why I love this, here’s why this is important to me, here’s why I made this game, first time I put my name on a thing,” and you recorded this beautiful and passionate video. And I remember walking into the line review and sitting down and saying, “I have a new game. First thing I’m going to do is we’re going to play this game and I’m not going to tell you anything about it, we’re just going to play this game.” And I set up the game and, within five minutes, they’re laughing and they’re having this incredible time and they’re like, “Oh, this is amazing, this is so much fun. How are you going to sell this thing?” And I said, “I’m going to play a video for you now,” and that was it. It was that one-two punch. It was we’ve nailed game design and we’ve nailed the pitch, we know exactly who to talk to and how to talk to them. And they saw those two elements and they’re full line purchase, every single store is getting this game. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, wild, yeah. Elan Lee: That has never happened on an initial pitch for us ever. Normally, we get into a subset of stores and then, eventually, it rolls out to all the stores. This was the first time ever they said, “Whatever it takes, we need this game everywhere.” Tim Ferriss: Which is still very surreal for me and I’m so grateful, obviously, and it’s terrifying at the same time. Not going to lie, this is mister dip the toe, then one foot, then wade up to the ankles, this is just — Elan Lee: Yeah, fire hose on. Tim Ferriss: — full Monty from second zero. What are other keys to pitching in a line review? And that could also be, I’ll just offer another option, which is what are some common mistakes that people make or that you suspect people make? Elan Lee: Okay. So, the first most common mistake — Tim Ferriss: Because this could be for games but it could be for — Elan Lee: It’s for anything, yeah. Tim Ferriss: — cosmetics, it could be for anything. Elan Lee: For anything. The first question is how are you represented in that room? Remember I said they only take a certain number of meetings, it took us five years to get one of those meetings. Tim Ferriss: Wow. Elan Lee: And the way that you get the — Tim Ferriss: Even with the thunderous, crazy lightning-in-a-bottle success of Exploding Kittens? Elan Lee: They only have so many hours. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: Yeah. So what you have to do instead is you find someone who already has a meeting and you hire them as your publisher and then they represent your game in their meeting. That’s how most companies do it and that’s how we did it for years. So the first problem is you have to make sure that whoever’s representing you, assuming you can’t be in the room because 99.9 percent of the people can’t, they are representing you the right way. With enough attention, they’re pitching it the right way, they’re representing it the right way, they’re saying the right words, they’re conveying the right fun. Tim Ferriss: How do you ensure that? Elan Lee: It’s a personal relationship and you — It’s just hard, it’s really hard. And to be honest, I don’t want to name names, but we went through three different publishers and I wasn’t happy with how — Tim Ferriss: How did you, this may or may not be something you can talk about, but how did you craft the deal structure such that you could take a swing and then you’re like, “Okay, swing and a miss, we’re going to go to someone else. And then swing and a miss, we’re going to go to someone else.” Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: How are those deals structured? Elan Lee: We got very lucky. Because our Kickstarter campaign was so through the roof, that fed into our Amazon sales immediately. And so I could go from publisher to publisher saying, “Look how many games I sold the last week, look how many I sold the week before that. This is a prestigious title that you want to represent.” And then when they wouldn’t represent me properly, wouldn’t get the right sales, couldn’t get the right deal structure in place because we also demand quite a bit as far as where the game is placed, is it in aisle, is it out of aisle, meaning is it in the game section or somewhere else. Tim Ferriss: Ankle height versus eye height. Elan Lee: Exactly, right. Those bottom shelves are like a death sentence, nobody looks down there. Can we get games at checkout where they’re selling chewing gum, can we put games there? Can we get games in the catalog? All this stuff that I wanted for our games was just not being properly represented for us. So, eventually, after our sales got high enough, I finally was able to stop doing that silly dance with these publishers and we were able to publish our own games. Tim Ferriss: Quick question. So, if I’m hearing you correctly, the success of the direct to consumer, the DTC, Kickstarter, Amazon, I should say online, those successes allowed you to dictate certain deal terms with the publishers so you had flexibility. Elan Lee: Correct. And they allow us to say you want to represent us. Because, even then, they only have a one, maybe two-hour meeting and so there’s only so many games they can pitch so how do they fill that library. Tim Ferriss: And then you get to the point where you can go and book those meetings yourself. How important was having a critical mass of SKUs? Elan Lee: Oh, it’s everything, yeah. Tim Ferriss: Because I have to imagine, if I’m a major retailer, I don’t want to have a meeting with someone who only has one thing to sell. Elan Lee: Well, that’s why we couldn’t do it at first. It was only once we had, I think, 10 games was the magic number to make it worth their while. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Okay, got it. Elan Lee: Yeah. And that takes a long time. And it’s not just 10 games, it’s 10 bestsellers. And unless you’re there, they’re just like, “Yeah, just go through a publisher. We don’t have time for — “ Tim Ferriss: Don’t have time. Elan Lee: We take 10 meetings, we don’t have time for an 11th. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. All right, so what have you learned understanding but, to the extent possible, if we can put aside the element of Exploding Kittens having and developing this incredible track record which allows you to not cut corners in a bad way but you can go in without a finished prototype of the box, et cetera. If we put that aside for the moment, what have you learned about line reviews if you look at your first outing versus — Elan Lee: Yeah. Oh, I love this. Tim Ferriss: — the more refined line reviews? Elan Lee: Yeah, okay. Tim Ferriss: And I’m spending a lot of time on this, guys, because this applies to everything. It applies to so much. You have a movie? Okay, fine, how are people going to see the movie? Yeah, you can go direct but you might want a distribution partner. What we’re talking about will apply to that pitch meeting, a lot of it. And it’s the stuff that mainstream magic is made of is figuring out how to craft these meetings. Elan Lee: Yeah. Remember you said, “Like it or not, you’re in sales?” Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: Here it is. This is where the rubber meets the road. Dust off your tap dancing shoes because, holy crap, these are tough. So you have to walk into that meeting and first you have to keep in mind you are their 10th meeting. Even if you’re not their 10th meeting, you’re their 10th meeting. They’re in this “I’m tired, I want to get out of this room, I’ve been at this for too long,” they’re in that mindset. So the first thing you’ve got to do is get them out of that funk. You need them to understand that this is going to be the best of the 10 meetings. And you do that with enthusiasm, you do that with props, you do that with a cool video. The stuff that can get them out of, “Oh, this isn’t like the other meetings.” Cool, that’s where you start. So we walk into the room with two of those suitcases, not the ones that fit in the overhead, the big crazy ones you have to check and they’re filled with games, the most beautiful games we’ve got. Even stuff that we’re not pitching that day, even stuff we know will never see the light of day because we’re going to set all of those up. And the basic premise is buy into this world. Exploding Kittens is not a product, it’s a whole world and you can have this world on your store shelves. And so that’s how we start and that’s a really nice way to start. Okay. Then what they’re expecting is, “Okay, pitch us a game one at a time. Pitch this, okay, you’re done. Okay, pitch the next one. Okay, you’re done. Pitch the next one.” What we do is very different. Instead of pitching a game and then pitching the next one, just like I said, for Coyote, we’re like, “Hey, we’re going to play a game.” And usually they say, “We don’t have time to play, can you just pitch it?” And I say, “No, we’re going to play a game.” Confrontation, I get it, but I force them to play the games, every single one of them. Now, I’m not going to play all the way through, I’m not going to spend 10 or 20 minutes. Tim Ferriss: All right. This might seem like a trivial detail but I don’t think it is. You in a tuxedo and a top hat for this? Are you dressed in your Sunday’s finest? Elan Lee: Oh, yeah. Oh, it’s so funny. So I learned this in my Microsoft days. If I dress up, if I wear a tuxedo, if I wear a suit, if I even wear a button-up shirt, nobody takes me seriously because I’m supposed to be the creative guy. I have to wear the creative guy uniform, I have to wear a t-shirt, I have to wear jeans, otherwise, no one looks at me. So that’s how I show up. Luckily, it’s a really comfortable uniform for me. So I force them to play and I’m there being the game’s biggest cheerleader. I don’t usually let them win, but I usually orchestrate a scenario in the game where they’re having as much fun as possible. And my goal is for them to have exactly those emotions that we talked about. When we start, I need them to think I can do that. And then, a minute in, I need them to think, “Oh, I did that. What’s next? Oh, I can do that next thing too.” And I am just crafting that. And right at the point where they’re like, “Oh, I know what the next thing is,” I pull the game away. We’re done playing, now let me tell you how we’re going to sell this game. And it’s because, at that point, they’re drooling. And I do that 10 times in a meeting and we just keep hitting that over and over. And I am very aware that the last two games I pitch are usually not going to be purchased because they’re exhausted because that roller coaster — they’ve been up and down too many times. Tim Ferriss: Right. So, you’re going to have to figure out the sequence. Elan Lee: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Do you start with the game you hope is going to be the big purchase? How do you sequence it? Elan Lee: Yeah, yeah. We open with our shortest, easiest pitch and what that usually is an Exploding Kittens expansion. So, if I need to sell an expansion box or a new Exploding Kittens product and I know I don’t have to work very hard to sell it because they always sell, that’ll take the first spot. That just warms the waters, gets us all eased in. Tim Ferriss: A little yes momentum. Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: Doesn’t hurt. Elan Lee: Yeah. The number two spot is the glory spot. Tim Ferriss: Okay, got it. Elan Lee: Whoever is there, that’s the game I’m actually pitching today. That’s where Coyote was, that’s the big thing we’re going to talk about. And then the next five are equal, it doesn’t matter what order they are, those are — usually we’ll sell all five of those. At a typical meeting, all five. What happens after that is very iffy. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Now you mentioned you play the game, you get them super excited, hopefully, they’re drooling over it and then you say, “All right, I’m going to take the game away, here’s how we’re going to sell it.” What is included in the “Here’s how we’re going to sell it?” Elan Lee: Oh, yeah, okay. So important. So this has changed over the last three years. It used to be I have to start with the box and we still — I shouldn’t say it used to be, it still is, we start with the box. “Look how beautiful this thing is,” and we do a mock-up, here’s how it looks on the shelf and it’s usually from a photograph we took that morning. We want to show you, “Hey, Target, here’s what your shelf looks like. Hey, Walmart, here’s what your shelf looks like. Here is our game right there in line.” Tim Ferriss: And I should mention, this probably goes without saying, but you are not just showing up and winging it, you guys — Elan Lee: Oh, my God. Tim Ferriss: — rehearse like you are going to be performing once in a lifetime at Carnegie Hall. Elan Lee: It is, if we screw up this meeting, our company is screwed. We don’t survive a bad meeting so, yeah, there is nothing that matters more than this. This is, arguably, 70 percent of our business this year. If we mess up this meeting, we will see a 70 percent drop. If they bought zero games, I don’t know that our company would survive that, so it’s a big deal. We rehearse constantly, we make changes constantly, we make all these props. We try to get the spot either right after breakfast or right after lunch because that’s when they’re in the best moods. All of it is orchestrated and so carefully. Who’s in the meeting? How many chairs are we going to fill? Tim Ferriss: How do you request those time slots? Because I imagine you’re not the only people who are thinking about this, right? It makes me think of the data, it’s a meta-analysis long ago looking at judges’ verdicts before or after meals and leniency, right? Elan Lee: Yeah, right. So, how do you get the right slots, yeah. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So, how do you angle for those? Elan Lee: There’s an art to that as well. So we have agents, we have representatives, one for Target and one for Walmart, and these are people who live in those cities, and they live and breathe sales with the sales rep. So, their job is — the very cynical way to say it is they’re like lobbyists but the more — Tim Ferriss: Ambassadors. Elan Lee: Ambassadors, there we go. That’s a much more appropriate way. They have been doing the job for longer than the salespeople have, longer than the buyers have. And as a result, the relationship that they have with the buyers is actually one of education because they’ve seen all the mistakes, they know where all the landmines are, they know how to avoid them. And so part of the art of getting the best meetings, of getting yourself set up the best, is to hire the best agent. Tim Ferriss: How does someone find said agents? Elan Lee: Friends of friends of friends. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: The best ones already have too many clients. You can’t work with them. Tim Ferriss: Right, the usual situation. Elan Lee: Yeah, exactly. But if you have a good enough brand, if you have the right relationships, if you can talk to the right people and if you’re persistent, you can get the right agents. I actually thought we didn’t need an agent at all at first. I was like, “We can just do it, we’re going to show up the day before, we’re going to walk into these meetings,” and some very good friends of mine in the industry said, “You are an idiot, it’s just not going to work.” So we started working with agents and they’re incredible. They know the industry, they can — Tim Ferriss: Now, just to dig into that a little, why wouldn’t that work? Is it that the code of etiquette and the way everything has been set up involves those agents and, therefore, it wouldn’t work or are there other reasons why going in guns blazing without representation wouldn’t work? Elan Lee: Yeah, both. The answer is both. So the buyers are much less likely to take you seriously unless you have an agent in the room. And part of that is just because — Tim Ferriss: I guess part of it is just these fools don’t know how this is done. Elan Lee: Exactly right. Tim Ferriss: Right. They’re showing up to Downton Abbey wearing a tank top. Elan Lee: Exactly right. Tim Ferriss: And they don’t know how to use the silverware. Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: Why should I trust their ability to be a good partner and actually get things done on time if they haven’t done their homework? Elan Lee: Precisely. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: And the other half is you haven’t done your homework. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Elan Lee: You actually don’t know, you actually don’t know how to use the silverware. When we walk into a meeting, the agent has done a year’s worth of work prepping for that meeting. They have made sure the buyers know what you’re going to pitch, how many games you’re going to pitch, what the order of the games is. They’ve made sure that the sales for the previous purchases they’ve made going into the meeting so they already have the confidence in, yes, these people are going to deliver. They’ve made sure that inventory levels are where they need to be so that a meeting doesn’t get sidetracked by them saying “This game is sold out, how did you let that happen?” So many things can go wrong that the agent is fixing before they go wrong so that the meeting stays on the rails and gets you to success. Tim Ferriss: Okay, got it. Elan Lee: It’s a full-time job and, without it — Tim Ferriss: And so that agent is the person who lobbies for the appointment after breakfast for lunch? Elan Lee: Exactly, yes. But you have to know to ask for it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, right. Elan Lee: Because your agent has other clients. They’re going to sit through maybe three, sometimes four meetings in that sell cycle and they’re going to give that prime slot to the one who asks for it. So you’ve got to know to ask for it. Here I am telling you on this podcast, it’s probably going to make my job a little bit harder for the next sales round, but so be it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. People listening need to hop through a few hoops before — Elan Lee: Yeah, fair enough, all right. Tim Ferriss: — they end up being viable competition. Elan Lee: Yeah, yeah, yeah, all right. There’s a few other tricks that — Tim Ferriss: And we are going to come back to, if you’re just developing a game at your kitchen table, what are some of the first steps. So, we’re going to get to that. Elan Lee: Yeah, we’ll get there. Yeah, for sure. Tim Ferriss: But in the meantime, you said a couple of tricks of the trade? Elan Lee: Yeah, there’s a few more. I should be a little careful about what I say but, look — Tim Ferriss: We can always bleep things in edit later. Elan Lee: All right. So, you want to pay attention to, believe it or not, all of the retailers have color themes year by year. So you want to make sure that, when you walk into a meeting, your boxes match that color scheme, it makes it much easier for them to say yes. Tim Ferriss: Had no idea. Elan Lee: Yeah, right, I know. Because why would you? Because why would anybody, right? There’s things like those agents are given permission to read the notes from the all-hands meeting from the company so they know what the company’s priorities are. And so you want to sit down with your agent in advance and say, “Those buyers, what are they going to get promotions and raises based on this year? Is it more throughput at the store? Is it promote online sales? Is it match the color scheme?” Whatever it is, you want to make sure — Tim Ferriss: What are the incentives? Elan Lee: Yeah. And you want to make sure that, when they look at your games, they think, “Oh, I’m really trying to promote online sales this year, whoa, this game would do great on our website. And then the next game, this game would do great on our website as well.” And by the time you get to the end of the meeting they’re like, “Oh, my God, I can get a promotion if I just buy all 10 of these games.” That’s what you want them to walk away with. Tim Ferriss: All right. So, these meetings are huge, we’ve established this. A huge deal. Elan Lee: So important. Tim Ferriss: You mentioned a couple of tricks to the trade. And any other tips, tricks, learnings along the way? Elan Lee: So what happens after those meetings is also very important. Okay. So there’s two things we have to talk about. One is pricing structure and the other is marketing. Tim Ferriss: Yep. Elan Lee: So in the meeting you talk a little bit about both. You have to now include marketing. Remember I said three years ago things were different than today? Three years ago, the marketing plan that you show for your game is largely your own website. Maybe you’ve bought some TV commercials, things like billboards, product placement here and there, things like that. Today, none of that matters. All they care about is social media because that’s the only form of marketing for games that works anymore, so. Tim Ferriss: I should say also it particularly works on, and this is my understanding, on platforms like TikTok or now that other platforms have realized to avoid TikTok consuming their market share, they need to push and reward short-form video. Elan Lee: That’s right. Tim Ferriss: Short-form video. Casual games are perfectly suited to short-form video. Elan Lee: Yeah. And the way that you build the most effective videos for those is you need to inspire, I think, two emotions. One, “I understand what those people are experiencing right now,” And two, “I would like to experience that.” And it took me forever to get to those two sentences. At first it was, “Let’s show gameplay, let’s show setup, let’s show a memorable moment. Let’s show people screaming and yelling because they’re having so much fun.” None of that matters. None of that works. “That looks like fun. I could have that much fun.” That’s it. That’s what you’re trying to show. Tim Ferriss: How does that differ from the first? Elan Lee: Um, it’s very, very focused, you want to — remember we talked about mastery early on? Tim Ferriss: Well, I also asked you guys, because we were talking about this very early on in the process, right? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Also, because if I’m procrastinating doing something hard, I like to talk about the marketing because it just is a lot easier for me to talk about. But I wanted to see examples of videos that had worked for any of your games. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Social posts. And so they were sent over. I was like, “Okay, I think I can deduce why this works.” Often it was one person playing the other person struggling to guess what the other person was doing and one person losing it laughing. Just inconsolably, but in the best possible way, losing it, getting the giggles out of control. Elan Lee: Okay. So I’ll tell you, one of the most effective pieces of media we have ever used was for Poetry for Neanderthals. This has like at this point, I don’t know, tens of millions of views. And all it is — oh, sorry, “Here’s how you play Poetry for Neanderthals. I have to get you, I have a secret word on this card. I have to get you to say that word. And I can only speak using single syllable words. That’s the whole game. If I mess up, someone sitting next to me has a giant inflatable neanderthal club and they get to bonk me on the head.” All right. So there’s our whole game. The best video we’ve ever seen is someone who’s trying to get a person to say the word “garage.” And we know they’re trying to get the person to say the word garage because we put that right on the screen. We show you, “Here’s the secret word, it’s garage.” And they’re just saying, “Car, go here. Car, hole, car hole. This car hole, big car hole.” And everyone’s losing it. And the poor person trying to guess is like, “What the fuck is a car hole? Glove compartment? What are you trying to say?” And then they say, “Vehicle. Multiple syllable word.” And so they get bonked on the head. Okay, here’s why that video is so effective. It’s those two senses. One is, “I see the experience they’re having. I get that.” And the secondary corollary is “I could do better than that.” Tim Ferriss: Is this the video, I think I remember seeing this. This might have been a separate video, but there’s a woman who’s the poet and then there’s the guy next to her, holding the club. Elan Lee: Yeah, so menacing. Tim Ferriss: The ax is going to drop. Yeah. And everyone’s losing it, including the guy at the back. Elan Lee: Because you look at that and you say, “I understand the rules,” immediately. “I understand the experience they’re having. I would like to have that experience.” And that’s what makes for an effective social media video. Tim Ferriss: All right, so how do you pitch that? Elan Lee: Well, we show a lot of examples and we show a track record. We say, “Look, here’s how many views our last round of videos got. Here’s how many likes, here’s how many shares, here’s how many subscriptions.” All this stuff, we show them right there in the meeting. We never had to do that. This is a brand new phenomenon. And we say, “Here’s the type of video that we’re going to craft for this new game,” and we always couch it in those two sentences. “Here’s how we’re going to explain the fun people are having and here’s how we’re going to make the audience feel like they would like to have that much fun as well.” And that’s been very effective for us. So that’s now half the meeting, because every game we start by, I demo the game. Tim Ferriss: It’s social media strategy. Elan Lee: Yes. I demo the game, I pull the game back, we talk a little bit about the pricing structure and the theme and the box and all that. And then we go right into social media strategy for that game. Because I have to spend as much time on that as I did on the game design because they’re equally important now. It’s huge. Such a difference. Tim Ferriss: All right, so for somebody listening who is thinking about making a game, and I really encourage everyone to do that, and I’m just going to flash, this is as good a time as any, just to flash these blank cards that are within every Coyote box and they are color-coded. You can use these to make action cards, which are these different gestures and actions and so on. Elan Lee: Yeah. Those are the templates that we use. Tim Ferriss: These are the templates. You can use them to make Coyote cards, these modifiers. You can use them to make the attack cards which you use to sabotage other people. There are other ways to play those cards. This is intended to invite everyone to basically create their own game by modifying the rules. Elan Lee: That’s right. Tim Ferriss: Or adding new elements that are uniquely their own. You can have fun with your friends, you can have fun with your kids. I mean, this is intended to make you a part of the creative process, which you will be part of anyway, just by the way you play the game but this takes it to another level. And this was a really important element for me. So this will be a warm-up in a sense. You get to try game design, game development light, with these blank cards. But let’s say somebody then decides they want to give it a go, maybe it’s with one of their kids, like you did with your daughter. Maybe it’s by themselves. Who knows? Maybe it’s going to the game shop, local game shop, which I really recommend people do. If you’ve never been to a real proper game shop, go in on a game night when people are set up and also check out the games you might not be inclined to check out. So if you’re a casual gamer, go to a Warhammer night, see what that’s about. Elan Lee: Totally. Tim Ferriss: Check out these different worlds. Elan Lee: Another secret weapon is go to a game shop, find the owner, or even the person behind the counter, someone who knows what they’re talking about. And just say, “I’m looking for a game. What game do you wish more people would give a try?” And you’ll find the gems that way because they know. But maybe the game doesn’t have the best box or the best name or it fell short somewhere and people just aren’t buying it, but they know it’s amazing. That’s where you find them. It’s a great experience. Tim Ferriss: So start testing the waters in that way. It’s so easy to do in a place like Austin. I mean, this is Austin. People might think of game locations and X, Y, Z, they’re all over the place. There happens to be a really vibrant scene here. And if you wanted to, if one wanted to start developing their own game, let’s say they find something that starts to stick. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Okay. We’ve got a tiger by the tail. This seems to be working. They’re play testing. It might take a while, like Settlers of Catan, I think Klaus Teuber had 150 versions before, that’s a complex game. But let’s say they start to develop the game and they’re like, “All right, I would like to try to sell this.” What are the options? What would you say to someone who’s like, they’re smart, they can plan, they’ve operated in the world before, so they’re not new to adulting, but they have no experience in selling games. Elan Lee: There are three paths. I’ll tell you all three paths and then I’ll tell you my favorite one. Tim Ferriss: All right. Elan Lee: Okay. Path number one, self-publishing. Self-publishing is hard, but you can print out your own decks. You can design everything yourself. You can write the rules yourself. You can do absolutely everything yourself. And then you can spend a few thousand dollars, publish a few hundred copies, and send them out to all your friends. Okay. So that’s option one. It sucks. Don’t do that one. It’s just the worst. I mean, you’re just going to make every mistake and you’re not — Tim Ferriss: And you’re going to have to pay for your mistakes. Elan Lee: And you pay for every mistake, and then once you make the mistake, now you can’t take it back and you can’t undo it. Just don’t self-publish. It’s a terrible idea. Okay, there’s number one. That’s not my favorite one. Number two is you go to an existing publisher, Hasbro, Mattel, nowadays Exploding Kittens. You can approach big publishers, pitch your game, and then strike a deal with them where they will handle all the risk, but they will also take most of the reward. You can still honestly get very rich this way, but you have to get into their portfolio, so either you need a track record or you just have to absolutely wow them or you need some other — you have to show up with some bona fides. You can’t just say, “I’m a brand new designer, here’s my brand new game, please publish me.” Tim Ferriss: How would you, maybe there are exceptions where people have wowed them, first time game designer with a game, how does one do that? Elan Lee: You go to a convention. Tim Ferriss: You go to a convention? Elan Lee: Yeah, you go to a convention, you demo your game, they will all show up. They’re like agents recruiting for a sports team. They’re going to show up to all of those places and they’re going to walk the halls and they’re going to check even the smallest booths. And they’re going to even go to the big convention halls where everyone just has their own little folding table or even a temporary folding table. They’re going to look at all of that stuff. So it is possible to do it that way, but you have to keep in mind they have very few slots open and they usually only have one or two agents, scouts looking for games. So your chances of success there are low as a first-time person, much better if you can walk in, if you can schedule a meeting and they will take that meeting and then you can say, “Here’s why you should not say no to this.” Tim Ferriss: What are the things you can do or put in a pitch that increase the likelihood of getting a meeting, outside of being an influencer with 20 million followers on Instagram? Elan Lee: Well, yeah, that helps, but the reason that helps is, what I was going to say is the ability to sell the game, whatever it is, maybe you’re an influencer — Tim Ferriss: By the way, also true of nonfiction writing. Elan Lee: Exactly right. Tim Ferriss: If you’re selling a book. Elan Lee: And for selling a screenplay and for really selling anything, you need to be able to say, “Here’s why people are going to take notice of this thing and why you would be a fool to pass on this opportunity.” That’s hard. Oftentimes the best way to do that is to have already done it, which means your first time out, you need what I’m about to talk about, which is option three. Option three, crowdfunding. This is relatively new, like 10, 15 years old. Tim Ferriss: So it is, I guess, self-publishing in a sense, but you’re getting other people to fund the development. Elan Lee: Two things, yes to that. Exactly right. Other people are funding a hundred percent of the development, which is incredible. But also you are collecting those funds on a platform that promotes the game. People are there watching your video, you’re trying to convince them. Tim Ferriss: It is a discovery platform. Elan Lee: Exactly. Perfectly phrased. It is a discovery platform that was missing 15 years ago. “Watch my self-published YouTube video and hopefully fund my game,” it just didn’t exist. So now people are looking at crowdfunding sites looking for cool new experiences and backing them. And that’s a new invention and that’s really cool. And it’s not my favorite one either. So I just said I picked my favorite and I just pitched three and I said, “None of them are my favorite.” Here’s my actual favorite. A combination of two and three. Start on crowdfunding, especially if it’s your first time out. Learn everything you can. Your first project is probably going to fail. That’s okay. You’ve got nothing at stake. You didn’t lose anything. Fix it. Relaunch it, fix it again. Relaunch it again. Take as many times as you need. There’s nothing at risk here. You’re just learning the process. Awesome. When you get a success on whatever crowdfunding platform you love, now go to those publishers and say, “Here are my bona fides. Here’s proof that this thing is going to sell. I’ve already sold this once. I’ve already gotten 10.” Tim Ferriss: Do you do that before you have shipped the game? Elan Lee: No. Very important. No. Ship the game first. If the only thing you can prove is that you are a train wreck waiting to happen, you will get nothing from them. So ship the game, show that you’re organized, even if it’s a small fulfillment like you sell a hundred copies of your game, show that you can fulfill those hundred copies and then start to show the reactions to those. If you’ve only got a hundred people who bought the game, reach out to every single one of them and beg them to record a video about how much they love your game. And now go to publishers with that. That’s really what you’re searching for. Use crowdfunding as exactly what it is, as a way to launch your new game to then take to step two. Tim Ferriss: Let me ask this. There may be people listening or watching who think to themselves, “That sounds awesome, but wasn’t the heyday of crowdfunding three, four, or five years ago?” Elan Lee: Yes. Tim Ferriss: You hear less about it. Certainly for, let’s say, selling to a hundred people or maybe many, many more, I’m sure there are runaway success campaigns even today, but are there any tweaks that you would add to it? Elan Lee: It’s really tricky. Okay, so here’s what happened with crowdfunding. So we launched on Kickstarter, Exploding Kittens launched on Kickstarter, and by some amazing twist of fate, that was perfect timing. Very few people had heard of Kickstarter. They heard about this funny, silly thing. It was drawn by The Oatmeal. Matt already had this incredibly large audience and people showed up and they said, “Ooh, crowdfunding. Ooh, this thing costs 20 bucks. I’m going to back this thing.” And we had 219,000 people try that thing. Amazing. Unheard of success. Those people then over the next, let’s call it five years, stayed on Kickstarter and they backed other things, other games, other projects, whatever. And what they found was the nature of Kickstarter is such that only about 50 percent of those projects that shipped either the thing that shipped was nowhere close to the thing promised, or the thing never shipped, and they never got their money back. Whatever it is. Tim Ferriss: People got burned. Elan Lee: They got burned, and they had a terrible experience. And now when you say, “Hey, back my Kickstarter,” everyone’s got this memory implanted of, “Oh, that was a bad experience for me. Maybe I even had some great experiences, but I also had those bad ones and this is not worth it. And I’m not going back to that site or any crowdfunding site.” So that’s the problem. We’re not seeing the numbers we used to see because everyone’s walking in with this baggage and it sucks. My only advice is there is now a secondary ecosystem around Kickstarter, other websites that have gotten very good at promoting projects, that have gotten very good at advertising new offerings on Kickstarter and building trust, like if you get on this other — Tim Ferriss: So it’s like a curated site that vets projects. Elan Lee: Exactly right. And here’s the thing, those companies almost always take a percentage of what the maker gets in exchange for helping them with fulfillment, with creation, with everything. So not only are you buying into a trusted ecosystem, but you also know there’s multiple parties involved that are going to work very hard to make sure you get that product. Tim Ferriss: What are some of those companies? Elan Lee: I would have to look them up. Tim Ferriss: Okay. Yeah, no problem. All right, we’ll put maybe links to a few of them in the show notes. Elan Lee: Yeah. Yeah. There’s a ton of them. They all have the word backer in them somewhere, backer found and backer this and backer that. Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Okay. We’ll put a couple of links in the show notes. Tim.blog/podcast, you can find it. And I will also just give a shout-out to a friend of mine who at some point you have to meet, maybe you’ve met him already. Craig Mod, does that name ring at all? Elan Lee: No. I don’t know Craig. Tim Ferriss: All right, so Craig is a gem of a human, amazing writer, also very technical as a software engineer, software development expert. And he, at one point, for his beautiful books that he has bound and crafted in Japan, these are works of art, they’re absolutely beautiful. And he created basically a, I don’t know if open source is the right term, but he does have the code available on GitHub for anybody who wants it, called, I think it’s called Craigstarter, which is effectively, if you want to host your own crowdfunding campaign and in his opinion, fix some of the bugs that were difficult to contend with. Elan Lee: Interesting. Tim Ferriss: Then boom, you can do that. Elan Lee: Oh, I love that. Tim Ferriss: And I think he incorporated Shopify and other add-ons, different services could be as modules. I’m sure I’m not using the right terminology, but incorporated into it. Elan Lee: Super clever. I love it. Tim Ferriss: So people can also check that out. And I have two interviews with Craig. You should check out both of them. They’re absolutely fantastic. Elan Lee: Lovely. Tim Ferriss: Okay, so folks can look at these services as basically a stamp of credibility. They will help not only with the promotion if you are so vetted, but with the fulfillment, like that third-party logistics. Elan Lee: That’s right. Now, I don’t think we’re going to see a crowdfunding campaign on the scale of Exploding Kittens these days. There are a few exceptions. You just interviewed one of them, in fact. Tim Ferriss: Brandon Sanderson? Elan Lee: Exactly, out of control success. Tim Ferriss: $45 million, or whatever it was, Kickstarter campaign for fantasy books. Unheard of. Elan Lee: Bonkers. Unheard of. But what I love is that that shows this is not even a remotely dead platform. Tim Ferriss: No. Elan Lee: There is success to be had here. You just have to be creative. I mean he started out with a great fan base. He picked an incredible title, the first word of his campaign was, “Surprise.” No one’s done that before. What does that mean? And just everything about it. Smart on top of smart on top of smart. I loved it. Loved it. So it’s very possible, but it’s also very rare and you have to be smart about it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Well, here’s the thing. It’s possible and who cares? It may not have the gravitational pull that it had five years ago, but if you can’t sell anything in a crowdfunding campaign, you are not going to sell any buyer at mass retail. Elan Lee: Absolutely right. Tim Ferriss: It’s not going to happen. Elan Lee: Absolutely right. Tim Ferriss: And therefore you save yourself years of banging your head against a brick wall when you’re never going to break through. If you get, and this might not sound like good news, but if it’s going to fail, you want to fail as quickly as possible. Elan Lee: It’s great news, as long as you don’t take it personally, as long as you say “This product — “ Tim Ferriss: How many games do you guys screw around with on any level? And how many make the cut? Elan Lee: We probably work on a hundred games a year and less than 20 make the cut. Tim Ferriss: And that’s with all of your experience? Elan Lee: Yeah. That’s probably way higher than it should be. I’m probably pushing forward games that have no right to be pushed forward. But again, you don’t take it personally. You say, “This game is flawed.” And the faster you can figure that out, the faster you can move on to a game that isn’t flawed. Tim Ferriss: So if I heard you correctly then, it’s crowdfunding. You establish some numbers and so on that you can share that show traction at some type, game reactions, et cetera. Then you take all of that to book a meeting at a trade show or a conference or convention with one of these publishers who already has the annual meetings and line reviews. Elan Lee: Exactly right. Tim Ferriss: And you make a pitch to do a deal with them. Elan Lee: That’s my favorite path through this. Tim Ferriss: What deal terms do you need to pay attention to? Elan Lee: Okay, so there is one very important number that you’re going to get, and it’s going to seem like a very low number, but here’s how this works. Most publishers are going to throw a number at you, like two percent. Tim Ferriss: Royalty rate? Elan Lee: Yeah. And you’re going to think, “Wait a second, I was the inventor, I get 80 percent and you’re offering me two percent?” But here’s what that number actually means. They, the publisher, are going to take on all the risk. They’re going to do all the printing, they’re going to do all the relationship management, they’re going to do that sales meeting, they’re supporting hundreds of people on their staff, they’re doing all this stuff that you are not doing. But in exchange for that, that two percent isn’t two percent of the profit, it’s two percent of the revenue. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Top line. Elan Lee: Exactly. And that is a very important distinction. That makes that two percent probably closer to 20 percent, 30 percent once you do all the math. Tim Ferriss: It’s the opposite of Hollywood accounting. Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: It’s not some percentage of net income, which is defined in some Byzantine way to fuck you every which way from Sunday. Elan Lee: Precisely right. Tim Ferriss: If it’s top line — Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: So just to reiterate what you just said, two percent is more like 20 plus percent? Elan Lee: Yes, that’s exactly right. Tim Ferriss: Of profit? Elan Lee: Yeah. And you can ask them to break down that math for you. You can say, “Show me the spreadsheet, show me what you’re spending, what your responsibilities are, what mine are. After all of those numbers are crunched, what is the total amount you’re going to spend on this game? Show me your total projections on what’s coming in, show me how much I’m going to make of that.” And then you can start comparing those numbers yourself and see, “Oh, of the money that came in, I’m getting 20 percent of it. Even though this number only says two percent.” Once you crunch that math, this is a pretty decent deal. And you can get higher than two percent. Usually not as a first-time developer, but I’ve seen deals anywhere from two to 12 percent on the super high end. Tim Ferriss: 12, wow. Elan Lee: You’ve got to be a rockstar because at 12 percent, now you’re at 50 percent, and that’s tough to get to. You’ve got to really pull your weight to get numbers like that. So those are what the deals look like. And then after that, then the whole relationship moves into this like, “Okay, now what the hell are we actually making? What is the quality of the cards? What are the components in the box? Are you allowed to change rules?” Tim Ferriss: Quick question, is the deal structure similar to a book publishing contract in the sense that the game developer would get an advance against sales? Or is that — Elan Lee: Sometimes. Tim Ferriss: Sometimes? Elan Lee: Yeah. You can negotiate that. I’ve seen publishers do that or not do that. I will just say for Exploding Kittens, we never do advances. Tim Ferriss: It’s fundamentally different also from, say, nonfiction book publishing in the following sense. If you’re taking a, let’s call it conventional publishing approach, which is very similar to selling the game, it’s like you have an agent. You’ve got the editors, let’s just say, and the publishers who are the buyers of sorts, the editor might be the category buyer but they have to get the okay from the publisher for signing off on deals. Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: And you’ll have your royalty rate, which varies widely, but let’s just say somewhere depending on paperback versus hardcover, up to probably a maximum in conventional deals of 12 to 15 percent of cover, which is also, again, of cover. And then there’s the advance, but the critical difference that I was alluding to is typically when a nonfiction book is sold, you are selling a book proposal, which is a writing sample and a marketing plan. Elan Lee: Wow. Tim Ferriss: And if, and only if, a publisher decides to sign a contract and buy the book, do you get an advance to buy you the time so you can stop doing all of these other things to write the full book, whereas with the game, the game’s got to be ready. Elan Lee: It’s done. Yeah. Now let’s call it 90 percent done, to be fair. And usually when we take on games, we change them significantly just because there’s always a better version, and through testing, we discover it. But the reason we don’t do advances, partially, is exactly what you’re saying. You’re already done. We’re not trying to pull you off of other projects. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. You don’t have to stop your nine to five. Elan Lee: Exactly. Exactly. But the other reason is because I want a partnership. I’m not here to say, “You sold us this game. Now we’re never going to talk again.” I want you here every day. I want skin in the game. We’re going to all make this better together, which is why we do so few partnerships. Tim Ferriss: Now, when you do partnerships, meaning you’re the publisher, you’re paying someone a royalty, how do you typically find those? So for instance, and I imagine a lot of it is you guys canvassing and basically asking the question that you recommended people ask the store owners, “Which game do you wish people played more often?” And then you find something that has the bones of a really good game but a piece of it is shitting the bed. There’s something that is broken and you’re like, “Oh, we can fix that broken thing.” Or do you take cold submissions? How does that work? Elan Lee: We have a form. We have a submission form on our website. We almost never find anything there. It’s hard. It’s time-consuming to go through all of them and honestly, it’s just not the highest quality. We also go to conventions. We look a little bit around there. Sometimes we find a diamond in the rough. Tim Ferriss: That’s a crowded fishing hole, right? Elan Lee: Very crowded. The most effective way are those agents. We talk to those two agents and we say, “Hey, people approach you all the time wanting you to be their agent and you have to turn a lot of them down. The ones that you feel terrible about because they’re such a good game and they just can’t get in the door, send them to us.” And that works really well. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Smart. That’s super smart. Aside from a crowdfunding campaign, what would actually cut through in a submission? Are there any ingredients outside of, here are a bunch of compelling data from a crowdfunding campaign? Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Or, “Hey, I’ve designed a hundred hit games.” Elan Lee: Yeah. Yeah. There’s that. Tim Ferriss: Aside from those two, what other types of lines or elements would cut through the noise? Elan Lee: So remember I said that phrase, the way we design games is we don’t make games that are entertaining, we make games that make the players entertaining. 90 percent of the game pitches I see are attempts to be entertaining games and I just immediately dismiss them. That looks like that game is working so hard to entertain the players. I don’t care. The best games, the ones that I pay very careful attention to, are when everything you do in the game creates an interaction between two players. I’m not interested in a four-player game where all four players are playing solitaire. It’s just, who cares? I’m interested in a game where the players are playing the players and I play a card — Tim Ferriss: We tweaked a lot in Coyote based on that. Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: So guiding principle. Elan Lee: And those are the best games. Those are the ones I love the most. Those are the ones I want to play over and over again. Tim Ferriss: And it could be as simple as you might, I’m saying you, the listener or viewer might remember holding your cards facing you versus having the cards available to the entire table. Elan Lee: That’s right. Because now we’re playing all together. And the card I choose, if I have a blind hand, if I have a deck of cards and I choose a card and then I play it, that is me presenting a game to the players. If I have all my available cards face up on the table and everyone can see what I choose, and everyone’s hoping I pick that first card, and I hover my hand over it and then I move to the second card instead and everyone starts groaning and then I play that second card anyway, now it’s me playing the players. And those are the best games in the world. Tim Ferriss: What are some common Achilles heels for games that have the potential to be great and huge successes? And I’m not going to mention names, but we’ve talked about a couple of games that you’ve considered buying or publishing, and I’m wondering what are some of the common weaknesses where you’re, this is a great game, but the reason it didn’t work is X or Y or Z. Elan Lee: All right, so there’s two basic places the games fall apart. One is right off the bat, their boxes suck, or the name sucks. The number of games out there called The Legendary Folklore of Gorgonzel. I can’t remember them, I don’t know what they are. I look at this — Tim Ferriss: Got to throw a CØCKPUNCH in there, and then it’s problem solved. Elan Lee: CØCKPUNCH aside, I would argue that those games, they have no chance of success. Yes, they’re going to sell 10 copies to the 10 people that bought The Legendary Tales of Gorgonzel volumes one through six, and they’re going to buy volume seven. Cool, great. I don’t care. Picking the wrong name, picking a non-descriptive name, putting a picture on the box that does not describe gameplay at all and does not provide a compelling narrative about what experience you are about to have, those games have zero chance of success. And I see that over and over and over again. You can fail right up front. And I’ve even seen the biggest publishers in the world mess this up, especially now that game shelves are so crowded and you don’t have five games to choose from, you have 500 games to choose from. And a game that doesn’t do a good job of saying, “Pick me, pick me, pick me,” you’re just not going to pick, so you will fail right there. Tim Ferriss: Or really complicated packaging too. I’ve seen that a bunch. Elan Lee: Absolutely. Tim Ferriss: Where there’s just so much going on. There’s no one dominant element. It’s like, what am I supposed to look at here? Elan Lee: Yeah, what do you look at first? Tim Ferriss: So you can’t. Elan Lee: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: You don’t look at anything, you look at the next box. Elan Lee: It’s just noise. Just noise. We worked very hard on Coyote, on all our games, but I remember having this discussion about Coyote because this is such an important lesson. When you look at this box, we know the first thing you’re going to look at and we know the second thing you’re going to look at and we know the third thing you’re going to look at, and this is a formula, and we crafted this — Tim Ferriss: It’s a formula. Elan Lee: — very carefully. Tim Ferriss: By the way, also exactly what works in old school print advertising. Elan Lee: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Right? Elan Lee: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Header image, headline, subheading. Elan Lee: Exactly right. Tim Ferriss: Text. Elan Lee: Yeah. And those components are all present here. Tim Ferriss: And if you fuck up the order, pardon my French, the eye doesn’t know how to track or it bounces around. Elan Lee: And if there’s other better options right next door, off you go. We hit those three things on a box meticulously, and your reaction should not be, “I’m going to buy that game.” That’s not our goal. Your reaction is, “I’m going to pick up this game and I’m going to turn it over and I’m going to read the back of the box.” And now we’ve got a very different task. Now we have more real estate we can afford. We still know the first thing you’re going to look at, but now we care a little bit less about the second thing. As long as you’ve already got enough interest, you’ve already committed to picking this thing up, now you’re willing to read a little story. As long as you can see the end of that story and you know it’s not too long, you’re going to read a little story. The goal of this is now purchase. I want you to get to the end of this experience and say, “I’ve got to have it. I want this.” Tim Ferriss: And just for people who can’t see this particular visual, and there’s all sorts of stuff on the back of the card, which we won’t get into, but some people might notice interesting things on the back of the cards. The dominant element on the back of the box is how to play. And man, we worked on this a lot too, with basically three panes, step one, step two, step three. “Put cards on the table, then take turns performing them,” that’s step one. And you’ve got a little visual with the salamander action cards. Then next part is “Play cards to help or sabotage other players,” shows two examples. Elan Lee: “Sabotage” was a very carefully chosen word, by the way. Tim Ferriss: Very carefully chosen. And then the last one is “Mess up and you’re out. The last player standing wins.” That’s for competitive mode. Now, one aspect of this that I think is very clever is not sure if you should buy this game? Give us a few seconds to convince you. And then there’s a QR code. Elan Lee: Nobody does that. This is new. Tim Ferriss: I know. What’s the impetus behind this? Elan Lee: This was an idea I had that we’re demoing on this game, first time ever. My idea was “If I went to the store with you, I could convince you to buy my favorite game because I’m going to pitch the hell out of that game.” But I’m not in the store with you, so that’s a problem. My first idea was for every retail location in the world, “Will they let us install a telephone that you can pick up and talk to somebody?” And they said, “No.” My second idea was, “Can I hire a person to stand in every store and convince you to buy the game I want you to buy?” And they said, “Sort of, but you have to pay for all of that.” And I was like, “Oh, that’s not going to work.” And so this was option three. Tim Ferriss: It’s cool, it’s a lot of people. 6,000 plus people. Elan Lee: I know, right? Can you imagine? This is just a little QR code. And the idea is I can’t stand next to you for every store, but I can tell you what I would’ve said had I been standing there. And so you scan this code and it’s just a 15-second video. In this case, it’s me, Tim, saying, “Listen, you’re holding a game in your hands. It’s the greatest thing you’ll ever see. Let me try to convince you.” And it’s just a pitch. It’s just, if I were standing next to you in the store, here’s why you should buy this game. And I don’t think a lot of people are going to scan that code, to be fair. But for those who do, they’re going to have the experience of a friend telling them, “You should trust me. This is going to be great, trust me.” Tim Ferriss: And it doesn’t take up that much real estate either. It’s an easy addition to the box. Once again, test it. Right. Let’s test it. Elan Lee: Test it. And what’s the worst that can happen? Tim Ferriss: See what happens. And I also want to revisit something you mentioned earlier, which is that royalty rate, whether it’s two percent, it’s up to 12 percent in the book world. Let me take the book world and the publishing world in the book publishing sense is changing a lot, but it’s also quite consistent over time. Different things have changed, sure, audio as a format has grown tremendously and become highly prized now versus 10 years ago when I could carve out those rights, it’s a lot harder to do now if you’re going to do the conventional route. But some folks will look at the percentages and they’ll say, “Well, wait a second, max 15 percent after an escalator, I’m starting off at 12 percent for hardcover. That’s ridiculous. I wrote the whole thing, da, da, da, da, da. I want to make the lion’s share.” There are some instances where you can make that work, but I will say just a few things. When you begin, for most people, unless you are excellent at running a meticulously managed business, it’s actually pretty tough to beat those numbers. In part because you’re going to be sacrificing distribution, so the top of the funnel number is going to be different. Secondly, when you factor in paying various agents, various distributors, and all of these little costs that for you, without any scale of having a thousand skews in a department dedicated to it, you start to very quickly approach that number. Elan Lee: Very quickly. Tim Ferriss: And by the way, you’re running a real business. This is not the easiest thing in the world to do at all. And I will probably do some experiments on that side of the equation in terms of “self-publishing,” which I would put in quotation marks because it’s going to be augmented pseudo self-publishing on a few levels. But I would only have the confidence of doing that myself currently, because I’ve gone through the conventional route multiple times and I’ve also run quite a few businesses. But if you’ve never, what Stephen Key, I mentioned earlier, one simple idea for licensing, what he might call venturing, running a business, do not underestimate the value of your time and sanity also. Elan Lee: It’s so true. Tim Ferriss: Because he’s, “Hey, look, I’ll take the licensing deal, maybe I’ll negotiate the number up a little bit.” But he’s like, “I can do 12 of those a year.” Elan Lee: That’s right. That’s exactly it. Tim Ferriss: And it adds up to a lot. And I have no employees, no supply chain issues. Elan Lee: No risk. Tim Ferriss: No, “Oops, that was printed the wrong way and now I have thousands of books —” Elan Lee: You have to recall those. Oh, my God. Tim Ferriss: “— that are sitting in my garage unsold, gathering dust and mold.” Elan Lee: Let me tell you the simplest example of the difference between doing it yourself and getting help, valuing your time. Our very first game Exploding Kittens, I needed to put a barcode on the box because it has to sell in retail. I go, I’m like, I’m going to research this, this can’t be too hard. I do the research and I find this website and it’s, you’ve got to pay some little subscription, 100 bucks a year, whatever it is, and you can generate unlimited barcodes. Amazing. I generate a barcode, I put it on the box. That wasn’t so hard. Then Target’s like, “Well, this is the wrong format.” I’m like, “Okay.” I spend another 100 bucks, I get a different format bar, put it on. They’re like, “We need a different barcode based on the palette that it’s in.” And then I talk to Walmart and they’re like, “Yeah, we use a different barcode format and we need this barcode to represent whether it was picked up in China or Mexico or Poland, so you actually need three different ones. Oh, and by the way, if it’s bundled with other games, we need a fourth one. And by the way, if it ships into Arkansas, we need a fifth.” And I was just like, “Help. Oh, my God, help.” And that’s the difference. You should not get good at this. Why would you want to get good at that? Tim Ferriss: What’s funny is I was actually going to bring up the example of the UPC codes and the ISBN and all this stuff because I also went down that rabbit hole. I’m like, “How hard could it be?” Elan Lee: Right, right. Tim Ferriss: “Oh, this is easy.” And lo and behold, actually it’s a lot of brain damage. I’m not saying that no one should Venture in the sense of self-funding or self-publishing, but it is a lot harder and much more consuming than most people realize. Elan Lee: And there’s no reason, unless you want to do it for a living, there’s no reason to get good at it. There’s no upside there. Tim Ferriss: And do it for a living meaning handle those types of details. Elan Lee: Right, exactly. Tim Ferriss: Okay. Elan Lee: Anyway, we have a barcode person who does it for a living. She’s quite good. I’m so happy she’s on my team. Tim Ferriss: All right, so on the side of selling games, what else have we not touched on? Any other aspects? Elan Lee: Let’s see. Another thing I learned along the way is there’s two kinds of selling. One is everything we’ve been talking about today. And your expectation is, “I have sold you a game, the game is now your responsibility. And we’ve negotiated a price, you, the retailer, own this game now and you’re going to sell it.” The second kind is the kind that we actually engage in, which is you do own this game, but there are restrictions on how you can sell it. Tim Ferriss: Can you explain that again? When you say you own this game, you mean a retailer? Elan Lee: You, the retailer, have purchased this palette of games from me. Tim Ferriss: I get it. All right. Sorry, I was just clarifying because people might’ve heard that as you own the IP of the game. Elan Lee: Sorry, sorry, sorry. Yes. Tim Ferriss: You are buying an inventory of this game. Elan Lee: Correct. Now, what if the game doesn’t sell very well? Whose problem is that? Well, if you didn’t think that through and it’s just a straight sale, they can put it in a bargain bin or they can sell it to somebody else who’s then going to sell it. Or if you really didn’t negotiate it, they can force you to buy it back from them. The restrictions on what happens to the game, what they’re allowed to do post-sale is so meticulous and these contracts get so long. And this is another thing, you don’t want to get good at this. You just need to hire someone who has seen every imaginable mistake and knows what to argue for. And oftentimes the retailers don’t care that much about this part, especially because they have a lot of faith. This thing’s going to do well. But when it goes poorly, if it goes poorly, and we’ve had a few examples of this, what do you do next? In the case of something as simple as Amazon, Amazon has a terrible policy for returns. Namely, they will accept all returns and it is the vendor’s responsibility, my responsibility. You buy Exploding Kittens from GameKnight, you play the game, you damage all the cards because you spilled beer all over them, you put them back in the box the next day after you had a great time and you return it and now that’s my cost. And that happens hundreds of times a week. It sucks. There’s also this thing where people will buy counterfeit games and they’ll buy, then, the real version. They’ll buy a counterfeit for a dollar, they’ll buy the real version on Amazon, they’ll keep the real version, they’ll return the counterfeit and now that’s mine as well. And I just spent $20 on that stupid counterfeit version because that’s coming back to me. All of this stuff has to be thought through in advance and it’s tricky, because some retailers, the Targets and the Walmarts in the world, they are so willing to work with you on that stuff. Amazon, not so much. They’re just like, “Oh, you don’t like our policy? All right, well maybe a different platform is for you.” It’s hard. It’s really hard. Tim Ferriss: And I should say that I’ve run into, when I’ve talked about termination clauses or what do we do when everyone’s pissed off and things aren’t working? Because really that’s the only time that you’re going to go back and look at the agreement, which is why Gary Keller, famous for his real estate empire, said, “You should really call them disagreements.” The only time you’re going to look at them is when things are really going sideways. Elan Lee: That’s right. Tim Ferriss: And there are some people I’ve spoken to about the importance of these things, like, “Wow, that’s really pessimistic.” I’m like, “No, no, no.” Let’s understand the consequences of not going through this. I know so many examples of entrepreneurs who actually had a chance at a runaway success and they did not pay attention to these terms for, say, a QVC or a huge retailer. And this could happen with Kickstarter as well, of course, they get overextended because now they have orders for God knows how much inventory that is well beyond their capacity, their experience, their financial means. And in their mind, let’s take out the Kickstarter or crowdfunding, but they don’t think about the return policy and they get the hug of death. They overextend themselves financially to produce the inventory, they ship it, and then any number of things can happen. It might be net 270 payment terms. Elan Lee: Oh, God. Tim Ferriss: It could be just — Elan Lee: So brutal. Tim Ferriss: — cash flow suicide right on the front end. And on top of that you might get all of it shipped back to you — Elan Lee: All of it. Tim Ferriss: — and it’s your problem. And then that — Elan Lee: It’s so tragic. Tim Ferriss: — is the hug of death and you’re done. Elan Lee: And then you’ve seen this, you’ve seen this picture. You have this friend whose apartment is filled with products and it’s taken over their living space and they have no way to move it. Tim Ferriss: I did that myself early on. I made an audiobook product. I was going to sell millions of this thing. Oh, my God. Didn’t do any market testing, none of that stuff, just high on my own supply. And I had an entire garage full of these things that just melted in the heat ultimately. And at the time though, that was a huge financial risk. I didn’t take so much risk that it torpedoed me, but if I had had that level of self-delusion and lack of experimentation a little later on, it very easily could have been a recipe for disaster. Elan Lee: Totally. Look, there’s so many ways to mess this up. There’s so many ways to mess this up. And the only good news is there is someone out there who has messed it up in every possible way. Tim Ferriss: Or represented people who have messed it up — Elan Lee: Exactly. Tim Ferriss: — in every possible way. Elan Lee: And those are the people you have to work with. You have to. If you don’t, the risk you’re taking on is just massive. Luckily, I had some very good advice early on from people who said, “Don’t take this on yourself. Just don’t do this.” And it’s the best advice I ever got. Tim Ferriss: And I think maybe tell me if this is overreaching on my part, but don’t take this on yourself now in the sense that after you’ve had 10 mega successes and you actually are fluent in retailese and you have the relationships, all right, now you can take some calculated risks. Elan Lee: And now you can hire the people that you would otherwise contract, now you can pull them in-house. Because now you can afford their salaries and now you want them to only be working on your own products. Great. That’s a huge mark of success and really that is exactly the way you reinvest in your own company. Tim Ferriss: And to reiterate just a few things, if you want to develop a game, number one, you can just develop it for your family, your friends, and keep it small. And I will just say in the book world, a lot of later mega successes have started out that way. You don’t have to go for scale, which I think can be a very dangerous word out of the gate. But as you mentioned, you can also, with the blank cards in Coyote, you can get a taste of it, see if you like it, then you can use the books that you recommended. And there are certainly other resources, we’ll put things in the show notes, to play around with prototyping. Look at these initial cards. These are blank cards with Sharpie writing on them. Elan Lee: That’s it. Tim Ferriss: That’s it. Elan Lee: That’s literally it. Tim Ferriss: That’s it, that’s the entire thing. And you can also find kits online, you can find them anywhere you want. Amazon has gaming kits where there are blank dice and cards and so on so you can workshop it. Elan Lee: Easy. It’s so easy. Tim Ferriss: It’s like Build-A-Bear for games basically. Elan Lee: That’s right. Tim Ferriss: And what I would add to that is you don’t need to run a big business to be a successful game designer. Elan Lee: Absolutely. Tim Ferriss: In fact, I would imagine most of the legendary game designers are not running companies. Elan Lee: No, definitely not. Tim Ferriss: They’re designing games and licensing them. And man, there are some legends out there. Elan Lee: Legends. They’ve created incredible games and they’ve generated gigantic wealth for themselves because in success, that two percent deal, that five percent deal, whatever it is, that faucet doesn’t turn off, that’s in perpetuity. In summary, I don’t think the games business is going anywhere. Tim Ferriss: And also there is a lot of room to innovate. There still is room. There’s so many games, but I wouldn’t have even attempted to create a game had I not thought there was space. Elan Lee: The thing is, it’s like saying, is there still space in the book industry, in the movie industry? All a game is is an idea delivered in a new way. When are we going to run out of ideas? When are we going to run out of delivery mechanisms? The answer to both of those individually is never. Combine them both together and it’s just build games forever. You’ll always have a new way — Tim Ferriss: Option. Elan Lee: — to deliver it. Tim Ferriss: All right, so I’m trying to think of anything that we missed. I do have a tantalizing offer for listeners and viewers just for fun because why not? And we will have also mentioned that in the intro. But before I get to that, anything critical that we’ve forgotten? Is there anything that we have left out or any other resources, people to watch, maybe people to Google and Wikipedia maybe? Anything at all? Elan Lee: All right. I’ve got two. I’ve got two that are interesting. One is there is a podcast I quite like for game design, it’s called Fun Problems, it’s with Peter and AJ. And all they do is they talk about game design. Now, they do talk about more hardcore games than I am accustomed to. It’s a wide range of topics, but it’s fun stuff and it’s worth listening to if you want to know more about game design. And the second thing is, because of you. Because of you, because of this process, this journey that we’ve been on over the last few years, I realized that I don’t document any of this ever. I never talk about what goes into a game design, I never talk about where to buy blank cards, and I never talk about why anybody can do this and what the process is like. I’ve started recording it and I started for the first time, I can’t believe I’m saying this, I actually started a YouTube channel and you can actually go and watch these instructional videos. Literally if you want to make a game, the whole idea is: here is how to make a game from scratch. Nobody’s watching right now, but — Tim Ferriss: YouTube.com at Elan Lee, that’s E-L-A-N-L-E-E. You can also just search him on YouTube. The first result will be our podcast together. Elan Lee: That’s true. Tim Ferriss: Episode one. And then within the first few results, you’ll also find it. But I’m pretty sure the URL is YouTube.com/@ElanLee. And let’s finish up with a few things. The first will be the tantalizing offer that I mentioned. The tantalizing offer is this, there’s no purchase required whatsoever, so if any sweepstakes sharks are out there, take it easy, take it easy. This is going to be just a fun little, it’s not even a competition, just a fun little experiment that I want to run. *** [Interview pauses] 02:46:00 to 02:48:14 Tim Ferriss: Hi, everyone, Tim here with an update, as details have changed since that first conversation with Elan. Here’s the tantalizing offer that I wanted to share with you. You have two very easy ways to enter for a chance to win a trip to a secret Los Angeles mansion for an unforgettable day or evening with me and Elan and maybe some special guests. Here’s how. Option number one, simply visit any Target or Walmart and take a fun photo or video with a Coyote game. No purchase necessary. Option number two, if you already bought Coyote, record yourself playing the game with friends or family. That’s it. I would love to see it. Then share your photo or video on Instagram or Tik Tok or both and tag me and ExplodingKittens. You can find us easily, but I’m @TimFerris on both. That’s @ Tim F-e-r-r-i-s-s and Exploding Kittens is ExplodingKittens on Tik Tok and @GameOfKittens on Instagram. So share your photo and or video on Instagram and or Tik Tok. Put them everywhere. Why not? And tag both me and Exploding Kittens. Longtime listeners know that I have a love of deadlines. This is how things actually get done. So, the deadline to post is August 17. That means that 10:00 p.m. PDT August 17. By then, you need to have posted and done all this stuff. By August 31st, we’ll randomly select five winners from people who post. Each winner will receive roundtrip airfare within the US, one night at a hotel, and will join us at our secret LA mansion party. And I think the legal elves wanted me to mention that that’s going to be coach airfare. So, just to be super clear, important legal disclaimer. No purchase necessary. Open to US residents aged 18 or older. So no little kids, no minotaurs allowed. Void where prohibited. Winners selected at random. Odds depend on number of eligible entries. Travel dates must align with the event likely in September. We are still finalizing the time with the busiest man in show business, Elan Lee himself. For official rules, eligibility details, and final date, please visit tim.blog/rules. So, go ahead, post a creative Tik Tok or Insta real or a photo with Coyote by August 17th, 10 p.m. PDT. Tag us and you might just be celebrating with us in Hollywood this fall. Now, back to the episode. *** [Interview resumes] Tim Ferriss: What else? Anything else to add? I have a little bit. I have one more thing I want to say. Elan Lee: Oh, okay. I want to hear one more thing. Tim Ferriss: I just wanted to thank you so much for allowing me to be part of this incredible ride — Elan Lee: Oh, my goodness. Tim Ferriss: — and just collaborating on the game. It’s been so meaningful for me and so much fun and so great to get closer with you and your family, and we’ve all been traveling together since. Elan Lee: I love it. Tim Ferriss: And to work with the incredible team that you have at Exploding Kittens. I’m not going to mention them all because there are quite few — Elan Lee: So many. Tim Ferriss: — but it’s just been such a joy and a dream come true to actually have this thing in my mind that was floating around that I’ve always wanted to do. And now here it is and people can get it. Elan Lee: Tim Ferriss made a game. Look, here’s the thing — Tim Ferriss: I’m thinking — Elan Lee: — you’re so welcome and thank you. We have limited time here and you have to choose your endeavors wisely, and this was one of the wisest choices I’ve ever made. Tim Ferriss: Oh, thanks, man. All right. We’re going to go get a fantastic meal. It’s Texas, so probably a bunch of meat, barbecue. Who knows, maybe some tequila and make an appearance unbidden. You never know. Strange things happen out here in Austin, Texas. And for everybody listening, we will link to all sorts of things, many resources that will help you think about how you might create a game. You could start with the blank cards in Coyote. Those will actually teach you a lot, I think, as you begin to experiment with these different elements. Elan Lee: Because you’re going to fail, because your first few are not going to work and you’ll learn why. Tim Ferriss: And then if you run out of blank cards, look, just go get some blank cards. Just go buy a blank deck and you can use those. But this is something anyone can do. You did this with your daughter when she was how old? Elan Lee: Four. Tim Ferriss: Four. This is an incredibly fun family activity. It’s an incredibly fun friend activity and it gets you off of your screens. It’s not good for you folks. Elan Lee: So important. Tim Ferriss: They are tools, but there is a point at which the tools become our masters and that is where a lot of the poison seeps in around the cracks. Elan Lee: This thing builds memories. That’s what you should be doing. That’s what your phone isn’t doing. This is building memories. Tim Ferriss: Building memories with some durability, not ephemera that get pushed out of your head as soon as you watch the next 10-second clip. This is something I’ve wanted to do for so long and I’m thrilled that it’s here. Fingers crossed. I’m still nervous as hell, obviously. But we’ve done so much play testing. Hundreds of people have play tested at this point and have made these fine-tuning tweaks along the way. I would love everybody to think about your life as a collection of games. You may not be aware of which games you’re playing just yet, but rest assured in some respects you are playing games and you get to choose more games than you realize. Most of them are optional, not all of them. Sure, we have responsibilities as adults and so on, but this is a way to open up that Pandora’s box of possibility. And we’ll include a lot of resources in the show notes, so tim.blog/podcast, just search Coyote. That’ll probably be the easiest way to find it. C-O-Y-O-T-E. And another time I’ll explain the backstory there, which is pretty wild, but for another time. And until next time, as always, be a little kinder than is necessary, not just to others, also to yourself. Play wisely. Find fun problems. And I’m going to check out that podcast. And life is short, have fun while you’re here, folks. And until next time, thanks for tuning in. Δ Δ Comment Rules: Remember what Fonzie was like? Cool. That's how we're gonna be — cool.

Title: Bitcoin Holds Strong Near All-Time High – Market Not Overheated Yet, Data Shows

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitcoin is holding firm above the $115,000 level after several days of trading below it, signaling renewed strength in the market. The bullish tone is building as Ethereum posts massive gains and altcoins begin to show strong moves over the past few days. For some analysts, this could be the start of the long-awaited altseason; for others, it’s simply the rest of the market catching up to Bitcoin’s earlier rally. Top analyst Axel Adler noted that Bitcoin’s price is now trading close to its all-time high, with the BTC Z-Score (Price, 30/365) sitting around +1.5σ above its one-year norm. This reading is well below the +2.5σ level typically associated with overheating, suggesting that while momentum is strong, it is not yet at extreme levels. The current environment offers a favorable backdrop for potential upside, with room for the market to expand further before reaching overheated conditions. With altcoins gaining traction and Ethereum’s rally adding fuel to the market’s optimism, the coming days could determine whether this is a sustainable breakout or just another phase of consolidation before the next major move. According to Adler, Bitcoin’s current market setup is showing a positive backdrop but with some important caveats. Adler points out that the Adjusted Price Divergence (APD) remains negative near −1.5 after rebounding from local lows around −2. This metric suggests that Bitcoin’s price is still outpacing on-chain activity, although the gap between the two is narrowing. In other words, while price momentum is firm, the network’s transactional activity and usage haven’t yet fully caught up. This discrepancy creates an interesting dynamic for the market. Adler explains that the bias still favors price, meaning momentum is being driven more by investor positioning and sentiment than by on-chain fundamentals. For the rally to gain more structural support, a healthier setup would see APD move toward zero. This could happen in one of two ways: either network activity increases significantly while price moves sideways or posts modest gains, or Bitcoin’s price cools off to better align with current usage levels. Importantly, Adler warns against interpreting APD moving toward zero as a direct buy or sell signal. Instead, it represents a sign of normalization — a point where market price and underlying network fundamentals are better aligned. For now, Bitcoin’s technical and macro backdrop remains bullish, but sustained long-term growth will likely require the network to catch up with price action. Bitcoin is consolidating above the $115,724 support level after a brief dip below it earlier this month. The daily chart shows price stabilizing just above the 50-day simple moving average (SMA), currently near $113,324, which has acted as a strong dynamic support throughout the recent uptrend. The short-term structure remains bullish, with BTC trading inside a range between $115,724 support and the $122,077 resistance level. Volume has tapered off slightly since the early August rebound, suggesting the market is in a wait-and-see mode before a potential breakout. A decisive close above $118,000 could invite another test of the $122,077 resistance, a key level that has capped upside attempts multiple times. If broken, this could open the door toward new all-time highs. On the downside, losing $115,724 would shift focus to the 100-day SMA at $108,983 as the next major support. Until then, the higher-lows pattern suggests buyers are defending the mid-$115K zone aggressively.

Tim Leunig US stock market outperformance reliesÂ on the âMagnificent 7â: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google, Android), Meta, Nvidia andÂ Tesla. Over the last decade, these stocks typically returned at least 500%. Without them, stock market rises would have been less than 2% aÂ year, afterÂ inflation. Pretty much everyone has an Apple or an Android phone. A new firm would struggle to break into that duopoly. Nokia, Blackberry: they came and went. Apple and Alphabet would have to really mess up to be in trouble. Walmart will do its best to cut Amazon down to size, but economies of scale in online retail and delivery are real.

But Tesla is vulnerable. Not because some people hate Musk for supporting Trump; or because others hate him for attacking Trump. But because lots of good, rival electric cars mean Tesla has no market power. In 2013, Autocar magazine described theÂ Tesla Model S as âa triumphâ, its 300-mile range about three times that of any other electric car available. Add in the supercharger network â then exclusively restricted to Tesla â and Teslas were the only EV that worked like a normal car. That gave the firm market power. Today, by contrast, while a Â£40,000 Tesla Model 3 can travel 320 miles, a 380-mile Kia EV3 costs a couple of thousands less. Teslaâs 430-mile longer-range Model 3 costs Â£45,000, but just Â£600 extra gets you a 480-mile Mercedes-Benz CLA. Tesla has a competitive offer, but it is not unique, and that hits pricing and margins. Outside of the US, Tesla produces only two, relatively similar, cars. It has no rival to this yearâs Car of the Year, the Â£23,000 electric Renault 5. As a contrast, Hyundai offers five EVs, ranging from the tiny Inster to the massive Ioniq 9. Whatever type of EV you want, Hyundai can help. Competitive pressure means Teslaâs net income was lower in 2024 than in any post-pandemic year. Related articles: Elon Muskâs $30bn Tesla stock option proves CEO pay in Silicon Valley is âbonkersâ Patricia Clarke Muskâs chatbot praises Hitler then says âsorry, my bad, I fell for a hoaxâ John Naughton The Chris Riddell cartoon: draining the swamp Chris Riddell Tesla has a second revenue stream: selling carbon credits to other car firms. The US requires car firms to lower their average CO2 emissions, while Europe requires them to sell a minimum proportion of EVs. Companies that fail can buy credits from firms, such as Tesla, that do better. Unfortunately for Tesla, President Trump has abolished this requirement in the US, destroying that revenue stream. In Europe, the EU has weakened the standard a little, reducing the value of credits. In any case, there are no credits to sell if you donât sell cars, and Teslaâs European sales have halved in the past year. Tesla is a bet on Elon Musk. That is why he can successfully demand an additional $30bn with the threat that he will otherwise walk away. That $30bn is a straightforward reduction in returns to shareholders. Shares in a company where the CEO can take so much of the upside, even in bad times, should not trade at high valuations. Capitalism can be cruel and merciless to companies that invent. All too often the second- and third-placed companies overtake the original innovator. Henry Fordâs production line cut the price of the Model T from $825 to $260 between 1908 and 1925, an 80% real-terms fall. Despite his genius, General Motors sold more cars than Ford by 1927. They copied Fordâs production line, and offered buyers a âcar for every purse and purposeâ. The parallels between then and now are uncanny: an autocratic, rather odd, genius inventor (Ford, Musk) achieved something amazing, and yet the dull-as-ditchwater corporate follower (GM, Hyundai) wins out. Perhaps Hyundai bosses have been reading business history books, and realise Tesla is as vulnerable now as Ford was then. The future for Tesla is probably muchÂ like that of Ford after the 1920s â just another erratically profitable car firm, with a share price to match.

Title: TCS layoffs mark end of one IT era, and the start of another
URL: https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/voices/tcs-layoffs-mark-end-of-one-it-era-and-the-start-of-another/
Time Published: 2025-08-10T02:35:08Z
Full Content:
“The future is already here; it’s just not evenly distributed,” goes the famous quote. Well, neither are job losses — or so the 12,000 laid-off employees of TCS might be ruefully thinking as they packed their personal effects, while simultaneously reading about the $100m salaries that Mark Zuckerberg was dangling to lure AI researchers to his company. There has been a spate of layoffs in tech companies, with Microsoft firing 15,000 employees, Intel 5,000, and Meta and Amazon joining the party. Much of the losses were ascribed to AI, which is driving workforce efficiencies and empowering one human to do the job of many. Till now, most of the layoffs were happening in far-off places like the US and Europe, but the TCS announcement that it was letting go 2% of the workforce brought this phenomenon closer home. Companies like TCS have traditionally been seen as a safe harbour, the closest to a ‘govt job’ in terms of stability and tenure. It had remained so through the dotcom bust, the financial crisis and others. But now, with the advent of AI, the myth seems to be busted. While TCS is the most prominent example, it is not alone. Big consulting firms are ‘streamlining’ their workforce, other big IT services firms are making disturbing noises, and job portals are teeming with tech workers’ resumes. TCS has gone to great lengths to not pin the blame on AI. But the subtext of terms like “a skill mismatch” and “future-ready” is hard to ignore. In many ways, this has been a long time coming. The IT services model of cost-arbitrage, deploying vast armies of coders and consultants at lower cost, has been in its twilight era for a while. AI just accelerated the trend, disrupting the existing linear model where more projects meant hiring more people. Now, a human analyst and a few AI agents working together can potentially do what ten analysts once did. In its place, a new kind of IT services firm is emerging — leaner, AI-native, and outcome-focused. These firms will not hire a thousand freshers to handle client reports or debug software, but deploy a small team of AI-literate experts and a suite of autonomous agents to do the job faster, cheaper, and often better. We are seeing early glimpses already, with new services startups using agents like Cursor or Devin, legal firms operating with Harvey, and research teams powered by Perplexity and NotebookLM. The societal impact of this transition in India will be immense. The whole education model of training young people in STEM skills to then place them in some IT company ensuring a stable career with a decent salary is under threat. However, this tectonic shift presents as great an opportunity as the magnitude of the threat. This is especially true for younger, entry-level employees, since “breaking first is the bottom rung of the career ladder” as Aneesh Raman, the chief economic opportunity officer at LinkedIn, wrote. However, with every crisis, including this one, comes great opportunity. These are five things I believe young people should do in this inevitable age of AI: Leapfrog with AI: The definition of literacy now includes the ability to work fluently and naturally with AI tools and agents. If you know how to, you can take AI’s help to do jobs the seniors traditionally did and jump straight to the second or third rung of the job ladder. In a recent post, for example, a tech founder offered a programmer with 2-5 years of experience a Rs 1 crore salary — qualifications and experience were not important, just the use of AI to code. Study humanities with STEM: Prompting is about knowledge, creativity, critical thinking, literature and grammar — core humanities skills. As answers become a commodity with AI, questions or ‘prompts’ will become the differentiator. Don’t just join a company, build one: There has been no better time to create a company with AI tools, agents, and ‘vibe coding’ available to everyone. It is the age of one-person unicorns — one human and a thousand AI agents building billion-dollar startups. Build a career portfolio: Don’t do just one thing. Be a product designer who also writes; a digital marketer who teaches music; a coder who also runs a pet shop. With AI, one company, many employees will give way to one employee with many companies. Build your personal brand: Do not depend on where you work for your identity; leverage AI to build your own through the talents you have or learn. You will never be out of paying work. As Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella put it: “AI is not here to replace humans. It is here to remove the barriers that prevent humans from doing their best work.” This crisis gives us the opportunity to do precisely that. (Jaspreet Bindra is the founder of AI&Beyond. His latest book is ‘Winning With AI: Your Guide to AI Literacy’) Views expressed above are the author's own.

Title: 120 Million Square Feet: Store Closings In The United States Are On Pace To Set A New Record High In 2025

by Michael Snyder | Aug 9, 2025 | Economics | 1 comment This article was originally published by Michael Snyder at The Economic Collapse Blog. If everything is going to be just fine, why are thousands of stores closing all over the country? So far this year, the total amount of retail space that has been permanently closed has surpassed 120 million square feet. We have never seen anything like this before. Store closings spiked during the early days of the pandemic, but in 2025, stores are being permanently shuttered at an even faster pace. In fact, during the first six months of this year, 5,822 store closures were recorded… Store closures across the U.S. continue to rise, and remain on track to far significantly surpass both new openings and the figures seen in 2024. According to a new report from research and advisory firm Coresight Research, cited by CoStar News, 5,822 store closures were recorded as of June 27, compared to 3,496 closures announced during the same period of 2024. If stores continue to close at this rate, we will break the old record that was established during the pandemic by a wide margin. We are also being told that the total amount of retail space that has been permanently shuttered in 2025 has reached a staggering 120 million square feet… In June, store closings by Plano, Texas-based home goods seller At Home and Philadelphia-based pharmacy chain Rite Aid, which have both filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, “pushed the total amount of retail space to close in the U.S. this year to over 120 million square feet,” Coresight said. The real estate churn is happening “as cyclical impacts confront structural shifts,” according to one executive at the research firm. Wow. You may have noticed that there are an increasing number of abandoned buildings in your particular area. Sadly, this is just the beginning. Consumers are under more financial stress than we have ever seen, and that has resulted in a substantial decline in store traffic… Many of the retail store closures are a result of declining store traffic as more consumers respond to inflation by reducing spending. There also are more consumers turning to online shopping especially for apparel, accessories and household items. The winner is not merely Amazon but increased competition from Temu and Shein marketplaces and social commerce outlets like TikTok. Needless to say, more stores are being closed down with each passing day. After filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, Claire’s announced that it will be closing 18 more stores… Claire’s, a mall-based teen accessories retailer, has identified several locations across the country it plans to close after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Claire’s U.S., which operates Claire’s and Icing stores, made the filing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware on Wednesday. It’s the second time since 2018 the company has filed for bankruptcy. While the company says the majority of its retail stores will remain open while it “continues to explore all strategic alternatives,” Claire’s said it identified 18 stores ahead of the Aug. 6 bankruptcy filing it would close, filings show. And home goods retailer At Home just announced that it will be closing 6 more stores… The home goods retailer At Home is closing an additional six stores across the country, bringing its total closure tally to more than two dozen as it grapples with high debt and dwindling sales. The furniture and home decor retailer based in Coppell, Texas, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on June 16, pointing to “broader economic and retail-specific market pressures,” in court documents. The bankruptcy filing and store closures follow several other “big box” retailers that have also significantly downsized their brick-and-mortar footprints this year, including Big Lots, Joann Fabrics, Kohl’s, JCPenney, Macy’s, and Party City. The retailer intially announced 26 store closures in June, before paring that down to 24 when it decided to keep open two stores in New Jersey and Wisconsin. The company added another six stores to the list, according to a statement by retail firm Hilco Consumer-Retail on Aug. 1, bringing the current number of stores it will shutter in the coming months to 30. We see more stories like this every single day. So what is going to happen if our economic momentum continues to take us very rapidly in the wrong direction? Earlier today, we learned that the percentage of student loans entering serious delinquency is absolutely exploding… The total amount of outstanding student loan debt was $1.64 trillion in the second quarter of 2025 after rising by $7 billion in the quarter. Additionally, the share of student loan debt entering serious delinquency, considered 90 days or more late, jumped to 12.9% at the end of June, up from 8% in March and above pre-pandemic trends that were around 9-10% from 2012 into early 2020, when the moratorium initially took effect. The American people are drowning in debt, and I expect delinquency rates of all types to continue to rise in the months ahead. We are going to see more layoffs too, and the fact that continuing claims for unemployment benefits just hit their highest level since 2021 is not a good sign at all… Recurring applications for unemployment benefits surged to the highest since November 2021, adding to recent signs that the labor market is weakening. Continuing claims, a proxy for the number of people receiving benefits, rose by 38,000 to 1.97 million in the week ended July 26, according to Labor Department data released Thursday. On top of everything else, U.S. manufacturing activity is now in contraction territory… From March to July, U.S. manufacturing activity contracted, according to the Institute for Supply Management’s monthly survey. The Manufacturing PMI last registered at 48, below the 50 score that differentiates growth and decline. The effective average tariff rate on all imported goods now stands at around roughly 18% versus 2.3% last year, the highest levels since the 1930s. We are in so much trouble. After evaluating all of the latest economic numbers that have come in, Mark Zandi has come to the conclusion that the “economy is on the precipice of recession”… Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, on Monday wrote a post on X that the “economy is on the precipice of recession” – citing the weaker-than-expected jobs report released Friday and the inflation data from the previous day that showed consumer prices rose as indicating the economy’s precarious position. “Consumer spending has flatlined, construction and manufacturing are contracting, and employment is set to fall. And with inflation on the rise, it is tough for the Fed to come to the rescue,” he wrote. It is hard to argue with him. Of course what is eventually coming is going to be so much worse than just a “recession”. As conditions deteriorate, will store closings slow down or will they speed up? The answer to that question is obvious. If there are stores in your local area that you really enjoy, I would visit them now while you still can, because they might not be there next year.

Title: Cloud Quarterly: Azure AI pop, AWS supply pinch and Google execution

UPDATED 11:25 EDT / AUGUST 09 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Artificial intelligence is currently running on a one-lane CapEx highway that is capacity-constrained. Hyperscaler cloud providers are the largest contributor to the momentum and as such, investors keep score with cloud growth rates. But this past quarter you had to read the footnotes and the fine print to go beyond the massive investments fueling the wave. Microsoft Corp. put up eye-popping Azure growth again, but a big part of that acceleration is Azure serving AI inference — notably OpenAI’s ChatGPT — now neatly included in the revised definition of what’s included in Azure. This is great for headlines but not conducive to apples-to-apples comparisons over time. Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services Inc. delivered the largest revenue for cloud infrastructure and sent a clear message that demand exceeds supply — meaning growth is capped by power and components, not pipeline. That creates a weird optics penalty — AWS showing growth in the high teens on a $120 billion-plus run rate and it’s deemed “concerning.” But it also telegraphs future upside as capacity goes online and depreciation cycles progress. The somewhat stealth story is Google LLC. Google Cloud posted a strong quarterly print with solid top-line growth and steadily improving operating margin — and GCP (the infrastructure-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service portion of the business) is growing materially faster than cloud overall – our estimate is nearly 40%. Google’s backlog is building at more than $250 million and $1 billion-plus deals continue to close thanks to Google’s underlying tech, a strong data foundation and its AI prowess. As the mix shifts toward AI-heavy, infrastructure-centric workloads, it becomes a tailwind for Google, which continues to lag the scale of AWS and Azure. The common thread is a capital expenditure arms race that faces real constraints. All three players said that power, sites, servers and lead times will dictate who wins AI inference and who can monetize it. Microsoft is capacity-constrained, AWS says it will take “several quarters” to rebalance, and Google raised its CapEx guide. As such, we believe strongly that this is not a one-quarter story; it’s a multiyear power grab that will determine margin structures and cash flow for the next cycle. All told, the the big three cloud players are on a pace to spend about $240 billion this calendar year on CapEx with, AI revenue coming in at about 10% of that figure. We clearly have a big hurdle before that massive investment pays back. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on our latest take of the cloud infrastructure market with a fresh look at growth rates in context, market share projections for the year, and the puts and takes for each of the big three from their earnings prints. We’ll also share some spending data from Enterprise Technology Research and a look at the road ahead. The big three U.S. hyperscalers just put up roughly $60 bilion of IaaS/PaaS revenue, and all-in IaaS/PaaS grew about 27% year-over-year. Importantly, that’s a one-point acceleration sequentially — all while demand is still outrunning supply. Margins continue to be divergent. AWS came in around 33% operating margin, down from 39% last quarter as depreciation and its seasonal stock based comp step-up hit — all with continued capacity constraints. Google Cloud, while far less profitable continues to show material improvement. Operating margin increased to roughly 21%, up from ~18% last quarter and 11% a year ago — showing, steady execution. Microsoft is a bit more opaque on its cloud operating margin as Azure drags margins down, but the company gave us some solid hints and a first-time Azure revenue disclosure. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $46.7 billion, up 27%, with gross margin 68%, down 2 points aI infrastructure scales and the mix shifts toward lower margin Azure. But for the first time, Microsoft put a number on Azure at $75 billion for the fiscal year — but remember, recent definition changes and the AI inference boost muddy apples-to-apples comparisons and contain a clever communications strategy by Microsoft. CapEx is the real story, however. The trio — plus Meta Platforms Inc. — shelled out about $87 billion in the June quarter. By our math, ~75% of Amazon’s CapEx is for AWS, underscoring the supply buildup. The bottom line is Azure’s AI pop is real (but fattened by ChatGPT inference), AWS is constrained but investing through it, and Google is quietly widening margins while it scales. Let’s take a look at the key performance indicators and do a quick scan of the metrics that matter: Microsoft: Microsoft Cloud came in at $46.7 billion for the quarter (+27% y/y) and Intelligent Cloud $29.9 billion (+26%) with Azure and other cloud +39% y/y (CC); Microsoft didn’t disclose its quarterly Azure performance but we’ve mapped our models to the $75 billion figure and estimate Azure IaaS/PaaS at ~$22.2 billion; with Azure AI services at ~$3 billion. Management guided that demand exceeds supply into 1H FY26 (2H CY 25), with its Q1 FY CapEx guided to $30 billion-plus. AWS: AWS revenue was $30.9 billion (+17.5% y/y; $124B ARR) with 32.9% operating margin pressured by seasonal SBC and higher depreciation; we peg AI services at around $2B for AWS. Backlog hit $195 bilion and CapEx stayed heavy ($24 biion of Amazon’s $31.4 billion in Q2 went to AWS by our estimates). Supply constraints continue but are expected to improve over several quarters. Google Cloud: Google Cloud posted $13.6 billion (+32% y/y) and 20.7% operating margin; we estimate GCP (IaaS/PaaS) at ~$7.2B, growing “much faster” than Google Cloud overall, with GCP AI services around ~$0.6B. Capex was $22.4B in Q2 and the 2025 outlook was raised to ~$85 billion (higher again in 2026) with backlog at $106 billion and capacity tight into 2026. Now lets look at the plusses and minuses for each player. Pluses: Azure is still ripping — ~39% growth with management guiding to ~37% cc next quarter even while capacity-constrained. We think it will be even higher – perhaps as high as 40% with GPT-5. A $368 billion RPO (+37% y/y) says the the company has a long runway, and foundry/agent adoption combined with surging token throughput says Microsoft has found a true AI platform flywheel. But it appears heavily tied to OpenAI, which is broadening it ecosystem horizontally with new open source models. Software efficiencies are kicking in with (“~90% more tokens per graphics processing unit” year on year) – without this, the gross-margin drag from scaling AI infrastructure would be much worse. The other welcome positive is the $75 billion Azure disclosure. Minuses: Microsoft still won’t disclose an Azure operating margin and is cagey around cloud operating margin. Overall Microsoft Cloud gross margin fell ~2 points year-over-year, pressured by Azure’s AI mix. Supply remains tight through 1H FY26, implying some demand is being pushed, and a significant piece of Azure’s momentum appears tied to ChatGPT inference and to reporting definitional changes, which confuse the growth rate relative to historical reporting. Pluses: Still the revenue leader and despite the drop in operating margin from the high 30s to ~32.9%, AWS remains profitable for what is essentially a company that sells access to hardware resources. Demand exceeds supply; backlog sits at ~$195 billion (+25% y/y) and the AI stack runs deep and wide — from Trainium2 to Bedrock plus AgentCore/Kiro announced at NYC Summit and a vast ecosystem that gives AWS customers choice and the company full-stack leverage. Minuses: Headline growth of ~17.5% trails Azure/GCP and invites lazy comparisons. Let’s face it – AWS is getting outmarketed right now by Microsoft when it comes to cloud momentum. Heavy CapEx means elevated depreciation and, with capacity expected to rebalance over “several quarters,” near-term upside may be capped. Pluses: Google Cloud is hitting a nice combo of scale and improving profitability — ~32% growth with ~20.7% operating margin — and GCP (IaaS/PaaS + AI) is growing much faster than overall cloud (tCR est. ~39%). Backlog momentum is real at ~$106 billion, with $250 million-plus deals doubling and $1 billion-plus wins in 1H25 matching all of 2024. Minuses: Capacity remains tight into 2026, which could pace revenue recognition, and Alphabet flagged an acceleration in depreciation as CapEx grows — both potential margin headwinds. Disclosure on pure IaaS/PaaS remains less granular, so we’re relying on qualitative signals and survey data for GCP’s exact mix shift. Let’s zoom out and take a look at the annual revenue and market share forecasts: Cloud infrastructure is now a quarter-trillion-dollar market. In 2025, the Big 3+ Alibaba will clear about $259 billion in IaaS/PaaS revenue, up roughly 26% year over year. AWS remains the revenue leader at ~$126.6 billion, but its growth cadence — ~18% — is well below Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform, both running high-30s. Azure is the big story: ~$87.7 billion in 2025E IaaS/PaaS, with growth juiced by AI inference volumes and Microsoft’s shifts in what it counts as ‘Azure.’ GCP is a solid No. 3 at ~$28.3 billion, growing about as fast as Azure from a smaller base. Share shifts continue. AWS drops about 4 points of IaaS/PaaS share since 2024 to ~48.6%. Microsoft picks up ~4 points to ~35.3%, while Google holds steady around ~10%. Put differently: Azure + GCP are growing at a combined ~38% versus AWS at ~18% — that gap continues to attract negative attention to AWS. Underneath the revenue lines is an unprecedented CapEx cycle. The big three are on pace to pour roughly $240 billion a year into data centers, power and servers to feed AI demand. Yet 2025 AI services revenue is only on the order of ~$25 billion from these three, which means heavy front-loading — that is, lots of spend now for monetization that (hopefully) scales later. The bottom line is AWS still throws off the most dollars, but Microsoft’s definition-plus-AI strategy is gaining share fast, and Google is quietly compounding with evidence of improved profitability and a long runway. Let’s look at the nuances of interpreting the growth rates and the games vendors play with numbers. The Azure revenue trajectory has been quite remarkable as shown in the chart above. Entering COVID, we estimate that Microsoft Azure was generating roughly $4 billion per quarter. Today, our estimates indicate that Azure is running at more than $21 billion per quarter growing in the high 30% range. Note the revenue flattening in 2024 roughly coincides with the removal of the Enterprise Mobility, Security and Power BI per-user pricing revenue within Azure definitions. It replaced those low growth businesses with smaller but faster growing AI. As such you see the Azure curve steeply rises into 2025 as Azure AI services kick in. The timing was right and Microsoft disclosed that Azure has surpassed $75 billion. [See our detailed analysis of the Azure financial disclosures and the definitional changes] Microsoft’s FY 2025 ends in CY Q2 2025 and the $75 billion figure corresponds to the CY periods comprising Q3 2024 through Q2 2025. In our view, Microsoft cleverly timed its reclassification of Azure revenue and the $75 billion disclosure to underscore its substantial revenue base and its significantly higher growth rate relative to AWS. But this is the “growth optics” slide – the games people play. The bottom half of the above chart tries to put everyone on the same field. AWS did ~$30.9 billion IaaS/PaaS in the quarter, up 17.5%. Mapping to the $75 billion figure, we have Microsoft at ~$22.2 billion, +39%. If you normalize for the ChatGPT uplift and Microsoft’s definitional tweaks, our range for ‘core Azure’ is ~$18.5 billion to $19.0 billion growing in the mid-30s; or, by its previous definitions, 20%. At that size, AWS historically also grew in the mid-30s, so the meme that “AWS is lagging” is mostly rate-of-change noise. Google Cloud Platform is ~$7.2 billion, growing ~38% to 39%. Strong, but when AWS was at ~$7 billion, it was growing at ~45%, so this isn’t unprecedented hypergrowth. Net-net: The market is ripping, but a lot of Azure’s pop is AI inference optics. George Gilbert points out that Microsoft doesn’t want to highlight the fact that it has a ChatGPT tiger by the tail. Probably 50% of OpenAI’s revenue goes to COGs – that is, Azure fees. The point is, strip that out and the growth curves of AWS and Azure converge when normalizing for size of business over time. Nonetheless – AWS remains the dollar leader, Azure is gaining share with these AI/OpenAI tailwinds, and GCP is executing cleanly off a smaller base. Let’s look at some of the spending data from ETR on the big three cloud players. ETR’s Shared-Net Score data shows spending momentum still favoring Azure. Remember this is account-based not revenue-based. In Jul 2025, Azure posts a 60.2% Shared Net Score on 986 accounts, well ahead of AWS at 45.3% (N=784) and GCP at 36.2% (N=437) out of 1,777 total shared responses. The 40% dotted line indicates highly elevated spending velocity, so despite AWS’s lower score it’s still elevated. Over the last 18 months Azure has held a persistent 60%+ Net Score, consistent with AI-driven expansions and Microsoft’s bundle leverage. AWS softened in late 2023, then recovered into the mid-40s — steady but still capacity-limited. GCP’s momentum cooled through 2024 into mid-2025, now mid-30s, possibly reflecting bigger, longer deal cycles rather than broad-based expansions. The net is: In overlapping accounts, account-share momentum = Azure > AWS > GCP. Here’s a similar slide but it shows the penetration into the data set. Surprisingly, all three are showing deceleration in the pervasiveness metric. This doesn’t fly in the face of the rapid and accelerating cloud growth rates, however what it speaks to is spending is shifting to other categories, namely AI; and possibly some pause in AI experimentation on the cloud and some thought of moving toward on-premises – or balancing in that direction. Again, this data doesn’t represent spending levels, rather it represents account penetration. Microsoft is ubiquitous and speaks to why Azure’s penetration is so high. AWS continues to broaden its footprint with shared-account penetration GCP is still the third player and quite a distance from the leaders. Let’s close with a look at things to watch going forward. Here’s the bottom line heading into H2 and the 2026 window on the bull and bear cases: We’re tracking three swing factors that will decide the leaderboard — agent adoption, power and silicon. If pilots flip to production and enterprise agents get embedded across Microsoft M365, Google Workspace and custom apps, we may get a second-wave of cloud migration and real productivity gains. For AWS, which lacks a ubiquitous collaboration software platform it must rely primarily on its builders. Offerings around Q Developer are critical for developers to create software and apps on the AWS platform. But if customers don’t see broad-based return on investment and they suffer from proof-of-concept fatigue, things could slow. Of course, we’re always watching the macro spending picture as well, which right now is cautious outside AI. We’re also looking at the pace of CapEx buildouts and permitting – if regulations keep dragging and “short on power” becomes the norm, growth gets slowed by lack of kilowatts, not underlying demand. For silicon designers, like these three – if price/performance keeps improving not only with Nvidia Blackwell GPUs, but in-house silicon such as AWS’ Trainium and Google’s TPUs, and better inference economics, hyperscalers can keep pricing power and this will pull adjacent services. If GPUs remain constrained or customers are concerned about CUDA lock-in and high training costs, that could be a headwind and the bear case is migrations slow and customers may pull back a bit. Sovereign cloud is a monetization tailwind. Microsoft has the strongest hybrid story of the big three with its legacy on-premises Azure stack footprint and there’s evidence that its non-cloud business remains strong. Google is probably even more incentivized to partner for on-prem deployments, while AWS doubles down on VPC-native sovereignty and has Outposts in its back pocket. Policy is the wild card; a pro-innovation framework with licensing/data-use clarity supports spending, while broad antitrust/tariff shocks or an AI-ROI vacuum will cause buyers to tap the brakes. Our base case is that pilots begin converting, power eases gradually, custom silicon improves inference unit economics, and sovereignty continues to be in demand. But the big concern is enterprises continue to struggle with good data. Bad data will constrict AI payback and agentic adoption. That all said, CapEx continues to be the mainspring of AI enthusiasm and the Azure playbook is popping. AWS is not standing still and Google’s quiet execution is showing improved mix and margin, which is encouraging. Watch these signs: agent adoption, weekly active users and token volumes. In addition pay attention to CapEx versus AI revenue realization, the share of inference on non-GPU silicon, sovereign-cloud RFP velocity and any shift in liability rules. If the players hit on these, the cloud up-cycle runs right through 2026. This is our expectation. This is our base case. What’s yours? Please get in touch and let us know.

August 09, 2025 10:20 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, Aug. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: IRBT) and certain officers. The class action, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and docketed under 25-cv-05563, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than Defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), seeking to recover damages caused by Defendants’ violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, against the Company and certain of its top officials. If you are an investor who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities during the Class Period, you have until September 5, 2025, to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. To discuss this action, contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. [Click here for information about joining the class action] iRobot designs, builds, and sells robots and home innovation products in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Japan, and internationally. The Company’s portfolio of home robots and smart home devices features proprietary technologies for the connected home and advanced concepts in cleaning, mapping and navigation. iRobot is primarily known for its robot vacuum cleaner (“RVC”) products sold under the “Roomba” brand name. While iRobot’s Roomba was the first commercially successful RVC, iRobot’s business has steadily declined over the past decade, apart from a brief sales bump during the COVID-19 pandemic. Competitors from China undercut the luxury-priced Roomba, while other consumer electronics firms like Samsung and SharkNinja introduced their own RVCs. By 2016, iRobot’s market share had dropped to 64% in 2016, and then to only 46% by 2020. Investors believed that iRobot was saved when, in August 2022, iRobot entered into a merger agreement with Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”) pursuant to which Amazon would acquire iRobot for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $1.7 billion (the “Amazon Acquisition”). In a joint press release announcing the Amazon Acquisition, iRobot’s then Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Colin Angle was quoted as stating, in relevant part, “Amazon shares our passion for building thoughtful innovations that empower people to do more at home, and I cannot think of a better place for our team to continue our mission. I’m hugely excited to be a part of Amazon and to see what we can build together for customers in the years ahead.” However, in January 2024, Amazon and iRobot announced that they had mutually agreed to terminate the Amazon Acquisition, citing regulatory concerns. Specifically, the companies stated that there was “no path to regulatory approval in the European Union” and reports circulated that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission was in the process of drafting a lawsuit that would seek to stop the deal. Concurrent with this announcement, iRobot also reported that Colin Angle would step down from his role as CEO, and that the Company would be cutting approximately 350 employees, representing 31% of iRobot’s workforce. Notwithstanding the termination of the Amazon Acquisition and the subsequent job cuts, the Company has consistently maintained that it is “confident in [its] ability to build on [its] legacy of innovation as a standalone company and to navigate this period successfully.” Moreover, in the wake of the Amazon Acquisition’s termination, iRobot touted that it would be implementing an operational restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”)—which the Company has sometimes referred to as “iRobot Elevate”—“designed to position the Company for stabilization in the current environment, while focusing on profitability and advancing key growth initiatives to extend its market share in the mid-tier and premium segments.” The Restructuring Plan, according to the Company, would “enable [it] to chart a new strategic path for sustainable value creation.” The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that “there can be no assurance that [iRobot’s] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies.” Accordingly, “[g]iven these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company’s financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements.” In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot’s announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating “due to [a] bleak outlook,” stating that “iRobot’s business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses,” “Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes,” “iRobot’s future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender,” and that the Company’s “survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely.” That same day, in an article entitled “Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today,” The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that “iRobot’s costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability.” On this news, iRobot’s stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. After the end of the Class Period, in May 2025, iRobot experienced a short squeeze—i.e., a rapid increase in the price of a stock owing primarily to an excess of short selling of a stock rather than underlying fundamentals—after it was announced that U.S. tariffs on European Union imports would be delayed until July 2025. However, notwithstanding the increase in the Company’s stock price, market analysts noted that iRobot’s underlying fundamentals remained highly concerning. For example, on May 29, 2025, Seeking Alpha stated that iRobot’s “[t]echnical indicators have turned bullish short-term, but the company’s cash burn and deteriorating financials outweigh these positives” and “Q1 [2025] results revealed falling revenue, worsening losses, shrinking cash reserves, and declining gross margins, signaling severe operational stress.” Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.

Title: This 8.5% Dividend Loves A Market Panic

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Volatility is back! And we contrarians know what to do: Get ready to buy. And we don’t have to try to time the depths of the next selloff, either, because the three 7%+ paying, “volatility-loving” dividends we’re going to talk about are perfect for this market. They’re all closed-end funds (CEFs) that see their cash streams grow when markets get skittish. Their secret? They sell covered-call options on their portfolios. This is a smart, low-risk way they can generate extra income—and send it our way as 7%+ dividends. That’s because these funds charge investors a “premium” for the “option” to buy their holdings at a fixed time and date in the future. They keep that cash no matter what happens with the trade itself. And their dividends (and our income) directly benefit. If you’ve been reading my column for a while, you’ll recognize these three covered-call CEFs: the 8.5%-paying Nuveen Dow 30 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (DIAX), the 7.6%-yielding Nuveen S&P 500 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (SPXX) and the 8.5%-paying Nuveen NASDAQ 100 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (QQQX). We highlighted all three in my July 24, 2025, Contrarian Outlook article, and our opportunity is still on the table here—with DIAX in particular. I also bring these funds up now because, despite the media’s howling, the current market is simply following an age-old course. It goes like this: As stocks rise, a major news story sparks worries that their gains can’t last. Stocks then sell off on rising investor fear, until the “smart money” comes in to buy the dip. Then the rest of the crowd takes notice and stocks begin to recover. Usually, this cycle happens over a short period—a few weeks, maybe a month or two. A good example is the sharp selloff, and speedy recovery, after President Trump announced large tariffs in April. However, a negative mood can hang on and prolong a selloff. That’s what happened in 2022, when worries of an economic crisis emerged after 2021’s huge run. But that turned out to be wrong, and the economy didn’t start contracting that year, or in 2023, or even in 2024. As a result, stocks recovered, but it took a long time as pundit after pundit wrongly insisted a recession was on its way. Okay, so why am I giving a history lesson here? Because we may very well be on the precipice of a new selloff, with volatility rising again. The trigger was that disappointing jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics last Friday, which included large downward revisions to the previous two months’ readings. It’s worth noting, however, that the economy is still adding jobs, and, if we look at the last five years of data, we’re still far from the calamities of the pandemic. In other words, we’re in the fearmongering stage of the cycle, with the media running story after story about the so-called “big drop” in the labor market. A quick look at the CNN Fear and Greed index, as of this writing, shows us that the extreme-greed mood of the last couple months has flipped to neutral, where it was in March and again at the end of April, after the huge crash earlier that month. However, it’s worth noting that stocks are up both from the end of April and from March. So, if sentiment is cooling, we may see stocks sell off in the short term, then recover strongly a bit later. That’s the scenario I find most likely at this time. One interesting thing about the current market is that, while volatility has jumped a little, it’s nowhere near the spikes associated with big, steep selloffs. This tells us that a near-term selloff isn’t guaranteed, and one will likely only emerge if the current level of the VIX—the market’s so-called “fear gauge”—rises. As you can see above, the VIX recently spiked from an unusually low level, meaning the market is waking up from weeks of complacency. Obviously, in such a market, you can’t just sell everything: If things stay flattish, you might be able to buy back in, but you’ll miss out on dividends. And if stocks see a short-term decline, who’s to say how low it will go and how long it will last? This doesn’t feel like a 2022-style drop, partly because Americans are less fearful than they were shortly after the pandemic. So a short-term market dip is the likeliest outcome, with a flat market a close second. In such a market, the best move is to monetize rising volatility. That’s where our (still-) available opportunity on those three covered-call CEFs comes in. We’re interested in these three because their call options essentially turn rising fear into cash. Plus there’s a big difference in their discounts to net asset value (NAV, or the value of their underlying portfolios) we can take advantage of. Note that DIAX (in blue above) trades at a near-11% discount to NAV as of this writing, even though its 8.5% yield matches that of QQQX, which has a much narrower 7.5% discount. And SPXX, with its smaller 7.6% yield, trades at just a 1.9% discount! This is odd, since CEF investors love high yields and tend to price up higher-yielding funds. And as of now, SPXX pays the least and has the smallest discount. That’s the one part of this that makes sense, and the reason is fairly straightforward: The S&P 500 is the best-known index, so many investors blindly pile into SPXX for that reason. But consider the fact that DIAX has a higher yield (8.5%, you’ll recall), a bigger discount (nearly 11%, as shown in the chart above) and holds solid blue chips like 3M (MMM), American Express (AXP), Boeing (BA), Coca-Cola (KO) and Procter & Gamble (PG). This means it’s likelier to see higher volatility in the short term (especially since its portfolio only includes 30 stocks—those in the Dow). But that’s a plus, as these option strategies do best in volatile markets. That should raise demand for DIAX, causing its near-11% discount to shrink. And that’s why, right now, DIAX is a compelling hedge for short-term volatility. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

The Qidi Plus 4’s chamber heating and high-temperature direct drive system set this $799 printer apart from the rest of its midrange competitors. Positioned between Creality’s affordability and Bambu’s innovation, Qidi emphasizes material versatility, consistent print quality, and enclosure-driven performance. While some 3D printing enthusiasts are happy to stop with ASA or ABS filaments—popular units like the Bambu Lab A1 check most of the boxes for most people—others have projects that require higher-quality and more-durable materials like nylon and polycarbonate. For these and several other use cases, the Plus 4 represents an exceptional value and a solid upgrade from the more beginner-friendly A1. It wins an Editors' Choice award as the best filament-based 3D printer for hobbyists. Qidi entered the consumer 3D printing market in 2014, focusing on enclosed, user-friendly FDM printers at a time when most competitors—including Creality—were emphasizing open-frame, DIY-style machines. While Creality gained popularity with its budget-friendly, modifiable Ender series, Qidi built its reputation on plug-and-play reliability and sturdy enclosures, making early models like the Qidi Tech I and X-Pro popular in educational and office environments. As the industry shifted toward speed, automation, and high-temperature capabilities—especially following Bambu Lab’s 2022 launch of the X1 Carbon—Qidi responded with machines like the X-Plus, X-Max, and ultimately the Plus 4. For a while, I watched this evolution from afar, sticking with my finicky LulzBot TAZ 5 for the better part of a decade. (Oh, the fun of leveling a square bed that has only three leveling screws...but I digress.) The mechanical engineer in me knew it was time for a new printer, and not an entry-level unit like the Bambu Lab A1 Mini (as venerated and reliable as it is). I wanted something with more ability than that; a class above it. I decided to see if the Plus 4 could fit the bill, and I purchased the unit I'm reviewing here, rather than receiving a loaner from Qidi. The Plus 4 weighs 60 pounds, which is definitely not in the featherweight class. Its footprint is no slouch either, coming in at 19.8 by 19.2 by 21.7 inches (HWD) compared with the Prusa Core One's 21.8 by 16.3 by 17.5 inches. (The increased size is partly thanks to the steel-frame enclosure.) While I had no problem finding room for the machine—I've got a dedicated maker space in my house—users with limited space will find it bulky to move or fit. Qidi compensates for this by building grab handles into the top of the unit, but it can be daunting for a single person to move. I needed my son to help me get it up the stairs. With a 12-by-12-by-11-inch build area, the Plus 4 supports large prints and multi-part assemblies, ideal for prototyping, making cosplay props, or short-run manufacturing. Dimensionally, the Plus 4 slightly outpaces its closest rivals, the Bambu Lab P1 and X1 Carbon, whose build volumes are 10 cubic inches. The Plus 4 comes with an active chamber heater, which warms the interior to around 150 degrees F in about 8 minutes when it's running at 400 watts. (Early firmware versions let the chamber heater pull up to 800 watts, which exceeded the safety ratings of the included solid-state relay [SSR], creating a potential fire risk. While Qidi issued a firmware cap to 400 watts, many users still choose to replace the SSR or install thermal fuses out of caution.) The heater promotes stable conditions for high-temperature materials like ABS, polycarbonate, and nylon. By circulating heated air throughout the chamber as opposed to passively retaining heat from the extruder or bed in the chamber, parts are surrounded by a uniform temperature, helping to prevent warping and lifting off of the PEI build plate. (Confused by some of this terminology? Check out our guide to 3D printing to learn the basics.) The Plus 4 also comes standard with a high-temperature direct-drive extruder with a 0.4mm hardened steel nozzle, enabling the use of advanced filaments like polycarbonate, nylon, and carbon-fiber blends, as well as common lower-temperature PLA and TPU. The 80-watt nozzle has a 700-degree-F ceiling with a ceramic heat break to prevent heat creep. The maximum temperature limit means no burnt or malformed nozzle tips, even after printing with filament like polycarbonate. Qidi uses a 6mm-thick aluminum substrate for the heater bed, a sturdier build than the typical 3mm beds found on entry-level printers. This thickness promotes consistent, even heat across the entire surface. (Notably, the surface is capable of 250 degrees F, well above the requirements of most engineering-grade filaments.) The combination of the thick aluminum heater and effective chamber insulation helps heat soak and the filament maintain stable temperatures, which is crucial for consistent first layers. The first thing you’re going to notice when you get the unit is its weight and size. This is one of the most important moments with a new product—how it feels when you take it out of the box. As I touched on above, the unit has thick, sturdy grab handles that are recessed into the frame of the printer. When you pull the machine out and put it on the stand or a nearby table, you know right away it is a heavy, sturdy unit. It feels like it belongs in a factory. I thought, “Someone is thinking about the little things.” I connected the filament spool holder, which goes in the rear left corner of the machine. This location makes sense to me, as I could get to it easily and see from a distance how much filament was left on the roll at any given time. Where placed, the printer felt like a piece of modern furniture. It looks sleek and futuristic, and from a few feet away, you can’t tell that the side panels aren’t aluminum. (You have to touch them to know for sure.) The machine also gets impressively bright via the internal LED; the powerful light makes it easy for my older eyes to work with the unit. I live with a spouse, who is very concerned about the fumes printers can produce and always quizzes me on my remediation plans. As such, I was happy to see that the chamber fans for the Plus 4 come standard with an active carbon filter pouch. It was just another smart touch that signaled attention to the user experience, and built my confidence in the machine. I was also very impressed with the guidance of the heated bed assembly. The four 10mm precision-hardened steel rods and two synchronized drive motors told me that Qidi had put a lot of thought into holding the print plane square. At the back of the build chamber, a horizontal stabilizer bar connects the tops of the two vertical Z-axis lead screw assemblies. This acts as a rigid crossbeam between the vertical linear rods and screws that raise and lower the bed across the rear of the printer for additional stability. The printer walked me through the calibrations on the display, including a bed calibration after the input shaping. The colorful 5-inch touch-screen display has an 800-by-400-pixel resolution, but it is laggy and unresponsive for a machine of this caliber. It can take several seconds for the preview images of the files you're loading to fully appear. This is one of the biggest disconnects in the experience, where you feel like the Plus 4 is cutting costs and not fighting in its weight class. The build plate level variance of my unit was about 0.21mm, which is definitely acceptable out of the box. Using four screws under the bed, you can fine-tune the bed height at the corners, but after printing my first-layer test print (shown below), I decided to use what I had and not adjust anything before getting started. One frustrating aspect of the Plus 4 is that it requires you to re-run mesh bed leveling every time you flip or swap the magnetic build plate. Since the Z-offset and mesh compensation are tied to the plate's exact thickness and position, even a slight change can throw off your first layer. Forgetting to recalibrate often results in poor adhesion or failed prints—an extra step that interrupts an otherwise streamlined workflow. Qidi could help address this via a firmware update, by sending the build plate to the bottom limits of the stepper motor each time. I had one small tear line in the 0.2mm quality setting print using Prusa Galaxy PLA filament, though the rest of the first layer printed perfectly. The Plus 4 comes standard with things other companies charge extra for, don’t offer, or rely on their community to design for them. For one thing, the model has a stout wiper and nozzle-cleaning assembly that feels industrial and intentional. Listening to it load and clean the nozzle, I had no doubts that when it was probing for prints that the surface of the nozzle was clean. The Prusa Core One lacks this, instead requiring you to print your own or do the cleaning by hand. Customer support is also above average. Qidi has an official Wiki page, which felt very reassuring to me; no need to wonder where to go should a problem arise. I would later use the email support, and got an answer the same day from Qidi. That's an impressive response. When I loaded the unit with filament and turned it loose, I was immediately struck with the speed and the lack of vibration of the unit, compared with my 10-year-old LulzBot TAZ 5. Minutes later, I was staring at an Owl staring back at me. The machine also made fast work of the frog test file on the USB key that comes with the unit. Speaking of which, the Plus 4 allows you to connect and load your prints via USB key, Ethernet, or wirelessly through Wi-Fi, which is what I chose to use for all my testing. The Wi-Fi option was helpful for me, as I could monitor the status of my print from afar with a feed from the included camera, which will also record a time-lapse video of each print. I experienced no plate adhesion issues with the small toe footprint of baby Kermit...more reassurance. With the Plus 4, parts always come loose from the flexible metal plate easily with minimal flexing to coax the parts away. Next, I printed a set of PETG water cups to impress my wife, and noticed the distinct lack of VFAs, the virtual fine artifacts that are the bane of 3D printing hobbyists. The 0.35-inch-wide 1.5GT timing belts and high-impact fiberglass pulleys—paired with an effective VFA resonance compensation algorithm—kept a tight grip on that extruder at high speeds, with less room for the belt to slip on the pulleys as it moved. Other printers from Bambu, Creality, and Prusa use 2GT belts and have more noticeable VFAs. The end result: near-perfect surface finishes on the cup. I ran the next print using Prusa Galaxy Black PLA in high-speed mode to print a vase. No VFAs here, either. The lines were barely visible at the 0.2mm high-speed quality tier. It all looked so slick that my wife thought I had bought the vase from a local plant store until I told her it came out of the printer. As mentioned above, early batches of the Plus 4, including my unit, were shipped with an underpowered SSR board for the chamber heater that was prone to overheating. The board's choke coil was undersized, leading to burnt components, melted insulation, and in rare cases, fire hazards. Qidi acknowledged the issue and began shipping upgraded SSR boards with improved thermal capacity and thicker components, offering replacements to affected users. While the new board resolved the overheating problem for most, some users have opted to install higher-quality aftermarket SSRs—such as those from Omron or Fotek—for additional safety. The incident highlighted a serious early oversight in power handling, especially for a machine marketed with industrial-grade features. I opted to contact Qidi, which immediately shipped me the new, tested SSR board shown above. The company also offered very clear instructions on the Wiki page about how to remove the board and swap in the new one. I was very satisfied with how quickly I was able to reach out, make contact, and receive my replacement part. I wanted this fixed before I used what I had bought the machine for: the active heat fan (shown below). Would it be able to get the chamber heated quickly, and maintain a homogenous block of stable air surrounding the parts I wanted to print? My very first print was an ABS Benchy. It was at this moment that I understood the Plus 4 is an ABS-eating monster. What PLA was for other machines, ABS was for the Qidi. I showed it to a friend, who thought it was PLA at first and couldn’t believe the quality of it. Print time was close to 15 minutes for each of my three attempts, which is about normal for a machine in this price range. The Plus 4 is capable of speeds up to 600mm per second, though that maximum requires resonance tuning and other optimizations. To avoid print degradation, the printer is best used at 200-to-300mm per second. Next, I wanted to test detail and retraction at speed to see if the Plus 4 could keep up with the quality of machines like the Prusa Core One. I loaded a hexagonal organizer cube and, with the ABS still in the machine and with the chamber heater set to 55 degrees C (131 degrees F), I printed out the box for comparison. This was an undried spool of filament, with some visible stringing but impressive quality for detail at that level. There were no elephant feet or lifting from the PEI build plate. The bottom was flat and stacked perfectly with the other box. With the ABS still in the machine, I ran the next print at the 0.2mm-layer height, with the bed chamber set to the same temperature. This is the Kickstarter/Autodesk “torture test.” We’re looking for dimensional accuracy, and watching filament-flow control, fine features, bridging, and overhangs. All the towers printed (I broke one moving it from the machine to the photo table) with mild stringing that went away with a pass of the heat gun. All of the tolerance dowels immediately fell from the holes when I removed the part from the plate, from the 0.5mm down to the 0.1mm clearance tests. The surface finish was perfect and appeared to have come from a much more expensive machine. The Plus 4 showed its strength with the bridging test section, having no issues cooling the overhangs over larger and larger spans, with the cooling fan doing well beyond the minimum and passing this test with flying colors. The overhangs hung in there up to the 80-degree mark, where they printed with noticeable layer line pronouncements. Again, using ABS filament and getting acceptable overhangs in a heated chamber, with no cooling issues, surprised me. I then used the digital caliper to measure the calibration disc at the base of the block: 25.75mm on the 25.00 datum. It was 24.75mm all around the disc, with a near-perfect concentric circle that had no egg shape. This is a better result than the Creality K1 achieved with this challenging print when we tested it. The second-to-last calibration revealed the same repeatable concentricity, with squares measuring equally across the entire matrix of cubes. This geometrical panel test showed fine detail maintenance up until the smallest “Test” text outcroppings, where the “s” and “t” had difficulty printing. I compared these results with those of notable printers like the Prusa MK4 and found them to be in line with the accuracy and precision of these old-school legacy printers, which impressed me even more. (The MK4 has been replaced by the MK4S since we tested it.) Finally, I performed a popular tolerance test with a go/no-go gauge from Cults3D.com, this time in Prusa Galaxy Black PLA with 0.2mm layer lines and the glass lid removed. The circle fit into every hole, including the 0.00mm hole. The square gauge stopped at the 0.05mm gauge hole. Finished with my testing and benchmark prints, I set out to use the unit for some real-world projects with engineering-grade materials. With the Polymaker black ABS still in the machine, I made a hard case I downloaded from Printables.com for a portable ham radio measurement device. Taking advantage of the heated chamber, I wanted to see if the planar case surfaces would lift up from the build plate. To my surprise, everything printed perfectly, with the case easily mating and closing perfectly square. Next up, a print-in-place pair of ABS vice grips, also with Polymaker black ABS. I chose a 50% infill for strength with a 200mm-per-second max speed and 55-degree-C chamber temperature. The grips and sliding parts easily broke open, and after a firm twist on the adjustment slide, I could use it to clamp small parts on my desk.Encouraged, I moved on to ABS carbon fiber, downloading a 0.177 air rifle suppressor from Printables.com. I target practice in my backyard, and the supersonic rounds always "cracked" when I fired, like a gunshot. The threads printed perfectly, and I saw no artifacts on the sides of the barrel. After firing several dozen rounds through the suppressor, it had no noticeable breaks or degradations in the surface from the heat or pressure from firing. With the ABS carbon fiber still loaded, I set about making a larger set of prints to really spread out in the large build chamber. First, a wall-mounted holder for my Starlink power supply and router. I’ve been using the Starlink Gen 3 router, but I never liked the way it sat on my shelving, and wanted a more permanent place on my wall to mount the pair of components. The Plus 4 went through this print like butter. I’d seen this file printed by a Creality K1 with noticeable warping on the corners, and I was curious how it would lay on the Plus4 build plate. The holder did have some noticeable artifacts on the surface, which I noted were exactly where the infill lines were terminating. But when I showed the parts to my wife, she asked me if I had ordered them from Amazon or Starlink directly. She couldn’t believe that I had made them at home. I then turned the printing speed down to 60mm per second and started aiming higher on the difficulty chart. I loaded a spool of PolyMide PA6-CF. PA6 is significantly harder to print than its PA12 counterpart due to how PA6 absorbs much more water. (Up to 10% by weight if left exposed, compared with 2% for PA12.) If the Plus 4 was going to struggle with this grade of material, it would happen now. PA6 will also shrink and warp more than PA12, which is more dimensionally stable and easier to keep stuck to the build plate. It was the perfect challenge for this unit. I put on a layer of PA Magigoo to help prevent any layer-adhesion issues, set the bed temperature to 50 degrees C and the build chamber to 55 degrees with the cooling fan off, and set out to print a display holder for my Xbox controller, which had no real home on my desk. The designer-style base came out fantastic. It had no surface issues whatsoever—no warping at the edges or lifting, despite the wide first layers that, notoriously, shrink in open-air units like the Prusa MK4. Not wanting to stop, I looked around my office for other expensive homeless devices, and decided that I would make a mount for my Meta Quest 2 headset with the same settings as the Xbox holder at the 0.2mm layer line height. The chamber was still hot, like a warm oven accepting the second batch of cookies. My first layer was a little wonky. I could have slightly raised the gap of the Z-offset during the first layer, something I later learned how to do, and appreciated the ability to change. Once the second layer covered the fibers from the first layer, though, the issues evaporated from my mind. Weeks later, I had a real-world application unexpectedly arise. We have chickens in the backyard, and the night before leaving for a vacation, my wife informed me that it was going to drop well below freezing temperatures while we were gone. The watering system I had in place was my summer/fall system, and the water would freeze if I didn't modify it. I had the necessary components to fix it: a pump, a reservoir, and a heater that came on below 38 degrees F, but after a trip to Lowe's, I found that the ABS adapters I needed to connect the pump to the pipe where the bird-feeder nozzles would go were out of stock. I sat down with my copy of Fusion 360 to design the part that would attach the hose to the 2-inch PVC pipe that chickens would be drinking from, and loaded it into the Qidi Studio Slicer. I stopped the first print 20% in, to validate that the threads were accurate and would fit, which they easily did. The full-size final print, at 100% infill with ABS set for 0.2mm, worked brilliantly. By 11:30 p.m., I had the cold water system in place and could go on our trip with peace of mind I wouldn’t have had without the quick change enabled by the engineering-grade-material abilities of the Plus 4. I also tested the Plus 4's ability to print with pure polycarbonate, arguably one of the most difficult materials to print. I started simple with parts like the ham radio wire spool handle shown below. I used a 300-degree-C nozzle temperature, with a 100-degree heated bed and a 65-degree heated chamber for a perfect first-time print, with the Magigoo PA bed glue wiped on first. (I was sure to dry the roll completely first in my Sunlu filament dryer box.) I’ve also tested carbon-fiber nylon, with the exact same results. This time, I designed a dry-erase marker holder for my whiteboard, completely overdoing it with the filament choice, but wanting to see if the parts would warp, and what the surfaces would look like after the print completed. Once I had a database of the good settings for these different filaments, I started to lean on the Plus 4 for more everyday items and challenges. For example, I downloaded a replacement chicken feeder port that has saved me about 20 pounds of waste feed falling out of the container from the stock feed port: The new feeder port falls deeper into the crumbles, and the chickens were unable to scrape it out of boredom into the dirt around the feeder. That one print alone has saved me hundreds of dollars in feed, and the parts are in the sun all day, every day. Having access to these durable filaments lets me protect expensive gear as well. I made a set of rails for my portable ham radio that protect the nearly $1,200 radio and its sensitive knobs from bumps and bruises while in the field. The Plus 4 made easy work of the files, giving me way more peace of mind than ASA or even ABS would have given me with printers incapable of using these more durable materials. When that project finished, I of course had to print this ABS glass fiber holder for my Ryobi pressure washer wands and nozzles, just because I could.

The Qidi Plus 4’s chamber heating and high-temperature direct drive system set this $799 printer apart from the rest of its midrange competitors. Positioned between Creality’s affordability and Bambu’s innovation, Qidi emphasizes material versatility, consistent print quality, and enclosure-driven performance. While some 3D printing enthusiasts are happy to stop with ASA or ABS filaments—popular units like the Bambu Lab A1 check most of the boxes for most people—others have projects that require higher-quality and more-durable materials like nylon and polycarbonate. For these and several other use cases, the Plus 4 represents an exceptional value and a solid upgrade from the more beginner-friendly A1. It wins an Editors' Choice award as the best filament-based 3D printer for hobbyists. In the UAE, QIDI Plus4 on Noon UAE is available for AED 4,399 (incl. VAT), offering a Gulf-ready printer with GCC-compatible power adapter and shipping via Noon. Through QIDI Plus4 on Ubuy, the unit is listed at approximately AED 3,648, delivered from international warehouses—still fully functional in the Gulf, though warranty coverage may differ. Another option is QIDI Plus4 on Desertcart UAE, priced at AED 4,649, offering easy returns and delivery across the UAE. In Saudi Arabia, Desertcart KSA currently offers the QIDI Plus 4 3D Printer for delivery within the region—though pricing reflects international sourcing (typically above SAR 4,000) and lacks official Gulf-region warranty. Additionally, WhizzCart KSA lists the Plus 4 at a competitive price with local shipping terms. Qidi entered the consumer 3D printing market in 2014, focusing on enclosed, user-friendly FDM printers at a time when most competitors—including Creality—were emphasizing open-frame, DIY-style machines. While Creality gained popularity with its budget-friendly, modifiable Ender series, Qidi built its reputation on plug-and-play reliability and sturdy enclosures, making early models like the Qidi Tech I and X-Pro popular in educational and office environments. As the industry shifted toward speed, automation, and high-temperature capabilities—especially following Bambu Lab’s 2022 launch of the X1 Carbon—Qidi responded with machines like the X-Plus, X-Max, and ultimately the Plus 4. For a while, I watched this evolution from afar, sticking with my finicky LulzBot TAZ 5 for the better part of a decade. (Oh, the fun of leveling a square bed that has only three leveling screws...but I digress.) The mechanical engineer in me knew it was time for a new printer, and not an entry-level unit like the Bambu Lab A1 Mini (as venerated and reliable as it is). I wanted something with more ability than that; a class above it. I decided to see if the Plus 4 could fit the bill, and I purchased the unit I'm reviewing here, rather than receiving a loaner from Qidi. The Plus 4 weighs 60 pounds, which is definitely not in the featherweight class. Its footprint is no slouch either, coming in at 19.8 by 19.2 by 21.7 inches (HWD) compared with the Prusa Core One's 21.8 by 16.3 by 17.5 inches. (The increased size is partly thanks to the steel-frame enclosure.) While I had no problem finding room for the machine—I've got a dedicated maker space in my house—users with limited space will find it bulky to move or fit. Qidi compensates for this by building grab handles into the top of the unit, but it can be daunting for a single person to move. I needed my son to help me get it up the stairs. With a 12-by-12-by-11-inch build area, the Plus 4 supports large prints and multi-part assemblies, ideal for prototyping, making cosplay props, or short-run manufacturing. Dimensionally, the Plus 4 slightly outpaces its closest rivals, the Bambu Lab P1 and X1 Carbon, whose build volumes are 10 cubic inches. The Plus 4 comes with an active chamber heater, which warms the interior to around 150 degrees F in about 8 minutes when it's running at 400 watts. (Early firmware versions let the chamber heater pull up to 800 watts, which exceeded the safety ratings of the included solid-state relay [SSR], creating a potential fire risk. While Qidi issued a firmware cap to 400 watts, many users still choose to replace the SSR or install thermal fuses out of caution.) The heater promotes stable conditions for high-temperature materials like ABS, polycarbonate, and nylon. By circulating heated air throughout the chamber as opposed to passively retaining heat from the extruder or bed in the chamber, parts are surrounded by a uniform temperature, helping to prevent warping and lifting off of the PEI build plate. (Confused by some of this terminology? Check out our guide to 3D printing to learn the basics.) The Plus 4 also comes standard with a high-temperature direct-drive extruder with a 0.4mm hardened steel nozzle, enabling the use of advanced filaments like polycarbonate, nylon, and carbon-fiber blends, as well as common lower-temperature PLA and TPU. The 80-watt nozzle has a 700-degree-F ceiling with a ceramic heat break to prevent heat creep. The maximum temperature limit means no burnt or malformed nozzle tips, even after printing with filament like polycarbonate. Qidi uses a 6mm-thick aluminum substrate for the heater bed, a sturdier build than the typical 3mm beds found on entry-level printers. This thickness promotes consistent, even heat across the entire surface. (Notably, the surface is capable of 250 degrees F, well above the requirements of most engineering-grade filaments.) The combination of the thick aluminum heater and effective chamber insulation helps heat soak and the filament maintain stable temperatures, which is crucial for consistent first layers. The first thing you’re going to notice when you get the unit is its weight and size. This is one of the most important moments with a new product—how it feels when you take it out of the box. As I touched on above, the unit has thick, sturdy grab handles that are recessed into the frame of the printer. When you pull the machine out and put it on the stand or a nearby table, you know right away it is a heavy, sturdy unit. It feels like it belongs in a factory. I thought, “Someone is thinking about the little things.” I connected the filament spool holder, which goes in the rear left corner of the machine. This location makes sense to me, as I could get to it easily and see from a distance how much filament was left on the roll at any given time. Where placed, the printer felt like a piece of modern furniture. It looks sleek and futuristic, and from a few feet away, you can’t tell that the side panels aren’t aluminum. (You have to touch them to know for sure.) The machine also gets impressively bright via the internal LED; the powerful light makes it easy for my older eyes to work with the unit. I live with a spouse, who is very concerned about the fumes printers can produce and always quizzes me on my remediation plans. As such, I was happy to see that the chamber fans for the Plus 4 come standard with an active carbon filter pouch. It was just another smart touch that signaled attention to the user experience, and built my confidence in the machine. I was also very impressed with the guidance of the heated bed assembly. The four 10mm precision-hardened steel rods and two synchronized drive motors told me that Qidi had put a lot of thought into holding the print plane square. At the back of the build chamber, a horizontal stabilizer bar connects the tops of the two vertical Z-axis lead screw assemblies. This acts as a rigid crossbeam between the vertical linear rods and screws that raise and lower the bed across the rear of the printer for additional stability. The printer walked me through the calibrations on the display, including a bed calibration after the input shaping. The colorful 5-inch touch-screen display has an 800-by-400-pixel resolution, but it is laggy and unresponsive for a machine of this caliber. It can take several seconds for the preview images of the files you're loading to fully appear. This is one of the biggest disconnects in the experience, where you feel like the Plus 4 is cutting costs and not fighting in its weight class. The build plate level variance of my unit was about 0.21mm, which is definitely acceptable out of the box. Using four screws under the bed, you can fine-tune the bed height at the corners, but after printing my first-layer test print (shown below), I decided to use what I had and not adjust anything before getting started. One frustrating aspect of the Plus 4 is that it requires you to re-run mesh bed leveling every time you flip or swap the magnetic build plate. Since the Z-offset and mesh compensation are tied to the plate's exact thickness and position, even a slight change can throw off your first layer. Forgetting to recalibrate often results in poor adhesion or failed prints—an extra step that interrupts an otherwise streamlined workflow. Qidi could help address this via a firmware update, by sending the build plate to the bottom limits of the stepper motor each time. I had one small tear line in the 0.2mm quality setting print using Prusa Galaxy PLA filament, though the rest of the first layer printed perfectly. The Plus 4 comes standard with things other companies charge extra for, don’t offer, or rely on their community to design for them. For one thing, the model has a stout wiper and nozzle-cleaning assembly that feels industrial and intentional. Listening to it load and clean the nozzle, I had no doubts that when it was probing for prints that the surface of the nozzle was clean. The Prusa Core One lacks this, instead requiring you to print your own or do the cleaning by hand. Customer support is also above average. Qidi has an official Wiki page, which felt very reassuring to me; no need to wonder where to go should a problem arise. I would later use the email support, and got an answer the same day from Qidi. That's an impressive response. When I loaded the unit with filament and turned it loose, I was immediately struck with the speed and the lack of vibration of the unit, compared with my 10-year-old LulzBot TAZ 5. Minutes later, I was staring at an Owl staring back at me. The machine also made fast work of the frog test file on the USB key that comes with the unit. Speaking of which, the Plus 4 allows you to connect and load your prints via USB key, Ethernet, or wirelessly through Wi-Fi, which is what I chose to use for all my testing. The Wi-Fi option was helpful for me, as I could monitor the status of my print from afar with a feed from the included camera, which will also record a time-lapse video of each print. I experienced no plate adhesion issues with the small toe footprint of baby Kermit...more reassurance. With the Plus 4, parts always come loose from the flexible metal plate easily with minimal flexing to coax the parts away. Next, I printed a set of PETG water cups to impress my wife, and noticed the distinct lack of VFAs, the virtual fine artifacts that are the bane of 3D printing hobbyists. The 0.35-inch-wide 1.5GT timing belts and high-impact fiberglass pulleys—paired with an effective VFA resonance compensation algorithm—kept a tight grip on that extruder at high speeds, with less room for the belt to slip on the pulleys as it moved. Other printers from Bambu, Creality, and Prusa use 2GT belts and have more noticeable VFAs. The end result: near-perfect surface finishes on the cup. I ran the next print using Prusa Galaxy Black PLA in high-speed mode to print a vase. No VFAs here, either. The lines were barely visible at the 0.2mm high-speed quality tier. It all looked so slick that my wife thought I had bought the vase from a local plant store until I told her it came out of the printer. As mentioned above, early batches of the Plus 4, including my unit, were shipped with an underpowered SSR board for the chamber heater that was prone to overheating. The board's choke coil was undersized, leading to burnt components, melted insulation, and in rare cases, fire hazards.

The chamber was still hot, like a warm oven accepting the second batch of cookies. My first layer was a little wonky. I could have slightly raised the gap of the Z-offset during the first layer, something I later learned how to do, and appreciated the ability to change. Once the second layer covered the fibers from the first layer, though, the issues evaporated from my mind. Weeks later, I had a real-world application unexpectedly arise. We have chickens in the backyard, and the night before leaving for a vacation, my wife informed me that it was going to drop well below freezing temperatures while we were gone. The watering system I had in place was my summer/fall system, and the water would freeze if I didn't modify it. I had the necessary components to fix it: a pump, a reservoir, and a heater that came on below 38 degrees F, but after a trip to Lowe's, I found that the ABS adapters I needed to connect the pump to the pipe where the bird-feeder nozzles would go were out of stock. I sat down with my copy of Fusion 360 to design the part that would attach the hose to the 2-inch PVC pipe that chickens would be drinking from, and loaded it into the Qidi Studio Slicer. I stopped the first print 20% in, to validate that the threads were accurate and would fit, which they easily did. The full-size final print, at 100% infill with ABS set for 0.2mm, worked brilliantly. By 11:30 p.m., I had the cold water system in place and could go on our trip with peace of mind I wouldn’t have had without the quick change enabled by the engineering-grade-material abilities of the Plus 4. I also tested the Plus 4's ability to print with pure polycarbonate, arguably one of the most difficult materials to print. I started simple with parts like the ham radio wire spool handle shown below. I used a 300-degree-C nozzle temperature, with a 100-degree heated bed and a 65-degree heated chamber for a perfect first-time print, with the Magigoo PA bed glue wiped on first. (I was sure to dry the roll completely first in my Sunlu filament dryer box.) I’ve also tested carbon-fiber nylon, with the exact same results. This time, I designed a dry-erase marker holder for my whiteboard, completely overdoing it with the filament choice, but wanting to see if the parts would warp, and what the surfaces would look like after the print completed. Once I had a database of the good settings for these different filaments, I started to lean on the Plus 4 for more everyday items and challenges. For example, I downloaded a replacement chicken feeder port that has saved me about 20 pounds of waste feed falling out of the container from the stock feed port: The new feeder port falls deeper into the crumbles, and the chickens were unable to scrape it out of boredom into the dirt around the feeder. That one print alone has saved me hundreds of dollars in feed, and the parts are in the sun all day, every day. Having access to these durable filaments lets me protect expensive gear as well. I made a set of rails for my portable ham radio that protect the nearly $1,200 radio and its sensitive knobs from bumps and bruises while in the field. The Plus 4 made easy work of the files, giving me way more peace of mind than ASA or even ABS would have given me with printers incapable of using these more durable materials. When that project finished, I of course had to print this ABS glass fiber holder for my Ryobi pressure washer wands and nozzles, just because I could.

Title: Cars, coffee and clothing are poised to get pricier with new tariffs

Americans are paying more for appliances, home furnishings, toys and shoes than they were a few months ago, and they could soon face higher prices on more goods as the Trump administration’s latest round of sharper tariffs kicks in. The newest round of duties took effect at midnight Thursday, lifting the average U.S. tariff rate to its highest level since the Great Depression. The move solidifies the president’s trade policy after months of negotiations, meaning more manufacturers and retailers are expected to begin raising prices in short order. “Tariffs have moved from being tentative to permanent — and that changes how American businesses are going to respond,” said Justin Wolfers, a professor of public policy and economics at the University of Michigan. “You’re going to start seeing higher prices as soon as businesses become convinced this will stick around, and that clock starts today.” The higher tariffs, which businesses — not countries — pay to the federal government to import goods, are as high as 50% for Brazil and India, but just 15% for the European Union and Japan. For consumers, that escalation is expected to result in higher prices, costing households an average of $2,400 per year, according to estimates from the Budget Lab at Yale University. Americans are likely to face large markups on clothing in the coming months, including a 39% increase in prices for leather shoes and bags, and a 37% rise in clothing costs, the research center found. Even after long-run supply chain adjustments and buying shifts, those prices could remain elevated by nearly 20%. Food prices, meanwhile, could rise more than 3%, while fresh produce could become 7% more expensive as a result of the Trump administration’s tariffs, the Budget Lab found. The center also expects cars — which often rely on components from several different countries — to get 12% more expensive, adding $6,000 to the price of an average new vehicle. Although businesses have so far absorbed the brunt of new tariffs, by covering higher costs themselves or relying on earlier stockpiles of inventory to keep them going, that is quickly changing. Major retailers, including Costco, Williams-Sonoma and Target, that loaded up on products earlier in the year are beginning to deplete those reserves, analysts say. “Consumers are going to pay, starting with their morning coffee,” said Robert Blecker, an economics professor at American University, referring to the 50% tariff on coffee from Brazil. “Although it does seem a lot of firms have been eating some of the tariffs by shaving their profit margins and holding the line on prices, that can’t go on forever.” Walmart, the country’s largest retailer, has begun marking up baby gear, kitchenware and toys. Nike is raising prices on some of its shoes, and many others are beginning to warn consumers that price increases are around the corner. Procter &amp; Gamble, the maker of Tide laundry detergent, Pampers diapers and Oral-B toothbrushes, said it would start raising prices in August on some products by about 2.5% to help offset $1 billion in tariff costs this year. Sharon Azula, who owns a company that sells plush toys and books, had enough inventory to fill orders through much of this year. But now she is preparing to stock up for the holidays, which means she will have to pay an extra 30% on merchandise from China, translating to markups for customers. Adding to the uncertainty: Ongoing trade talks between the U.S. and China. “We know we’re going to have to raise our prices at some point,” said Azula, who founded the Tooth Brigade with her husband in 2019. “If our $16 plush suddenly costs more than $20, are consumers still going to buy it? We can’t pay for the increase ourselves, but we also don’t know if we can keep moving forward with our business.” The toy industry, which imports more than 75% of its products from China, has been among the first to pass on higher costs from the president’s trade war. Toy prices rose by 3.2% between April and June, far outpacing overall inflation of 0.4% in that period, federal data shows. The president says higher tariffs are needed to combat other countries’ unfair trade practices, which have hollowed out American manufacturing and cost millions of factory workers their jobs. By erecting new barriers to foreign products, Trump aims to promote domestic manufacturing while ushering in what he calls a new “Golden Age.” Yet, for products like toys, moving manufacturing out of China is not realistic, said Greg Ahearn, president and chief executive of the Toy Association, a trade group. Not only is labor cheaper in China, but for decades, the country also has built up an infrastructure of “manufacturing expertise and the ethical manufacturing process at the factories,” he said. Everything from final packaging to materials such as springs, motors and plastic parts “can’t be replicated here in the U.S.” An analysis of recent prices from the country’s four largest retailers shows that goods from China have gotten roughly 4% costlier since the Trump administration’s first tariffs took hold this year, according to Alberto Cavallo, a professor at Harvard Business School and co-director of its Pricing Lab. He expects those costs to be up about 10 percent by the end of the year. Americans now face an overall average effective tariff rate of 18.6%, the highest since 1933, according to calculations from the Budget Lab. “We had 2 to 3% average tariffs at the beginning of this year,” said Şebnem Kalemli-Özcan, an economics professor at Brown University. “It is foolish to think there isn’t going to be any economic impact, or that this is going to be all pink and rosy for the American people.” Economists are just beginning to understand how new trade policies are affecting prices, consumer demand and business decisions across the country. The latest data points to slowing economic growth in the first half of the year, as well as pullbacks in business spending, hiring and investment. Households, too, are holding tight as they wait to see how things unfold. Still, inflationary effects have so far been limited to specific categories and have yet to translate to higher across-the-board prices for many families. Some of the administration’s most dramatic proposals, including tariffs of 100% on chips and semiconductors, and up to 145% on Chinese imports, are still in the air. Carmakers have so far shouldered much of import costs themselves instead of passing them onto consumers. General Motors last month said tariffs had cost the company more than $1 billion in the latest quarter, cutting into its profit margins and prompting the company to move some operations to the United States. The cost of a new vehicle in June rose 1.2% year-over-year to $48,907, below the average 10-year increase of 3.9 percent, according to Kelley Blue Book. But the new round of tariffs is expected to make cars pricier, especially those assembled in Mexico and Japan. Consumers will pay an extra 9%, or $3,010, for cars assembled in Japan, including for some Toyota models, such as the Prius and the 4Runner, according to Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive. Cars assembled in Mexico will see the highest price hikes — about 10 percent, or $3,550 — according to Cox. Those include the Honda Fit, the Chevrolet Equinox and the Ford Maverick. In upstate New York, gear manufacturer Gear Motions began raising prices to offset tariffs earlier this year. Although imports make up just 5% of the company’s business, trade uncertainty has complicated just about every part of the firm’s operations, President Dean Burrows said. The company’s gears are used in air compressors, superchargers and car transmissions. Anxious customers are buying less. And it has gotten harder to sell his U.S.-made products overseas; international inquiries have dried up by about 50%, he said, as buyers in other countries look for ways to bypass American manufacturers. “We’re a 140-year-old company and have survived many ups and downs, but the uncertainty right now is what’s unprecedented,” he said. “We have precision gears on the ocean, coming from Italy and I still don’t know whether I’ll have to pay a 15% tariff, or 27.5%. But either way, we have no choice: We’ll pay it, and we’ll pass it on.”

Title: Google Pixel 10 and its Qi2 magnets could be the perfect device to revive the magic of Moto Mods

While every leaked render and marketing tease for Google upcoming smartphone launch might make the Pixel 10 feel like a year-old rerun, the devil’s seemingly in the details. Even setting aside the usual round of software enhancements — only some of which have just begun to leak — it’s clear Google does have some hardware tricks up its sleeve Chief among them is native Qi2 support, which should bring support for magnetic chargers, wallets, stands, and much more to every device in the Pixel 10 lineup. If you’ve used anything newer than the iPhone 12 — or you’ve splurged for a MagSafe-compatible case for all sorts of Android devices — you already know how great magnetic-based accessories are. We’ve seen a handful of brands, including Samsung and OnePlus, dip their respective toes into the world of Qi2 support, but that sense of excitement is seriously dulled when you realize you need those cases for any of these tools to work. Aside from an outlier or two, the Pixel 10 lineup will be the first major Android device to include Qi2’s magnet array within the smartphone itself, with the only sacrifice being a minor (and in my eyes, worthwhile) increase in thickness. But I want more. See, Google’s decision to reuse the design language from last year’s Pixel 9 lineup comes with some added potential now that all four phones have embedded magnets hidden right below the surface: the chance to bring back an idea Motorola abandoned at the tail end of last decade. That’s right, Pixel fans — it’s time for Google to revive Moto Mods. Moto Mods, for those who don’t remember, arrived with the Moto Z in 2016. Motorola’s one-time flagship series had some pretty slick tricks up its sleeve, combining a shockingly slim chassis — even by today’s standards — with a magnetic accessory lineup. Unlike previous attempts to design a modular smartphone, Moto Mods were hot-swappable; while LG’s “Friends” required cracking open the battery compartment on the G5, Moto Mods were, in many ways, more like the MagSafe and Qi2 accessories we’ve come to know and love today. Really, the downfall of Moto Mods had nothing to do with how well they worked, but rather, the limitation of such a product lineup. Motorola only offered Mods on the Z-series, which saw several mainline and spin-off entries released from 2016 to 2019. Early excitement from the company — including the promise of a million dollar offer to the best third-party Mod developer — had fizzled out by 2018, resulting in layoffs from its Chicago-based team and the eventual death of the Z-series after its fourth-gen model. Frankly, Motorola was the wrong company to go about this. At the time, the company’s biggest success — both critically and commercially — was its budget-friendly G-series. Even after its split from Google, Motorola was making solid entry-level and midrange smartphones well before the Galaxy A-series and Pixel A-series stole its thunder. The Moto Z and its various follow-ups weren’t bad, but the focus on expensive accessories and the compromises from the magnetic modular system were apparent from the jump. But there were a lot of good ideas, especially with the Mods themselves. Hasselblad developed a point-and-shoot-esque camera system long before it would partner with OnePlus and Oppo on their respective phones, providing 10x zoom and a real flash. JBL made add-on speakers that ran circles around any built-in offerings at the time. Battery packs, game controllers, photo printers, and even a projector — Moto Mods produced a lot of cool concepts, even if the entire ecosystem never quite managed to go mainstream. And that’s to say nothing of Motorola’s “Style Shells,” which transformed the joys of Moto Maker into something you could do in your home. The Moto Z’s 5.2mm chassis could easily support additional material padded onto the back without feeling too bulky, eliminating the need for a case for plenty of users while delivering an early sense of those fashion-forward vibes the company would later adopt with the Moto Razr. If anything, I think Moto Mods’ inability to score any mainstream success really boils down to timing. The original Moto Z shipped a year before the iPhone X, Galaxy S8, and Pixel 2 XL all started to move towards taller, edge-to-edge panels, while Motorola found itself boxed into a design it promised to support for at least two additional generations. By the end of the Z-series, the company’s devices looked wildly dated next to practically any other smartphone on the market, to say nothing of the (fairly ugly) pogo pins that stuck out like a sore thumb whenever a Mod wasn’t in active use. A good idea poorly executed, in other words — and that’s exactly where Google can swoop in to pick up the pieces. The Pixel 10 lineup seems tailor-made for a Moto Mods-style reboot. Obviously it’s got built-in magnets, just like the original Moto Z had. It’s got a splashy, memorable name in “Pixelsnap,” one that should include various optional first-party accessories in addition to every third-party MagSafe/Qi2 accessory already on the market. And rather than starting with an entirely fresh smartphone series, Google appears to be building this support directly into its entire 2025 flagship lineup, practically guaranteeing far more attention than Moto Mods ever got. But for me, the biggest factor is the Pixel 10’s design. Leaks and teases alike show Google reusing last year’s design, complete with the same squared-off, protruding camera bump that is, when paired with magnets, surprisingly reminiscent of the Moto Z. That phone series used its large, circular camera bump to help hold accessories in place, something that could be easily recreated on the Pixel 10, 10 Pro, and 10 Pro XL. Google’s got plenty of new colors , but I’d love to see a series of first-party Style Shell-type add-ons to deliver just a bit more personalization. It seems, to me, like a match made in heaven. Still, I’m not going to pretend there aren’t some obvious shortcomings here, both compared to Moto Mods themselves and with how something similar would play with the Pixel 10. First, the design. The entire Pixel 10 series, like the Pixel 9 lineup before it, is pretty chunky. While adding on a magnetic backplate might not be that much bulkier than any random case off Amazon, it’s going to pale in comparison to a chassis so sleek, OEMs today are manufacturing “ultra-slim” phones that still can’t compete. A magnetic shell flush with the camera bar would make the entire device over 12mm thick, and that might be a touch too far for those of us who live a caseless lifestyle. Second, we don’t totally know how Pixelsnap works at the moment when pairing Pixel hardware with a magnetic accessory. MagSafe supports some communication between various accessories through NFC, but it’s a far cry from the pogo pin implementation on the Moto Z. Say what you will about its appearance, but there’s a reason pogo pins are still relied on for accessories like tablet keyboards to this very day. I think we can safely say some of the coolest Moto Mod accessories — projectors, game controllers, etc. — simply could not work just through a magnetic connection on its own. But that still leaves plenty of room for Google and third-party partners to really innovate on some excited accessories. Build a hybrid power bank-meets-Bluetooth speaker that aligns perfectly with the shape of either the Pixel 10 and 10 Pro or the Pixel 10 Pro XL. Design a wallet add-on that feels as though it’s part of the device’s design rather than awkwardly protruding from the back. Make a crazy slider QWERTY keyboard just because you can. Hell, even just Style Shell-like back covers would be a worthy endeavor in making the Pixel feel a little more customizable than in years past. While I doubt we’ll ever see Moto Mods come roaring back to life with the same sort of surprising capability, the Pixel 10 certainly feels like the right time to try. I’m struggling to see a reason here for Google to skip out on embracing some of Motorola’s best concepts from a decade ago in a more modern fashion. Not every accessories needs to be perfectly flush with the phone — we’ve seen that for years with MagSafe and Qi2-compliant battery banks. The opportunity is there, though, for both Google and other casemakers to lean heavily into some half-forgotten ideas from 2016. While I doubt we’ll ever see Moto Mods come roaring back to life with the same sort of surprising capability, the Pixel 10 certainly feels like the right time to try.

Title: Embattled Intel CEO calls out ‘misinformation’ after Trump demands he step down over alleged ties to Chinese military

Embattled Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan pushed back on “misinformation” over his alleged financial ties to China after President Trump called on him to resign over a potential conflict of interest. “I want to be absolutely clear: Over 40+ years in the industry, I’ve built relationships around the world and across our diverse ecosystem – and I have always operated within the highest legal and ethical standards,” Tan wrote in the letter to Intel staffers on Thursday. He went on to say that the company — which last year was awarded $8.5 billion under the Biden administration’s CHIPS Act — is working with the Trump administration to address the issues being raised. Tan has come under fire from both Trump and Sen. Tom Cotton, the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, over the Intel chief’s past investments in Chinese companies with ties to the Beijing and the military. In a post on his Truth Social platform Thursday morning, Trump wrote that Tan is “highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately.” That missive came a day after Cotton (R-Ark.) sent a letter to Intel Chairman Frank Yeary demanding answers about Tan’s financial dealings because he is concerned “about the security and integrity of Intel’s operations and its potential impact on US national security.” A Reuters report earlier this year claimed Tan invested at least $200 million across hundreds of Chinese firms – some with links to the military – between March 2012 and December 2024. Cotton also raised concerns over Tan’s tenure as CEO at Cadence Design, which last week agreed to pay more than $140 million to settle charges that it sold chips to a Chinese military institution, according to Reuters. In Tan’s memo Thursday, he said that Intel’s board is “fully supportive.” However, the beleaguered boss has been emroiled a power struggle with Intel’s board since taking over as CEO in March, sources familiar with the matter told the Wall Street Journal. The crux of the tensions revolves around whether Intel should continue to manufacture its own chips or exit the business entirely to cut down on costs, according to the report. While Tan has pushed to keep Intel’s own production in place, some board members, led by Yeary, are trying to spin off or sell the money-losing unit, sources said. Yeary has even held talks with Nvidia and Amazon about buying pieces of the business, and explored a potential sale to chipmaker TSMC, according to the Journal. Tan, who was born in Malaysia and grew up in Singapore, replaced ousted CEO Pat Gelsinger following dismal earnings and several rounds of layoffs.

CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Novo investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/novo-nordisk-a-s-lawsuit-submission-form-3?prid=160233&wire=3 NVO investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Novo during the relevant time frame, you have until September 30, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff.

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time The job market has begun looking shakier. How much is artificial intelligence to blame? Not a whole lot. At least not yet. A review of employment surveys, interviews with labor market analysts and recent company earnings reports shows little evidence, so far, that would support assertions of a widespread economic impact from AI’s growing usage. “It’s such an emotional thing for people, many of whom are determined to see it in the data,” said Martha Gimbel, executive director and co-founder of the Budget Lab at Yale University and a former President Joe Biden economic adviser. “And it’s just not there yet.” Much is riding on the payoff from AI. The stock market has been hitting record highs largely thanks to gains from tech giants like Nvidia, Google parent Alphabet, Facebook parent Meta and Microsoft, which have made enormous investments in pumping out AI-related products. For precisely that reason, analysts say, some businesses may be incentivized to hype AI’s potential as a disruptive force. Through the end of July, the term “AI” has been cited on about two-thirds of second-quarter earnings calls conducted by S&P 500 companies, according to the data provider Factset. That’s up from less than half in the first quarter. Amid a downshifting economy, cost pressures are mounting, prompting corporate leaders to hype AI’s potential as a savings source — even if it’s not quite there yet. “In 2023, you’d have a high-profile public company do a job cut and cite rising interest rates or uncertain macro conditions,” Roger Lee, a tech entrepreneur who also runs a website that tracks tech industry layoffs, said. ”Today, it’s AI.” The most extreme warning about AI’s short-term impact has come from Dario Amodei, co-founder and CEO of AI firm Anthropic. In May, he told Axios that he foresees half of all entry-level white-collar jobs being wiped out in the next one to five years, spiking unemployment to between 10% and 20%. So far, evidence for this scenario is mixed. All job openings, entry-level or otherwise, have been declining since 2023, according to labor market analytics company Revelio Labs, though the trend has not been linear. Revelio said entry-level jobs exposed to AI have been declining fastest — but senior roles exposed to AI have actually begun to recover. The broader picture for white-collar professions most at risk of disruption actually indicates fairly stable employment trends. Last week’s official jobs report showed office and administrative roles have actually returned to their pandemic-era highs, while employment in other professional sectors, like accounting and legal services, has held relatively steady. It’s a gloomier story in tech — but also a more nuanced one when it comes to AI’s impact. The leaders of Amazon and Microsoft have both signaled the ability to run their businesses with reduced headcount thanks to AI. Tech layoffs tracked by Lee’s website hit a three-month high in July, with three companies — Intel, Microsoft and Recruit Holdings, the parent of Indeed and Glassdoor — largely responsible. All three of those companies cited artificial intelligence as playing a role in the job reductions, Lee said. But he noted that in the case of Recruit Holdings, there were no specifics about how AI had impacted the lost positions. The company simply said the technology was “changing the world.” “It does seem like many of the roles being cut are in line with ones being used by AI,” Lee said. “But it’s still being used as a cover in other cases.” A representative for Recruit did not respond to a request for comment. The simple calculus behind AI is that businesses will be able to do more with less, increasing overall productivity while reducing hiring needs. Yet economists say it is difficult to calculate accurate changes in productivity over the short term — though so far, the broadest national measure has shown a deceleration in recent quarters. Most of the benefits of AI are instead accruing to consumers, not businesses, according to a forthcoming paper from researchers at Carnegie Mellon and Stanford University. If it feels like much of the value from the current generation of AI seems mostly to allow ordinary people to generate emails and papers faster, or do quicker research, you’re not imagining things. “Free goods are invisible in the GDP numbers, even if they make consumers better off,” the authors, Avinash Collis and Erik Brynjolfsson, wrote in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed. They calculate consumers derived the equivalent of $97 billion in surplus welfare from generative AI in 2024, compared with $7 billion in revenues logged by the tech firms actually creating AI products. Economies typically see a “J-curve” effect when transformative technologies are introduced, Collis told NBC News. At first there is a bottleneck that can cause some disruptions, though these initial effects are often not captured in official figures. For example, the iPhone increased the total global volume of photos from billions to trillions, something that directly impacted workers at camera giant Kodak, but created incalculable opportunities elsewhere, Collis said. “There will likely be a lot of impact, perhaps on some sectors negatively,” Collis said. “But at the same time lots of new jobs could be created as well.” Other indicators do suggest the stirrings of a more pronounced AI effect on jobs. The July employment survey from consultancy Challenger, Gray and Christmas found companies have blamed “automation and AI implementation” for 20,000 job cuts in 2025, with another 10,000 or so directly attributable to artificial intelligence. Challenger said this shows “a significant acceleration in AI-related restructuring.” Those figures are dwarfed by cuts related to government spending declines and general economic and market conditions, which account for nearly 500,000 lost roles this year, Challenger said. Some companies appear to be keeping payroll counts steady in response to the broad uncertainty in the economy, and using any additional resources to explore AI’s potential to boost their bottom lines. Stacy Spikes, CEO of MoviePass, told NBC News that internal workflows at his company become vastly more efficient thanks to AI. That’s made him more gun-shy about bringing on new workers into certain departments, like software. As of Tuesday, MoviePass’ careers page showed no open positions. “We haven’t seen headcount need to increase,” Spikes said. Businesses like MoviePass still appear to be the exception, however. Analysts at Goldman Sachs say only about 9% of all companies are regularly using new AI tools to produce goods or services. As a result, they see only limited effects at the moment. “When I look at the impact that AI has had on the overall labor market data so far, it looks pretty small to me,” Joseph Briggs, head of the global economics team at Goldman Sachs Research, said on a recent company podcast. Even for recent college grads, who have seen unemployment rates tick higher, “the anecdotes and the relationship that the anecdotes have to AI is often a little bit overstated,” Briggs said. JP Morgan analysts came to a similar conclusion, finding that, for now, its research “failed to find a significant impact on job growth.” But they cautioned that this could change at the next economic downturn. For white-collar workers, “we think that during the course of the next recession the speed and the breadth of the adoption of the AI tools and applications in the workplace might induce large scale displacement for occupations,” they said in a recent note to clients. Others remain more optimistic about the potential for new opportunities to overcome any negative effects. That’s how Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang sees it. As the head of an AI giant, he may also have reason to hype its potential — but his outlook is notably rosier than Anthropic’s Amodei’s. Huang told Axios last month that the technology would ultimately lead to more jobs, even if there are some redundancies elsewhere. “Everyone’s jobs will change,” he said. “Some jobs will be unnecessary. Some people will lose jobs. But many new jobs will be created. ... The world will be more productive.” Rob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: Meta reportedly acquires voice AI startup WaveForms

Time Published: 2025-08-08T19:18:59Z

UPDATED 15:18 EDT / AUGUST 08 2025 by Maria Deutscher Meta Platforms Inc. has reportedly acquired WaveForms AI Inc., a developer of artificial intelligence models optimized to understand speech. The Information broke the news on Thursday. It’s unclear how much Meta is paying for WaveForms. Last December, the startup raised $40 million at a $200 million valuation, which suggests the sale price was in the hundreds of millions of dollars. In recent months, Meta and other tech giants have paid significant premiums to recruit the staff of venture-backed AI startups. WaveForms was founded in 2024 by Alexis Conneau and Coralie Lemaitre. Conneau is a former OpenAI researcher who worked on GPT-4’s Voice Mode feature, which allows users to interact with the model using their voice. Lemaitre is a former Google LLC ad strategist. When WaveForms announced its $40 million funding round last year, Bloomberg reported that the company didn’t yet have a product. A blog post from investor Andreessen Horowitz, which led the round, stated that WaveForms was in the process of training an “end-to-end audio language model.” Processing speech historically required three different AI models. One transcribes the user’s speech into a text prompt, another generates a text-based response to the prompt and a third turns the response into speech. The Andreessen Horowitz blog post indicated that WaveForms’ technology allows one model to perform all three tasks, a potentially more efficient approach. The company also planned to equip its model with the ability to detect emotional cues in speech. The goal was to have the model adapt its output based on those cues. According to The Information, Conneau and Lemaitre have joined Meta as part of the acquisition. It’s unclear whether they will work at TBD Labs, the business unit that is leading the Facebook parent’s AI research efforts. The Wall Street Journal reported today that the unit is staffed by many of the researchers Meta has poached from OpenAI and Google in recent weeks. WaveForms is the second voice AI startup that Meta has acquired in the past month. It previously bought Play AI Inc., which developed a platform that can create voice AI agents for tasks such as processing customer support requests. The company raised $21 million prior to its sale. Meta reportedly told staffers in a memo that Play AI will help enhance its Meta AI chatbot’s voice features. Like ChatGPT, the chatbot provides support for voice commands. Additionally, Meta is developing a feature that allows Meta AI to translate speech in Instagram Reels videos. The WaveForms acquisition may also be part of the effort to improve the chatbot. Additionally, the technology and know-how that Meta is gaining through the deal may help enhance its Llama large language model series. Many of the algorithms in the lineup can process voice input. According to today’s Journal report, TBD Labs is working on a new Llama model known as Llama 4.5 and Llama 4.X internally. The research group is said to be focused on making Meta’s LLMs better at reasoning tasks. It’s unclear when the upcoming Llama model might launch or if it will be available under an open-source license like its predecessors.

AST SpaceMobile’s attempt to justify its use of the amateur radio band for its satellites has done little to assuage concerns from the ham radio community. “AST is again economical with the truth,” an amateur radio operator in Germany named Mario Lorenz wrote to the FCC on Friday. AST SpaceMobile wants to use the 430 to 440MHz bands outside the US to control and track its constellation of 248 satellites, which promise to beam cellular connectivity to smartphones across the globe. However, these bands have long been allocated to amateur radio operations, raising fears that AST’s operations will create widespread interference. On Tuesday, Texas-based AST defended using the radio band, telling the FCC that any radio interference should be minimal. It would use the 430 to 440MHz band for "very limited, non-routine" use, such as for “emergency operations when other frequency bands are unavailable." However, the amateur radio community says AST is already using those bands. On Friday, AMSAT-Deutschland sent a letter to the FCC that says amateur radio users have detected signals from AST’s satellites over the radio bands. “The claim is therefore either a misrepresentation or a deliberate falsehood,” AMSAT-Deutschland wrote. In particular, AST’s BlueWalker-3 satellite was spotted using the radio band up until July 23 as the amateur radio community began campaigning against the spectrum use. Ironically, AMSAT-Deutschland operates as a group devoted to the advancement of satellite communications, along with amateur radio satellites. In the letter, the group even noted: “We applaud AST SpaceMobile’s ambitious goals. However, innovation must not come at the expense of internationally recognized and community-supported amateur radio services.” AMSAT-Deutschland also tells PCMag the clash with AST has hit a nerve with the amateur radio community over concerns it could “set a precedent” if the FCC greenlights the company’s use of the 430 to 440MHz bands for satellite control. In addition, the group is worried that the FCC is “effectively shifting the resulting interference risks to other countries.” “If similar authorizations are granted to other commercial operators, the 430-440 MHz band could gradually become unusable for amateur radio. What is framed as ‘exceptional use’ today risks becoming the norm tomorrow — to the detriment of a long-standing and diverse community of amateur radio users,” the group said. “It also raises questions about AST’s technical maturity,” the group added. “Other large-scale satellite operators — such as SpaceX, with over 6,000 Starlink satellites in orbit — appear to manage TT&C (Telemetry, Tracking, and Command) functions without resorting to use of the amateur UHF band.” AST didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But the company submitted a third-party analysis to the FCC that claims to show the risk of interference to be “extremely unlikely” to amateur radio operations. However, Mario Lorenz, the amateur radio user who helped kick off the protest campaign, told the FCC on Friday that the third-party analysis was flawed. “Yet again, AST tries to get away with handing in only half the homework it was supposed to do,” Lorenz wrote. “Despite its title, the study addresses only a single scenario of interference in the AMATEUR RADIO SATELLITE service," not amateur radio use on the ground. The Bulgarian Federation of Radio Amateurs also told the FCC last month: “Even slight interference under these operating conditions can result in harmful interference as defined in (FCC regulations) 47 CFR §2.1, disrupting communications, damaging experimental data integrity, and jeopardizing control of amateur satellites.” PCMag.com is a leading authority on technology, delivering lab-based, independent reviews of the latest products and services.

Title: Apple's 'BlackBerry Moment'

Do you remember the BlackBerry? If you're younger than 30, you probably think I'm talking about the fruit. Nope. The BlackBerry was by far the most popular smartphone 20 years ago. Back in the mid-2000s, everyone used and loved its QWERTY keyboard and the ability to get emails instantly. Gasp! They were actually really cool. I loved mine, and I was late to trade it for a new device called the Apple iPhone. You may have heard of this one! BlackBerry was among the most valuable companies in the world and the pride of Canada, where it was founded. The stock peaked at more than $140 in May 2008, then plunged as consumers adopted the iPhone en masse over the ensuing years. BlackBerry shares trade at about $3.65 these days. That's epic value destruction of more than 97%. What went so wrong? BlackBerry had an amazingly profitable existing business. Competing with Apple would have meant throwing away this formula for success and probably cratering revenue and income. It's very hard for a public company to pivot radically like this. Shareholders don't like it — they want steadily growing income, not wild swings and big risky bets. So, BlackBerry stuck to its guns for a few years, and by the time it had to change, it was too late: Everyone was already addicted to their iPhones, not their "CrackBerries" (as BlackBerries used to be called). Apple won the mobile revolution, hands down. Its stock has risen more than 3,000% since May 2008, and is now worth $3.33 trillion. A new tech revolution has begun, though. Generative artificial intelligence is remaking the industry in radical ways, and there's concern among some on Wall Street that Apple could be facing its own "BlackBerry Moment" now. This catchy phrase was in the title of a new research note on Friday by Dan Ives, a tech analyst at Wedbush Securities. In a striking departure from his typically bullish tone, Ives issued a stark warning to Apple: Move aggressively into AI or risk becoming the next BlackBerry. While rivals such as OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon surge ahead in AI innovation, Ives said Apple is "on a park bench drinking lemonade," watching, rather than getting in the race. With 2.4 billion iOS devices and 1.5 billion iPhones in circulation, the company holds an unparalleled platform, but it risks squandering that lead without a bold AI play, Ives wrote. The analyst outlined three strategic imperatives for Apple to avoid a BlackBerry moment: When Apple fanboys get upset at their beloved company, it's time to pay close attention. The message is clear: Cupertino must stop watching the AI party from afar and start leading it. (I asked Apple for comment on all this on Friday. It didn't respond.)

Title: Stocks just broke through a key level that indicates a sell-off. Here's how much the S&P 500 will fall before you should buy, according to one strategist
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-outlook-technical-analysis-sp500-resistance-level-broken-2025-8
Time Published: 2025-08-08T16:38:05Z

The stock market flashed a key technical signal that suggests a pullback from all-time highs is on the way. That's according to Jonathan Krinsky, the managing director and chief market technician at BTIG, who thinks the S&P 500 is bound for a 5% pullback soon. The benchmark index just broke through a technical resistance level that suggests a retrenchment is likely, he said, speculating the index could fall to around 6,100 before investors have the opportunity to buy. The S&P 500 saw technical resistance, a price ceiling where sellers are likely to step in and cause a pullback, at around the 6,100 mark in late January, Krinsky said. That was several months before Trump announced his tariffs and drove a steep decline in equities. The index then dropped around 20% from its February peak through the sell-off in early April, before breaking past the key 6,100 level again in late June. "Typically, when you break through resistance, you do get a check back to kind of retest that support. And so we do think that's coming, into this August, September period," Krinsky said, speaking to CNBC this week. "We think you'll get an opportunity to buy around 6,100." There are a few signs that suggest that the stock market is looking vulnerable to a correction, Krinsky added. Here are some of the warning signs he sees: Krinsky pointed to potential vulnerabilities in consumer-facing sectors, like retail and transportation. The consumer discretionary sector of the S&P 500, for instance, has been among the worst-performing areas of the market so far this year. Consumer discretionary stocks in the S&P 500 are down 0.43% since January, one of the only areas of the broader index in the red this year. Other market pros have said they're eyeing weakness in consumer stocks, pointing to the impact of tariffs on inflation and consumer spending. "You're seeing some cracks under the surface," Krinsky said. Historically, semiconductor stocks have lagged behind software stocks in the late summer, Krinsky said, adding that he believed many names in the semiconductor space also looked vulnerable to him. Some chipmakers' second-quarter earnings have been weaker than expected. Advanced Micro Devices missed slightly on earnings estimates for the quarter, while Super Micro Computer missed slightly on earnings and revenue. "August tends to favor software over semis," Krinsky said, though he noted that Nvidia's earnings report, which is coming up at the end of the month, will remain a key influence over the sector's performance. Credit spreads, which are the difference between the yield demanded by investors to hold corporate bonds versus safer debt like US Treasurys, have remained tight this year. For markets, that's a good sign, as wider credit spreads mean investors think there's a higher risk to holding corporate debt over government bonds, and are demanding a higher yield. The ICE Bank of America US High Yield Index Option-Adjusted Spread hovered near 2.95% in the last week, near a historic low. But credit spreads could start to widen, which could be negative for equities, Krinsky said. He pointed to weak manufacturing employment data, which tends to be associated with wider credit spreads. "If we think that credit spreads are about as tight as they can get, they probably have a little bit of room to move wider. That also suggests some risk in the cyclical versus defensive trade," he added. Microsoft and Meta, two of the largest tech titans in the AI trade, reported "blowout" earnings for the second quarter, Krinsky said. But besides both stocks surging after reporting their results, investors haven't been buying more shares, he added. "We haven't seen buying enthusiasm post the print," Krinsky said. "That's the risk. We kind of got as good as it gets from some of those mega-cap earnings, and we just see a little bit of profit taking into the back half of the summer." Jump to

Title: What you need to know before investing in 2025: a guide to smart decisions in crypto market (experience guide)

Something unusual is happening in the crypto space before the next altcoin season. After a sharp correction in mid-August, momentum is once again shifting. We’ve been watching the cycles for years at global crypto news media. And based on what we’re seeing now, from politics, price patterns to presale activity to sentiment across the board, our specialists believe something is about to pop. It’s rare to see all the ingredients line up at once, but right now, we’re watching a setup that checks all the boxes. According to our team’s experience, this is the kind of setup that doesn’t come often and that every smart investor should consider… and when it does, it tends to leave a historical mark. Has 2025 delivered? Regulatory signals from US political figures like Donald Trump are turning crypto from speculation into strategy. The long-standing XRP vs. SEC case is finally tilting in XRP’s favor, with the token now appearing in official financial disclosures by companies like Flora Growth and Webus International. At the same time, pressure on Jerome Powell to cut interest rates is pushing liquidity back into the markets, reigniting appetite for risk-on assets like crypto. Ethereum is also finalizing critical Layer 2 updates, adding scalability and reducing costs, a major win for the altcoin space. As altcoin price prediction in 2025, one narrative keeps getting stronger: investors are no longer chasing hype only, they’re hunting real value. And tokens with utility, scalability, and story, according to our analysts, are the elements you need to know before investing. Elon Musk recently made waves again by updating his profile with a Pepe meme, reviving interest in frog-themed tokens. Michael Saylor continues to double down on Bitcoin, not as speculation, but as a financial reserve. These are not isolated events , they are public signals from people who shape markets. So the question is no longer “Is crypto here to stay?”. The better question might be: If you’re looking for the next potential breakout, the next story that holds together meme culture, utility, staking rewards, and a price so low it feels impossible , this is your moment to find it: The meme coin market reached a staggering $91 billion peak this July, igniting buzz about a potential meme supercycle. But here’s the twist: Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE), the two OG meme coins, may no longer be the names leading that charge. It’s not that they’ve failed , in fact, quite the opposite. They’ve become crypto’s version of blue-chip stocks: predictable, mainstream, and with most of their explosive upside behind them. Analysts still anticipate modest rallies , perhaps 2x to 5x , before the year’s end. But let’s be honest: you don’t buy Apple stock in 2025 expecting 100 x returns. Same logic applies here. The circulating supplies are massive. For investors seeking life-changing upside, the rocket ships have already left the launch pad. If you’re looking for the next Shiba, the next DOGE — the real underdog play — you need to find it where no one else is looking. Pepeto isn’t just another frog meme. It’s the spiritual reboot of PEPE, but this time, it comes with structure, substance, and real infrastructure to back it. The project has already attracted tens of thousands of holders, with over $5,860,439.25. At just $0.000000145, Pepeto is still in the stage SHIB and DOGE were when only insiders were watching and none of the investments guide were handed to smart investors. But not for long, this is our call: The token is about to list , and when it does, the price curve may never look back according to its utility and use case of the token. If it only hits the price of PEPE? That’s indeed over 100x potential. And it’s not just theory , here is why Pepeto has the elements to make it happen: If you’ve been waiting for the meme coin with real backbone, this is your moment. Pepeto isn’t just another frog-themed token riding hype, it’s a redemption play from one of the minds behind the original PEPE, built to correct what that project missed: value, infrastructure, and lasting potential. With a live demo exchange already shown to the public, staking that dwarf competitors with 252% rewards, and a presale price that’s still a fraction of a cent, Pepeto is entering the final presale hours before its price increase. The room for upside here isn’t just theoretical , it’s mathematically visible. Every cycle has its star: Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, PEPE. This time, it’s what’s early invetors call : the God Of Frogs – Pepeto. Ask yourself, how often do these chances come around? DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE all exploded because early believers took the leap. Now they’re the faces of a billion-dollar club. Pepeto stands at that same threshold , the kind of moment that only looks obvious in hindsight, or later in historical data. As crypto enters a meme supercycle, driven by regulatory momentum, ETH Layer 2 progress, altcoin rallies, and even Trump’s pro-crypto stance, Pepeto is positioned perfectly, not just to grow rapidly, but to stand still. If you missed SHIB at $0.00000001… you might not want to miss Pepeto now. To learn more about PEPETO, visit its website, Telegram, Instagram, and Twitter.

Title: These visa holders reveal a program that can transform lives — and quickly unravel them

Good morning. Still struggling to sell that Cybertruck? The US Air Force is looking to buy two to use as target practice. Don't worry, they need only be towable — they're blowing them up anyway. In today's big story, seven current and ex-employees at Google, Meta, Amazon, and more share the opportunities and anxieties of living on the H-1B visa. What's on deck: Markets: The US economy is inching toward a stagflation scenario — again. Tech: xAI's head lawyer is leaving the company to spend more time with his kids. Business: Trump is calling for Intel's CEO to resign. Crisis communications warned Intel to not stay quiet. But first, life on the H-1B visa. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. The H-1B visa is a gateway to the American dream — a chance for skilled immigrants to shape the future of US technology and innovation. That opportunity also comes with risk. One layoff and the clock starts ticking: 60 days to find a new employer, or leave the country. In any job market, that would be a daunting deadline. But in today's climate, where layoffs have swept the tech industry, it's a tight race against time. Some Americans can take solace in the hope that the market will rebound; for now, they're clinging to their desks. For H-1B holders, there's no waiting out the storm. No margin for error. 60 days, remember? Thanks to visa data from federal filings, we have a glimpse at what could be at stake financially: eye-popping salaries for top AI talent. Business Insider spoke to seven current or former H-1B recipients who moved from India and found work in Big Tech. Their stories, as told to BI, reveal a program that can transform lives — and quickly unravel them, too. "My life feels temporary in a lot of ways," said Surabhi Madan, a senior software engineer at Google. She said she faces challenges that her friends don't: "I'm anxious about making mistakes when I drive or file taxes. I don't volunteer because I'd have to contact my immigration lawyer to check that it wouldn't jeopardize anything." After six years at Twitter, Debpriya Seal was laid off and left with 60 days to find a new employer. "The market was tough. It was the last quarter of the year, when companies tend to slow hiring. I hoped I'd find a job in time, but I had to consider moving back to India. I started looking into selling my possessions on Facebook Marketplace." Debjit Saha, now the cofounder of a real estate startup in Buffalo, says the rules shape how he runs his own company. "As an H-1B holder, I have to be careful to only do the type of work outlined in my petition. Even though I'm the cofounder, I can't do things outside my remit as CTO, like marketing." Wendy's reports earnings. Hallam Bullock, senior editor, in London. Grace Lett, editor, in New York. Meghan Morris, bureau chief, in Singapore. Akin Oyedele, deputy editor, in New York.

Title: OpenAI debuts GPT-5 AI model, Trump calls for Intel CEO to resign, and IPOs keep popping

UPDATED 10:55 EDT / AUGUST 08 2025 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof AI continues to suck all the air and the dollars out of the room, with a flurry of new models and new fundings this week. It’s still a breakneck race in AI, as OpenAI, Anthropic and Google all released new models and agents. In particular, OpenAI debuted its GPT-5 flagship model, which combines the reasoning abilities of its o-series with the faster responses of its GPT series. CEO Sam Altman (pictured) played his best Steve Jobs imitation in the more than hourlong presentation, except for the lack of a turtleneck. You’re excused if you can’t keep up with all these models. OpenAI’s biggest challenge actually won’t be fellow foundation model makers but the likes of JPMorgan, whose data holds the real value for the future of AI — so explain Dave Vellante and George Gilbert in their latest Breaking Analysis. Investors don’t seem to be thinking that far ahead, though, as OpenAI’s reported talks on its latest stock sale carrying a $500 billion valuation for the company keep upping the need to execute perfectly to grow into it. Lots of cybersecurity companies took this week’s Black Hat USA conference as an opportunity to announce new products, including Palo Alto Networks, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Microsoft, and SentinelOne chose this week to announce it’s buying Prompt Security. Overall, though, AI was the key theme, as researchers and companies gear up efforts to use AI to battle AI-driven attacks. Apple sucked up to Trump again and promised to invest an additional $100 billion into U.S. manufacturing. Fine as far as it goes (though that solid gold plaque presented to Trump seems wildly over the top, no?), but if you believe Trump when he says U.S. chipmaking will return soon and Apple will make the iPhone with all-American parts, well, I’ve got some 100% tariffs to sell you. And what’s with Trump’s demand that Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan step down? Just Trump being Trump, I guess? Tan says he’s “engaging” with Trump, so maybe this will blow over. It’s not as if Tan doesn’t have a few other things to deal with. The drumbeat of initial public offerings continued this week with Firefly Aerospace debuting with a 34% pop over its initial offering price. Cryptocurrency exchange Bullish also filed. It was a decidedly mixed bag for enterprise tech earnings this week, as Palantir, Digital Ocean, Arista, Extreme Networks and others outperformed, but AMD, Supermicro, Kyndryl and others disappointed. Next week’s earnings include Cisco, CoreWeave and Applied Materials. Here’s all the news and analysis in enterprise and emerging tech from SiliconANGLE, theCUBE Research and beyond: How Jamie Dimon becomes Sam Altman’s biggest competitor The era of physical AI is at

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Despite considerable growth in both revenue and profits, Amazon’s stock (NASDAQ: AMZN) performance has raised concerns among investors due to a mix of slowing growth in its vital cloud division, fierce competition in artificial intelligence (AI), a high valuation, and overarching economic pressures. Over the past four years, Amazon has increased its revenue by $200 billion and $37 billion in net profit, with profits rising by 112% thanks to improving margins. However, during the same timeframe, its stock has only seen a 33% increase, and its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has dropped by 34%. In 2021, Amazon’s valuation multiple stood at 51 times earnings, signaling high expectations for future growth. Now, with a reduced multiple of 34x trailing earnings, investors are questioning whether this valuation remains justified, particularly as growth expectations are being moderated. Now, we also have a contrasting scenario on Amazon Stock: Path To 2x Growth. Indeed, we believe that this wide range of upside and downside possibilities underscores a fundamental reality: AMZN is a volatile stock. That being said, if you are looking for upside with less volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative — it has outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its launch. Additionally, see – The Trade Desk: Buy TTD Stock Now At $60? A variety of factors contribute to investor anxiety, presenting potential obstacles for Amazon’s stock. AWS has traditionally been Amazon’s main source of profit, with estimated adjusted EBITDA margins around 45%, compared to 15% for its North American operations and 11% for its international businesses. Any slowdown in this segment greatly influences the company's overall profitability and investor confidence. While Amazon’s Q2 AWS growth of 18% topped analyst projections, it lagged behind the growth rates of its primary rivals, Microsoft Azure (39%) and Google Cloud (32%). This gap is a significant reason for the stock's recent slump, as investors fear that AWS is losing its competitive edge in the key cloud market. Even a notable partnership with OpenAI has not fully alleviated these worries. The surge in AI has heightened demand for cloud services, yet some view Amazon as falling behind its competitors. Rivals like Microsoft and Google offer highly integrated AI solutions (like GPT and Gemini, respectively), which are often simpler for customers to adopt. Conversely, AWS’s approach frequently necessitates greater technical expertise from developers to combine various services. Wider economic factors present additional threats for Amazon: Amazon’s stock has shown volatility during previous market downturns, sometimes performing worse than the S&P 500 index. The substantial 55% drawdown in 2022 indicates that a significant drop from current levels is not unusual. This history of volatility, combined with a high stock price, leads to cautious investor sentiment. See – Buy or Sell AMZN Stock – for more details. To summarize, it also does not aid that AMZN stock remains expensive; it trades at nearly 34x trailing earnings. Certainly, the company’s revenue has increased significantly over recent years, growing at an average rate of about 11% over the last three years (compared to 5% for the S&P 500). However, this growth might diminish rapidly if the economy worsens and if the company fails to adequately seize its share of the AI cloud market. At existing multiples, even slight disappointments could prompt a disproportionate correction in the stock, as demonstrated by its performance following its positive Q2 results. The high valuation of AMZN stock could restrict its upside potential in the near to medium term. Alternatively, the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices), delivering strong returns for investors. Why is this the case? The quarterly rebalanced combination of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks has provided a responsive means to capitalize on favorable market conditions while limiting losses during downturns, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: The Real Cost of DEI Rollbacks in Customer Experience Strategy

CMSWire's Marketing & Customer Experience Leadership channel is the go-to hub for actionable research, editorial and opinion for CMOs, aspiring CMOs and today's customer experience innovators. Our dedicated editorial and research teams focus on bringing you the data and information you need to navigate today's complex customer, organizational and technical landscapes. We've got you covered. Our society finds itself at a critical juncture, particularly within the realm of marketing and customer experience. The nationwide boycott of McDonld's and Walmart—planned for August by The People's Union USA over the company's rollback of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives—exemplifies the complex challenges facing CMOs today. While DEI initiatives have demonstrably enhanced consumer relationships and internal operations, a growing wave of corporate rollbacks presents a complex paradox for marketing leaders. The challenge for IT and marketing leaders today is to understand not only the intrinsic value of DEI but also the tangible costs of its abandonment, and how to proactively champion inclusive practices amidst political and social pressures. And here in August, on National Black Business Month, there is no better time to foster this dialogue and help chief marketing officers develop some action steps amid rising political division and pressure on corporations to pull back. CMOs and CX leaders have a critical opportunity to lead with intention—making diversity and inclusion a core strategy for long-term growth and brand credibility. DEI initiatives are not merely social endeavors; they are powerful strategic tools that bolster the authenticity of customer experiences. A commitment to DEI creates a better understanding of customers, enabling businesses to empathize with and serve a diverse customer base effectively. This leads to more personalized service and stronger customer relationships, ultimately improving customer retention. A diverse customer experience team can also translate into better access to new markets, helping companies reach previously misunderstood areas. Inclusive strategies do more than drive social value — they deliver measurable impact across customer relationships, loyalty and retention. Beyond understanding, DEI enhances marketing effectiveness and customer trust. When marketing teams reflect diverse perspectives, they create campaigns that resonate authentically with varied customer segments rather than relying on generic messaging. This inclusive approach helps brands develop community-focused marketing that highlights genuine investment in local services and diverse suppliers. A diverse and inclusive workforce provides multiple perspectives on marketing campaigns, helping brands avoid distasteful messages that could make audiences feel excluded or mocked. Related Article: Building Customer Trust — Statistics in the US for 2025 DEI also reduces language barriers in customer service. Many companies in the U.S. primarily offer English support, excluding millions of potential customers. A diverse and inclusive workforce, including bilingual contact centers, allows customers to speak their native language, boosting retention and customer relationships by creating ease and streamlining the experience. Finally, a diverse and inclusive work environment offers additional opportunities for CX innovation. When staff feel appreciated and empowered, they bring a wider range of unique insights and perspectives to the table, leading to more innovative and effective services for customers. This diverse input makes problem-solving and brainstorming quicker and more effective, helping organizations stay ahead in providing personalized customer experiences. Despite these clear benefits, many major companies and organizations have recently scaled back, renamed, or eliminated their DEI programs. President Donald Trump signed two executive orders this year — Executive Orders 14151 and 14173, on Jan. 20 and Jan. 21, respectively — that eliminated DEI programs within government agencies and contractor projects. This created an antagonistic environment, forcing corporations and universities to adjust or eliminate long-standing programs in an appeasement effort. But as companies altered their programs, they found that those decisions carry significant financial and reputational risks for brands, as Target's recent experience starkly demonstrates. Boycotts can be effective for social change, such as the 1960 Greensboro sit-ins during the Civil Rights era, where students refused to leave a Woolworth lunch counter in Greensboro, NC. Yet only recently have boycotts proven to be influential on the consumer’s decision to purchase. The internet era, which has allowed consumers to interact with retailers and brands more frequently, has altered how messaging is managed, especially for brands built on inclusion. When companies pull back on DEI, they risk alienating a significant portion of their consumer base. A 2022 Harris report commissioned by Google found that 82% of consumers “would prefer a consumer brand’s values to align with their own”. Another 75% of respondents reported parting ways with a brand over a conflict in values. This reflects a personal connection consumers have to brands, with a shifting number of people seeing themselves directly affected and taking action based on their identity and support for causes. Related Article: Double up on DEI: The Real Impact on Customer Experience Recent data highlights the financial and reputational damage that can result when brands pull back from diversity and inclusion efforts. Target's experience serves as a cautionary tale: the company missed analyst sales expectations by nearly half a billion dollars in Q1 2025, with net sales falling nearly 3% to $23.8 billion, down from $24.5 billion in Q1 2024. Foot traffic declined 5.7% year-over-year, and for 10 consecutive weeks following its DEI rollback announcement, Target experienced declining store traffic, down 9% year-over-year in February and 6.5% in March. The company's stock plummeted 12%, erasing billions in market value, while Target revised its sales projections downward, now expecting a "low single-digit decline" for fiscal 2025 instead of the previously forecast 1% growth. In contrast, Costco, which publicly defended and maintained its DEI commitments, saw its foot traffic rise 7% year-over-year during the same period. McDonald's now faces similar pressure, with The People's Union USA organizing a week-long boycott claiming the fast food giant went back on its promised investment in diversity initiatives. McDonald’s representatives acknowledge a change in some initiatives, including a supplier program. But they claim the changes will not minimize their commitment. The damage from DEI rollbacks extends beyond immediate sales figures. It results in eroding trust, diminished brand perception, and a weakening of emotional loyalty and long-term equity. As Valeria Piaggio, global head of sustainable growth and transformation at Kantar, notes in a Mediapost article on the rollbacks, marketers want to be "loved, trusted and believed in," and this emotional connection, which drives value, is "at risk." For brands like Target that spent years building a purpose-driven identity centered on inclusion, walking back these commitments "breaks the brand narrative" and "the consumer contract," causing the emotional foundation of the relationship to collapse. This volatility means even a "fringe boycott" can cause "outsized reputational harm." Moreover, CMOs must recognize the immense purchasing power of diverse consumer segments. Black consumers, according to Nielsen in its latest report, have an annual purchasing power expected to reach $2 trillion by 2026, up from $1.7 trillion in 2024. Organizations like the NAACP are responding to DEI cuts by empowering Black consumers to be intentional about where they spend their money, launching initiatives like the Black Consumer Advisory to highlight companies that promote diversity. According to eMarketer, a February Harris Poll cited by Axios revealed that 50% of Black consumers have recently stopped shopping at companies with differing political views, the highest among all demographics surveyed. Deprioritizing diversity can leave "significant growth on the table," doing a "disservice to shareholders." In an age characterized by political polarization and corporate appeasement, CMOs have a golden opportunity to proactively embrace actions that reinforce diversity and inclusion as a strategic imperative for sustained growth and brand integrity. The most effective way to understand a diverse customer base is to have a diverse team that reflects their backgrounds and experiences. CMOs should prioritize hiring individuals across all ethnicities, races, ages, abilities, religions, cultures, genders and sexual orientations. This diversity provides invaluable insights, leading to more personalized service and expanding access to new markets. Customers increasingly align with brands whose values resonate with their own. CMOs must ensure that their teams understand multiple perspectives, avoiding ad messaging that could be offensive. This commitment demonstrates genuine awareness and alignment with consumer priorities like community service and equity. Customers reward that commitment with their customer loyalty. E.l.f. Beauty, for instance, has leveraged its diverse employee base and loyal following of younger, diverse customers, featuring transgender and non-binary models. According to Black Enterprise, E.l.f. Beauty has seen its stock price increase by over 700% since 2020, building a loyal young customer base that trusts the brand. A significant portion of the population prefers customer service in their native language. CMOs should advocate for multilingual support in contact centers and digital channels, allowing customers to feel at ease and streamlining their experience. This proactive step not only boosts customer retention and relationships but also captures a broader market segment that may otherwise seek out competitors offering such support. DEI is about recognizing and valuing the unique experiences each individual brings. CMOs should cultivate a culture where all team members feel appreciated and empowered to share their thoughts and unique ideas. This inclusion leads to a wider range of insights, making problem-solving and brainstorming for customer experience initiatives quicker and more effective, ensuring the brand stays ahead of the curve. As data increasingly represents customer interactions from personalized recommendations to AI-generated models, CMOs must ensure that data modeling technologies apply ethical standards so that inclusion efforts do not begin to operate with the systematic approaches that were used for exclusion. One way is to advocate for "human-in-the-loop" protocols with AI. The protocol is valuable when AI is used to generate visual imagery. One example is the fashion models of various body types, ages, sizes and skin tones that Levi's is doing with Lalaland.ai. It is crucial that algorithms and datasets do not craft visualizations of people with negative social biases. Brands must ensure the design and deployment of algorithm-based systems avoid discriminatory outcomes. The current environment, marked by both a strong consumer preference for inclusive brands and political pressure against DEI, presents a unique challenge for CMOs. However, by understanding the proven benefits of DEI for CX, recognizing the costs of retreat and proactively implementing strategies that embrace diversity, CMOs can not only protect but also enhance their brand's perception, loyalty and long-term financial health. The true business risk lies not in maintaining DEI values but in retreating from them. Even a brand’s perceived retreat from ethics in the eyes of its customers leaves significant future opportunities for building customer trust and fostering great customer experiences on the table.

You won't want to start your day without it. By Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Crypto markets rallied in the past 24 hours, with the CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index rising 5.3% as fresh U.S. policy signals and regulatory clarity supported risk appetite across the sector. Bitcoin BTC$117,101.92 gained a relatively muted 1.3% to $116,500. The rally took off after President Donald Trump signed an executive order opening 401(k) retirement plans to a broader range of investments, including cryptocurrencies. The order directs the Department of Labor and Securities and Exchange Commission to publish new guidance for retirement accounts. “This move effectively opens access to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for retirement investors, unlocking a staggering $8.7 trillion in assets under management.,” James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, said in an emailed statement. Jake Ostrovskis, OTC trader at Wintermute, told CoinDesk that the impact of the move could not be understated. “Just a 2% allocation to Bitcoin and Ethereum would represent 1.5x the total cumulative ETF inflows to date, while a 3% allocation would more than double the entire market,” Ostrovskis said. “Critically, these would be largely price-insensitive buyers focused on meeting allocation benchmarks rather than tactical trading.“ In practice, that means 401(k) funds would create “sustained, predictable demand flows that could provide a structural bid for digital assets regardless of short-term price volatility,” Ostrovskis added. While crypto has never been formally banned from the retirement investments, previous guidance strongly discouraged fiduciaries from offering it. Meanwhile, the Ethereum blockchain hit a new record for average daily transactions this week, according to data from Dune Analytics. The increase was underpinned by the SEC's clarification earlier this week that certain liquid staking models don’t constitute securities under the 1933 Securities Act, making it safer for institutions to offer staking services. Ether's (ETH) price surged 4.6% over the past 24 hours to near $3,900. While fireworks were going off in the crypto sector, TradFi was more subdued. The S&P 500 dropped in Thursday’s session, and the Nasdaq closed 0.35% higher, furthering the concentration of megacaps in the indexes. The 10 largest stocks now account for 76% of the entire stock market capitalization, data shared by Barchart shows. Gold rose on tariffs being imposed on some bullion bars. Looking ahead, investors are bracing for July’s inflation report, due next week, which may influence the odds of a dovish Fed interest-rate cut in September. Stay alert!

Time Published: 2025-08-08T10:33:12Z

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / AUGUST 08 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last.

Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform.

Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers.

Episode 12 – Bill McDermott steps down from SAP – Commentary and Outlook. SAP pre-announced earnings with a beat and a raise, which acted as a heat shield for the surprise news that long-time CEO Bill McDermott is not renewing his contract. SAP is moving back to a dual-CEO model with a separate customer-facing and product/ops focus for each exec. SAP is strong financially but we believe faces significant technical integration challenges over the next decade, which may have played into McDermott’s and SAP’s decisions. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave Vellante shares recent spending data from ETR and lays out some of the challenges SAP faces going forward. Watch the full video analysis.

Episode 6 – Spending data from ETR shows that robotic process automation is gaining steam in mid-to-large enterprises – A race to improve productivity is driving companies to implement automation in the form of software robots. UiPath and Automation Anywhere show strong customer spending momentum. Blue Prism and other major players, while not showing the same growth, appear to be well-positioned. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave Vellante explains how this market is beginning to re-shape automation for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 5 – Spending data shows that cloud native databases are disrupting traditional analytic data stores. Snowflake and AWS RedShift stand out as having spending momentum based on ETR survey data – Some cloud native databases have been architected to enable storage and compute resources to be scaled independently. This not only improves economics but also drives increased agility and flexibility for many use cases. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave Vellante explains how this dynamic is eating into traditional enterprise data warehouse markets. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 4 – Storage Spending Outlook 2H ’19 – Pure Leads the Pack – The on-prem storage business has been hurt by: 1) the cloud siphoning away demand; and 2) a massive injection of flash storage that has given data center managers enough performance headroom to minimize the need to buy for performance reasons. Pure Storage is growing faster than the marketshare leaders but from a much smaller installed base. Watch the full video analysis.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / AUGUST 08 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / AUGUST 08 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 82 – Why Apple Could be the Key to Intel’s Future – The latest Arm Neoverse announcement further cements our opinion that its architecture, business model and ecosystem execution are defining a new era of computing; and leaving Intel in its dust. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explain why and how Apple could hold a key to saving Intel’s (and America’s) semiconductor industry leadership position. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 81 – A Digital Skills Gap Signals Rebound in IT Services Spend – Recent survey data from ETR shows that enterprise tech spending is tracking with projected U.S. GDP growth at 6% to 7% this year. Many markers continue to point the way to a strong recovery including hiring trends and the loosening of frozen IT project budgets. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR, who will share fresh data, perspectives and insights from the latest survey data.

Episode 79 – Moore’s Law is Accelerating and AI is Ready to Explode – Moore’s Law is dead right? Think again. While the historical annual CPU performance improvement of ~40% is slowing, the combination of CPUs packaged with alternative processors is improving at a rate of more than 100% per annum. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is going to unveil some data that suggests we’re entering a new era of innovation where inexpensive processing capabilities will power an explosion of machine intelligence applications. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 78 – Arm Lays Down the Gauntlet at Intel’s Feet – Exactly one week after Pat Gelsinger unveiled plans to reinvent Intel, Arm announced version 9 of its architecture and put forth its vision for the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years.

Title: Is Google TV in trouble? A new report reveals concerning details

August 8, 2025 Back in 2020, Google merged its Android TV and Chromecast efforts and launched a Google TV interface aimed at increasing discovery. While its focus to promote relevant content — basically based on your preferences and watch history from various streaming apps installed on the TV — has ramped up, Google has also worked hard to continuously inject ads to generate revenue streams other than licensing fees paid by TV manufacturers. However, the efforts do not seem to be working much in Google’s favor. As per a recent report by The Verge (paywalled), the tech giant, whose most significant revenue source is advertising, is struggling to make enough money from ads on the TV platform. The report says Google has spent millions of dollars on making the platform lucrative to advertisers, but has yet to make a profit on its investments. And with “costs exploding,” Google is forced to re-evaluate how much more it wants to invest. In a desperate attempt to generate more money from Google TV ads, it is renouncing control of ad slots and freely offering them to streaming service providers who publish their apps on the platform, in exchange for a commission. This approach goes against what other brands like Ruko and Vizio employ, where they reserve some of the ad slots, including those within the apps, and claim the entirety of the commission from those. Google appears to have now hit the panic button and is relinquishing control over those ad spaces, according to The Verge‘s report. Google’s nervousness can also be backed by its share in the North American smart TV market. While more than two-thirds of US households are estimated to own a smart TV, according to Park Associates, only about 10% of them use Android or Google TVs. The percentage is much higher worldwide, where about a quarter of new TVs are shipped with one of Google’s interfaces. However, that also accounts for an “operator tier,” which is highly customized by TV manufacturers or companies operating them, which takes away a significant portion of Google’s revenue. In the US, where Google can exert more control, the smart TV market is dominated by Samsung, LG, and Roku. Meanwhile, Amazon, which currently stands at about 5%, is increasing pressure on Google by engaging in aggressive retail placements. The Verge notes Amazon recently partnered with Hisense to launch smart TVs with its Fire TV OS — replacing Google TV from the brand’s previous lineup. Amazon is reportedly also incentivizing retail partners like Costco to sell its Fire OS-based Hisense TVs by offering “bounties” up to $50 per TV activated. Adding to the platform’s woes, Google TV’s ad revenue is seemingly being cannibalized by its cousin, YouTube. Notably, YouTube’s views on smart TVs have increased consistently over the years, and it currently makes up for 25% of the views that all streaming services receive in the US. As a result, Google’s sales teams are forced to prioritize it over the Google TV platform. This has also triggered budget cuts and layoffs in the Google TV team, as reported back in June. So, unlike Android, Google TV hasn’t given the tech giant the monopoly it was hoping for. But what does that say about the platform’s future? We aren’t quite sure yet, but it doesn’t look all bright and shiny for the team. For now, Google is looking at shorter-term partnerships with TV manufacturers, and uncertainty looms around Google TV’s future. While we hate the ads, we sure hope Google doesn’t give up on yet another service. It could, however, mean Google scales back its efforts and prioritizes other profitable avenues.

Title: Dogecoin Isn’t Done Yet – Grok’s Surprising Price Prediction & $MAXI Recommendation
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-price-prediction-grok-buy-maxi-doge/
Time Published: 2025-08-08T07:04:05Z
Full Content:
Dogecoin’s name is written in golden letters in meme coin lore. After all, it was the first major meme coin that really showed to the world that humor and finance can indeed blend, and blend beautifully, and that an investment opportunity doesn’t need to titillate a Harvard graduate’s intellect to be wildly profitable. Currently trading at $0.2202, $DOGE has climbed a chunky 27% over the past month. With a new altcoin bull run seemingly on the horizon, speculation is rife on whether this dog-themed token could turn back the clock and deliver mind-boggling rallies once again. To find out, we turned to Grok for Dogecoin’s price prediction for 2025 and beyond. Why Grok? Because it’s one of the best AI chatbots out there, and the only one directly integrated with X, the hub of pipping-hot crypto updates from both under-the-radar crypto wizards and mainstream industry voices. This gives Grok a unique ability to sweep the floor and piece together a sharper, more accurate narrative on what’s next for $DOGE. Keep reading to see why Grok thinks $DOGE could hit $0.50 (a bold call, to say the least) by the end of 2025, the forces driving it higher, and why buying a Doge-based presale meme coin like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) could be the best way to ride Doge’s next leg up. The biggest reason behind Grok’s bold $DOGE price prediction is that the token is sitting in a rare sweet spot where both fundamental and technical factors are flashing green. For starters, Dogecoin is preparing to integrate a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) verification system, which would allow transactions to be verified without revealing sensitive information, boosting both privacy and scalability. This kind of tech upgrade strengthens Dogecoin’s long-term credibility and makes it more attractive for mainstream adoption. Why is an ETF approval such a big deal? Because it would open the floodgates for institutional investors and everyday traders to buy $DOGE through regular brokerage accounts, potentially triggering a surge in demand and liquidity. On the daily chart, Dogecoin has just broken above the 10 and 20 EMAs with a fat green candle. Even better, this bounce is coming straight from the 0.5-0.618 Fibonacci zone (drawn from the $0.14287 low) – a ‘golden pocket.’ In simple words, this setup makes it highly likely that the bullish momentum will continue, potentially pushing $DOGE to $0.28746, i.e., the high of the Fib range. Even more interesting? The rebound is happening exactly at a long-standing upward trendline, the same one that kicked off a 400% price surge back in December 2024. If history repeats, $DOGE could be on track to blast through Grok’s $0.50 target and potentially even challenge its all-time highs. So, buying $DOGE now at just $0.2202 could potentially set you up for 100%+ gains in the coming months. Awesome, innit? After all, these are returns most investors would likely never see even in multiple years in stocks. However, in the wild world of crypto, the real moonshots come from looking for low-cap, low-priced tokens ready to ride a major wave. As for the Dogecoin wave, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) could be the next crypto to explode, with the potential to deliver 1000x gains once it hits the exchanges. Like all explode-worthy meme coins, Maxi Doge is built around a mascot with undeniable gravitas. A Shiba Inu dog with revenge in his eyes, protein shakes in his veins, and big, bulky muscles to intimidate every cutesy, wholesome mascot in the meme coin space, Maxi has the kind of presence that stops you in your tracks. Bold. Iconic. Impossible to ignore. But revenge from whom? Dogecoin, Maxi’s distant cousin. The one who hogged all the limelight at every family gathering, leaving poor little Maxi with a cocktail of insecurity, self-hatred, and loneliness. Determined to dethrone Dogecoin’s dominance, Maxi hit the gym and stared at candlestick charts all day, and all night. His reasoning? The crypto market never sleeps, so why should you? And that’s exactly the raw, untamed energy $MAXI embodies. A place with no rules to follow, no mould to fit into. Here, ‘gainz’ is the only religion, even if it takes 1000x leveraged YOLO bets to get there. While Maxi Doge is a meme coin through and through – meaning it doesn’t have any underlying value, utility, or rEvOlUtIoNaRy mission to sell you – holding $MAXI tokens unlocks a bunch of community benefits, including: Even better? Maxi Doge has reserved a chunky 40% of its total token supply for marketing. This will include influencer partnerships and gamified trading challenges. This shows how serious the devs are about $MAXI’s virality. Despite being one of the newest crypto presales on the market, Maxi Doge has already raked in an impressive $470K in early investor funding, proving that if you’ve got a viral idea, a loyal community, and hype, the money pours in fast. Right now, you can scoop up 1 $MAXI for just $0.000251. The easiest way to buy is through Best Wallet, where you can purchase from directly within the app. Alternatively, you can head to Maxi Doge’s official website, connect your crypto wallet, and buy from there. Learn all about this rage-fueled degen project in its whitepaper. And follow its X and Telegram to catch every update before the next pump. With Dogecoin poised for a 100%+ rally in the coming months, thanks to bullish price action, upcoming tech upgrades, and the looming possibility of an ETF approval, now’s the perfect time to back Doge-inspired, low-cap, high-upside meme coins like Maxi Doge ($MAXI).

Title: The Big Tech Visa: 7 current and former Big Tech employees share their H-1B visa stories
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/h-1b-visa-big-tech-immigration-green-card-2025-8
Time Published: 2025-08-08T04:05:01Z

The H-1B visa is a gateway to the American dream for skilled immigrants, but the path for some is paved with anxiety, guilt, and uncertainty. Big Tech companies like Amazon, Meta, Google and Apple are among those allocated the highest number of these visas annually. And they can pay top dollar — sometimes as much as $500,000 — to secure talent, H-1B data reviewed by Business Insider shows. The largest demographic of H-1B beneficiaries over the last decade has been Indian nationals working in computer-related roles, according to USCIS records. Business Insider spoke to seven current or former H-1B recipients who moved from India and found work in Big Tech. Their experiences reveal a program that grants access to life-changing opportunities and also imposes limitations that shape everything from career moves to family planning. Business Insider's review of H-1B filings reveals the salaries that Big Tech companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, and Meta are paying employees. See the salary data here. Tech layoffs, immigration policy shifts, and a booming Indian tech sector add to the daily pressure of living on this temporary visa in the United States. For some, high salaries and career opportunities make the precarity worth it; for others, doubt is creeping in. These are their stories, as told to Business Insider. Pushkar Singh, 31, is a staff engineer at Google, where he's worked in AI ads. He lives in California. The H-1B visa has allowed me to continue my work in the US, but the biggest issue is the psychological toll. I've been on an H-1B visa with Google for nearly seven years. My appetite for risk is lower because of my visa. Although you can switch jobs on an H-1B, you want to avoid moving to companies where there are high turnover rates to avoid getting fired. You've contributed so much in work and taxes, but if you're laid off, you only have 60 days to find a new job. You don't have the luxury of waiting for the economy to improve before getting back into the job market. I joined Google in Bangalore in 2015. I was interested in AI, but there weren't many opportunities in India. All the cutting-edge work was happening in Silicon Valley. In 2017, the company relocated me to work on the ads team in California on an L-1 visa, which is for internal company transfers. I wanted to switch to an H-1B visa to give me a bit more peace of mind because you can't really switch companies on an L-1. Google sponsored my petition, and I was selected in the H-1B lottery on the first attempt in 2018. I've helped develop cool technologies for Google Ads, like PMax, which helps small businesses use AI for their advertising. Alongside the psychological impact of being on an H-1B, there's also uncertainty around family. My wife and I have to be mindful about starting a family or moving our parents here. If I lost my job, I might have to take my entire family back to India within 60 days. I've seen misconceptions about the H-1B visa that it is replacing US jobs. Companies that hire a lot of H-1B workers have to give Americans fair opportunities for employment. I also get paid similarly to my US colleagues, so I don't think it's fair to say H-1B visa holders are cheap labor. I support the H-1B program but also think it can be improved. Having part of the application process take the person's achievements into account, like other visas such as the O-1 or EB-1, could mean that good people don't miss out. Surabhi Madan, 30, is a senior software engineer at Google. She lives in New York. I've been with Google for eight years and am a senior software engineer. Now I'm in a phase of my life where I'm thinking more about long-term stability. I enjoy my work, but there is an internal expectation to do well because, on an H-1B visa, my performance is the only thing in my hands. I've thought about teaching full- or part-time, but I can't have a secondary job on an H-1B. A career change also seems challenging: I would have to return to a student visa to get a graduate degree, and salaries for high school teachers may not meet the minimum requirement for work visas. I came to the US in 2013 to pursue a bachelor's at Brown. I interned at Google's New York office and landed a full-time offer before I graduated. I kicked off the process for my Optional Practical Training and received my H-1B visa in the lottery on my first try. Once, after returning to the US from traveling abroad, a border officer asked me about the purpose of my visit. I said, "I live here." The officer responded, "You don't live here; you work here." I remember thinking, "It's true." Even after more than a decade in the US, I have challenges that my friends don't. My life feels temporary in a lot of ways. I'm anxious about making mistakes when I drive or file taxes. I don't volunteer because I'd have to contact my immigration lawyer to check that it wouldn't jeopardize anything. Friends are buying apartments and thinking about having families. I find it hard to put down roots. Every time I renew my apartment lease, I have the option for one or two years. I always choose one year. My visa has become a consideration in family planning, too. I've looked into egg freezing recently. But I had this vision of having to return as a tourist with a suitcase to pick up my eggs if my status changed, and decided it wasn't worth it. I also can't imagine having another person depend on me while on a temporary status tied to my job. Once a year, I ask myself if this is still worth it. So far, the answer has been, "yes." Living in the US has granted me so many opportunities; I'm grateful. On the days I feel more anxious, I focus on the things in my control. I also have a decent financial cushion, another huge benefit of working in tech in the US for eight years. Debpriya Seal, 40, lives in California. He was laid off from Twitter in 2022, leaving him with 60 days to find a new employer to sponsor his visa and remain in the US, per the program's restrictions. In early November 2022, I got an email saying I'd been laid off. It was the worst season of my professional life. I came to the US for a master's degree in 2012 and joined Twitter in data engineering four years later. Twitter transferred my H-1B visa from my previous company and sponsored my green card application, which is still pending. Being laid off was emotional because I'd given six years to Twitter, but I didn't have much time to think about it. I had to find a new job before my visa ran out in 60 days. The aggressive timeline felt like I was running down the clock. It was a constant dilemma to try to be prepared enough for interviews in a time crunch. I looked for data and machine learning jobs, trying to get referrals from friends. I probably applied to around 50 companies overall. Requiring a visa sponsorship probably made things harder for me. The first thing I'd say when speaking with HR departments of potential employers is that I'd require sponsorship. When you apply to Big Tech companies like Facebook, Apple, or Amazon, this generally isn't an issue. During the application process, a few companies told me they couldn't sponsor H-1Bs. The market was tough. It was the last quarter of the year, when companies tend to slow hiring. I hoped I'd find a job in time, but I had to consider moving back to India. I started looking into selling my possessions on Facebook Marketplace. After roughly a month, I was offered a staff software engineer position at Intuit. They filed for my H-1B transfer. I was so relieved. I've since moved to a role at LinkedIn. Overall, my experience with the H-1B visa has mostly been positive. I can renew it and change companies relatively smoothly. There are just a few elements I'd say are unfair, like the fact that the lottery is basically a lucky draw, and the 60-day window if you get laid off. Soundarya Balasubramani, 29, is the founder and CEO of The Curious Maverick LLC. She divides her time between San Francisco and Bengaluru, India. I moved to the US on an F-1 visa to study at Columbia, then got a job at Salesforce, which sponsored my H-1B visa. Salesforce, where I was a product manager from 2019 to 2021, had a comprehensive internal process for sponsoring my H-1B. I uploaded my passport and degree certificates to a portal and was later I was told I'd been selected in the lottery. Big companies also often have in-house legal counsel or partner law firms to handle immigration processes for employees. In January 2023, I moved back to India to start a company focused on educational content and talent mobility. I felt I needed to move to become a founder. (My US work authorization meant I had to stay employed by the company that hired me.) Coming back to the US was always part of my plan. I applied for an O-1 visa, which is for "extraordinary individuals," with my own company sponsoring me. It was approved in 2023, and I moved back that October. Getting an O-1 is much harder than getting an H-1B. The visa is for people at the top of their fields, so the burden of proof is pretty high. I had to submit evidence, such as awards, publications, and recommendations. Although the American immigration system has problems, I can't imagine making the same kind of money anywhere else. My starting salary at Salesforce was $130,000, plus bonus and stocks. I could save aggressively and send money back home. People on H-1Bs ask me about starting a side project. They have ideas, but feel like they can't execute them because of immigration restrictions. India is booming, and I think people in the US are feeling a pull. They wonder if the green card backlog or constant fear of layoffs is worth it. Indians on H-1Bs get criticism from two sides. Some people make negative statements about there being too many Indians in the US tech space, but there are also Indians who'll say you're propagating brain drain from India. Debjit Saha, 38, is the cofounder and CTO of HomeAbroad Inc., a real estate company in Buffalo, New York. I started a company in the US as an H-1B visa holder. I have to follow the rules very carefully while running my business. I came to the US in 2013 on a student visa for a master's in computer science. After finishing my studies, I started a full-time software engineer role at Oracle, where I worked until June 2021. They sponsored my H-1B. While at Oracle, I had an idea for starting a business. My cofounder and I were discussing how immigrants struggle to get good mortgage rates because they lack credit history. We wanted to build a solution. I relied on my employer for my H-1B visa status and was cautious of not violating my immigration status. Attorneys I consulted told me I could invest in the business but couldn't run its day-to-day operations. My cofounder was the CEO while I continued working for Oracle. Eventually, I left the US in 2022 while our business, HomeAbroad, petitioned to transfer my H-1B. To transfer my visa, our company had to show that it could pay me a salary that matched what those in similar occupations in our area made. We're a bootstrapped company, so my cofounder and I invested our own money in the company as working capital. My salary was then paid through operational revenue. In 2023, I returned as the CTO. As an H-1 B holder, I have to be careful to only do the type of work outlined in my petition. Even though I'm the cofounder, I can't do things outside my remit as CTO, like marketing. It's a slippery slope, so it's always good to consult attorneys about whether you can take on a certain responsibility. I've been following recent immigration debates and have tried to have a fallback plan. I'm looking into the EB-1 green card pathway. The H-1B visa has helped me build a career in the US, and I feel fortunate to be building my company here. The Indian market is growing, but I think America is still the best place to get an education and enter the workforce. Vaashu Sharma is a senior software engineer at Airbnb, who moved from California to Bengaluru in November 2024. I did my bachelor's in India and moved to the US in 2016 to pursue a master's in computer science at Stony Brook University. After graduating, I landed a job at IBM. I got an offer from Meta a year later and worked there for four years. I was on a type of student work authorization called OPT for three years before I got my H-1B visa in my fourth attempt at the lottery. In 2022, I moved to Google for a new challenge. Two years later, I moved to Bengaluru. Being closer to my family and the culture I grew up with was my biggest reason to move home. I was tired of missing celebrations and festivals. I also felt Big Tech companies' presence had increased in India since I left. I saw positive changes in the products being built and salary potential. Visa challenges also made my husband and me want to move home. We fell into different cycles for our three-year H-1B visa renewals. While we were allowed to live and work in the US once our extension was approved, international travel became complicated. Once you leave the US on an old visa stamp, re-entry is only permitted with a renewed stamp. Post-pandemic, visa appointments were limited due to a significant backlog. Because it was so difficult to secure a slot in India to get new stamps, we weren't traveling back home. We missed important events and were scared that if we ever got bad news about our family in India, we couldn't be there. The H-1B also felt restrictive. We made good money and were growing our careers, but we couldn't pursue side hustles or take a career break. And the worry that we could be deported was always there. I landed a senior software engineer role at Airbnb in Bengaluru. Groceries can be delivered within 10 minutes, and we can afford to hire help with cooking and cleaning. The pros of living in India heavily outweigh the cons, like overcrowding or pollution. Sai Chiligireddy is an engineering manager at Amazon, where he works on Alexa. He lives in Seattle. I came to the US in 2014 to pursue a master's at Texas A&M University. I knew I could receive a longer period of student work authorization as a STEM major. Even if I didn't get an H-1B, I thought I'd have three years of solid work experience and could pay off any loans before moving back to India. After graduation, I worked for a year and a half at Juniper Networks. It was there, while trying for the H-1B lottery, that I heard about a Canadian visa program that gave applicants points based on their education, family ties, and work experience. I moved to Canada after landing a software engineer position at Amazon — and three failed attempts at getting an H-1B in the lottery. I loved my team in the Vancouver office, and the move boosted my career. But starting from scratch twice in five years was the most emotionally taxing thing I've ever done. I'm not an extrovert, so leaving my friends and family in the US and building new relationships was difficult. I got citizenship after living in Canada for three years. Shortly after, I moved back to Seattle because my H-1B application was pulled in the lottery on my fourth try. There are positives to living in the US as a Canadian citizen. I feel less restricted than my Indian friends, who need to get their visas stamped overseas and spend their vacation time waiting for embassy appointments. Canadians are eligible for the North American Free Trade Agreement professional or "TN" visa, which I can fall back on if there are changes to the H-1B. I still face challenges. The queue for green cards is based on the country of birth, and is exceptionally long for those born in India. I'm still on H-1B, and even though I have more leeway than others, I make sure that I am giving 100% or more at work and try to ensure that I'm always providing value to the company so my job is safe. My job would feel more like a job if I had a green card; now, it's what keeps me in the US. Representatives for the US Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Labor did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Title: Who Pays The Cloud Compute Bill?; AppLovin Bounces Back On Ads
URL: http://www.adexchanger.com/daily-news-roundup/friday-08082025/
Time Published: 2025-08-08T04:03:13Z
Full Content:
Your SaaS Is Grass The great AI pivot happening across business sectors right now – particularly in data-driven marketing – has led to a sudden, strange gap in the payment models of many SaaS and ad tech companies. The Information has some insider details on software companies, such as Replit and Anysphere, that cranked up revenue after launching successful generative AI coding agents in the past year or two. But even 12x growth in annual recurring revenue (i.e., SaaS earnings), as in Replit’s case, has proven insufficient. As of February, the company’s gross margins were an attractive 36% – but they’ve since dropped to negative 14% post-agentic launch, because Replit’s LLM bills are based on usage. And usage is through the roof. Earlier this week, AdExchanger reported on Zillow’s pilot test of “containerized RTB.” This is another example of vendors – here Index Exchange and Chalice – having to deal with cloud bandwidth costs that must be retrofitted into the CPM-based ad tech business model. Relatedly, LiveRamp CEO Scott Howe announced on the company’s earnings call earlier this week that it’s begun testing a new usage-based pricing model, currently in beta with 40 customers, based on its issuing of “fungible tokens across all products.” These tokens act like interchangeable units or credits that customers consume as they use LiveRamp’s services. AdLovin AppLovin has been on a rollercoaster ride since mid-February, when several anonymous investors and funds published critical reports and shorted the stock. Its share price dropped from $510 to $220 over just a couple of weeks. But AppLovin has mostly bounced back. Its shares now stand at $437 as of the end of trading Thursday. AppLovin was helped by its positive Q2, during which its ads business grew 77% to $1.26 billion. The company’s updated guidance calls for between 58% and 60% growth for the rest of the year, notes Eric Seufert at Mobile Dev Memo. There’s more, though. AppLovin also placed an important stake in the ground. CEO Adam Foroughi told investors that the company’s self-serve commerce advertising beta program – a product akin to Meta’s Advantage+ Shopping Campaigns and Google’s Performance Max – will open to all advertisers by the first half of 2026. That’s a big step, considering AppLovin has carefully limited its participants, which helped buoy campaign ROAS since there are fewer advertisers soaking up the demand. Something to watch out for: When AppLovin’s commerce media becomes an open program, achieving the same performance benchmarks will be much more difficult. Grok ’N’ Roll No CEO? No problem. While we’re at it, who needs a media buyer, strategist or account manager, either? According to Elon Musk, X certainly doesn’t. He says Grok will replace all three of them. Musk’s vision, as described during a live Spaces session on Wednesday, is that brands will eventually be able to outsource the entire process of creative production and optimization to Grok. Once advertisers upload their ads to Grok, Musk said, advertisers won’t need “to do anything at all.” His goal, Digiday surmises, is to get people “to buy directly from the app.” But buyers aren’t sold. During the Spaces, senior marketers from Lowe’s, Uber, SharkNinja and Kia tuned in to ask questions – and they specifically highlighted their brand safety concerns. But, hey, at least the ads will be, uh, pretty? Roman Grachev, who leads X’s ad engineering team (which exists apparently?) was present during the session and noted that Grok will assign an “aesthetic score” to all ads uploaded to the system. The ads that the AI model deems superior will have preferential ranking in the app. But Wait! There’s More! Magnite hints at future legal action against Google.

[The Guardian] Google and Perplexity are offering free one-year trials of their AI tools in India. [Rest of World] People weren’t thrilled when Duolingo announced it was going AI-first. Now, the language learning app is playing it safe and forgoing its notoriously “edgy” social media posts. [Business Insider] AI slop pages on Facebook are editing nature photos and trying to pass the new (anatomically inaccurate) versions off as their own work.
