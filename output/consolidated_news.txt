By MATT OTT, AP Business Writer WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. applications for unemployment benefits fell by 13,000 last week, remaining in the same historically healthy range of the past few years even as concerns grow about the health of the labor market. The number of Americans applying for jobless claims for the week ending Dec. 13 declined by 13,000 to 224,000 from the previous week’s 237,000, the Labor Department reported Thursday. That’s more than analysts’ forecast of 200,000 new applications. Applications for unemployment aid are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. Earlier this week, the government reported that the U.S. gained a decent 64,000 jobs in November but lost 105,000 in October as federal workers departed after cutbacks by the Trump administration. The unemployment rate rose to 4.6% last month, the highest since 2021. The November job gains were higher than the 40,000 economists had forecast. The October job losses were caused by a 162,000 drop in federal workers, many of whom resigned at the end of fiscal year 2025 on Sept. 30 under pressure from billionaire Elon Musk’s purge of U.S. government payrolls. Labor Department revisions also knocked 33,000 jobs off August and September payrolls. Hiring has clearly lost momentum, hobbled by uncertainty over President Donald Trump’s tariffs and the lingering effects of the high interest rates the Fed engineered in 2022 and 2023 to rein in an outburst of pandemic-induced inflation. Since March, job creation has fallen to an average 35,000 a month, compared to 71,000 in the year ended in March. Last week, the Federal Reserve trimmed its benchmark lending rate by a quarter-point, its third straight cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the committee reduced borrowing costs out of concern that the job market is even weaker than it appears. Powell said that recent job figures could be revised lower by as much as 60,000, which would mean employers have actually been shedding an average of about 25,000 jobs a month since the spring. Companies that have recently announced job cuts include UPS, General Motors, Amazon and Verizon, but those workforce reductions can take months to show up in the government’s data. The Labor Department’s report Thursday also showed that the four-week average of claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week volatility, rose by 500 to 217,500. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Dec. 6 rose by 67,000 to 1.9 million, the government said.

Glen Schofield has been on a roll with insights that are making waves in the video game industry of late. Known as the founder of Sledgehammer Games and Striking Distance Studios, Schofield opened up a can of worms when he detailed the “bittersweet” transformation of video game publishing juggernauts, Electronic Arts and Activision. Schofield spearheaded Dead Space at EA in 2008 and worked on its spiritual successor, The Callisto Protocol, before departing from Striking Distance earlier in 2023. In the LinkedIn post, he looked back on his decade-long tenure at both companies during their heydays. After the word came out about EA’s pivot into private ownership by Saudi Arabia’s PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners in a $55 billion deal, similar to Microsoft’s Activision Blizzard Acquisition, Schofield finally chimed in on the conversation on LinkedIn. Schofield drew parallels between the two companies and said, “In the span of just a few years, the two publishing giants who shaped the last 20+ years of our industry have both entered new eras.” Schofield expressed emotional turmoil, reflecting on his career at both studios, adding: I spent roughly a decade at each company, right in their primes. Watching them fade from their roles as dominant publishers and powerhouse training grounds hits harder than I expected. It’s not without reason that Schofield viewed EA and Activision as crucibles for talent. He further detailed: EA was buttoned-up, disciplined, and structured in a way that forced you to rise to the level of the room. Franchise reviews were intense, no shortcuts, no guessing. You had to know every inch of your game. And they’d challenge you, push you, test you. But when you walked out of that meeting, you knew exactly where you stood. Activision was a different playing field, he said, stating it was: Where review meetings were loud, passionate, borderline chaotic, with people calling out questions over one another. However, the questions were sharp, focused, and always aimed at making the game better. A one-hour meeting becoming two and a half was normal, and somehow, the time felt well spent. Schofield went down nostalgia lane, stating that both companies honed and bred a new generation of developers, but that time seems short-lived in light of recent acquisitions. He concluded the interview, stating: It’s tough to watch these companies step back from what they once were: major publishers, major developers, and incredible places to grow, learn, and sharpen your craft. They trained generations of us. Mine included. His comments come at a time when the industry as a whole is reeling from a series of layoffs as AI becomes a more prominent feature in titles, and game publishers and developers alike continue to chase profitability amid rising costs and increased competition. They provide unique insight into how developers view two of the most iconic game publishers in the industry, even amid continued volatility.

Title: Aptos introduces post-quantum signatures before they’re urgently needed
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/aptos-introduces-post-quantum-signatures-proposal
Time Published: 2025-12-18T16:40:32Z
Full Content:
Aptos has proposed an optional post-quantum signature scheme, citing long-term risks that advances in quantum computing could pose to existing cryptography. Blockchain network Aptos is moving toward a post-quantum signature option, reflecting growing concern that advances in quantum computing are no longer purely theoretical and could eventually affect how blockchain networks secure accounts and transactions. On Thursday, Aptos outlined a proposal to introduce post-quantum signatures, addressing the network’s reliance on digital signatures for ownership, transaction authorization and overall security. While existing cryptographic schemes remain secure against classical computers, researchers warn that sufficiently powerful quantum machines could one day forge them, potentially compromising account security retroactively. “Quantum computing is not a distant spectre anymore,” Aptos Labs wrote in a post on X, pointing to early discussions around quantum scaling by IBM and growing regulatory momentum, including the publication of post-quantum cryptography standards by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). “This matters for networks like Aptos because Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computers (CRQCs) can make today’s signature schemes forgeable, possibly breaking security models,” the post said. CRQCs are machines theoretically powerful enough to break today’s cryptography. In response, developers have proposed AIP-137, an Aptos Improvement Proposal authored by cryptographers at Aptos Labs, which would add support for a post-quantum signature scheme at the account level. If approved through governance, AIP-137 would introduce SLH-DSA, a hash-based digital signature scheme standardized as FIPS 205, as an optional account signature type. The change would make Aptos one of the earliest production blockchains to natively support post-quantum accounts. However, existing accounts would remain unaffected. Post-quantum accounts would be opt-in only, allowing users to adopt selectively. Aptos is one of the larger layer-1 proof-of-stake blockchains, designed primarily to support decentralized applications. Earlier this year, its head of ecosystem, Ash Pampati, told Cointelegraph that consumer-focused applications were gaining traction on the network, particularly those blending elements of Web2 and Web3. As Cointelegraph previously reported, Aptos has also emerged as a venue for tokenized real-world assets, with asset managers including Franklin Templeton and BlackRock deploying products on the network. Related: Google announces quantum advantage, 13,000 times faster than supercomputers While many in the crypto industry argue that quantum threats to blockchains, particularly Bitcoin, remain years away, networks are increasingly taking preparatory steps, with Aptos far from alone in doing so. Earlier this month, Solana tested quantum-resistant transactions on a dedicated testnet, an experiment aimed at evaluating how post-quantum signature schemes could be integrated into its transaction model without disrupting existing accounts. Within the Bitcoin community, a smaller but vocal group of developers, researchers and fund managers has also begun pushing for faster progress on quantum-resistant cryptography. Some have rallied around BIP-360, a proposed Bitcoin Improvement Proposal that would introduce quantum-resistant signature options. However, the idea remains in its early stages and is subject to debate. Others, including early Bitcoin figure Adam Back, have dismissed near-term quantum concerns as a form of fear, uncertainty and doubt, or FUD, arguing that Bitcoin does not rely on encryption for its core security model. Instead, Bitcoin uses digital signature schemes and cryptographic hash functions, which are not imminently threatened by practical quantum computers. Related: Are quantum computers stealing Bitcoin?

Title: OpenAI Could Start Using Amazon Chips. Time to Buy Amazon?

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © jetcityimage / iStock Editorial via Getty Images Just when you thought the circular dealmaking across the AI scene couldn’t pick up any more traction, news breaks that e-commerce and hyperscaler Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is chatting with OpenAI about a potential $10 billion investment and a deal to start using Amazon chips. Undoubtedly, you just had to think that it would just be a matter of time before Amazon’s AI chip efforts would produce something notable. While there aren’t a ton of details known about the potential deal, I do find it a bit strange that shares of Amazon aren’t taking off on the news. I guess investors have had enough of the circular dealmaking in AI. And with sentiment turning against OpenAI exposure, perhaps such an event would be viewed as more of a negative than a positive as gravitational forces in the tech sector pull valuations lower, especially among the heavier spenders in AI. Personally, I think such a deal could be a massive long-term win for Amazon, especially if its Tranium chip stacks up well against Google’s TPUs or even some of the GPUs out there. Either way, Amazon has been hard at work on its own chips, and it’s about time we see what they’re really capable of. As OpenAI opens its doors to using a multitude of AI innovations across the tech scene (maybe the OpenAI name is warranted, after all!), we’ll learn a bit more about the organic silicon innovations of the Magnificent Seven. And if OpenAI orders more of a specific chip, perhaps we’ll gain a better understanding of which custom silicon solution has the edge as the AI chip race gets a bit more interesting. Of course, GPUs will still be hot as ChatGPT and leading models lead the charge in frontier training. As more ASIC deals are announced, though, one has to think that more focus will shift away from the GPU makers. In any case, I do think Amazon stock is a fantastic bet, even before the OpenAI news broke this past week. If OpenAI inks a deal and starts using Amazon’s new Trainium chips, I think the bull case for shares of Amazon is that much stronger. At this juncture, I don’t see all too much AI chip upside baked into the valuation of the e-commerce juggernaut. In the meantime, investors seem a tad hesitant when it comes to the big AI spenders. With a new head of artificial general intelligence (AGI), Rohit Prasad, stepping in at Amazon, I think it’s about time that investors start getting more constructive with Amazon stock after a lackluster year of gains. Right now, Amazon stock goes for a very reasonable 31.4 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E). Given its AI prowess, the warehouse robotics opportunity, relationships with Anthropic and perhaps soon OpenAI, I find Amazon stock to be one of the more magnificent catch-up trades for AI investors who want some AI GARP (growth at a reasonable price) in a climate that could be far more punishing to the high-multiple AI plays, especially those that have lofty spending plans. An OpenAI deal might bring some of the jitters to Amazon stock, but in the long run, I think such a partnership is a massive plus for Amazon as it embarks on an AI journey that could bring forth a growth inflection point of sorts. I think Trainium and Inferentia are the real deal. And, in due time, I do think Amazon stock will be rewarded more appropriately, perhaps after a more cathartic correction in AI stocks.

Title: Valve Is Running Apple's Playbook in Reverse
URL: https://www.garbagecollected.dev/p/valve-the-reverse-apple
Time Published: 2025-12-18T15:45:42Z
Full Content:
In November 2025, Valve “unveiled” the Steam Machine – a living room PC designed to bring your Steam library to the TV. Gaming press covered it as news, but what was missing from the headlines was that this is actually Steam Machine 2.0. Valve already tried this a decade ago, and it flopped. So why try again? Thanks for reading Garbage Collected! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. Because Valve learned from that failure. They learned what Apple had figured out years earlier – hardware, software, and services need to, to quote Jobs, “just work” (2011 WWDC). This isn’t speculation. Take it from Valve co-founder Gabe Newell’s own thoughts on threats to PC gaming: The threat right now is that Apple has gained a huge amount of market share, and has a relatively obvious pathway towards entering the living room with their platform [...] I think Apple rolls the console guys really easily. The question is can we make enough progress in the PC space to establish ourselves there, and also figure out better ways of addressing mobile before Apple takes over the living room? (Talk at University of Texas’s LBJ School of Public Affairs, via Polygon in 2013) Newell wasn’t worried about Nintendo, PlayStation, or Xbox; he was worried about Apple, who weren’t even in gaming then (and still aren’t today). His solution? Run Apple’s playbook, but do it in reverse. To understand what Valve is doing, it helps to see the paths both companies took, and how they mirror each other. Apple’s path to becoming the modern corporate juggernaut that nobody saw coming even 20 years ago needs little introduction: Macs, to portable Macbooks, to portable music (iPods), to iPhones, to App Store, to Everything Else, each step further locking customers into the ecosystem through hardware that “just works”. Valve was founded by ex-Microsoft employees Gabe Newell and Mike Harrington in the late 90s following their frustration that, among other things, Microsoft was getting outflanked in gaming by startups with a better understanding of how to use the internet. As you might expect from a company with that origin, they started by making video games like Half-Life, Team Fortress, and Counter-Strike. Steam came in 2003, created for easy management of updates for their games over the Internet (what today would be called a “proprietary launcher”). What Valve soon realized, though, is that they could turn this “cost” into a source of revenue by making their solutions available to other developers, and so came the Steam Store and services (2005). Over time, they built on this, adding features like Managed Matchmaking and Cloud Saves before they took their first crack at hardware in 2015 with Steam Machine 1.0 (aka the Steam Box). The Steam Box… didn’t do so hot. We’ll get to that. After that, the important points in the timeline to note for this narrative are the release of the Steam Deck (a portable PC gaming device, perhaps most analogous in function to the Nintendo Switch) in 2022, and the instigator for today, the announcement of the Steam Machine (2.0) for 2026. For a snapshot of how Steam stands today: Regularly peaks at ~41MM concurrent users on weekends: https://store.steampowered.com/stats/stats/ Note: that’s concurrent users, not distinct users over the course of the weekend. As a global platform, it’s absolutely the case that distinct user count in a 24 hour time period is higher than that. While we don’t have any official recent Monthly Active User (MAU) numbers, Valve gave a figure of about 132 MM at the end of 2021. If we scale that using the ratio of peak concurrent users then vs now, that gives an estimate of ~200MM MAU (though this is very rough) A couple of contextual comparisons: Netflix has ~300 million subscribers, about 100 million of whom are on the ad-supported tier. Uber reported ~190 million MAPC (Monthly Active Platform Consumers, i.e. “people who took a ride or bought Uber Eats delivery”) for the most recent quarter. eBay has ~135 million “Active Buyers” (defined as an account that made a purchase in the last year). Many may be surprised to learn that the Steam Machine being released in 2026 is actually Steam Machine 2.0. Valve, for its part, seems to be tacitly trying to memory-hole the earlier model; essentially none of the messaging about the new release brings up the fiasco from a decade prior. However, it’s clear that Valve has internalized a lot of the failures from that affair: It’s a perceived truism in the games industry that platform exclusives drive platform adoption. While I think this is on the whole significantly overstated, and it seems like the industry itself might be coming around on that, it’s hard to deny that the fact that many major games just didn’t run on the original Steam Machine’s software could hardly be called a selling point: Probably the biggest issue holding back the Steam Machine at launch was the [...] fact they only run games that have Linux versions. Three of the platform’s biggest titles in recent years: The Witcher 3, Grand Theft Auto 5, and Metal Gear Solid V, still aren’t supported, which is a big problem for a machine aimed at gamers. (The Steam Machine: What Went Wrong | TechSpot, 2017) Even looking at the games that were supported, they performed worse on SteamOS than they did on Windows… which ties into the next point: Steam Link, launched in 2015, allowed owners of (sufficiently powerful) PCs to stream games to the TV over your (hopefully uncluttered) WiFi network at a lower price point. What did that mean? You had two options: Purchase a new machine that cost anywhere from $500 to thousands and hook it up to your TV; or Purchase a little stick for $50 and use the PC you probably already gamed on before all this as a local server for your games. You know, that PC running Windows, which apparently runs those games better anyway. Gosh, I wonder which one consumers would want? /s For this one, I’m just going to quote directly from another publication that ran a postmortem article on all this about a decade ago: “We started thinking, ‘Hey, you know, we’re actually creating a middle-tier niche for this at this point,’” says [Michael Hoang, marketing manager @ iBuyPower]. “You have your console, you have your PC gamers, we’re right in between. We’re right in the middle where no one can really claim which one this is. So now we’re creating a new demographic that has never been created, so we have to do everything from the ground up at this point. And it was very, very hard to convince people, well, do I want to be a PC gamer? Do I want to stick with just being console? Or this new thing in the middle. (What happened to Steam Machines? | PC Gamer, originally published 2017, re-published 2018) How does this compare to the situation in 2022 (with the Steam Deck) or 2026 (Machine 2.0)? On the back of years of testing/improvements and launch of the Steam Deck, the Proton gaming compatibility layer for Linux means even some brand new games can, out of the box, often “just work” on SteamOS without tuning. ProtonDB tracks compatibility, and counts 7000+ games that are verified to work as well or almost as well as on Windows, and when sorting games by popularity on Steam (i.e. the main platform), you have to pass more than 40 at time of writing before you get one that isn’t at least “Gold” rated. While the software still technically exists and is usable, the hardware is dead, and even the software has “better” open source alternatives that are recommended by the community as the go-to solutions (ref: Moonlight/Sunshine). This one is less clear; while (at time of writing) the pricing of Steam Machine 2.0 is not confirmed, it has been stated that it won’t be sold at a loss despite only having the hardware to be performance-competitive with current-gen consoles (which are sold at a loss, and so would be expected to be cheaper). At a glance, it seems like Valve is setting themselves up for the same “are we PC gamers, console gamers, or something in the middle” question all over again. However, there’s an argument to be made that, if the Steam Deck is the iPhone of gaming, then the Steam Machine is the iPad – an interoperable, friction-free extension of the software to a new form factor, built to fulfill a complementary purpose to the Deck. Moreover, “a slightly more expensive console” is an easier sell when you can also play your games on the go with the Steam Deck, in that (again) it centralizes your library. Returning to the earlier-mentioned PC Gamer post-mortem: What’s the best thing to come of iBuyPower’s SBX? The LED strip, says Hoang, which looked really nice. Now, taking a look at the Steam Machine store page: Jokes aside, I think Valve’s biggest takeaways from the debacle that was “Steam Machine 1.0” was that, for their vision of hardware to make sense as a customer purchase, it need to be smooth; they couldn’t just ship an MVP and build on it later, or rely on third-party partners specialized in hardware to build the rig while they made the software and hope that the two would meet in the middle. No, they needed to control the hardware, the software, the interface, the messaging, everything. They learned that it all needed to “just work, seamlessly”. The parallels aren’t only in their trajectories and ultimate product offerings, though. A deeper examination of what makes these companies unique and valuable reveals more similarities, which is perhaps unsurprising considering that they are both also very, very successful. Both Jobs and Newell view(ed) digital asset piracy as a problem of availability and convenience. Jobs: We believe that 80 percent of the people stealing stuff don’t want to be; there’s just no legal alternative. So we said, Let’s create a legal alternative to this. Everybody wins. Music companies win. The artists win. Apple wins. And the user wins because he gets a better service and doesn’t have to be a thief. (Esquire Magazine Interview, 2003) Newell: “We think there is a fundamental misconception about piracy. Piracy is almost always a service problem and not a pricing problem,” [Newell] said. “If a pirate offers a product anywhere in the world, 24 x 7, purchasable from the convenience of your personal computer, and the legal provider says the product is region-locked, will come to your country 3 months after the US release, and can only be purchased at a brick and mortar store, then the pirate’s service is more valuable.” (2011, proxied quote from The Cambridge Student via The Escapist; thanks to teddyh on HackerNews for digging up the archive link for TCS!) This take by Newell is borne out by results, as he goes on to explain: “Prior to entering the Russian market, we were told that Russia was a waste of time because everyone would pirate our products. Russia is now about to become [Steam’s] largest market in Europe,” Newell said. While Jobs is providing an optimistic view on people’s morals and Newell is looking more clinically at overall value like an economist, they both point at the same underlying idea, i.e. “users will pay for a good experience”. We return again to Jobs’s famous refrain of “it just works” – and customers will pay you when it does. When Steve Jobs died in 2011, people left flowers at Apple stores. When Gabe Newell so much as posts on Reddit, threads debating what happens to Steam without him rack up thousands of upvotes and comments. Both companies have fanbases that behave less like customers and more like congregations. Even after almost 15 years of Tim Cook at its head, when you think “Apple”, you think of the iconic image of Steve Jobs looking directly at the camera with his hand on his chin that became the cover of Walter Isaacson’s biography. Jobs’s ideas around design as the lodestone of product development, his relentless focus on the customer experience, his love for simplicity – all of these are written into Apple’s very DNA and are the exact things customers love about their products. While the general public might not recognize the name, Gabe Newell is the same in gaming circles. One need look no further than even reactions from those fans when Gabe Newell questions his own celebrity treatment. And just like Apple, this cult-like veneration extends to the company itself – despite having been almost 20 years since the last mainline entry in the Half-Life series, memes and (half-?)jokes about “Half-Life 3 when” have not died down, and when Valve announced a prequel VR game in the series due to release in 2020, the trailer racked up 10 million views in less than 24 hours… and, of course, prompted a fresh wave of “Half-Life 3 when?” This phenomenon of fandom cannot be viewed as anything but a competitive advantage. Both companies have audiences that will literally hold off on buying things in case their “preferred” creator might enter the space, and watch their every move like hawks to determine what to “get hype” for. Valve and Apple do differ in one major respect, however: Valve seems staunchly unwilling to pursue any explicit, strong lock-in. Unlike Apple hardware, the Steam Deck does not need to be jailbroken in any way, and Valve explicitly provides a guide for how to go outside their ecosystem (and potentially brick your very expensive game machine). The messaging for the Steam Machine 2.0 seems equally “free”: Yes, Steam Machine is optimized for gaming, but it’s still your PC. Install your own apps, or even another operating system. Who are we to tell you how to use your computer? (Steam Machine product page) A useful lens for understanding the dynamics at play when talking about Valve/Steam is that of Aggregation Theory. Aggregation Theory is a model and way of thinking about businesses enabled by the Internet and digitization, conceived and coined by Ben Thompson of Stratechery. Thompson labels “Aggregators” as businesses having three core characteristics: A Direct Relationship with Users Negligible Marginal Cost for Additional Users Demand-Driven Markets with Decreasing Acquisition Costs Is that a mouthful? Yes, and the big words hide a lot of complexity. For those who want to really understand it (something I encourage, as I think that a lot of both the successes and failures in recent times of tech companies, whether in product strategy or regulation, come from a misunderstanding of these dynamics), I’d encourage going to the source and spidering out to related, mentioned articles (Thompson does such a great job at linking between his pieces that I’m tempted to provide a quasi-TVTropes warning first): https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/ https://stratechery.com/2017/defining-aggregators/ However, for our purposes, I think we only need to engage with the concept at a high level. Consider AirBnB (which might not initially seem like an aggregator), an example Thompson himself brings up often. Homesharing wasn’t a new concept that sprung fully-formed from Brian Chesky’s forehead; couchsurfers and foreign exchange students engaged in it for decades. What AirBnB did was aggregate demand – they made it trivially easy to find a nice place to stay. Once enough travelers were searching on AirBnB, hosts “had to be there”. Once enough hosts were listed, why would travelers look elsewhere? The platform became the default not by being the only option, but by being the most convenient. In this regard, Steam works the same way. Steam is inarguably an aggregator, and arguably close to the platonic ideal of one: Direct Relationship with Users – As a customer, you make an account with Steam to activate products managed through it. While you don’t have to give them your payment information, it’s certainly more convenient to do so. It would almost require active commitment to avoid doing so: you’d have to exclusively buy game keys from other retailers, handle any and all in-game purchases directly with the game creators (if even possible), and deny yourself the ability to buy anything during the ever-rotating Steam Store sales that often feature deep discounts on a wide swath of games. Negligible Marginal Cost for Additional Users – Steam is a digital storefront, so yes. Additional users are just an O(1) addition of rows in a few database tables. And while Steam obviously incurs some transaction costs when users buy things, who doesn’t pay the gatekeepers of Visa and Mastercard? Demand-Driven with Decreasing Acquisition Costs – Steam is practically self-sustaining on both sides of its market. Customers not already on Steam are liable to wind up there by accident just buying a box copy of some game or another. That mass of users attracts developers, both small and large, even ones that left believing their fans would follow. As a platform, Steam is also increasing lock-in: SteamVR serves as the “platform” for VR development, driven by customer demand for Half-Life: Alyx, with the Steam Frame as the first-party platform (alongside already-existing VR hardware options like HTC Vive or Oculus Quest) The Steam Deck functions as the “iPhone for PC gaming” (direct quote from GabeN)... And now comes the Steam Machine to complete a “hardware trifecta” to mirror the iPad. All of these hardware offerings are undergirded by the self-lock-in of users who have a significant portion (sometimes a supermajority) of their gaming libraries in Steam, which is (currently) non-transferable (c.f. iTunes/App Store/iCloud) In this light, the parallels to Apple are hard not to see, but Apple “integrated forward” – they created great hardware that brought customers to them first, then slowly built the pretty walls around the garden users had entered, even as the garden itself expanded into new domains like mobile and watches. Valve, by contrast “integrated backward” – they created the ecosystem first, offering both customers and developers amenities like managed updates, cloud saves, mod hosting, and content distribution networks before creating their own first-party hardware that leverages all that work. A core contributor to the success of both Apple and Valve is that they both grew naturally (if in inverse directions): Apple went from PCs, to laptops, to portable music, to smartphones as a generalization of their learnings from ‘portable music’, and finally to the modern ecosystem of software & peripherals (watches, headphones, VR). Valve started in video games, then made a game launcher/update manager for their games, then offered that update management service to other developers with a storefront before finally getting to the hardware. At each step, both companies responded to real market demand and simply did a better job at capturing that demand through UX. You can even see the proof by contradiction: The Steam Machine 1.0 shows where they perhaps moved too early or chased illusory demand, and a similar story may be repeating itself with Apple Vision. It’s instructive to contrast this with Facebook’s “all-in” pivot to metaverse. At first blush, there are significant parallels to Valve, in that both Zuckerberg and Newell had built their fiefdoms in the lands of other empires and were trying to “escape their jailers”: Newell was trying to get out of “Windows 8 jail” and the potential that Microsoft might smother their business with expansion of the Xbox business. Zuckerberg wanted to leave the Apple/Google app platforms of iOS and Android, where their decisions around privacy could kneecap FB profits (ref: iOS’s App Tracking Transparency initiative), and run his own platform from which to derive value (or, being more cynical, collect rent). However, it’s hard to imagine a bigger gap in outcomes between the two. Looking at the result of Facebook’s metaverse efforts in December 2025: A stagnant Quest store/ecosystem 70 billion dollars in losses associated with the pivot 4 years invested for no meaningful revenue growth Planned 10-30% cuts to Metaverse Perhaps most depressingly, investors drove stock 3-5% higher following release of news, indicating they were also fed up with this nonsense. Why? Well, Zuckerberg’s big pivot was completely unbacked in demand, whether from customers or enterprises, to match the scale of the investment he decided to fling at it. Moreover, it had an at-best tenuous connection to the core competencies that Facebook had developed in scalable software, social networks, and advertising. Zuckerberg often talked about how everyone would interact with virtual avatars while on the go or in meetings across timezones or what have you, and how that tied into Facebook’s mission of connecting people, but as the saying goes: if you need to explain the joke, it isn’t funny. All of this analysis begs the question: What sayeth the crystal balls? If we’re looking at things as Aggregation Theorists, continued near-total monopoly is the obvious end result, absent significant developments: What is important to note is that in all of these examples there are strong winner-take-all effects. All of the examples I listed are not only capable of serving all consumers/users, but they also become better services the more consumers/users they serve — and they are all capable of serving every consumer/user on earth. (Aggregation Theory | Stratechery, 2015) Competition is difficult once a big aggregator has emerged, even for deep-pocketed incumbents. One need only look at famous examples like Yahoo or Bing vs Google, or Walmart vs Amazon. Epic Games already tries to offer competition in digital storefronts by leveraging the breakout success of Fortnite to launch their Epic Games Store, with a more generous revenue split for developers and the backing of Tencent to buy up store exclusives (even if timed only) by flinging money around. However, 7 years into the experiment, these terms don’t seem to have resulted in any significant upturning of the apple cart. Ben Thompson (of Stratechery) suggests that traditional platforms might offer an avenue by which competition can rise, looking at Shopify vis a vis Amazon. However, it’s unclear what “a platform approach” might look like as competition in the context of gaming here. Indeed, if you asked me what an extensible platform might look like in gaming, I’d say that Valve are, themselves, operating closer to a platform than a straightforward aggregator by making Proton/SteamOS free for other companies to use and potentially develop on top of (ref: Lenovo Legion Go S and ASUS ROG Ally as competitors to Steam Deck that can use Proton/SteamOS (though by default ship with Windows 11)). So, if the traditional mechanisms of the market find no purchase, might we look elsewhere? Antitrust is also hard, at least based on dominant US thought. Those who know me personally will know that I’ve long railed against Robert Bork’s consumer welfare standard for evaluating mergers and antitrust. I’m hardly the first or alone in this – perhaps most notably, former FTC Chair and current Mamdani transition team member Lina Khan first made her name penning “The Amazon Antitrust Paradox” as a direct refutation of Bork’s ideas. However, despite some recent small shifts suggesting that the climate may be changing, it remains the default standard, and considering that users specifically choose to go to the aggregators due to the benefits they offer (whether on price or quality), consumer welfare seems unlikely to find any justification for action. However, there are potential avenues in forced service interoperability and data portability. In short, the idea is that regulations can mandate that platforms of sufficient size have to allow other services to be able to integrate in some (perhaps standardized, limited) ways with the incumbent giants. This is an idea that’s already being trialed by the EU via the Digital Markets Act (DMA) for messaging (even despite some real and valid technical concerns), and it’s also being partially (voluntarily, seemingly) rolled out in music streaming apps (specifically between Apple Music and YouTube Music). While it’s early days, if these initial forays work without significant snags, it may embolden other legislatures to make similar moves that ultimately wind up hitting Steam, forcing it to cooperate with EGS in some way like allowing Steam users to take their validly purchased games to EGS if they want. Cory Doctorow’s pithy (if crude) term and model, which posits that platforms are eventually incentivized to ruin the experience for everyone on them in search of profit, might credibly be argued to be the end state of all platforms controlled by profit-seeking entities. And arguably, Steam has long since been “enshittified” in some regards. The deluge of games on the store that are approved for release without quality control has led to cheap, buggy messes or even outright malware finding their way onto customer machines. This is not a new problem, either, with industry analyst and pundit James Stephanie Sterling having coined the term “the asset flip” in 2015 to describe a problem that has only grown in scope since. However, while that criticism might hold water for some industry professionals, power-users, and gaming enthusiasts who want to find “hidden gems”, for the average consumer, Steam generally remains a good experience for discovery, purchase, and library management. Looking forward, as a private company that is majority owned by Gabe Newell himself, Valve is not as vulnerable to the kinds of short-term shareholder pressures that public companies or heavily venture-funded companies like Facebook/Bytedance face. While that alone is no guarantee, the combination of profitability, patient capital, and founder control may stave off the specter of enshittification for some time yet, at least while current leadership remains. That is, however, also why, as mentioned earlier, many fans fret about what might happen to Steam and Valve in the absence of GabeN. While it’s hard to say what direction technology might go in the future (who could’ve predicted in Oct 2022 that the US economy’s growth would hinge on LLMs?), there is one obvious avenue that may pose a threat: Cloud Gaming is only getting better. Surfaces like Xbox Cloud Gaming or Nvidia GeForce Now are currently only either technological solutions that allow access to existing libraries (e.g. Steam or EGS via Nvidia GeForce Now) or Netflix-esque “subscription packages” for pre-selected games. However, there’s no technological reason preventing these providers from attempting to fight with Steam as a digital storefront; Google Stadia already tried this in a form, and while that service was eventually shut down, there’s nothing to suggest that the idea itself is inherently unworkable. If these services want to become “the Uber for gaming”, a storefront may eventually be a necessity; many of these services already have experimented with messaging of “pay-as-you-go” for gaming hardware, gesturing at a future where you never have to worry about hardware compatibility or drivers because it “runs in the cloud”, all of which is reminiscent of the “you won’t need to own a car, a self-driving one will just come pick you up” vision pitched by Uber or Tesla in years past. If you were to ask me where things likely go from here, I’d say Valve will remain the much-beloved de facto king of PC gaming for the foreseeable future. This isn’t because they’re inherently more talented or virtuous, but because the factors for decay just aren’t there. They’re private, they’re profitable, and (if nothing else) they’re patient (Half-Life 3 when, GabeN?). There’s no strong incentive for them to enshittify. The parallel to Apple isn’t perfect, though; the companies have taken different directions in some aspects. The more open approach Valve has taken with Proton and SteamOS is perhaps the most obvious, and I personally consider that to be a strength, especially in the context of regulation. However, there are other differences as well, and the one that stands out to me is in social infrastructure. If I say “blue and green bubbles”, the direction I’m pointing at should become clear. Apple has leveraged their branding and dominant position (at least within the US) to elevate the iPhone to a status symbol, and in so doing has created network effects through iMessage and Facetime that further keeps their customers within their ecosystem in a way akin to traditional social networks (“I can’t leave Facebook; that’s how I keep in touch with my high school buddies!”). By contrast, while Steam does have chat and groups and forums and other social features, calling them “anemic” might be generous. When it comes to PC gaming, while most things make you think Valve and Steam, if you talk about social lock-in, it’s Discord that comes to mind, and that’s a chink in the fortress Valve has built. The question is, will social infrastructure be as critical in gaming platform lock-in as it has been to mobile? If Apple’s trajectory is any guide – iMessage didn’t seem critical until it revealed itself as one of their strongest moats – owning the social layer may matter more than is obvious today.

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily The university lauded him as "among the rare titans whose vision has reshaped not just business, but culture and society more broadly." WWD Editor, International HAILED BY YALE: Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, “embodies the rare combination of business acumen, strategic discipline, aesthetic sensitivity, moral courage, and cultural stewardship that defines history’s most influential leaders.” So said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management, as the university bestowed the French luxury titan with its Yale Legend in Leadership Award on Wednesday during its Yale CEO Summit in New York City. Related Articles Parties Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart and Chase Infiniti at the Golden Globes' First-time Nominees Luncheon Watches LVMH Watch Week Is Heading to Milan for 2026 Edition Arnault was nominated by past award winners and confirmed by Yale faculty members. You May Also Like The Legend in Leadership prize was established 35 years ago and has been awarded to the likes of Tim Cook, CEO of Apple; Larry Fink, chair and CEO of BlackRock; Doug McMillon, CEO of Walmart; Brian C. Cornell, chair and CEO of Target Corp., and Paul Polman, CEO of Unilever plc. Michael Burke, chairman and CEO of LVMH Americas, accepted the trophy on Arnault’s behalf from Ivanka Trump, Anna Wintour, and Stephen Schwarzman, chairman and CEO of Blackstone. The event was livestreamed on CNBC.com and Arnault delivered an acceptance speech in English via a live video link from Paris. “We are part of French history. Very often when I travel around the world, I feel myself like a kind of ambassador, not only a businessman,” Arnault related, given that his family-controlled luxury group is the steward of so many European heritage brands, from Christian Dior, Louis Vuitton and Givenchy to wine maker Château d’Yquem, whose origins date back to 1593. “I am proud that the group has built continuously, has grown continuously because we are showing something in the world for which the interest of people is constantly growing,” he added. Sonnenfeld described Arnault as “among the rare titans whose vision has reshaped not just business, but culture and society more broadly. His leadership illuminates the extraordinary possibilities that emerge when commercial imagination is paired with cultural vision, civic engagement, social impact, and long-term stewardship. “Under his stewardship, LVMH became the first European company to surpass a $500 billion valuation, transforming a constellation of independent, often family-run ‘maisons’ into a pioneering global powerhouse — without ever sacrificing their soul, heritage, or devotion to meticulous craftsmanship,” he continued. “As the architect of the modern luxury industry, he has shown that genuine leadership in this realm is not about excess but about excellence; not about exclusivity but about enduring cultural contribution.” Arnault has served as chairman and CEO of LVMH since 1989.

Title: World’s Richest Family Gets Much Richer

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Alice Walton and Jim Walton at... (CC BY 2.0) by Walmart The richest family in the world is the Walton family, by a large margin. They are the descendants of Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT) founder Sam Walton. Every year, Forbes and Bloomberg release a list of the richest families in the world. The estimates are easy for the wealth that is mostly held in public companies. Private company ownership and investments are harder to value accurately. Bloomberg puts the Walton figure at $513 billion across three generations. The second richest family is controlled by Al Nahyan of the United Arab Emirates, at $336 billion. The net worth of the Waltons is well below that of Elon Musk, who is the world’s richest person with a net worth of $632 billion. The Waltons and their foundations own 44% of Walmart, the world’s largest retailer. Walmart’s market cap is $922 billion, which makes it the 13th most valuable company in the world. Based on the math, the Waltons have other valuable holdings. For the most recent quarter, Walmart reported revenue of $180 billion, up 6% from the same quarter a year earlier. Earnings rose 35% to $0.77 per share. Walmart has 2.1 million employees around the world and more than 10,500 stores. The Waltons’ wealth increased over the past year. Walmart stock is up 21% over that period, compared to an 11% increase in the S&P 500. The Waltons are unusual among the mega-rich because they inherited their wealth. Most of the people at the top of the rich lists are founders or early employees. These include Elon Musk of Tesla, Larry Ellison of Oracle, Bill Gates of Microsoft, Jensen Huang of Nvidia, Mark Zuckerberg of Meta, and Larry Page and Sergey Brin of Alphabet. And, of course, Warren Buffett. The Waltons did not have to work as hard as the tech founders to get mega-rich.

Title: China Prepares to Wreck US AI Industry

Technology Sending You to Google News in 3 © JohanSjolander / E+ via Getty Images The math is simple. It starts with three facts. China has spent massive amounts to create very low-priced electricity at a rate several times the U.S. pace. It has built massive dams. The best example is the Motuo Hydropower Station on the Yarlung Tsangpo River in Tibet. No other nation could build a colossal project so fast. And China has extraordinary solar power supply. Do the large Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) companies pay for these? No. The central government largely does. China is a dictatorship, so things happen that way. Next, China creates a science project like the one America did when we built the atomic bomb. The nation’s best scientists all work on one project: chips that rival those made by Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA). Reuters calls it China’s Manhattan Project. The news service reports, “Chinese scientists have built what Washington has spent years trying to prevent: a prototype of a machine capable of producing the cutting-edge semiconductor chips that power artificial intelligence, smartphones and weapons central to Western military dominance.” Much of the tech seems to have been “stolen” from Western companies. Finally, China creates extremely advanced AI products, like those from Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and OpenAI, which it then dumps into the market. The latest versions include DeepSeek-V3.2, which anyone in the public can use, and DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale, which is more for tech business operations. Chen Fang, a Chinese engineer who worked on the project, said, “People thought DeepSeek gave a one-time breakthrough, but we came back much bigger,” according to VentureBeat. The Chinese could be lying, but experts with access to the DeepSeek products don’t think so. The Chinese can employ huge numbers of top experts to move forward even faster. There is no competition for talent like there is among America’s tech companies. No engineer in China is being paid $10 million to move from Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) to Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META). China won’t allow it. rodenkoff / iStock via Getty Images It takes three years to build a data center in the United States, especially for large hyperscale projects. Ask Elon Musk. U.S. data centers face a scarcity of electricity as builders attempt to bring data centers online quickly. Renewable energy has not scaled fast enough. This has forced America to return to coal generation. Environmental activists are trying to stop that. In the U.S. AI data center builders will need hundreds of billions of dollars to build out infrastructure. That capital has to be raised somewhere. Tech companies and financial players are cobbling it together. Companies like Microsoft and Meta do not have enough capital to cover these expenses themselves. Blue Owl Capital just walked away from helping to fund an Oracle Corp. (NYSE: ORCL) data center project. Money is fickle. Nearby residents and businesses oppose U.S. data centers. Data center power use can drive up electricity prices. The grid in some areas is too weak to supply the power. And politicians are starting to make electricity prices an issue. That can slow or kill data centers in some parts of the country. The Wall Street Journal recently wrote, “An escalating artificial intelligence race between China and the U.S. is drawing comparisons to the Cold War, and is likely to be just as consequential.” What happens to the valuation of Nvidia, Microsoft, OpenAI, and other sector leaders if China starts to pull ahead? It is similar to what people worry about with an AI bubble.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Drew Angerer/ Getty Images News via Getty Images Shares of Micron (NASDAQ: MU) are up about 14%, or by $31 this morning. All thanks to strong earnings. EPS of $4.78 beat by 82 cents. Revenue of $13.64 billion beat by $760 million. Moving forward, the company expects to earn between $8.22 and $8.62 per share, with revenue expected to be between $18.3 billion and $19.1 billion for the second quarter. Analysts were looking for $4.78 per share on revenue of $14.3 billion. “Our Q2 outlook reflects substantial records across revenue, gross margin, EPS, and free cash flow, and we anticipate our business performance to continue strengthening through fiscal 2026,” added Sanjay Mehrotra, Chairman, President, and CEO of Micron, as quoted in an earnings release. Fueling further upside, Micron says supply-demand issues could create a $100 billion high-bandwidth memory (HBM) market by 2028 – a milestone projected to arrive two years before the company’s previous outlook. Micron also declared a dividend of $0.115 per share, which is payable on January 14 to shareholders of record as of December 29. Shares of Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) took a massive hit after management warned of margin pressures. However, as I noted the other day, analysts at Morgan Stanley still expect AVGO to see strong growth moving forward. With an overweight rating on AVGO, Morgan Stanley has a $462 price target on AVGO. They also believe the latest pullback is an overreaction. Analysts at Bank of America have a $500 price target with a buy rating. Goldman Sachs has a $450 price target with a buy rating. UBS has a $472 price target with a buy rating. And Bernstein has a $475 price target with an outperform rating. This morning, AVGO is gaining lost ground after UBS added that it’s time to buy the dip. Technically, AVGO is severely oversold at $326.02. It’s also overextended on RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R. From its last traded price of $326.02, we’d like to see it rally back to $400. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) are up about 3%, or by $6 a share, in premarket. Analysts at Piper Sandler have an overweight rating on the stock with a price target of $280 a share. The analysts are bullish on the stock ahead of its Helios launch. Helios is a new, open, rack-scale AI platform designed for AI training and inference. Technically, AMD is also oversold on RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R. From its last traded price of $198.11, we’d like to see the tech giant soar back to $270 initially. Recent AMD earnings have also been solid. EPS OF $1.20 beat by three cents. Revenue of $9.25 billion, up 35.6% year over year, beat by $500 million. Moving forward, AMD expects fourth-quarter sales to be between $9.3 billion and $9.9 billion, with the mid-point of $9.6 billion above the $9.21 billion estimate. “Our record third quarter performance and strong fourth quarter guidance marks a clear step up in our growth trajectory as our expanding compute franchise and rapidly scaling data center AI business drive significant revenue and earnings growth,” said Dr. Lisa Su, AMD chair and CEO, as quoted in an earnings release.

Title: Why Is Bitcoin And Ethereum Prices Down Today? BlackRock Deposits Spark Worry

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. The Bitcoin and Ethereum prices are down today as the crypto market remains in a phase of extreme fear. This latest crash came amid BlackRock’s move, which sparked fear of a sell-off from the world’s largest asset manager. The Bitcoin and Ethereum prices are down today following BlackRock’s transfer of 2,257 BTC and 74,973 ETH to Coinbase, indicating plans to offload these coins. Notably, the BTC and ETH ETFs recorded outflows on December 16, likely why the asset manager moved these coins to redeem shares for its IBIT and ETHA ETFs, which were sold that day. These Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have continued to record mixed flows, which have partly contributed to declines in BTC and ETH prices. Notably, the Bitcoin price had surged to around $90,000 yesterday from an intraday low of around $87,000, before retracing below $87,000 about an hour later. This immediately sparked theories of manipulation, with some crypto pundits revealing that BlackRock wasn’t the only one selling. Related Reading: The Bearish Structure That Puts Bitcoin Price At $92,550, And Then $82,000 Crypto pundit Kruse claimed that Binance first bought nonstop for over 30 minutes to pump the price, then started dumping millions of BTC and ETH to liquidate longs. He noted that the Bitcoin price pumped about $3,300 in 30 minutes, with $106 million in shorts wiped out during that period. Following that, BTC printed another volatile hourly candle to the downside, which flushed out $52 million in longs. A similar price action had also played out for the Ethereum price. Kruse declared that this wasn’t random volatility but rather liquidity hunting. The pundit further warned that this is how leverage gets punished in crypto. He then reiterated that the volatile Bitcoin and Ethereum price actions weren’t random, indicating the market is being manipulated. Onchain Sleuth Tracer also accused Binance of being responsible for the Bitcoin and Ethereum price declines. He claimed that the crypto exchange pumped and dumped millions of BTC to liquidate traders, with $194 million in shorts and longs liquidated in one hour. Crypto asset manager Bitwise has predicted that the Bitcoin price will break the four-year cycle and set new all-time highs in 2026. The asset manager alluded to factors such as the Bitcoin halving and interest rate cycles as what will drive this rally for the flagship crypto. The firm also remarked that crypto booms and busts fueled by leverage are weaker than in past cycles. Bitwise also stated that institutions are likely to allocate more to Bitcoin ETFs, which is why they expect the Bitcoin price to reach new all-time highs next year. Furthermore, the firm noted that the pro-crypto regulatory shift will continue to allow companies to adopt crypto at a faster rate. The crypto asset manager also predicted that the Ethereum price could reach a new all-time high if the CLARITY Act passes.

Title: Experience Virtual Reality at a Discount With This Meta Quest 3S Holiday Deal

Our expert deal-hunting staff showcases the best price drops and discounts from reputable sellers daily. If you make a purchase using our links, CNET may earn a commission. CNET’s top budget VR headset is now at a great low price, plus you’ll score a free $50 Amazon gift card with purchase. The Meta Quest 3S is on sale now. The holiday season is officially here, offering a prime opportunity to save on a wide range of technology. While it’s always smart to stock up on essentials during a sale, the real value lies in year‑end discounts on premium electronics. If you’ve been waiting for the right moment to invest in the best virtual reality headset, these seasonal savings make right now the perfect time to buy. The Meta Quest 3S, already a fantastic value for the money, is on sale at Amazon. You can get the 128GB model or the 256GB model for up to $51 off, plus a $50 credit thrown in. New users also get one month of Xbox GamePass. At Amazon, the 128GB model is down to $250 with a $50 credit, effectively making it $200. The 256GB option includes Batman and is $50 off, bringing it down to $349. The Meta Quest 3S features an improved CPU and better graphics, making it a solid choice for gamers. It’s noticeably lighter than the previous Quest 2 and offers about three hours of battery life. This headset is the budget version of the Quest 3, but it’s similar to comparing an iPhone 17 to an iPhone 17 Pro -- the Pro has added benefits, but the standard version covers all the essentials without breaking a virtual sweat. Scott Stein, CNET’s VR expert, praised the headset in his review: “If you want a simple, fun entry ticket to VR at an amazing price, the Quest 3S is a really good upgraded device with a lot of headroom for mixed‑reality evolution in the years to come. And if you’re thinking of VR as a simple, fun everyday toy and you’re not wanting to spend too much, then the cheaper 3S is exactly where you want to be.” He also labeled it as “by far the best value in VR.” Virtual and augmented reality tech is constantly evolving, but it’s rarely cheap. Deals on headsets like the Meta Quest 3S don’t pop up every day. If you’ve been wanting to invest in one of Meta’s headsets, this is the time to buy while it’s available at a lower‑than‑usual price.

U.S. applications for unemployment benefits fell by 13,000 last week, remaining in the same historically healthy range of the past few years even as concerns grow about the health of the labor market WASHINGTON -- U.S. applications for unemployment benefits fell by 13,000 last week, remaining in the same historically healthy range of the past few years even as concerns grow about the health of the labor market. The number of Americans applying for jobless claims for the week ending Dec. 13 declined by 13,000 to 224,000 from the previous week’s 237,000, the Labor Department reported Thursday. That’s more than analysts’ forecast of 200,000 new applications. Applications for unemployment aid are viewed as a proxy for layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market. Earlier this week, the government reported that the U.S. gained a decent 64,000 jobs in November but lost 105,000 in October as federal workers departed after cutbacks by the Trump administration. The unemployment rate rose to 4.6% last month, the highest since 2021. The November job gains were higher than the 40,000 economists had forecast. The October job losses were caused by a 162,000 drop in federal workers, many of whom resigned at the end of fiscal year 2025 on Sept. 30 under pressure from billionaire Elon Musk’s purge of U.S. government payrolls. Labor Department revisions also knocked 33,000 jobs off August and September payrolls. Hiring has clearly lost momentum, hobbled by uncertainty over President Donald Trump’s tariffs and the lingering effects of the high interest rates the Fed engineered in 2022 and 2023 to rein in an outburst of pandemic-induced inflation. Since March, job creation has fallen to an average 35,000 a month, compared to 71,000 in the year ended in March. Last week, the Federal Reserve trimmed its benchmark lending rate by a quarter-point, its third straight cut. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the committee reduced borrowing costs out of concern that the job market is even weaker than it appears. Powell said that recent job figures could be revised lower by as much as 60,000, which would mean employers have actually been shedding an average of about 25,000 jobs a month since the spring. Companies that have recently announced job cuts include UPS, General Motors, Amazon and Verizon, but those workforce reductions can take months to show up in the government’s data. The Labor Department's report Thursday also showed that the four-week average of claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week volatility, rose by 500 to 217,500. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Dec. 6 rose by 67,000 to 1.9 million, the government said. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © mezzotint / Shutterstock.com Futures are trading higher on Thursday as we grind closer to the Christmas holiday, which is just a week off now. The song remains the same for the AI/Datacenter trade, and participants are finding it’s going to be a bit tougher here at the end of the year than in the last 6 months, as we rallied almost 30% off the April lows. The kicker for Wednesday was that various media outlets reported that Blue Owl Capital (NYSE: OWL) may not fund the $10 billion data center for OpenAI, which in turn hammered Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL). Blue Owl had been in talks with Oracle about funding a 1-gigawatt facility for Michigan, but the spiraling increase in debt was reported to have turned the tables, at least for now. That led to steep losses across the major indices, with the Nasdaq taking the biggest hit, closing down 1.81% at 22,693. The Dow Jones Industrials fared the best on Wednesday, down 0.47% to finish the session at 47,885, while the S&P 500 was last seen at 6721, down 1.16%. Yields were flat across the Treasury curve on Wednesday as most traders remained on the sidelines awaiting this morning’s Consumer Price Index data. Wall Street has a 3.1% year-over-year expectation for the headline inflation number, and the same for the volatile Core CPI, which excludes food and energy. While inflation appears to be stabilizing, it is still above the Federal Reserves 2% target. The 30-year bond closed at 4.83%, while the benchmark 10-year note was last at 4.15%. For the first time in what seems like an eternity, prices across the energy sector were up across the board as President Trump imposed a blockade halting Venezuelan oil tankers’ movement around the globe. The reason cited was two-fold: the selling of oil to restricted countries like Russia, plus the ongoing narco-terrorist battle, designed to stop the constant flow of drugs from that country into the United States. Oil, which has been heavily shorted by hedge funds and other money managers, saw a big spike on Wednesday, with Brent Crude up 2.55% at $60.42, while West Texas Intermediate closed up 2.55% at $56.68. Natural gas, which has taken a beating over the last three weeks, closed up 5.17% at $4.09. Gold and Silver continued to surge higher, as late-to-the-game retail investors and Central Banks around the globe continue to buy and add to already huge positions, or initiate new ones. The weak employment numbers, combined with global geopolitical angst and the potential for more interest rate cuts in 2026, were the driving forces on Wednesday. Toss in the weak dollar and safe-haven demand, plus no overhead resistance for the bullion, and the stage was set. Gold closed on Wednesday at $4,344, while Silver was last seen at $65.99 on continued strong industrial demand. The cryptocurrency market experienced significant volatility across the day on Wednesday, marked by an early surge during U.S. trading hours, followed by a sharp reversal and a general decline by midday. Analysts cited issues that largely mirrored a sell-off in technology stocks, suggesting a correlation with broader market jitters over AI stocks and speculation about the next U.S. Federal Reserve chairman.

The number of Americans applying for jobless claims for the week ending Dec. 13 declined by 13,000 to 224,000 from the previous week’s 237,000, the Labor Department reported Thursday.

Title: If GTA VI Delivers, Take-Two Could Hit $300 in 2026

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ: TTWO) has delivered a solid 2025, with shares up approximately 36% from their 52-week low of $177.35 and trading near recent highs. The rally has been fueled by strong NBA 2K performance and mounting anticipation for Grand Theft Auto VI, launching November 2026. With the stock at $240.55, investors are asking whether shares can push to $300 in the year ahead. Analysts are bullish on Take-Two’s prospects. The consensus price target sits at $277.40, implying 15% upside from current levels. Sentiment is overwhelmingly positive, with 25 of 28 analysts rating the stock a buy or strong buy. Wall Street expects revenue growth to continue accelerating, with quarterly revenue up 31% year-over-year. Analysts are projecting 60% year-over-year earnings growth as the company emerges from its heavy investment cycle. Take-Two has absorbed over $9 billion in net losses across fiscal years 2023 through 2025 while developing GTA VI and other major titles. With those costs largely behind them, the company is positioned to convert that investment into revenue without proportional cost increases. CEO Strauss Zelnick reinforced this outlook on the recent earnings call, stating the company remains “highly confident that we’ll achieve sequential increases in and record levels of net bookings in fiscal 2026 and 2027.” At $240.55, Take-Two trades at 28x forward earnings. At $300, shares would trade at roughly 35x forward earnings—a premium valuation, but reasonable for a company projecting 60% earnings growth and sitting on the most anticipated game release in over a decade. Several catalysts could push Take-Two to $300: Hitting $300 would require a 25% gain. Take-Two has delivered returns exceeding 25% in multiple years, including a 171% gain in 2024 during the last major release cycle. While repeating those returns is less likely given the company’s larger market cap of $44.45 billion, the historical pattern shows major franchise releases can drive significant upside. Reaching $300 per share in 2026 would require Take-Two to gain 25%, pushing above Wall Street’s consensus target. The bull case is built on GTA VI’s transformational potential, continued NBA 2K strength, and the company’s emergence from its investment trough into a period of record bookings. As Zelnick put it, the company is “exceedingly optimistic about the commercial potential” ahead. We’ve outlined the blueprint for how Take-Two could see outsized returns in 2026.

Title: The Key To Understanding The Cult Of Globalism’s War On The West

Time Published: 2025-12-18T13:00:00Z

The culture war in the western world is currently hitting a crescendo. At first the media said it was all “conspiracy theory” being amplified by a “fringe minority” of radical right wingers. Then, they admitted the conflict was real but claimed that conservatives were monsters trying to “dismantle democracy”. Today, the culture war has become the dominant issue of our age with the debate echoing through the halls of the White House. Leftists hoped they could make it all go away by dismissing it. They hoped they could continue with their ideological takeover at their leisure. They failed. The rebellion in the US is a product of decades of effort by liberty advocates and it is finally bearing fruit. However, I think many Americans and some Europeans are discovering that movements like progressive wokism (essentially Cultural Marxism) are much more than a mere reaction to the return of conservatives to the cultural space. The fight that’s happening in front of the curtain is only a dim reflection of the fight that’s going on behind the curtain. Almost every facet of leftist political and social activism is bankrolled by some of the wealthiest organizations and individuals on the planet. In fact, I would argue that without the billions of dollars in global funding provided by NGOs, government entities and corporations, the political left as we know it would not exist and the world would be much quieter. A prime example is anti-ICE organizations: These groups have access to extensive cash reserves to finance call networks, they pay for hundreds or even thousand of protesters and agitators, they pay for legal representation and bail to get their activist agents out of jail, and they often obtain inside information on ICE operations before those operations occur. These groups function less like homegrown civil rights efforts and more like clandestine government agencies. And, if you check the tax backgrounds of all of them you will find, without fail, that they’re propped up by NGOs like the Open Society Foundation, Ford Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation, global corporations like Vangaurd and Blackrock, and government bureaucracies like USAID (before it was shut down). Nothing about these movements is natural, they are purely astroturf. It might look like chaos, but every time you see leftist mobs on the news trying to interfere with ICE arrests and deportations, what you are watching is a highly organized machine flush with globalist cash working to undermine US sovereignty. The mass immigration of third worlders is coordinated by globalists. The protests against deportations are funded by globalists. The politicians that promote open border policies and enable the invasion of the west are closely associated with prominent globalists. The war on the west is a globalist war; radical activists are mindless soldiers and paid mercenaries. They are not the source of the conflict; they shield the source. Unfortunately there are too many conservative commentators out there that REFUSE to accept the reality that the actions of the political left are coordinated by a deeper conspiracy. I don’t know why they deny the existence of this cabal, I can only surmise that the idea of a top-down conspiracy to bring about the downfall of western culture is too frightening for them to ponder. There is also the problem of motive. There’s plenty of conservatives and patriots with a vague notion of why the globalists do the things they do. Evil exists, that’s not up for debate. But beyond the underlying mental factors of psychopathy and delusions of godhood, the issue of relativism is ever present. It is a globalist obsession. Globalism is rooted in cultural relativism, moral relativism, legal relativism, even biological relativism. Western culture is basically the antithesis of relativism, and thus, it must be destroyed in order for globalism to thrive. Everything else is just a tactic, a strategy to destroy the west while taking none of the blame. Only the west codifies the idea of inherent liberties into its legal framework. Only the west (specifically the US) places individual citizen rights as equal to or greater than the policies of government. Only the west values free thought over uniformity. Only the west (largely the US) preaches the necessity of popular revolt in the wake of collectivist tyranny. The problem is, most of the world has no concept of these ideals. They have spent their lives acclimating to cultures where “rights” are also relative – Relative to the whims of socialist and authoritarian regimes. It therefore makes perfect sense for globalists to fund the importation of millions of foreigners, mostly from the third world, into the west. These are people whose minds are already enslaved by a lifetime of submission to collectivism and oligarchy. The migrants go along with the plan because the incentives are too enticing. Their masters are aiming them at the west and saying: “Go and pillage, take what you can! We will let you plunder these wealthy places as long as you do as we say after the coffers are looted and the blood in the streets is dry in the sun…” In other words, the globalists are giving the oppressed third worlders a steam valve, an opportunity to “chimp out” and act on their worst impulses. It is a sad but pervasive observation that the majority of enslaved minds HATE the existence of free people, even if those people live on the other side of the planet. This doesn’t only apply to hostile migrants, it also applies to the progressives that live next door to us. Look at what happened during the pandemic. Look at how they act when faced with facts that contradict their political beliefs. They snap, they crash out, they go insane. They spit and froth and rage like animals. They revile us and nothing would make them happier than to see us dead. All because we don’t blindly embrace their doctrine. Wokeness, along with multiculturalism, is a globalist construct adapted as a new world religion and all of its tenets are designed as an attack on western values. We respect meritocracy, so they create DEI and equity. We promote personal responsibility, so they promote narcissism and self worship. We revere free markets, so they enable expanding socialism. We respect biological science and the biblical definitions of man and woman, so they create gender fluid ideology. We respect moral objectivity and the reality of good and evil, so they conjure up the philosophy of moral relativism as a license for ubridled degeneracy. To be sure, there are other cultures that do not embrace wokeness, but they don’t present a legitimate threat to globalism. They don’t have a legacy of free thought, they have no interest in rebellion and they are mostly disarmed so they wouldn’t be able to fight back if they wanted to. Wokeness was specifically tailored as a weapon against the west; a weapon that targets our belief in liberty and attempts to use it against us. For if an individual has a right to choose their own path, how far does this right extend? Do individuals have the rights and the freedom to congregate into mobs and systematically burn the west down? Liberals would say “yes”, and if anyone tries to stop them those people are tyrants. Are we tyrants if we fight back? Are we fascists if we defend out culture and borders from erasure? Are we hypocrites if we ignore the sovereignty of people whose only goal is to eliminate our sovereignty? My counter-argument to this philosophy is that leftists and globalist have no right to socially engineer the west. They only have the right to leave the west and start their own systems somewhere else. If they hate the west so much, why don’t they relocate instead of staying here, or inviting in millions of immigrants that also have no respect for our heritage? Because this is not a civic disagreement between citizens with a mutual love of country – This is a war between mortal enemies who share nothing in common. They don’t want to live peacefully in another place where they can experiment with socialism to their heart’s content. They want to conquer and subjugate. Globalism must be global. If any competing systems are allowed to exist they will act as proof that the relativist method is an inferior method. The key to understanding the globalist war on the west is first to recognize that a conspiracy of “elites” is a hard, irrefutable fact. Second, we must accept that war has been declared on us and this war is one of total conquest. We are not allowed to live separately and peacefully, our very existence is seen as a threat to the establishment. Third, globalists view western culture as antithetical to their future aims. Globalism cannot prevail as long as western ideals exist. Finally, as noted, most of the world is against us whether they know it or not. Even old allies in Europe are becoming enemies. Import masses of third worlders into America and they don’t become American, America becomes the third world. Import millions of socialists into the US and the US becomes increasingly socialist. This is very simple to understand, but leftists (and some libertarians) refuse to acknowledge the truth. Not all cultures are equal. Some are better than others. It’s fascinating how liberals continue to pretend as if different nations and cultures don’t produce tribes that are contrary to each other. We are not the same and natural coexistence is a myth. Coexistence of such groups is created through intimidation, extortion and force. The liberal Utopian ideal of multiculturalism requires oppressive centralization and tyranny. Globalism is the mechanism by which total and eternal oligarchy is achieved. They use open borders, mass immigration, woke cultism, economic crisis, international conflagration, engineered pandemics, anything you can think of and more to tear their enemies down. We are their enemy. We didn’t choose this fight, they did, and they will continue changing strategies until they find one that works (or until we end their little experiment).

Title: BlackRock, Mastercard, and Franklin Templeton Announce Collaboration with the ADI Foundation Signaling Institutional Adoption

December 18, 2025 06:00 ET | Source: ADI Chain ADI Chain ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates, Dec. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Days after the mainnet launch, the MENA region's first and largest institutional L2 has secured partnerships with BlackRock, Mastercard, and Franklin Templeton, demonstrating institutional confidence in compliance-first blockchain architecture. The Institutional Validation Each of ADI's latest partnerships targets different infrastructure needs: Three global institutions partnering within days of launch signal what they need: a blockchain built for regulatory frameworks. These partnerships expand the ADI Foundation's influence, reach, and capabilities, bringing more projects into the ecosystem as enterprises discover ADI Chain through BlackRock, Mastercard, Franklin Templeton, and expanding institutional networks. Launch and Access The ADI utility token launched simultaneously with the mainnet across Kraken, Crypto.com, and KuCoin, and became available through Wallet in Telegram and Fasset shortly after. The market response showed demand for compliance-ready infrastructure: that interest extends beyond institutional players. The Build Continues BlackRock, Mastercard, and Franklin Templeton joined an ecosystem spanning partnerships across 20 countries. Over 50 institutional and enterprise projects are in the pipeline for deployment on ADI Chain, with institutional and technology partnerships continuing to expand. Projects deploying on ADI Chain already demonstrate the network's institutional use cases: The foundation's strategic partnerships expand its capabilities and market access: ZKsync powers ADI Chain's zero-knowledge proof infrastructure, Alchemy provides national-scale deployment capabilities, WalletConnect enables cross-chain interoperability, and Covalent delivers real-time blockchain data for institutional applications. Core infrastructure milestones continue advancing as well. ADI Chain was chosen to host the UAE Dirham-backed stablecoin, which will be issued by two major players in the region: First Abu Dhabi Bank and IHC, and is set to be regulated by the UAE Central Bank. Alongside technical infrastructure, the Foundation will launch an educational initiative, ‘Future Tech 4.0’ in partnership with ADGM and leading universities to develop over 10,000 Web3 specialists. A Year of Building Most L2 blockchains compete on transaction speed and low fees. ADI Chain took a different approach, building for compliance, regulatory alignment, and government deployment. The thesis was straightforward: emerging market governments and institutions need blockchain infrastructure designed specifically for them. One year ago, the ADI Foundation announced its formation at Abu Dhabi Finance Week. Last week, it returned to the same stage to announce the ADI Chain Mainnet launch. Twelve months from formation to operational infrastructure, with partnerships confirmed within days. BlackRock, Mastercard, and Franklin Templeton signed partnerships days after launch, showing they had monitored development closely. When institutions of that scale move that quickly, it validates the category itself. ADI established "institutional L2 for MENA" before competitors could claim the space. ADI aims to bring one billion people onchain by 2030. One year in: mainnet operational, partnerships across 20 countries, 50+ projects ready to deploy, 500+ million people already within reach. The goal now looks less distant. About the ADI Foundation & ADI Chain The ADI Foundation is an Abu Dhabi-based non-profit founded by Sirius International Holding, a subsidiary of IHC, dedicated to empowering governments and institutions in emerging markets through blockchain infrastructure. The foundation's mission is to bring one billion people into the digital economy by 2030, building on a foundation of 500+ million people already within its ecosystem reach. ADI Chain is the first institutional Layer 2 blockchain for stablecoins and real-world assets in the MENA region, providing settlement infrastructure for First Abu Dhabi Bank and IHC's dirham-backed stablecoin, set to be regulated by the UAE Central Bank. The network operates on three pillars - Compliance, Efficiency, Security - serving governments implementing blockchain infrastructure across the Middle East, Asia, and Africa.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. If you're making your list of stocks to watch in the new year, UBS has a list of its highest conviction stocks for 2026 that could offer some insight. The bank released its list of top picks for the coming year this week, encompassing names across various sectors and themes that analysts believe will outperform the broader market. After another year of strong stock-market growth, some finance pros are looking to areas outside big tech to fuel more gains. With the AI trade looking shakier than it once did, investors are on the hunt for alternatives that can help keep the bull market going. "We've focused on stocks where we believe our analysts have a differentiated view vs. consensus, and where we have interesting or proprietary data sources," UBS said. "We have also considered potential upside to price target and risk/reward skew as well as a stock's exposure to key themes during the selection process." Here are 10 of the bank's highest conviction calls for the coming year. Ticker: ACAD 2025 return: +46% Commentary: Biotech firm Acadia Pharmaceuticals is UBS analyst Ashwani Verma's top pick for the healthcare sector. He thinks the company's management is executing on growth initiatives for multiple promising new drugs. "We believe an upside could come from successful outcome from ACP-204's Alzheimer's disease psychosis (ADP) trial," he said. "Read-out is expected in mid-'26." Ticker: LNT 2025 return: +11% Commentary: Analyst William Appicelli names power generation company Alliant Energy as his top pick in the utilities sector. He thinks the market is undervaluing the company as it is likely to benefit from the ongoing data center boom in 2026, a view shared by other Wall Street banks. "Current valuation does not fully capture the 2-4GW of upside opportunities. We expect announcement for service agreements for this load to be incorporated into the capital plans over the next 12 months," he said. Ticker: AMZN 2025 return: +0.3% Commentary: Amazon is the only Magnificent Seven stock on UBS' list of top picks for 2026. While it's been outperformed by peers in 2025, analyst Stephen Ju sees it benefiting from the ongoing AI boom as well as progress in both sports licensing and same-day delivery in its e-commerce business. Ticker: AMT 2025 return: -3% Commentary: While American Tower operates as a real estate investment trust (REIT), its niche position developing and leasing communications infrastructure, such as cellular towers and data centers, makes it attractive. UBS analyst Batya Levi lists it as the top pick for the Communications Services sector, citing rising 5G deployments and compounding mobile data usage, both of which can set it up for growth in 2025. Ticker: COF 2025 return: +33% Commentary: Capital One is UBS analyst Erika Najarian's top pick for the financial sector. Capital One stock has enjoyed a strong year already, but Najarian maintains it is likely to keep rising. "In the case of COF, we see an opportunity for investors to own a vertically integrated payments platform and card juggernaut where COF leverages DFS's credit and debit networks to earn revenue without taking balance sheet or credit risk and lowers its natural cost of funding — driving synergies well beyond typical bank mergers," she said. Ticker: PEP 2025 return: -2% Commentary: PepsiCo stock has struggled this year, but the company beat out its rival Coca-Cola for the position of top-ranked consumer staples stock on the bank's list. Analyst Peter Grom highlighted its high growth potential relative to many of its peers. "We believe PEP is a buy as the company is one of the only large-cap names in our coverage to be on track to deliver +LSD/+MSD top-line growth and +MSD/+HSD EPS growth, all while trading at a significant relative discount to US large-cap multinational peers (~17.6x vs. ~21.7x 5-yr average)," Grom said. Ticker: DECK 2025 return: -50% Commentary: The outdoor shoes and equipment producer has spent most of the year trending downward, but UBS thinks a turnaround is coming. The bank's analysts see Deckers stock as an opportunity for investors to gain exposure to a strong company before it rebounds. "We see a very good opportunity to buy shares in a growth company significantly undervalued by the market. We expect DECK's EPS to positively surprise over the NTM due to Hoka and UGG performing better than expected," said UBS' Jay Sole. The analyst named it as the top pick in the consumer discretionary sector. Ticker: GM 2025 return: +52% Commentary: The carmaker is UBS' top pick for the automotive industry after a strong trading year. The bank lists it under the broader industrial sector. Analyst Joseph Spark isn't overly concerned with the struggling EV industry, noting that he sees potential for General Motors to improve its production costs and restructure in a way that minimizes its EV exposure. Spark also believes that GM can benefit from the current economic policy landscape if interest rates continue to decline. Ticker: OVV 2025 return: -6% Commentary: Ovintiv is an oil and natural gas producer that serves the US and Canada. While the stock has struggled in 2025, analyst Josh Silverstein still rates it as his top pick for the energy sector, noting that recent deals are likely to help the company turn around in 2026. "The transactions add Montney resource depth, streamlines capital allocation, and most importantly, improves OVV's balance sheet and return of capital profile," he wrote. "We see OVV's current multiple reflecting concerns over its balance sheet and Midland inventory depth." Ticker: WWD 2025 return: +71% Commentary: Woodward may not be as well known as its peers in the defense industry, but its year-to-date growth makes it a standout in the sector. "We see faster revenue growth and better margin expansion than the market expects, with a decade plus of visibility into aftermarket streams on the LEAP/GTF engines," he noted. Parsons also highlighted the industrial industry's strong power generation tailwinds, noting that fast-growing customers are causing a surge in demand that will likely help boost Woodward stock in the coming year.

Title: Spot Bitcoin ETFs record $450M inflows in ‘early positioning’ push

Time Published: 2025-12-18T08:32:56Z

Spot Bitcoin ETFs logged their strongest inflows in over a month amid renewed institutional demand tied to shifting macro expectations. Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded $457 million in net inflows on Wednesday, marking their strongest single-day intake in more than a month as institutional demand showed signs of re-acceleration. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) led the inflows, recording the largest daily intake at roughly $391 million, accounting for the majority of the day’s net inflows. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) followed with around $111 million, according to data from Farside Investors. Other funds saw modest withdrawals. Bitwise’s BITB saw about $8.4 million in outflows, ARK 21Shares’ ARKB recorded roughly $37 million in outflows, and Hashdex’s DEFI posted around $1.5 million in net outflows on the day. The inflows lifted cumulative net inflows for US spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs to more than $57 billion, while total net assets climbed above $112 billion, equivalent to around 6.5% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. The rebound followed a choppy stretch in November and early December, when flows alternated between modest inflows and sharp outflows. Spot Bitcoin ETFs last saw inflows above $450 million on Nov. 11, when funds pulled in roughly $524 million in a single day. Related: Crypto ETPs to enter ‘cheesecake factory’ era in 2026: Bitwise Vincent Liu, chief investment officer at Kronos Research, said the renewed interest appears to reflect early positioning rather than late-cycle enthusiasm. “ETF inflows feel like early positioning,” Liu said. “As rate expectations soften, BTC becomes a clean liquidity trade again. Politics sets the mood, but capital moves on macro.” However, Liu cautioned that while momentum could continue, it is unlikely to be smooth. “Momentum likely holds, but expect it to be uneven,” he said. “Flows will track liquidity and price action. As long as BTC remains a clean macro expression, ETFs stay the path of least resistance.” On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump said he plans to appoint a new Federal Reserve chair who strongly supports cutting interest rates. Speaking during a national address marking the first year of his second term, Trump said he would announce a successor to current Fed Chair Jerome Powell early next year, adding that all known finalists favor lower rates than current levels. Lower rates are usually considered bullish for risk assets like crypto. Related: Spot Bitcoin ETFs see $358M outflow: Are investors really abandoning BTC? Bitcoin has returned to price levels last seen nearly a year ago, leaving behind a dense supply cluster between $93,000 and $120,000 that continues to cap recovery attempts. This top-heavy structure has pushed the amount of Bitcoin held at a loss to 6.7 million BTC, the highest level of the current cycle, according to Glassnode. The report said demand remains fragile across both spot and derivatives markets. Spot buying has been selective and short-lived, corporate treasury flows episodic, and futures positioning continues to de-risk rather than rebuild conviction. Until sellers are absorbed above $95,000 or fresh liquidity enters the market, Bitcoin is likely to remain caught between structural support near $81,000, per Glassnode.

Title: Either way the EU loses: Why ignoring the US on Russian assets will be the bloc’s undoing
URL: https://www.rt.com/news/629570-eu-russian-sovereign-assets/
Time Published: 2025-12-18T08:21:03Z

It is crunch time for Ursula von der Leyen and her Brussels-based cabal who have attempted to bend and break EU law in order to force through a dubious legal claim for the use of sovereign Russian wealth to further fund Ukraine’s military. Kiev is long past broke, owes the EU some €45 billion and faces a fiscal shortage of €70 billion for the next year, and is suffering a slow and painful frontline collapse. Moscow has long described the EU’s attack on its assets as “theft,” the IMF and European Central Bank both oppose the move, and the ratings agency Fitch has already issued a downgrade warning to Euroclear, the clearing house at centre of the scandal. The stakes Von der Leyen, along with her compatriot German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, have managed to bring what is widely regarded as a potentially disastrous initiative to an EU vote under dubious circumstances which, if it fails, will leave the two German politicians’ reputations in ruins. Merz has been at the megaphone this week while von der Leyen has pressed the flesh with bloc members. In the past 48 hours, the former chairman of the Blackrock Germany board has declared the ‘pax Americana’ is over, compared Russian President Vladimir Putin to Adolf Hitler (Merz’s grandfather was a Nazi), and warned of direct NATO-Russia conflict. However, it could be worse. If the vote to use Russian assets to finance Kiev’s military is passed, it will permanently damage the EU’s reputation, spell the end of any Russia-EU cooperation for decades while triggering a global legal onslaught. A slew of cases will be opened in the bloc, not least by Belgium, which has protested against the EU attempts to get its hands on some €180 billion of Russian sovereign wealth held in the Belgian clearing house Euroclear. Russia has also begun legal proceedings in a Moscow arbitration court for damages. Some €280 billion of assets belonging to countries deemed “unfriendly” by Moscow, presently held in type-C deposits in Russia, could be seized in retaliation for the European attack on Russia’s funds, as well as a wave of litigation potentially targeting all complicit institutions in every major global financial hub. Death and “pax Americana” The European option also ignores the military reality in Donbass and Ukraine, by seeking to pour billions into continuing a war that Kiev is undoubtedly losing. US President Donald Trump’s team, however, have proposed a different mechanism which Russia has not outright rejected, by which the Russian funds in question are used for an investment vehicle. Such a mechanism could have a very positive impact on the investment climate in a post-conflict Ukraine, given the rampant and endemic corruption associated with the country and in particular Vladimir Zelensky’s inner circle. Effectively what we are witnessing is the European Union rejecting Washington while trying to force on Kiev a militaristic future which only promises years of warfare. The US, which let us remember initiated this entire round of diplomacy, has a proposal on the table that could secure a stable and lasting peace, offer security guarantees to all parties involved, and have a positive impact on the investment climate in a country that will need unprecedented investment. The Spin While you may have read that the European Union has already taken an indefinite hold over Russia’s assets in lieu of reparations to Ukraine, neither of these claims is true. The EU has misused article 122 of its constitution to assert a temporary hold over Russian assets for as long as they can prove that the conflict in Ukraine poses or threatens to pose an economic risk to the bloc. There is no indefinite freeze on Russian assets for reparations to speak of. Belgian Prime Minister Bart de Wever has spoken of the EU “stealing” Russian assets. Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Rueben has already described the EU tactics as “a declaration of war.” Slovakia’s Robert Fico, who was shot at close range by a pro-Ukraine activist, has claimed Brussels is only “prolonging the war.” Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis has also refused to support financing Ukraine. Italy, Malta, and others are also said to be firmly against the plot to steal Russia’s assets and are advocating for a different option. The vote Though the matter is regarded as a foreign policy issue involving the assets of a non-member of the bloc and would normally require unanimity to pass, von der Leyen has managed force a vote under qualified majority voting. This means that 15 of the 27 member states, and/or states representing 65% of the EU’s population must vote in favor in order to pass the ruling. Eight votes against could be enough to force von der Leyen to have to go back to EU taxpayers, already suffering and drifting to the left and right, to seek lining for Ukraine’s donated war chest. Should the reparations loan option be defeated or removed from the table, the joint debt option, whereby EU member countries must borrow money for Ukraine, to be repaid by the countries themselves, will arise, requiring unanimity to pass. Either way, it looks like Brussels could lose. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2025. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies.

Title: Binance’s US Return Strategy: CZ’s Stake At Risk In Potential Recapitalization

Amid significant regulatory shifts under President Trump’s administration, Binance is gearing up to relaunch in the United States, potentially reducing the stakes held by its former CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ). Following years of legal hurdles that culminated in Zhao serving time in prison, his recent presidential pardon has revitalized the exchange’s prospects within the US crypto landscape. According to a recent Bloomberg report, Binance has been exploring options to restart operations for its American affiliate, Binance.US. This includes discussions of a recapitalization that could dilute Zhao’s majority stake, which has complicated the company’s efforts to expand in the country. At a recent Binance Blockchain Week event, Zhao expressed his commitment to transforming the US into a central hub for cryptocurrency, dubbing it “an emerging land for us.” His remarks came in the wake of a challenging period for Binance.US, which has seen its market share plummet from an impressive 35% to virtually zero since US regulatory bodies charged Zhao and the cryptocurrency exchange two years ago. Several states have also rescinded Binance’s licenses, while others, notably New York, never granted one in the first place. Supporters of the exchange believe that a forthcoming market-structure bill could establish a federal licensing regime, potentially altering the operational landscape for companies like Binance. However, Bitcoinist has continuously reported that the bill’s progress has stalled amid political divisions, casting doubt on its future. For now, the anticipated markup has been delayed until January 2026. The report suggests that if Binance were able to buy back some or all of Zhao’s holdings, it might consider new leadership and strategies to drive growth while leveraging political connections in Washington. Sources familiar with the situation emphasize a sense of urgency for the exchange to make critical decisions. In a separate effort to bolster its standing, the exchange is reportedly aiming for a closer partnership with BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager and issuer of the largest Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US. This relationship could involve the utilization of BlackRock’s tokenized money-market fund to support trades on Binance. Discussions regarding enhanced financial ties between the two have included the potential development of additional products and revenue-sharing opportunities. Additionally, Binance is looking to strengthen its relationship with World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a crypto venture co-founded by members of the Trump family. These moves appear to have taken shape following Zhao’s pardon and signify the crypto company’s desire to recalibrate its presence in a more favorable political atmosphere. To facilitate these efforts, Binance has promoted Yi He, Zhao’s partner, as a stabilizing force for the company. Over the past few months, she has assumed a prominent role, leading strategic initiatives and revitalizing Binance’s growth narrative. However, her elevation has sparked questions regarding the dynamics of power between her and Teng, the former regulator who has been instrumental in guiding the exchange’s outreach efforts. At the time of writing, BNB, the exchange’s native token, is trading at $846. This represents a major correction of 38% over the past few months, following the cryptocurrency’s all-time high of $1,369.

December 18, 2025 01:35 ET | Source: Rocket Lab Corporation Rocket Lab Corporation Long Beach, CA Long Beach, CA LONG BEACH, Calif., Dec. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today successfully launched the STP-S30 mission for the U.S. Space Force’s (USSF) Space Systems Command (SSC) – completing the launch five months ahead of schedule and playing a critical role in advancing technologies that ensure U.S. superiority in space. The launch, named ‘Don’t Be Such A Square’, lifted off from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 2 (LC-2) at the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport (MARS) on Wallops Island, Virginia on December 18 at 12:03 a.m. (05:03 UTC) to deploy four DiskSat spacecraft to a 550km low Earth orbit for Department of War’s (DoW) Space Test Program (STP). Managed by SSC’s System Delta 89 (SYD 89) Capability Development Branch led by Lt Col Cesar Rodriguez, developed by The Aerospace Corporation (Aerospace), and funded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Small Spacecraft & Distributed Systems program, based at NASA’s Ames Research Center in California’s Silicon Valley within the agency’s Space Technology Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington, DiskSat is a proposed alternative to CubeSat satellites to improve the build, integration, and cost of future small satellite missions and unlock new possibilities across commercial, government, and defense applications. ‘Don’t Be Such A Square’ is the latest showcase of Rocket Lab’s flexibility and agile launch capabilities. Working alongside the USSF’s Rocket Systems Launch Program (RSLP), Rocket Lab executed the mission five months ahead of schedule. RSLP awarded STP-S30 to Rocket Lab in April 2024 using the Orbital Services Program (OSP-4) contract. Rocket Lab has delivered an affordable, responsive, and reliable launch solution to the USSF and its civil and industry partners that remains unmatched across dedicated commercial small launch. ‘Don’t Be Such A Square’ completes a run of four launches in the past three months from Rocket Lab’s LC-2 launch in Virginia, each serving national security and defense technology advancement objectives for the DoW. Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, says: “Rocket Lab’s speed, streamlined operations, and reliability were on full display with this flawless Electron launch for STP-S30, and we’re proud to be strengthening the nation’s space capabilities. We’re meeting the space access demands of the U.S. Space Force with our consistent execution, and this launch is another proud moment in Rocket Lab’s long history of successful missions for defense, national security, and commercial space users.” Lt. Col. Brian Shimek, Director, Department of War Space Test Program, says: "We are immensely proud of this collaboration with Rocket Lab, the Capability Development Branch, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), The Aerospace Corporation, and the Rocket Systems Launch Program. Their exceptional teamwork and dedication have made this achievement possible. Proving these advanced technologies in the space environment is a critical step towards their integration into future operational Space Force systems, ensuring our nation maintains its edge in space. Accelerating this launch by five months underscores our commitment to rapidly delivering innovative capabilities to the Space Force. This achievement is a testament to the dedication and expertise of the entire STP-S30 team." ‘Don’t Be Such A Square’ was also Electron’s 20th launch of the year and 78th mission overall, further extending Rocket Lab’s new annual launch record. Details for Rocket Lab’s next Electron launch of 2025 will be announced in the coming days. ‘Don’t Be Such A Square’ launch images: F78 | Don't Be Such A Square ‘Don’t Be Such A Square’ launch webcast: Rocket Lab - 'Don't Be Such A Square' Launch Rocket Lab Media ContactMurielle Bakermedia@rocketlabusa.com About Rocket LabAbout Rocket Lab Rocket Lab is a leading space company that provides launch services, spacecraft, payloads and satellite components serving commercial, government, and national security markets.

Title: EU’s seizure of Russian assets sparks legal showdown as Moscow demands $230 billion

The EU is considering repurposing â¬200 billion ($234 billion) in frozen Russian sovereign assets to fund Ukraine, escalating tensions. Russia has retaliated by suing Euroclear for $230 billion, framing the move as outright "theft" and threatening financial instability. The U.S. has privately warned the EU against confiscation, fearing it could sabotage peace talks. Hungary and Slovakia oppose the plan, forcing Brussels to use emergency powers to maintain the freeze. Belgium fears legal exposure, while Ukraine's worsening debt crisis raises doubts about repayment capacity. Moscow filed a lawsuit against Euroclear in Russian courts, with expected enforcement in friendly jurisdictions like China or the UAE. Russian officials warn that asset seizures will erode trust in Western financial systems and trigger retaliatory seizures of European holdings in Russia. The EU's move would be the first time non-belligerent nations seize a belligerent's assets during an ongoing conflict to aid a third party. Historical seizures (Iran, Venezuela) set a contentious precedent, with Russia accusing the West of a "genetic urge to steal." If Russia reclaims assets via international courts, Euroclear and Western financial institutions could face chaos. Ukraine's looming default and Washington's hesitation highlight strategic fragility, with long-term damage to trust in the euro and Western monetary systems.

If Russia reclaims assets via international courts, Euroclear and Western financial institutions could face chaos. Ukraine's looming default and Washington's hesitation highlight strategic fragility, with long-term damage to trust in the euro and Western monetary systems. The European Union's plan to repurpose â¬200 billion ($234 billion) in frozen Russian sovereign assets to fund Ukraine has escalated into a high-stakes legal and financial battle, with Moscow retaliating by suing Euroclear for $230 billion in damages. Euroclear is a Brussels-based financial depository that holds and manages seized Russian assets in European banks, according to BrightU.AI's Enoch. The move, framed by Russia as outright "theft," risks destabilizing Western financial institutions and undermining international trust in the euro. Meanwhile, the U.S. has reportedly warned the EU against confiscating the funds, fearing it could sabotage peace negotiations with Moscow. Following Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Western nations froze approximately $300 billion in Russian sovereign assets, with â¬210 billion held in Europeâprimarily by Euroclear. EU leaders, led by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, have proposed using these funds to back a "reparations loan" for Ukraine, arguing that Kyiv urgently needs financial support as the war drags on. However, the plan has met fierce resistanceânot just from Russia but also within the EU itself. Hungary and Slovakia opposed the measure, forcing Brussels to invoke emergency powers to keep the assets frozen indefinitely. Belgium, home to Euroclear, has expressed concerns about being left vulnerable to Russian lawsuits. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk revealed that Washington has privately urged Brussels to "leave these Russian assets alone," fearing Moscow would harden its stance in peace talks. Russia's legal counterattack Russia has launched a multi-pronged legal offensive, with the Bank of Russia filing a $230 billion lawsuit against Euroclear in Moscow's Commercial Court. Legal experts anticipate a swift ruling in Russia's favor, which could then be enforced in jurisdictions deemed friendly to Moscow, such as China, Hong Kong or the UAE, where Euroclear operates. Kirill Dmitriev, Russian President Vladimir Putin's investment envoy, warned that seizing sovereign assets would erode trust in Western financial systems: "What rational investor will hold its securities in Euroclear, in euro or in the EU, if they understand that their property rights are not respected?" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov went further, accusing the West of a "genetic urge to steal," citing past seizures of Iranian and Venezuelan assets. Moscow has vowed to retaliate by targeting European investors' holdings in Russia, potentially escalating into a tit-for-tat financial war. Historical precedent and financial fallout The EU's move marks an unprecedented step in modern financial warfare. A 2024 study by Sweden's Riksbank noted that this would be the first time non-belligerent nations seize a belligerent country's assets during an ongoing conflict to aid a third party. The U.S. has floated an alternative proposalâsplitting the frozen funds between Ukrainian reconstruction and a U.S.-Russia investment vehicleâbut Brussels appears determined to proceed. However, Ukraine's worsening financial crisis complicates matters. Reuters recently reported that Kyiv is nearing default on $20 billion in debt to investors like BlackRock, raising doubts about its ability to repay any new loansâeven those backed by Russian assets. The EU's gamble on Russian assets risks backfiring spectacularly. If Moscow succeeds in reclaiming its funds through international courts, Western financial institutions could face chaos, with Euroclear at the center of the storm. Meanwhile, Ukraine's economic collapse and Washington's hesitation underscore the fragility of the West's strategy. As legal battles loom and diplomatic tensions flare, one thing is clear: The financial fallout from this confrontation could reshape global trust in Western monetary systems for years to come.

Sources include: RT.com Reuters.com BrightU.ai Brighteon.com Following Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Western nations froze approximately $300 billion in Russian sovereign assets, with â¬210 billion held in Europeâprimarily by Euroclear. EU leaders, led by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, have proposed using these funds to back a "reparations loan" for Ukraine, arguing that Kyiv urgently needs financial support as the war drags on. However, the plan has met fierce resistanceânot just from Russia but also within the EU itself. Hungary and Slovakia opposed the measure, forcing Brussels to invoke emergency powers to keep the assets frozen indefinitely. Belgium, home to Euroclear, has expressed concerns about being left vulnerable to Russian lawsuits. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk revealed that Washington has privately urged Brussels to "leave these Russian assets alone," fearing Moscow would harden its stance in peace talks. Russia's legal counterattack Russia has launched a multi-pronged legal offensive, with the Bank of Russia filing a $230 billion lawsuit against Euroclear in Moscow's Commercial Court. Legal experts anticipate a swift ruling in Russia's favor, which could then be enforced in jurisdictions deemed friendly to Moscow, such as China, Hong Kong or the UAE, where Euroclear operates. Kirill Dmitriev, Russian President Vladimir Putin's investment envoy, warned that seizing sovereign assets would erode trust in Western financial systems: "What rational investor will hold its securities in Euroclear, in euro or in the EU, if they understand that their property rights are not respected?" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov went further, accusing the West of a "genetic urge to steal," citing past seizures of Iranian and Venezuelan assets. Moscow has vowed to retaliate by targeting European investors' holdings in Russia, potentially escalating into a tit-for-tat financial war.

Transcripts may contain a few typos. With many episodes lasting 2+ hours, it can be difficult to catch minor errors. Enjoy! Tim Ferriss: Bill, great to see you, man. Bill Gurley: Good to see you. Tim Ferriss: And I thought we would start with a prop that you brought. So there was a very thick book with a tattered cover and I think that is as good a lead in as anything. And what are you holding? Bill Gurley: I’m holding a book called The Last Laugh by Phil Berger. The reason it’s tattered is I think it may be out of print, like I bought it used because I wanted to see it and have it. Tim Ferriss: What’s the subtitle? Bill Gurley: The Last Laugh: The World of the Stand-up Comics. Tim Ferriss: Why do you have this book? Are you thinking of making a career switch? Bill Gurley: No. No. No. No. So as part of researching my new book, Runnin’ Down a Dream, my co-writer and I were, we spent six years just diving through stories because I had done this speech at the University of Texas and we wanted to enhance it when we went to the printed form. And one of the stories we came across was Jerry Seinfeld and his decision to pursue a career as a comedian. And he was in New York. He wasn’t sure what he wanted to do with his life. He had an inkling, an inkling that he might want to be a standup comic, but he didn’t know what that meant. He didn’t know if it was a real career. He didn’t know that you could make money. And he read this book and it profiles, I don’t know, it looks like 15 different — it’s got Woody Allen, Bill Cosby, George Carlin, Lily Tomlin, Robert Klein. It profiled them in a way that was very disinhibiting to him. It gave him permission to go do this career that’s not a typical career. When you go to college, they don’t list standup comedian as something that you can go do. Tim Ferriss: The guidance counselor is not generally putting that on the multiple choice. Bill Gurley: Exactly. But this book served as something that granted him permission to go do that. Tim Ferriss: And we’re going to come back to that. I will say that I bookmarked this for future conversations, and of course we’re chatting outside of these recordings, but because two years ago, almost exactly when we did our first episode, you mentioned that you were working on a book idea based on the belief that it’s easier than ever to rise up because access to mentors and information is unprecedented. So we’ll come back to that, of course, and discuss it and the frameworks and the approaches and the stories at some length. But I wanted to start with some topical subject matter: AI bubble or not? And if so, what does that mean? Bill Gurley: Yeah. So I think this is super interesting. My partner, Peter, reminded me of a book that we had seen a while ago by Carlota Perez. It has this very benign title, Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital. It was written in like 2002. And what Perez simplifies and notices, which I just find perfect for trying to understand whether there’s a bubble or not, is that every time there’s been a technology wave that leads to wealth creation, especially fast wealth creation, that will inherently invite speculators, carpetbaggers, interlopers that want to come take advantage of it, think of the Gold Rush. And so people want to make it a debate. Do you believe in AI or is it a bubble? And if you say you think it’s a bubble, they say, “Oh, you don’t believe in AI.” Like, this “Got you!” kind of thing. And if you study Perez, and I think this is absolutely correct, if the wave is real, then you’re going to have bubble-like behavior. They come together as a pair, precisely because any time there’s very quick wealth creation, you’re going to get a lot of people that want to come try and take advantage of that or participate in it. So you get a flood of those types of people coming at it. And so it’s odd. There’s a real technology wave that’s fundamentally changing the world and there’s also massive speculation simultaneously. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, they come as a pair. I recall not too long ago, maybe two weeks ago, saw a short interview with your friend, Jeff Bezos, and he distinguished between financial bubbles and industrial bubbles and cited, and I’m paraphrasing here, but 2008 as an example of a bad bubble, financial bubble, versus, let’s just say, the early 2000s, ’98, ’99, 2000, where a lot of very important technology was created that then was durable after the fact and created new generations of entrepreneurs and a lot of economic growth. And he believes that AI would fall into the industrial bubble category of things. But I suppose, given that the dancing pair you described come together, how would you think about investing in private companies, modern venture capital at this point in time? And just, I suppose, as it’s changed since you were most active. Bill Gurley: Just a quick comment on that industrial bubble thing. One thing that is surprising to me is that even though I fundamentally believe this is an important real technology wave, the big players, even the Mag Seven, have all decided to do things from a deal perspective. You’ve read about these circular deals and whatnot. Tim Ferriss: Could you explain what you mean by that? Bill Gurley: Yeah. There’s a lot of talk out there, but it all started when Microsoft invested in OpenAI. OpenAI agreed to buy services from Microsoft, which is called a circular deal because you’re giving them money they wouldn’t have otherwise. And when Dario was on stage at DealBook last week, he said, “Oh, I can explain this. It’s not that hard.” Amazon wanted us to spend money we didn’t have, so they gave us even more money. And I’m like, “Well, that’s precisely why this is a questionable behavior.” But it’s gotten bigger. NVIDIA’s handed out money and then NVIDIA gave CoreWeave money, but then also agreed to buy any services they have left over. This stuff’s not ideal. Like if you were to say, “What’s crisp, clean accounting?” You wouldn’t do these things. And some of them say, “Well, it’s not material.” And which I would say, “Well, then why are you doing it?” And I’ve asked other people to try and understand how even big, sophisticated companies might get speculative using a word from previous discussion. And I hear things like, “Well, loss aversion tends to go down when you’re winning.” Like if you’re on a hot streak in a casino, you take more risk, things like that. But it is surprising to me. So when it comes to retail investors, I would be particularly concerned for them at this stage in the AI game because there is a plethora of SPV vehicles, but you’ve heard that phrase, I’m sure, SPV. This is where someone has an in on an investment and they do a one-off VC fund, if you will. Tim Ferriss: A special purpose vehicle. Bill Gurley: Yeah. It’s a single entity just for that one — Tim Ferriss: We have a chance to invest in X. We have an allocation of however much money, and then they can allow Jane Doe and John Doe potentially — Bill Gurley: And they take a rake on it. And there’s people promoting SPVs in situations where they don’t even actually have the underlying stock, or maybe they hope to get it. It’s the wild, wild west. And most of the people on that edge, I would put in the category of interloper carpet bagger. These are people that have come to this thing, and I just think you got to be quite careful. The investments that were made that have already had 100 X plus returns were made a while ago before this thing started. And that’s not to say there won’t be an incremental AI investment that makes money, I think there will, but your odds right now of that being the case are really, really low. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I would add to that and say, and this applies to me as much as anyone else, but your actual risk tolerance may differ, probably does differ significantly from your perceived risk tolerance if you haven’t had a huge drawdown, right? If you haven’t actually ridden a few of those waves and see how you respond in those circumstances, and you should be, I suppose, skeptical of how you view your own intestinal fortitude with some of those things, or maybe the losses you can absorb. Because I recall, for instance, I’ve seen this many, many times, but with these types of SPVs, people get involved, and let’s just say they’re not typically an angel investor, they don’t have the experience of watching 60%, 70%, 80% of their investments go to zero or become the walking dead, and they sign off on all of the, not necessarily waivers, but they accept, accept, accept the SBV terms of service, which I’ll say, “You could lose all of your investment. This is incredibly risky.” But then when it does go to zero, the financial and psychological impact is catastrophic. Bill Gurley: There’s a lot of people, and I think this comes from a very good place. I think they’re very well intentioned who look at the world and say — well, first of all, rising inequality, why can’t everyone have access to the same things? And then companies are staying private longer. So they say, we need to institutionalize the generic public’s ability to invest in private companies. And the problem, I think there’s two problems. One you just hinted at, which is most private company VC backed even go to zero, like the majority, which is not something people really — they sense that they want the lottery ticket, they want the Uber, they want the one that goes to the moon, but they don’t understand that that comes along with it. Tim Ferriss: They don’t want to buy losing lottery tickets for 12 years. Bill Gurley: Right. Right. Exactly. And the second problem is the information transparency in the private company game is just low. And I think the institutional investors have come to understand that and know what they’re getting into and know how to evaluate things. But if you come at it with a public market mindset thinking, “Oh, every set of financials I’ve been handed is audited and is correct.” And that’s just not the case. It’s super loosey-goosey. Tim Ferriss: So if you were, this may be a difficult question, but if you were angel investing right now, how would you be thinking about your approach? Bill Gurley: I’ll tell you a funny story. When I decided to hang up my gloves, if you will, and stop making institutional venture capital investments, I had a whole bunch of ideas about what I wanted to do next. And one of them was, “Oh, I’ll do a bunch of angel investing.” Bezos did it on the side. This would be fantastic. Tim Ferriss: He did pretty well with his angel investing. Bill Gurley: I was explaining this to a, I won’t say who it is, but a Silicon Valley CEO, very successful. And he said, “What are you going to do now?” And I said, “I was thinking of doing angel investing.” He goes, “Why would you do that?” He said, “I got 50 of these things. People don’t return my calls.” He goes, “I wish I’d never done it.” So there’s a unglamorous side to it as much as there is a glamorous side. And you’ve participated in this world before. So what would I say? I think if I were doing angel investments, I’d try and find in an intersection of people that are super curious and are playing with all these AI tools, but bring a perspective from a particular industry that gives them an advantage in that area where they could simultaneously be maybe the smartest user of AI in their genre, in their vertical. Tim Ferriss: So despite the, or maybe because of, because we talked about the pair, the AI bubble, you would still be looking at AI intersected opportunities if you were angel investing. Bill Gurley: Yeah. There’s a weird reality out there right now, and this could end if ever a bubble has popped or whatever, but the institutional investors have zero interest in non-AI deals. Zero. It’s more black and white than I could be successful in — Tim Ferriss: And for people who do not know the term, define the institutional investor. Bill Gurley: People who are paid both a salary and a piece of the return to be active investors of other people’s money, using other people’s money. But the reason that kind of matters is if you angel fund a deal and have any hope of it raising money in the future, if it’s not AI related, right now — Tim Ferriss: Could die of neglect. Bill Gurley: There is no interest. I can’t state clearly enough how there’s zero interest. And I could simultaneously make fun of that reality, but I could also justify that reality, but it is the reality right now. And by the way, while I mention that, I feel obligated for your audience. I don’t care what field you’re in, you should be playing with this stuff. It has the potential to impact your role in your career, and the best way to protect against any risk of your career being obfuscated or eliminated from AI is to be the most AI-enabled version of yourself you can possibly be. PREROLL Tim Ferriss: How would you think about, maybe you can give a hypothetical example of looking for someone who has very, very sophisticated domain expertise and experience who’s now intersecting with AI and has a unique, because of the combination perspective on things, to invest in as an angel investor and separate that from something that’s just going to be consumed by the fundamental models and these larger companies that — Bill Gurley: From a career perspective or — Tim Ferriss: From an angel investment perspective, how would you pick folks you don’t think are just going to end up working on something that gets replicated in short order by the bigger companies? Bill Gurley: Yeah. The key is just to stay pretty far away from the edge of whatever. You can go online and see interviews with the people at Anthropic or OpenAI and what they’re working on. If it’s the next thing they’re going to do, I don’t think you’re going to be protected. But as I think about founders and angel investors, you’re talking about a pretty broad array of things. At this point, as I mentioned earlier, you’re not going to back the next big model company. Besides, if you were, you need a billion dollar angel investment to go make that happen. It’s just really, the game’s changed. There’s so much money involved. And so I think you’re going to want to be off the beaten path anyway. When I think about these deeper verticals, I don’t think it will make sense for OpenAI to go crush every little vertical. Tim Ferriss: Waste management. Bill Gurley: And even if the model’s capable of understanding that subject matter, there are workflows, there are data sets that are local to your customer, and that stuff has to be stitched together. So I think having an understanding of a particular industry and one that’s not going to be on the next thing to do list at OpenAI, it would probably be your best bet. Tim Ferriss: Got it. So is it fair to say, if I’m understanding you correctly, that effectively looking for something that would not be a high priority for one of these larger companies and also a proprietary dataset of some type? Bill Gurley: Proprietary datasets, the more workflows that exist are better because you can build software around those things that — Tim Ferriss: What is a workflow? Bill Gurley: The thing that popped into my head, I’m on the board of Zillow. Zillow’s been investing for the past five years in tools that help the realtor do their day-to-day job. They have a tool called Showing Time that helps you book in person tours at houses as an example, but there’s putting the mortgage together, getting the sign-offs on. There’s just all these tasks that have to be happened that can be automated in the — And so tasks that can be automated, that can be integrated with AI, the more of that stuff you can build into a system, the better off you’re going to be protecting yourself from a model that just answers questions, which is why I brought it up. Tim Ferriss: All right. Let’s move on to big topic, big country, China. You spent 10 days there over the past summer. What was your experience? What did you see? What made an impression? What did you do? Bill Gurley: Yeah. I’d been about six times before, so this is like my seventh trip. It was one thing that was different. My daughter is an Asian studies major, as you were, and she spent the summer in Hong Kong. So we picked her up and then we toured six cities in 10 days. And my objective with this trip, in the past trips, it was mostly just to meet with entrepreneurs and founders and mutual sharing of information, that thing. This time I was more interested in just kind of being eyes wide open and learning. And so we took two of the high speed trains just as an experience that I got a tour of the Xiaomi factory with their new car, the SU7, and was trying to get a feel for what’s most recent there. And we went to Shenzhen, the overnight city, which has gone from, I think, less than 100,000 people in 1980 to 20 million people. And just to see the scale and scope of the whole thing, there’s a lot of rhetoric in the US about what is or isn’t happening in China. And I just wanted to have a better feel for it. And we’re making policy decisions that are going to impact the global footprint, and God forbid, end up in a World War three situation. So anyway, I just wanted a better understanding. I was aided by the fact that Dan Wang shared his book Breakneck with me right before I left, and I read it while I was there, which was interesting. And then it came out, and of course it ended up on the bestseller list. But I think China’s misperceived in a lot of ways. Tim Ferriss: What are some of those misperceptions? Bill Gurley: The biggest one is that people who have a rudimentary understanding of what is happening there, you use this word communism to infer a lot of other things. And one of the things that’s inferred by communism is top down state run system. And I think they think of Russia and they assume, “Well, that’ll always lead to bad capital allocation, no innovation.” Because they have this picture in their mind of these, I don’t know, brick buildings, like with snow all around them and not much happening. And the reality there is just far, far different from that. I think Dan Wang did a great job of explaining how the country puts out this five-year plan, but then the provinces, which they’re a lot bigger than a US state, but they’re the equivalent, like it’s how the country segment and they compete with each other. And the effective mayor of the province, if he does well, has a chance to move up in the system, which is not a reality in the US system. But what that leads to is just a massive amount of competition and — Tim Ferriss: What are the metrics by which they’re being judged? Do you have any idea on a province level? Is it some equivalent of GDP? It’s not the right term, but — Bill Gurley: I’m guessing probably we could go talk to AI and get a better answer than I have right now. But yeah, I would think that’s part of it, prosperity, employment, those things. By the way, this provincial competition has also led to overbuild of buildings. It’s not always positive, bridges that aren’t used, there’s a Go cities. Go cities, yes. But you end up with hyper competition. So I think the thing that a lot of people in Silicon Valley love about capitalism is this notion of the invisible hand and competition that leads to innovation and best practice, and the winners rise up and they’re better for it. That is happening there. And if you read about the solar industry or the EV industry or now the robotics industry, they have hundreds of different companies competing in these fields and it’s brutal competition. And as a result of that, they’re ending up with very innovative companies, which once again, I think people wouldn’t prescribe to being possible in a communist world and remarkable execution from an industrial standpoint. So the price points of the products that will be sold around the globe are well below anything that could be done in the US. Tim Ferriss: How do you go about getting a tour of Xiaomi factory? I would think that they would be very closed about that. What’s in it for them and how do they — Bill Gurley: I don’t know if you saw this going around the internet yesterday, but they shipped a car to this YouTuber. Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah. I saw it. Yeah. Absolutely. Bill Gurley: Which is brilliant. And he did like a 15 — that’s the SG7, that’s the factory I went to. As I mentioned, I’d been there before, so I met Lei Jun, who’s the Founder of Xiaomi in 2005 when he was chairman of Joyo, which was a E-commerce company that Amazon bought. So he’s been around a while. He has evolved into, the best thing I could say is he’s the Steve Jobs of China right now. When he quit doing Joyo and he had this other company as well, he declared 10 years ago he was going to build a smartphone. Just out of the blue, I’m going to build a smartphone. He didn’t have any smartphone experience, but Xiaomi’s now the third-largest manufacturer of handsets in the globe. And about four or five years ago, at about the exact same time Apple hinted they were interested in building a car, he said, “I’m going to build a car.” Tim Ferriss: Well, not only did he say I’m going to build a car, but that was a response to sanctions. That was an emergency. Well, I listened to the translation of, even though my Chinese is decent, but it’s not as good as it once was. I think it was 2024 company-wide address where he talked about the sanctions coming in saying, “What if we couldn’t make phones? What would we do? Bill Gurley: But that talk is unbelievable, and it’s translated on YouTube, and I would encourage people to watch from about minute 30 to about an hour 15, which is where he talks about his process for designing the car. I don’t know if you saw that part. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I did. Bill Gurley: But it’s crazy. He says, he put a note on any car in his parking lot that he had never drove, and he would ask each employee to give him three positives, three negatives and loan them the car. Said he drove 200 of his employees cars. When you hear that stuff, you’re like, “Wow, I wonder if anyone at Apple did that.” It’s just such a bottom up, just ground truth way to start the process. But even still, even if he did that, a bunch of people could do that. How do you have the wherewithal to build a factory? He’d never built a factory before. And I’ve been in other car factories here in the US. It was phenomenal. Anyway, back to your question why I could get in. I knew Lei Jun from way back when. Tim Ferriss: What does the process look like? Are there a bunch of clearances and you have to get the okay from the provincial? Bill Gurley: I don’t think we went through the whole factory, but no, it wasn’t that. They’re a public company. I think they’re interested in being well understood, which I think hints at why they enabled this. I think they had to send a car to this guy, the YouTuber. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: And by the way, the President of Ford went over there about six months before I did, went on the same tour, so they let him go there. And he had an SU7 shipped to Michigan, and he drove it for several weeks and he’s talked about how incredible it is. Tim Ferriss: Well, he also, if I’m remembering correctly, has talked about EV production, and battery dominance or at least component dominance from China and the risks inherent in that. And I don’t want to bleed too far into geopolitics, but it’s hard not to pull it into the conversation. So this is a question from X, the artist formerly known as Twitter, one of many questions. But I’ll ask, what are your top handful of critiques say of the Chinese tech ecosystem or CCP after going on a tour there? What would you say they’re not doing well or things that complicate their ability to compete? Bill Gurley: Well, the first one that’s I think been well publicized is when an entrepreneur has risen to a level of success and then uses that as a platform, the government seems uninterested in that. Tim Ferriss: Exhibit A. Bill Gurley: The Jack Ma. Tim Ferriss: Jack Ma. Bill Gurley: Yeah, exactly. And there’s a saying that I think I heard while I was over there, “Don’t be the tallest tree.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah, this is, Don’t Be The Tallest Tree. Yeah, the nail that sticks out gets hammered down in Japan. They have a totally different system obviously. Bill Gurley: The other entrepreneur outside of Lei Jun is the ByteDance CEO. And ByteDance is probably got the leading position for the consumer AI, like Open AI, but over there right now, in addition to just incredible revenue growth. This is the company that owned TikTok and whatnot, but they’re not going public and you don’t see him at all, which may get to this tallest tree thing. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, celebrities also disappear over there. Bill Gurley: No doubt. Tim Ferriss: Very mysteriously. Bill Gurley: Yes. Well, and business people. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: So yes, that does happen. Tim Ferriss: I will say, and for people who are wondering, because there are a lot of — how should we put this? There are people who are very angry, very hawkish. Some people are very, very supportive, and then their agendas or alliances get questioned. I, like you, I’m just interested in understanding what is happening to the extent that I can. What is the actual truth on the ground? What are the details? And frankly, the innovation over there is remarkable. And what they’ve done in terms of establishing access to rare metals and everything they need to manufacture is remarkable. You go to South America or Africa, and it is Chinese everywhere on infrastructure projects. They’ve been very, very smart about it. So I’m deeply interested in all of it, and please hold your thought because I want to hear everything you have to say. What I would say is a piece of the three-dimensional chess that I’ve been impressed with is how well the Chinese government is able to — well, of course they’re able to integrate with the private sector so that they’re able to use, in a sense, products to widen their scope of access potentially. Like DJI, for instance, great example. People have a lot of questions around these cars, as spectacular as they might be. Are they an extension of surveillance? These are open questions that I think are worth asking. But you were about to say something, so I’ll let you — Bill Gurley: No, no, no. I think let’s come to that. Let me make one point and then let’s come to that. So there’s two other things I wanted to mention. Obviously, infrastructure. So they are building new nuclear fission plants. So fission being old school, not new school, at one fourth the price that we do it here in the US. So is South Korea, by the way. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. And the numbers are incredible. Bill Gurley: But when we sit here and say, “Oh, we want to re-shore manufacturing, and they can build things at one fourth the price we can.” If you don’t solve that, you’re going to re-shore something and we’re going to not be price competitive globally. And then because you won’t import what they have, and you’re going to make our citizens buy from this new factory where we’re making things way more expensive, it doesn’t work. Tim Ferriss: The math doesn’t math. Bill Gurley: It doesn’t work. And by the way, I’m not sure it brings jobs. The Xiaomi factory was a third based on some numbers I was able to acquire, a third the number of employees per car output. And I got to believe in 10 years it’ll be a sixth. And so you could calculate the total number of jobs that you’d be bringing back if you brought back all this car production and it’d be hundreds of thousands. It’s not millions and millions of jobs. So anyway, that infrastructure thing’s for real. And I think Dan Wong does a good job of saying that America’s run by lawyers. Tim Ferriss: And this is the author of Breakneck. Bill Gurley: Our country’s run by lawyers and theirs is run by engineers. Engineers. And so when you try and build something here, the lawyers just get in the way and try and block it, which certainly when you hear Elon talks about why the Gigafactory is here in Austin and not in California, it all relates to those things. So anyway, that’s infrastructure. There’s another thing that’s I think quite interesting, which is the government may not care about whether or not their companies have really big market caps. And when I first realized this, you saw what happened when they took down Alibaba when they went after Jack Ma, and Amp Financial could have been this big thing and it got a haircut, and you question, well, do they care? And if you are pushing your companies to be low cost providers, maybe that’s at odds with them being hyper profitable and really big. And then you can turn around and ask the question. Hearing that caused me to ask the question, does America really benefit by the fact that the Mag Seven have $3 trillion market caps? I know the employees of those companies do, but is that a sign of our competitive capitalistic society not being truly competitive? Tim Ferriss: On a global scale. Bill Gurley: No, even within. There’s a notion you learn about in economics classes called pure competition. And in pure competition, no one has an intellectual property advantage. Marginal profits are whittled down just to the cost of capital, and the consumer benefits because there’s no excessive profit capture. If we have all these companies that are able to have excessive profits, is that a form of market failure? And does the fact that they exist help America in any way? At first, of course I’m a venture capitalist. I want to think, yes, of course. But then as I think about it, I don’t know that our government, or our society, or our people are better off because these six companies have $3 trillion market caps. It’s not that many people that — the percentage of the country that’s employed by those companies is small on an overall basis. And so anyway, I think they have a different perspective on whether big market caps matter, and I think that is somewhat intriguing. Tim Ferriss: What do you think about the innovation in China leading in some cases to the development of superior technology at a lower cost, that is plausibly an extension of the intelligence gathering apparatus of the government? Is that a real thing? Bill Gurley: I’m not in a good place to know. Tim Ferriss: I would have to imagine it seems like they would have to be stupid not to use that given their ability to penetrate the private sector. Bill Gurley: Yeah. I think it’s certainly well known that they do surveillance of their own people. I know that would be particularly upsetting to people like Greg Luciano that runs FIRE and is very interested in free speech. The flip side is there’s very little street crime. You walk around, you don’t worry about that when you’re there. Tim Ferriss: It’s true also in Japan though, right? Bill Gurley: It doesn’t make it right or wrong. It is what it is. And I don’t know that we have this ability to tell them how they have to do it. Now, to the extent that the Huawei stuff where their products are being shipped out, and then those are used to gather intelligence out of their country and the rest of the world, of course that’s a problem. But I think the way to deal with it, I’m not a politician, but I think the way to deal with it — I’m more of a believer of the engage. Engage, talk about what you don’t like and what you do like, and try and negotiate that problem away like we’re trying to do with the fentanyl precursors. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Well, way back in the day when I was an East Asian studies major, this was lifetimes ago. And keeping in mind, I was at the Capitol University of Business Economics in 1996. That was the bicycle era, these old photographs of Beijing with millions of bicycles with people in their long green jackets. I had one of those jackets for the winters. It gets really cold. But things have changed a lot. At the time, I was looking forward and thinking I might be one of those people who could engage in Chinese. I think the way to do it is in English, frankly, for a whole host of reasons. But even if you speak the other language, Putin speaks English pretty well, but he does all of his negotiations when he’s speaking in Russian for a lot of good reasons, the same good reasons. Bill Gurley: I get that. But look, so first of all, I do get accused of being like an agent of the CCP or something, even by some of the people that responded to your Twitter thing. I’m not. I’ve only visited a few times. I don’t know anybody in the government, but I worry greatly that we make bad policy decisions if we misunderstand what’s really going on. Tim Ferriss: Oh, I agree with that. Yeah, I fully agree with that. I’ve thought about — I frankly am worried about it. I would take a burner phone and a burner laptop. I’ve thought about it, because I want to get a better understanding of the culture of innovation that can be fostered, and exactly how things are to the extent that it would be visible to me, how things are developing in China. I’ve thought about going there. I thought about doing the same thing in India, too, to go and interview 10 of the top entrepreneurs. But the reason I haven’t done it is that I’m just like, I don’t know what radars that’s going to put me on, what surveillance, what fill in the blank, how difficult is it going to be? Whose rings am I going to have to kiss? Am I overthinking it or is it straightforward? Bill Gurley: I think you’re overthinking it. I think the odds that Tim Ferriss would disappear in China is really [inaudible 00:44:26]. Tim Ferriss: Oh, I’m not worried about disappearing. That would be a terrible — the upside downside on that doesn’t make any sense. I’m not worried about disappearing. Bill Gurley: There are companies that may not speak with you. When I was there, DeepSeek and Unitree, the word was out on the street that they’re not meeting with Westerners for reasons that are — Tim Ferriss: Well, I’m sure that’s true conversely in the US too, right? Bill Gurley: Yes. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I’m sure that’s — and by the way, I think that reflective lens, when you think about the country is helpful. When Alex Karp was just on stage at DealBook last week, he was talking about surveillance and he says, “Well, of course our tools are used to surveil the enemy.” And I’m like, “Okay, well, my God, the Chinese are surveilling us, but obviously we’re surveilling them too. Let’s be honest about these things.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah. It’s a lot easier for a bunch of obvious reasons. It’s in some respects, a lot easier for them to surveil us than the other way around. Partially just due to the homogeneity of the society over there. You can’t send a bunch of blonde-haired, blue eyes, black, Latino, whatever, to China to end up at top universities, top companies, et cetera. It’s just a lot harder. Bill Gurley: By the way, to put a bow on this part, I would say there’s two other things. One, you hinted at. One, the supply chains are so integrated in China down to the raw material level, that even if you brought a factory back here, it’d be more of an assembly shop and you’d still be sourcing from there, which isn’t necessarily cost competitive. And to replicate all of it would take a very, very, very long time. Tim Ferriss: Well, including raw materials for staple pharmaceuticals, There’s a lot going on. So what at this point, is it a day late and a dollar short for the US? I know I almost promised we weren’t going to go into this, but I want to know your opinion. I’m so curious. What are the keys to the US remaining globally competitive and vibrant as an economy? You hinted to one, which is, it seems inevitable, nuclear power or more power. So how do you do that? I’m not sure how quickly you can right the ship, although it seems like a handful of people have done a pretty good job of changing the narrative. What are some of the key things in your opinion that the US needs to do? Bill Gurley: One is make it easier to build. Tim Ferriss: Build companies? Build? Bill Gurley: I think build infrastructure. If you’re going to build semiconductor plants, if you’re going to build nuclear plants on time and on budget, that’s very hard to do in the US right now. And the glimmer of hope I would say is that a few states seem to have governors that want to get stuff out of the way. And I think it’s red tape and bureaucracy, and lawyers, and litigation that make this stuff so expensive. And so Texas and Arizona seem to be getting their unfair share of data centers and semiconductor plants. And I think because of that attitude, I’ve seen a similar attitude in Pennsylvania where they repaired I-95 in 12 days, but they literally had to take a bunch of statutes that are on the books and say that they don’t apply right now. So that mindset I think needs a lot more momentum. That’d be one thing. There’s another thing that I think is important for people to understand on the China front. There are numerous people with a loud microphone that will say, “Oh, they know how to scale out plants, but they don’t know how to do any innovation.” And that’s just flat wrong. Whoever’s saying that just hasn’t been there. They don’t know the facts on the ground. These entrepreneurs are every bit as good as the entrepreneurs they are here. There are examples like in LIDAR, they built a MEMS LiDAR product that’s like $130 a car. Tim Ferriss: What is MEMS LiDAR? Bill Gurley: It’s solid state. It uses solid state semiconductor technology instead of that big spinning radar. And so the LiDAR on a Waymo is $5,000. And it’s $130 for MEMS LIDAR. They’re putting it on every car. You can go into ChatGPT and say, “Tell me about MEMS LiDAR innovation in China.” But it’s a great example. Le Jun’s another one, but anybody that thinks there’s no innovation is just — Tim Ferriss: Yeah, they’re just wrong. Bill Gurley: They got blinders on. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. No, that’s not true. That’s definitely not true. I asked you two years ago if there are any countries that you’re long on. At the time, I’d be curious if this is still the case. You said you’re long on the UK, less regulatory capture. Bill Gurley: Did I say that? Tim Ferriss: Losing party pay is in the legal system. Bill Gurley: I do love that. Tim Ferriss: Which reduces frivolous litigation compared to the US. Any thoughts on where you’re bullish these days? Bill Gurley: Well, ironically, Matt Ridley was in town a few weeks ago in Austin. Tim Ferriss: The Rational Optimist, other books. Bill Gurley: I love his stuff, but he would say that I would be dead wrong on that. Things aren’t going well there. And he lives there. So I’ll just take that as I got that one wrong. Tim Ferriss: Well, it depends on the timeframe too. Is it two years, or is it five years or is it 10 years? Bill Gurley: One of the things that’s been impressive about China is since Deng Xiaoping brought back capitalism, 500 million people have come out of poverty. And you look at countries that have a very strong work ethic, and a high education, and a currently low per populate income, and you would think more jobs would come their way. So two that would pop for me are Vietnam and Turkey, who check all those boxes. Tim Ferriss: All right. Bill Gurley: Hopefully I do better then. Tim Ferriss: Check in in another two years. All right. So let’s talk about, this is going to be a segue to talking about Runnin’ Down a Dream and all things involved with that. Maybe we could start with an anecdote from a fellow Austinite, likes to play the bongos, long hair, associated with smoking reefer every once in a while. Matthew, we were talking about a short anecdote about Matthew before we started recording. Would you mind sharing that? Bill Gurley: Yeah. As I was preparing, as I was wrapping up the book, I started listening to Greenlights, and I was told you had to listen to it because of course he reads it. So you get all the great McConaughey affectations as you read it. But there’s a story in it that just popped in my brain and summarized exactly what I’m trying to accomplish with this book, Runnin’ Down a Dream. And he had spent the vast majority of his young adult life—so this anecdote is from when he was like 20, 21—telling his family he was going to be a lawyer. And so he’d gotten into the University of Texas. He was Pre-Law. Every time he went home, he talked about, “Yeah, I’m going to be a lawyer.” And he had met some people at Texas that had convinced him that he should switch to film school. And he had immense anxiety about sharing this with his father. This is all in the book, but his father’s a very tough individual. And so reason to be fearful when you’re going to drop some news. “I’m no longer going to be a lawyer. I’m going to go to film school.” And he builds it up a lot in the book. I didn’t know when I was going to talk to him. You can imagine being in that situation, you’re delaying, delaying, delaying. But he finally tells his dad and his dad utters this very simple phrase, “Well, don’t half ass it.” And he says, “Of all the reactions he could have had, don’t half ass it were the last words I expected to hear and the best words he could have ever said to me.” And he said in that single moment, he gave him blessing, consent, approval, validation, privilege, honor, freedom, and responsibility, called it rocket fuel. And I’d like to believe there are a number of people out there, young adults, maybe even some midlife career who have this notion that they should be doing something else, but society has put them on a path, or just the way they matriculated through college, put them into a career that they just don’t love and that they have this inkling that they could go do this thing. Or maybe you’re a young kid and you really want to do X, but everybody else is telling you to do A, B and C. I want to help them have the confidence and permission to go do X, to go chase this dream. And as you hinted at from our last call, I think the amount of your ability to make connections and to gather information and learn on your own pace, has never been better. You can literally just sit there and talk to ChatGPT six hours a day if you so choose, and learn so much about any particular field. And so your ability to take things into your own hands, and to go try and be successful in this thing that you feel passionate about, I think has never been better. Tim Ferriss: Why do you think when you initially gave and subsequently had to go online, Runnin’ Down a Dream as a presentation, why do you think that took? Why did it strike a chord in the way that it did? What do you think it was? Bill Gurley: Well, I think we’ve built a society, like nobody’s fault. We just have built a society where we love to celebrate people that are successful in a lot of different fields, but when it comes to our own children, we tend to think way more pragmatically about what they should be doing. Lawyers, consultants, doctors, computer scientists, it’s all these jobs that have certainty to the financial component. And I think that’s so well intended. I don’t think there’s mal intent of anyone in the system. And I’m a parent of three, I’ve been through this. You just feel this obligation to try and push them towards prosperity, but it’s not intellectual prosperity, it’s not happiness, it’s financial. Tim Ferriss: Stability. Bill Gurley: Yes, that most people are guiding children towards. And this isn’t that complicated math, but most people end up working 80,000 hours in their life. It’s a third of your life. Why do something you don’t like? There’s Gallup poll data on career engagement and 59% of people say they’re not engaged at work. And this is that whole quiet quitting thing that we hear so much about. And some of these numbers are at an all-time low. It just seems horrific that people are sauntering through life. Tim Ferriss: So what are some of the keys to taking the path less traveled then in this case? And there are a few I highlighted for myself, but where should we start? I highlighted one for myself. We don’t have to start here, but go where the action is. I just think this is so underrated, and people further undervalue it maybe in a digital world, but we can start anywhere you want. That’s just one that really jumped out to me because I think it’s really underrated. But where would you like to start? Bill Gurley: I think in the book, one of the things that we tie together very early on is the interplay between passion, or fascination, or curiosity and learning. And the way to be most successful in any endeavor, but certainly if you’re going to go tilt it something that’s less pragmatic, is to be the smartest, most knowledgeable person you can possibly be. And knowledge is free now, as we’ve talked about. And I have this test for whether or not you’re actually truly passionate about what you’re trying to do, which is do you self-learn on your own time? Would you not watch Breaking Bad and read about this field and be energized by that activity? If you are, and we have 20, 30 different stories in the book of people that have been successful, almost all of them check that box. You just have this amazing ability to gain knowledge so much faster than everyone else you would be competing with. And that’s going to be useful. That’s unquestionably going to be useful. Tim Ferriss: I mean, it makes me think of an interview I saw a long time ago, actually. It was quite a few years ago, but it was an interview with Joe Rogan and he said something that surprised me, it might surprise a lot of people, which was along the lines of he’s not good at, it was either willpower or discipline, which he’s in great shape. Obviously he’s black belt in jujitsu. He’s done what he’s done with the podcast. He’s the undisputed king of podcasting, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. And he said, “I’m not actually good at whether it was discipline or willpower, but I am good at obsession. It’s all on or all off.” And I’ve seen that, I’m sure you’ve seen this in a lot of the entrepreneurs who actually make it to the other side and create these mega successes, they are just obsessed. Bill Gurley: No doubt. Tim Ferriss: And that gives them a huge, not just knowledge advantage, but endurance advantage. You just go down the checkboxes. It’s all advantages, and — Bill Gurley: I had the opportunity to talk to Angela Duckworth when I was working on this and her book, Grit, talks about two components, passion and perseverance. And I heard a podcast she had done recently where she said if she could go back, she would put far more weight on the passion and the perseverance because she says, “We’ve taught our children to grind.” And so once again, starting in sixth grade, they’re told to learn the flute and take lacrosse and do all this stuff and crush the SATs and take the extra credit classes and all this. And they all do it and they all do it. And then they go to college and, “Oh, how are you doing?” They take six hours of class instead of four and they’re just going. But eventually she says, “If you don’t have that passion, you just burn out.” And so you’re right about the energy part. I think it’s both knowledge and you’ve put in more cycles. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. It makes me think of, maybe this is cliched in Silicon Valley because it gets so oft repeated, but a lot of folks listening will not have heard it, which is if you’re looking for the next technological breakthrough or something on the edge, look for what the nerds are doing on the weekends. But it’s not just a great way to find what might be coming around the corner in a few years. It’s a great way to find the people to bet on who are already using their excess, their free time to work on these things. Bill Gurley: No doubt. Tim Ferriss: I think of [inaudible 01:01:43] and 3D printing. I mean, I can just go down the list. How do you — Bill Gurley: And by the way, that’s another advantage of going to the epicenter is there’s more people doing that all the time. Tim Ferriss: Maybe you could, let’s talk about, people might be surprised by this, but Bob Dylan. I think this is just the quintessential example. Why is he relevant to what we’re talking about? Bill Gurley: When this idea popped in my head, I had finished a third biography and contrasted it with these other two and I just saw all these patterns. VC is a game of pattern recognition I guess my brain has just developed. I was like, “Oh, my God, it’s all this lock thing where these three people had all done the same thing.” And one was a basketball coach, one was a restaurateur and the other was Bob Dylan, not people you would, not industry, “Oh, this is where you should get career development advice.” There’s a part of the Dylan story that most people wouldn’t know unless they had read all the biographies or maybe seen the Scorsese documentary. But the new movie misses the whole thing, which is the pre-New York Bob Dylan was hanging out in Minnesota studying folk music at such a deep level that I feel confident in saying when he left, he knew more about folk music than any other human in Minnesota. And he was borrowing, and maybe that’s even a euphemism. He was stealing his friends albums, he was going into the record store, into these listening booths. He knew all there was to know and had studied every bit of it. And he’s referred to by Scorsese as a music expeditionary. And the people that knew him in New York said he could mimic any one song. It’s not what you would think of when you hear a Dylan song that he had mastered the bedrock underneath and then started innovating. Picasso, by the way, the same thing, perfect realist painter at age 14. If you go to the Barcelona Picasso Museum, it’s in geographic order and you’re shocked at how good a realist this kid was before he went and did this other thing. That bedrock knowledge I think is so differentiating for someone to have all the history and then to start doing the innovation. Tim Ferriss: What was the before and after on Dylan, Minnesota, New York City? And why is that such an important piece of the puzzle? Bill Gurley: By the way, and just to even pile on more on this studious part of Bob Dylan, he did a podcast series for a while where he just walks through all these different genres of music and he’s — Tim Ferriss: You’re talking about Bob Dylan himself? Bill Gurley: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Oh, I didn’t realize this. Bill Gurley: Yes, yes. You can go find it. He stopped, but he’s — and then that book he put out of the 50 best songs, the coffee table book that came out two years ago, it’s incredible the amount of knowledge he has about songs outside of his genre, everything. He’s a clear student of what he’s doing. I think this is well known and is covered at the beginning of the movie. He went to New York to find Woody Guthrie, probably the single most deterministic and ambitious mentor pursuit story that I’ve ever heard of. He hitchhiked there with no money and found him and became friends with him. Tim Ferriss: I mean, this echoes back to go where the action is also, right? Bill Gurley: Oh, no doubt. And by the way, he landed in Manhattan at the center of the folk music scene and all those people he was studying when he was listening in Minnesota, they were all there and he got to know them all. If that doesn’t happen, I don’t think Dylan happens. Tim Ferriss: How relevant do you think the go where the action is now considering the access to information using ChatGPT or other tools, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera? Maybe less so access to mentors, although you can have virtual relationships, but how relevant do you think that is? I’ve got my own opinion, but — Bill Gurley: You could certainly have the type of peer and mentor experiences that are remote. I have a great anecdote about MrBeast in the book that we could talk about that was a remote one, but the benefits of being in and around a whole bunch of people that are chasing the same thing is so high. And I think the intuition is, “Oh, well, it’s going to be even more competitive, so why would I go? Wouldn’t it be better to try and do this in a town where it’s less of a big deal?” But the problem is your learning is impacted, your access to peers and mentors is drastically reduced, and then probably most importantly, your optionality gets cut so dramatically. People think that a lot of success stories, they attribute it to luck, but there’s that famous saying, luck is when preparation meets opportunity. And when you’re in the epicenter, both your preparation and your opportunity go up 10 X. And so your ability to just have that lucky moment where you get brought into something is so much higher. Tim Ferriss: The lucky moment is, I think, really important to underscore in terms of going where the action is because there’s a lot you can do virtually, but let’s just say you’re using ChatGPT, you’re going to get what you prompt. In other words, you’re asking for something and that can take you down a rabbit hole, but there, at least in my lived experience, and certainly I still see this happening, when I moved to Silicon Valley in 2000, and then I look back at my angel investing career, I look back at all these collaborations, the vast majority of them did not come from me going out with an agenda and seeking something. They came from serendipitous bumping into somebody at a coffee shop. I literally met Naval Ravikant because I was hitting on his girlfriend at the time when she was getting her coffee, didn’t realize they were together. And then you look at Garrett Camp, Kevin Rose. These are, at a barbecue I met Kevin Rose. And you go down the list and you look at all of these formative, massively impactful, personally and professionally relationships. They almost all came from serendipity and you just don’t seem to get that density unless you’re in the center of the action. And perhaps it’s easier to relocate yourself, I’m sure it is, when you have fewer responsibilities, but God, I can’t even imagine what my life would have looked like had I not left Long Island and then ultimately moved to Silicon Valley. Bill Gurley: Yeah, and same for me. I had thought about the notion of venture capital and practicing it and probably would have jumped at any job I could have got. Like when I was at McCombs here in Austin, I tried to get an interview at Austin Ventures. I didn’t get one, but had they said yes, maybe I practiced there. And I’m glad that didn’t happen. Going and practicing it where I did was the exact right place to do it. I do think if you can, if you can, because there are financial constraints, and if you want to be great at a field and that field has an epicenter, I think you should go. Tim Ferriss: And there are different types of epicenters too. You think about, let’s just say AI, not to repeatedly bang that drum, but you could just say, okay, AI, first thing that comes to mind, Silicon Valley, but this is going to be a bit of a digression, but I remember asking Derek Sivers, a friend of mine, amazing entrepreneur, philosopher programmer, people can look him up, but I asked him, “Who’s the first person who comes to mind when you think of the word successful?” And he said, “Well, actually the most interesting or more interesting question might be who’s the third person who comes to mind?” Because I might say something really obvious like Richard Branson, but is he successful? I don’t really know what his goals were. I’d have to compare his goals to his outcomes. And then you get to the third. Similarly, with an epicenter, you could say Silicon Valley first, but there might be something that is dense in learning, but has other advantages like, I think it’s the University of Waterloo, but one of these universities where industry is trying to raid the academic program because it’s so strong in terms of teaching the technical side. There’s so many different ways to approach it, but let’s talk about a virtual example. You mentioned MrBeast. Could you describe that story? Bill Gurley: Yeah. I actually heard it on a podcast, but I also got a chance to talk to Jimmy Donaldson, so we got it firsthand. When he was infatuated with YouTube, he was one of the first people that was infatuated with YouTube, his parents were rightfully trying to get him to go to school and college, which he wasn’t doing because he was playing around on YouTube all day. He met three other people who were equally fascinated with YouTube. And this is a virtual epicenter story, but it’s really a peer story. One of my six principles is embrace your peers. And I think far too many people have sharp elbows to peers because they think they’re climbing the ladder and they’ve got to beat these people. And the world’s just way too prosperous to have that mindset. You can learn so much and get so much value from co-climbing that you should definitely do that. And I think it’s not taught enough and people don’t do it enough, but Jimmy happened on these three people and they got on a Skype call, he said 20 hours a day and for years — Tim Ferriss: Sounds like Jimmy. Bill Gurley: For years, they shared best practices on this call, which apparently in that world, the color of the icon on the post you do on Instagram to send them to YouTube, like all these little bitty esoteric things can impact conversion. And he said when he was talking about this, that they all became millionaires. And he said, “If you or any random individual had been a fifth person on those calls, you would have too, because of that.” And it’s just a wonderful example of how peers — he on this podcast said something that was very clever. He took the 10,000 hours thing from Gladwell and said, “Well, there were four of us spending 10,000 hours and then sharing ideas so you get 40,000 hours of expertise.” Tim Ferriss: How would you suggest people who are not on YouTube where you can identify outliers perhaps, I shouldn’t say easily. In this day and age, I mean, it’s a sea of participants, but how should people go about seeking peers? And do you rank order your principles in a way, for instance, do you want to first check the box if you can of go where the action is and then embrace your peers because the level will be higher? I think about, for instance, my experience in Silicon Valley, it could have just as easily for something else been Nashville or New York City or who knows, Shanghai. I mean, it just depends on what you’re doing. The mentors, let’s just say like Mike Maples Jr., who taught me the very basic ropes of angel investing, he definitely, without him, I don’t go zero to one in terms of having any basic literacy or access. That was the first rung on the ladder. But then once I was in, you look at people who were, in a sense, just getting started at the time. I mean, holy shit, some of them have really exploded. I mean, they’ve all done really well. Kevin Rose, Naval, Chris Sacca. The remaining — I mean, the latter goes on forever, but 49 rungs after that initial step up, zero to one, it was all peer driven. And those guys, we were comparing notes the whole way. Bill Gurley: See, that’s the thing. I would say, first of all, I would practice it wherever you are. I would practice it virtually. I’d practice it locally. And if you can move to the epicenter, I’d practice it there. I don’t know that it’s an either or thing. You can have multiple groups of peers. You can have multiple circles of peers. But I think there’s only two tests, and one is trust. There are people in this world who view everything as a zero-sum game and they will elbow you out the first chance they can get. And so those shouldn’t be your peers. Those people you should quickly push to the side. Trust and then this shared interest in learning. And if they are equally learning on their own dime in their free time, which is my test for whether you actually truly are passionate about something, if they are doing that also, that’s perfect. And those experiences you’ve talked about, I’ve had so many of them myself, they get excited to tell you what they just learned, right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Yeah. Bill Gurley: Yeah. And then you reciprocate. And by the way, Mike’s a great example. I really have both a passion and a lot of respect for people that are writers in their industry, and Buffett did it and Howard Marks did it, who I benefited greatly from. I tried my entire career to write quite a bit, but Mike does this. Mike’s very — he’s a huge sharer when it comes to his knowledge about the subject matter and it’s so great — Tim Ferriss: He is. Yeah. Pattern Breakers is an excellent book also. Bill Gurley: So great. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Yeah, Mike, I’m hoping to see him again soon. It’s been a minute. We’ve talked about MrBeast, Bob Dylan. In both cases, like poor kids with nothing to lose, in a sense. Not in any destitute sense, but they’re starting at — Bill Gurley: It’s funny — Tim Ferriss: — futons and ramen, right? Bill Gurley: He was just interviewed at DealBook also, and his mother was in the front row who apparently works for him now. He was telling the story about when he went to tell her he was dropping out of college, similar to the McConaughey story, not quite as abrupt, or Jimmy’s being more abrupt, but of course she’s happy now. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it all worked out. I mean, there’s always a little survivorship bias, but — Bill Gurley: No doubt, no doubt. Tim Ferriss: But let’s talk about Danny Meyer because I want to give an example of someone who gave something up to then pursue X instead of A, B, or C. Could you say a little bit about Danny? I’ve interviewed him on the podcast. I might have met him through you. I don’t even remember how I initially connected with him, but who is Danny Meyer and what is this Genesis story of Danny Meyer, the restaurateur? Bill Gurley: It’s funny, when someone asks me who is Danny Meyer, I feel compelled the first thing to say he’s one of the most genuine humans on the planet. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, for sure. Bill Gurley: Just a wonderful human. Tim Ferriss: For sure. Bill Gurley: But he is also one of the most celebrated restaurateurs of our time. He was working for a company that sold these devices to clip onto clothes so you can’t steal them from a retail store, and he was making good money. He was making about $200,000 a year, and this is — Tim Ferriss: At the time. Bill Gurley: — 40 years ago. Tim Ferriss: Real money. Bill Gurley: Real, real money. And he had convinced himself he was going to be a lawyer. I guess a lot of people convinced themselves of that. And he was about to take the LSAT and he was out to dinner with his uncle and his uncle was probing him and probing him and, “Oh, yeah, he’s going to take the LSAT.” And I think his uncle sensed a lack of real conviction about this thing, this person, this human was going to do. And he literally said to him, “Why are you doing this? You know you want to be a restaurateur.” And when you read Danny’s book, he did spend a ton of time in his youth being fascinated with restaurants and to the point where he would take copious notes prior to even doing this. His family had a reason to know that he had this deep passion, but it’s interesting it’s an uncle. I don’t know that a parent is going to jump in and say that, and maybe that’s an advantage I have not knowing the readers of my book and giving him this permission to do things that aren’t necessarily pragmatic. But anyway, his uncle said, “You should start a restaurant.” And he took the test. He never submitted the scores to a university and very soon thereafter enrolled in some vocational restaurant courses and took a job. He took the first job you could get, which was a front office job at a restaurant that was making about a 10th the salary that he was making in the sales job. Tim Ferriss: And went on to Gramercy Tav — I mean, all these iconic restaurants, then Shake Shack, then I mean, just dot, dot, dot, dot, dot. Bill Gurley: Yeah, and we walked through in detail his path once he made this intention, and one of the variables that my co-writer and I were looking for as we added stories to the book was this moment of intentionality. We didn’t want people that fell into a job and were successful. We wanted people that had made a decision, usually a pivot to say, “I’m going to go do this now.” And once he had made that decision, not only did he take that job, but he took advantage of being in that restaurant to learn about the multiple functions, but then he set up a tour through Europe as a stage in multiple places where he’s working for free, basically. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I’m so glad you brought this up because I wouldn’t have brought it up myself, but I’ve run — this is going to relate in a second. I’ve run a bunch of competitions for, let’s just say, creating artwork for PDFs/free books I’m going to put out or whatever, and there’s always a big hubbub where folks get, some folks get very upset and they say, “Oh, you want people to work for free?” And I’m like, “Well, there’s going to be a winner.” It’s like, if you don’t want to participate, don’t participate. But there’s always this shaking of the fist like, “Ah, it’s so unfair. You want people to work, do work for free.” When I look at almost every example of someone who became the equivalent of Danny Meyer in their world, they did a lot that was unpaid, almost always. I’m sure there are exceptions, but staging is a great example in the restaurant world where it’s like, okay, you want to work at a restaurant where you’re going to have the highest density of learning and you don’t know shit? Guess what? They probably don’t want to pay you a whole lot because it’s actually going to be a bit of a drain on their resources to show you around and teach you how to work your station and do all this stuff. I would just encourage people to not be allergic to that. And the way I got, in a sense, my foot in the door in Silicon Valley was I volunteered at TiE, The Indus Entrepreneur. Bill Gurley: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. [inaudible 01:22:33]. Tim Ferriss: I volunteered with all of these nonprofit groups and quickly realized that most volunteers are doing the absolute minimum to be volunteers. And if you just do 10% more, it doesn’t take much. I would just refill people’s water glasses and stuff after I finished taking their tickets for an event. And suddenly the producers of this event who were also doing it, but had real jobs. I mean, I had a job at a college [inaudible 01:23:00] and I was working a lot. They were like, “Wow, this kid’s a go getter because he’s refilling these water glasses. Let’s give him more responsibility.” And that’s how I ended up connecting with all these speakers and everything, just did some stuff for free on the weekends. It didn’t take a lot. Bill Gurley: There’s a story in the book that’s actually hard to believe. We profiled this woman, Jen Atkins, who’s a hairstylist. It’s an incredible story, but the one anecdote, she’s rising in her career and things are starting to work and she has jobs and she’s getting paid. She would go to Fashion Week in Paris and sneak in the back door and volunteer to do the hair of the models on stage. Snuck in. Not supposed to be there, just to get reps with these top models in this environment. Tim Ferriss: Incredible. Bill Gurley: It sounds unfathomable that someone would do that. She did it multiple times. Tim Ferriss: And she did it. Bill Gurley: Yes. Tim Ferriss: What ended up happening after that? I don’t know her story. Bill Gurley: Oh, she’s become probably the most successful hairstylist of our time. It’s an incredible story. Tim Ferriss: How do you suggest people who are, maybe they’re doing A, B, and C right now, they’re listening to this and they just say, “All right, I want to take the leap. I want to do Z. I want to do whatever the off menu option is.” Bill Gurley: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: They might have to have a conversation with a parent. They might have to have a conversation with a spouse. They may have to have a conversation with who knows, whoever the most important people are in their lives. How might they approach that? And we’re going to talk about choosing paths in a second, because I do have a question about maybe how to sanity check yourself in the world of AI, but how do you suggest having those conversations? Do you moonlight for a while so it’s not either or? Do you time box it or make it time bound in a sense where you’re like, “Hey, just give me permission to try this for six months, a year, two years.” Bill Gurley: It’s interesting that I think any of those approaches is realistic. We profile Sal Khan in the book of Khan Academy and he told his wife he wanted to go try it for a year. He had also, he worked at a hedge fund just like Danny Meyer. He was making real money. Tim Ferriss: Wow. I didn’t realize that about Sal Khan. Wild. Bill Gurley: And started working with his cousins across the globe online doing these tutorial exercises and ended up posting a few on YouTube. They started working and he told his wife, “I really want to go tilt at this.” He didn’t even know what the business model was and he went and changed it. Look, I think the real test comes back to this passion element, or we use a lot of different words because passion’s been considered trite, but fascination, curiosity. If you have this deep desire to know so much about this one thing that that curiosity is so high, I think the odds that that’s not apparent to whoever these people are you’re trying to convince is pretty low. And if you can show that you’re — because if you’re going to tilt at something that hard and if you’re going to really differentiate yourself by being that learned in that field, I think it’d be hard for someone to tell you not to go do it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: It’s not going to be easy. I don’t want anyone to think that, “Oh, just read this book and magic happens.” It requires effort. And that’s why this test matters so much, this test of whether you would learn about this thing on your free time. Tim Ferriss: And maybe are you already learning about this? Bill Gurley: Are you already learning about it on your free time? Tim Ferriss: Right. Bill Gurley: Yes. No doubt. Tim Ferriss: At least have one — Bill Gurley: You should be. You should be. I doubt you’re going to turn it on. Tim Ferriss: — data point based on history. Bill Gurley: Yeah. Well, actually, I have an example of someone who just turned it on. We have a chapter called Never Too Late, which is where the [inaudible 01:27:32] thing is because that happened when he was close to 40. Another local Austinite, Bert Tito Beveridge started his endeavor in the spirit business. Tim Ferriss: So wild, I was just thinking about him while I was driving here for no good reason. Bill Gurley: At the age of 40. Tim Ferriss: All right. Bill Gurley: He’s watching a PBS special. This is also hard to believe. He’s watching a PBS special. And back probably when there were only four channels or whatever, but they said on the screen, they said, “Take a blank sheet of paper, draw a line down it, put what you love to do on the left and what you’re really good at on the right. Just a list of those things and then contemplate what might be in the middle.” And he had studied chemistry and a lot of stuff and he liked going out to bars and socializing. And he was making flavored vodka as Christmas presents in his spare time. Tim Ferriss: What was his day job? Bill Gurley: His first career was in seismetology and the oil field and that dragged him to South America. And then when that became dangerous, both in Midland and in South America, he became a mortgage broker. Tim Ferriss: Okay. Bill Gurley: But he didn’t love either. He didn’t love either of them. But the reason I brought it up when you said, “already.” I don’t know that he was already studying the spirit business, but once he made that intentionality to go do this, then he studied it writ large. Tim Ferriss: How did he start, just out of curiosity? Because I was just thinking about him. He just acquired — well, Tito Beveridge just acquired Lala Tequila, which I was involved with. Bill Gurley: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: That’s probably why he popped to mind. But how did he start? Bill Gurley: He first started by just studying the distilling process writ large, like read everything he possibly could. And then it turns out there were no distilleries in the state of Texas and there were laws on the books that made it nearly impossible. So then he had to study that and literally rewrite regulation to make it possible. Interestingly, he did the whole thing on credit cards, so he owns 100% of the business, which is a huge business. It’s the single largest spirit sold in America today. Tim Ferriss: I didn’t realize that. Bill Gurley: Yes. Tim Ferriss: I didn’t realize it was that big. Bill Gurley: It’s huge. Tim Ferriss: Wow. Good for him. Bill Gurley: Yes. Tim Ferriss: That’s so wild. So wild. So I promised to get to this and I do want to get to it. Are there any sanity checks that you would put in place to compliment the fascination/obsession/what I’m doing in my spare time or would pay to do or do for free? Because I’m wondering if there are any things you would take off the table or how you would hone that given the rapidly developing technology of AI. So if someone said, “What I love to do in my spare time is copy editing.” I might not suggest that they throw caution to the wind and burn the ships and go into copy editing. Any thoughts? Because this is something that is — Bill Gurley: Well, the first thing I would note is that many of those pragmatic jobs that the well-intentioned parents have been pushing their children towards are at risk. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, for sure. Bill Gurley: So comp-sci. Tim Ferriss: Right. Yeah, risky, but as compared to what? Bill Gurley: Comp-sci went from being the most least risky major you could possibly get to one that’s somewhat risky overnight. And so that’d be my first notion. And the second thing I would add to that, which I already said is, no matter what your endeavor is, you need to be playing with this tool. It’s a modern tool. It’s the equivalent of a laptop and Microsoft Word was, it’s equivalent of what a calculator was. You don’t want to go out in the world and play without the modern tool set. It’s a part of what you need. If you’re playing with those things and you’re curious, you know where the edge is of whatever you’re passionate about and what the technology’s capable of. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So in order to find that edge and follow that edge, which will move, you have to be playing with the tools. Bill Gurley: And look, I think in any field, one thing I love to suggest on the learning side is, know the history and know the new innovative edge. If you bring both of those things to the table, you are highly compelling. That could be true even if you’re not chasing your dream job. Even if you’re just a marketing major, if you walk into an interview at Clorox and you can simultaneously show that you’ve studied all the historical best marketers and you also understand how TikTok works, that’s heavily differentiating in that interview. Like you’re going to get the job, I would argue, versus someone else, if you can portray those things. Tim Ferriss: How would you apply that here? Is that just, I guess, field dependent or are you referring to AI? Bill Gurley: No. Yeah. Well, I think AI is the leading edge of almost any industry. So yeah, I’m saying you should just study what it’s capable of. Look, the thing that LLMs are most capable of, it’s a large language model. The language type stuff, like your copy editing example, things that were just rote moving words around, yeah, it’s really good at that stuff. But it doesn’t mean that you can’t be the person that really understands what it’s capable of and then superpower yourself to go attack a particular interest. The other thing, you had started a question by saying warnings. I think there are a lot of fields where talent really does matter. I don’t know that I can make you a singer or I certainly can’t make you an NBA basketball player, but in all those fields, whether it be Hollywood or sports or even Danny Meyer at one time thought he was going to be a chef and he just became a restaurateur. He wasn’t a chef. I would say that for any artistic field, there are way more jobs that support those artists than there are the jobs of the artist. Tim Ferriss: What do you mean by that? Bill Gurley: I mean, we have an example in the book of a Hollywood agent and that individual had not thought about a job in Hollywood when they were growing up because they felt they couldn’t act. So they’re like, “Oh, I can’t go do that.” But there’s tons of jobs — Tim Ferriss: I see what you’re saying. Bill Gurley: — in Hollywood that aren’t — Tim Ferriss: Within the sector of entertainment. Bill Gurley: — that aren’t the talent itself. So if you’re passionate about basketball or you’re passionate about the chef example of a restaurant, like there’s tons of jobs you can go do, music industry, without being that particular person. Tim Ferriss: This makes me think of an interview I was watching recently, Patrick O’Shaughnessy, Invest With The Best. He was interviewing Ari Emanuel, so famous super agent, force of nature. His whole family is just like, they’re drinking different water. I don’t know what’s going on there. But he has raised a ton of money to invest in live events, sports and so on as an anti-AI or maybe AI anti-fragile bet, right? And there are lots of ways to make money when you raise a lot of money. So putting that aside, any other AI resilient or anti-AI bets that you think are interesting outside of live events, live sports? Bill Gurley: I think a lot of the service industries, I think humans enjoy experiences and I don’t think that changes personally that much. And so restaurateurs or hoteliers, I think all those things are going to thrive and people that know how to really differentiate experiences in that way, I think are — I personally doubt that — I don’t share this thought that we’re all going to go watch movies that we’ve imagined that are made just for ourselves. I find that hard to believe. I think people enjoy great art in many different forms. They enjoy talking about it and they enjoy the community element of having seen the same thing. And so it may be that if you’re a movie maker, you’re using AI instead of this expensive CGI tool set, but I think the storytelling and the imagination and the writing, I think all those things will still be real. I really do. And obviously just general business, entrepreneurship. I took my dad, who’s 93, fly-fishing in Montana this summer and we were at a lodge and one of the other guests that was staying there is a 28-year-old entrepreneur from the tip of Texas down near Corpus Christi area. And he had started three or four businesses and was well off, like I’m not saying — but he was so enamored with AI. He said, “And then I needed this, and then it did this, and then I needed this, and then I did this. And then I wanted to know where to put the next one of these. And I just ask it, where would you put it in the city? And it immediately gave me answers.” This guy was already successful, but he was running triple speed because he had tipped into this stuff and he was learning what was possible because he had an open mind towards it solving problems. And I thought, “Holy shit, if other people just leaned at it the way he’s leaning at it, they would become super powered themselves.” I was really blown away by that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. This makes me think of Kevin Rose. Kevin Rose is spending the vast majority of his free time playing with all these tools, vibe coding, using them endlessly. And I feel like that is probably over the next few weeks where I need to put some more time and just take a layup with wherever it happens to intersect with someplace that makes it easy to apply. Who’s Sam Hinkie? Bill Gurley: Sam Hinkie is a gentleman that about, I don’t know, six years ago became maybe the youngest GM in the history of the NBA. He became the general manager of the Philadelphia 76ers. Tim Ferriss: Why is his story relevant? Bill Gurley: He was a amazing student. He grew up in Oklahoma. His father worked for Halliburton. He made good grades, good students, kind of classic, did everything right, became a consultant. I think he was working for McKinsey, and they moved him to Australia. And he’s sitting there and he’s reading other things in his spare time. He’s not reading about how to be a better consultant. And he reads a book called Moneyball, which we all know of, the Michael Lewis book about the Oakland A’s. And in almost what seems like an instant decided, “I really need to be in sports analytics.” And I mentioned that a lot of the stories we found have this intentionality. So that book, just like The Last Laugh did for Seinfeld, that book told him, “I’m going to go do this.” And from the day he read that book to getting the job as the head of GM of the 76ers was about 10 years. So no experience whatsoever in the field to youngest GM of all time in 10 years. Tim Ferriss: Was he obsessed with sports already at that point? Bill Gurley: I think so. He played — this gets back to what I said about maybe your original obsession came from participating or being the talent, but then he’s not particularly big. And so yeah, he was successful in high school, but there was no path to keep going down that field. So yeah, he had immense passion for the category, but had never imagined himself in the field in one of these other roles until that book disinhibited him and gave him permission to think, “Well, you know what? I could be differentiated on this dimension, on this dimension of understanding analytics.” He immediately was applying to business school, and he used that as a pivot point. For those that have the needs and the resources, I think in MBA programs can be a great place to switch careers and go chase a different dream. And there’s a great interesting anecdote in the book where he’s trying to decide between Harvard and Stanford, which is a choice for most humans [inaudible 01:41:42]. Tim Ferriss: Quality problem. Bill Gurley: Yeah, exactly. But he went and told them both what he wanted to do and Harvard basically said, “Well, we don’t really have any programs like that.” And Stanford, to give Stanford a lot of credit, said, “You know what? That’s super interesting. We have this person associated with the school that does this. We’ll introduce you to these four people.” And were a lot like McConaughey’s dad when Sam brought them that challenge. Tim Ferriss: Sounds about right. That checks out for me. Bill Gurley: Yeah. Based on what you know of the two institutions. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: Yeah. And then he just started, he ended up meeting Michael Lewis because he was in the Bay Area and some of the Stanford people knew Michael. And so he talked to the guy that wrote the book that inspired him. He hustled his ass off. I don’t want to make it sound like — he kind of built his own curriculum, but it worked. Tim Ferriss: For people who are not going to get an MBA, would you still suggest everyone read the first three chapters of Michael Porter’s Competitive Strategy Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors? Bill Gurley: Unquestionably. Tim Ferriss: All right. Just wanted to — Bill Gurley: Anyone that’s going to do anything in business should read that book. Tim Ferriss: All right. I wanted to give the throwback to our first conversation. Bill Gurley: By the way, at the back of the book, it lists about 50 books. At the very end. Tim Ferriss: Just to whet the appetite? Bill Gurley: Well, I think you did the same thing. I’ve gone through your — Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah. Oh, no. Bill Gurley: In fact, I looked at yours for the structure when I wanted to see how to lay it out. Tim Ferriss: Oh, amazing. Amazing. I want to get your expansion on avoiding false failures. Let me explain what I mean by that. So there’s this expression, if you do what you love, you’ll never work a day in your life. Bill Gurley: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Right? Bill Gurley: It’s in my note. Tim Ferriss: But my experience has been, it’s not always fun, even if you’re doing what you love. Sometimes there’s burnout. Sometimes you go through chapters where things do feel like a grind. I mean, maybe I’m an outlier, but that’s been my experience. When I realized, for instance, in the case of the podcast, it’s like, “Wow, I have much more sponsor demand than I could ever fill. If I just doubled the number of episodes, I’d double the number of revenue. So why don’t I do that?” And it started to feel like a bad job. Not a bad job. Bill Gurley: I get it. Tim Ferriss: It’s still a great job, but the volume was too high. And I can imagine if people take the expression I just mentioned, if you love what you do, you’ll never work a day in your life. They pursue X, whatever that is, the songwriting and the performing in the case of Bob Dylan, Danny Meyer, whatever it might be. And then they hit a really hard stretch. Maybe it’s early on, maybe it’s later, maybe they’re [inaudible 01:44:46] and some French guy yelling at them. Bill Gurley: Yeah certainly. Tim Ferriss: It’s the case with a friend of mine. And they’re like, “Wow, God, this really feels painful. Maybe this isn’t my path.” How do you distinguish between growing pains that are temporary and an indication that you’re not doing the right thing? Bill Gurley: Yeah. It’s funny. I’ll take a short diversion in answering the question. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Long diversions. Bill Gurley: Because people often ask me, “How do you use AI?” When I was wrapping up the book, my publisher and editor said, “I want you to write the concluding chapter.” And I wrote what I think most people would do, which is I just summarized the whole book and I submitted it to him and he said, “No, this is no good.” And so then I went to ChatGPT deep research mode and I said, “Tell me about the 10 best nonfiction concluding chapters that you know of.” And it went and did like a 20-page report and sent it to me. And what I noticed in reading that was that most of these great concluding chapters were orthogonal. They weren’t a summary. They were a different take on the whole thing. Well, my concluding chapter is now titled It Ain’t Easy, to your point. And I went through all of the stories that we have in the book and I pulled out the darkest hour moments for each one of those people and included it at the end, because I didn’t want to leave people with the impression that it’s just all smiles and babies and hugs. I don’t think that’s true in any field. And I guess my answer would be, do you still feel this natural curiosity to learn the entire time? Is the impediment something that truly means you should stop like, “I can’t get around it. I can’t…” Or is it something that maybe can be avoided, something I can get around? I push heavily on the peer thing because one of the things a peer group can do is help you in those moments, both just from emotional support, but also to put perspective on whatever this speed bump is and whether it’s insurmountable or not. Mentors can help with that too, but I think peers are better for that because you worry about being judged in disclosing this. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, 100%. Bill Gurley: And so peers don’t judge. That’s why that trust thing really matters also, another reason why it matters. And they can help you. I think they can help you determine whether that is as big a blocker as it may seem like. But there’s going to be some of that in any field. I don’t think there’s any run that’s just without paying. Tim Ferriss: I’m also imagining that one of the challenges that I had and some of my friends had at different points in pursuing, fill in the blank, starting our first companies, just beginning to invest, having a career in X, right? When I got out of college, it was mass data storage and hitting these really rough patches and feeling like you’re the first person in the world to experience this and it’s because of your unique flaws or uniquely bad decisions. And I’m just realizing now, I haven’t tried this, I’m sure it would work, that you could just describe the dark chapter you’re going through into ChatGPT or one of these tools and say, “Can you give me any comparable examples from other people who have succeeded in other fields?” Bill Gurley: I’m sure that’ll work. It’ll also give you five answers on how to deal with it, how to get around it. Tim Ferriss: How to deal with it. Bill Gurley: But by the way, one thing that’s important when we’re talking about this is, Daniel Pink has this great book on regret, and he talks about it as a valid motivator to get you to make good decisions. And there is a reality that that anxiety you may feel may mean you’re not in the right lane. And so when you were at that sales job, you got to the point where you’re like, “Holy shit, I don’t want to be doing this anymore.” And I had two careers before I became a VC, one as an engineer and one as a sell-side analyst. I enjoyed both. I think I was good at both, but I reached a point about three years in with each where I was like, “I don’t want to do this the rest of my life.” And so I would say, equally with like, don’t give up too early, but if the signal is really telling you, I don’t want to do this the rest of my life, jump out. That’s the precise moment to move on and try something new. And I spend a ton of time in the early chapters trying to get people to understand that’s okay. Most people don’t end up in a career that their major was. I think one of the reasons people grind too long is because they think they’re supposed to. They just think they’re supposed to stay in this lane they’re in. Tim Ferriss: How did you conclude it was time to hop in those cases? We don’t have to go into tons of the background because we talked about so much of your history and decisions and so on, including, I don’t want to say stealing palm pilots, but it’s a pretty good story about getting a palm pilot with contact information. But was it just a gut feeling? Was it a disquiet that you felt in your system or was it more than that? Bill Gurley: I’m sure I’ve overplayed it in my brain, but they feel like very concrete moments where I had almost near certainty. The first one was, I started my third project at Compact Computer Corporation where I was an engineer and the projects were these computers we were releasing and the third one was another computer with a little faster clock speed and a better Intel chip, but the rest of it was all the same and we were going to do it again. I’m like, “That doesn’t seem that interesting to me.” And I’d become curious about other things. So when I was doing external learning, which is what I refer to as this kind of spare time learning, it wasn’t that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Right. Bill Gurley: It was something else. I was reading Peter Lynch’s book on stocks and stuff like that. Tim Ferriss: Right. Segue to the sell-side analyst. Bill Gurley: Yes. The thing that happened as a sell-side analyst, and and I may parlay this into something from the Daniel Pink book, but this notion of, do you want to do this the rest of your life? The sell-side job is wonderful. You get access so early in your life to so many amazing people, but you have to work really hard. And this classic thing where you’re in your 20s and you’re working on Wall Street, they serve dinner at the office. The cafeteria is open, that’ll tell you something. And it was like 10:30 or 11:00 PM and the entire research department was on the 36th floor of Park Avenue Plaza and I did a loop. The four corner offices were the most senior analysts. And for whatever reason, I popped my head in each of their office and they were career sell-side analysts. I said, “Do I want to be this person when I’m 60?” It just stuck in my head. I went to the next one, went to the next one. Hopefully — I don’t know who those people were, but I was like, “No, I don’t.” Like that night, I made the decision that I got to go do something else. Tim Ferriss: No, it’s one of — Bill Gurley: If you don’t mind. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, fire away. Bill Gurley: In Daniel Pink’s book, he talks a lot about boldness regrets. And this is where I say, “Do you want to do this for the rest of your life?” He says, “One of the most robust findings in the academic research and my own is that over time we are much more likely to regret the chances we didn’t take than the chances we did.” What haunts us is the inaction itself. Foregone opportunities all linger in the same way.” And he says that they’ve studied this across China, Russia, Japan, it’s common across all of them. And you may have heard of this YouTube video where Bezos talks about his regret minimization framework. And so he had the same thing. He’s walking around Central Park, “Should I stay in this incredible job at D.E. Shaw,” where he’s making tons of money, “or should I take this flyer on this online bookstore I want to do?” And he put it in his mind that test, which is when I’m 80 and looking back, am I going to regret not doing this? Tim Ferriss: Well, it makes me think of, and this is also a dicey proposition quoting Niccolo Machiavelli, but, “Make mistakes of ambition, not mistakes of sloth.” Bill Gurley: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Right? Bill Gurley: It’s the same thing. Tim Ferriss: And I do think about that a lot myself. I mean, I’m at a point where I’m trying to figure out what my next chapter is too, because this podcasting game’s getting pretty crowded. Bill Gurley: It is. Tim Ferriss: And I still enjoy doing it, but that’s only because I refuse to play by the incentives that the platforms and algorithms provide, which is economically punishing, but intellectually rewarding. Bill Gurley: Because you’ve had two successful careers as, not just a podcaster and influencer, but as an angel investor, I would encourage you to read Arthur Brooks’ book, Strength to Strength. Tim Ferriss: I did. I did. It was great. Bill Gurley: Okay. You already read it? Tim Ferriss: It was great. It was great. Bill Gurley: I think it gives great perspective for a later career shift. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I should go back and look at my notes from that book again. So let’s chat for a second. People should all check this out. I mean, you’re such an operator. Track record’s incredible. Runnin’ Down a Dream: How to Succeed and Thrive in a Career You Love, we’ll talk about that again. We’ll mention it again at the end. What do you want to do after this book? I mean, you can’t sit on your hands very long. Bill Gurley: No. And as I mentioned, when I made the decision to stop the venture career, which I think we talked about on the last podcast — Tim Ferriss: A little bit, yeah. Bill Gurley: — where I read the Steve Martin book. But I didn’t know. I knew I wanted to do something else. And I went on a listening tour and I talked to all these people that had — Tim Ferriss: Can you just reiterate what a listening tour is? Bill Gurley: Oh, I identified several people who had successfully—retired is a strong word—but made a decision to stop doing a job they were very successful at. And then what do you do now? It’s similar to the Arthur Brooks book, but it was just a personal life. A lot of people angel invest, a lot of people go on boards, a lot of people manage their own money. I had this list that people teach and I slowly was checking them off. Tim Ferriss: Just crossing out, yeah. Bill Gurley: Scratch them out, yeah. I don’t really want to manage my own money. I don’t really want to angel invest. I don’t want to start my own venture firm. I’ve done that. I found myself crossing them all off and I couldn’t discover something that got me excited and tied into this what are you doing with your external learning thing. Slowly, I’ve come around to an idea that I made up. It’s not a career that other people have, but I think I’d like to start a policy institute. I’ve come up with a name P3, which stands for Purpose, Progress, and Prosperity. When I was doing the BG2 podcast, which I recently stepped away from, we did a episode at the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Facility. Before I did that episode, I spent three or four weeks calling everyone I knew to make sure that I was prepared for that. That was one of our more successful episodes and I just really enjoyed that. I look at the shifting mindset around the globe on nuclear energy in the past five years as an example of what’s possible with really great policy work. It wasn’t one person. I think the fact that Steve Pinker was banging the drum was super important, but Andreessen and Elon and all these people started pounding that same drum. Joe Gebbia’s wife made this a big life passion project of hers. But it’s shocking how quick we went from, “This stuff’s bad,” to, “Oh, no, we made a mistake. It’s actually good.” That could have a powerful impact on the planet. I don’t know how many of those type things there are to find. I don’t want to go grind on state by state legislation. I don’t have any interest in that. But looking at big problems, looking at US-China relations, US healthcare system has some massive problems. Can you come up with ideas that help shift these things? I’ve already got to know some really innovative professors who are thinking in very innovative ways and I look to use my financial capabilities to do grant writing through people like that and see what we can go do, see what we can go change. Regulatory capture is another one that I’ve spent time tilting at. Tim Ferriss: If you’re not doing this state by state legislative change, what does the work of P3 potentially look like? What is policy work? I know that seems like a silly question but — Bill Gurley: We’re at day one, but I’ll give you — Tim Ferriss: What might it look like? Bill Gurley: Yeah, here’s an example. A professor approached me on the regulatory capture front. “What if we put — Tim Ferriss: Could you define that just for people who didn’t hear episode one? Bill Gurley: Yeah. There’s a Nobel Prize winner from the University of Chicago named George Stigler. He’s passed away but who made the very strong argument that regulation is the friend of the incumbent, that large businesses learn how to lobby Washington. No matter how well intention the policy is that’s passed, it ends up benefiting the incumbent more than restricting the incumbent. He won a Nobel Prize for that work. I gave a speech at the All-In Summit that you can go watch on YouTube. It has five million views on this topic, but I think this happens in the majority of the time rather than — anyway, this — Tim Ferriss: That’s why ACH takes three days to clear, right? Bill Gurley: Yes, yes, yes, yes, but stablecoin may solve that. But this professor approached me about making maybe a global database that scores countries on how captured they are and that identifies the best practices from the countries that have the best scores. That kind of thing, like investing in that type of data and transparency, is pretty compelling to me. That’s an example of what I might go do. Tim Ferriss: Well, let me chew on that for a second. Let’s say you create this data set that presents these scores on a country by country basis. What are the hoped for outcomes of that? That countries that have worse scores start to model the countries with better scores? Certainly, there might be talent flight from one place to another. I mean, we already see that in some respects. I mean, that’s not purely regulatory capture determined, but when you share that data, what would the hope be? Bill Gurley: The hope would be that you can shine a light on the best practices and try to get those implemented — Tim Ferriss: In other places. Bill Gurley: — here in the US. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: That would be the hope. Also, I think just shining a light on them is — I’ll give you an example that relates to regulatory capture. After you’ve been a senator or congressman for a while, you get invited onto committees. The minute you’re on a committee, you are in charge of regulation that affects different industries. I don’t even know if most humans know this. What happens is your local senator or your local congressman who you think is representing your district now starts raising money nationally. They go around and meet with businesses because they’re on that committee and have influence and they’re raising money nationally. I think that’s ridiculous personally. You could imagine restrictions against that, transparency towards it. If your congressman represents this zip code in Austin, wouldn’t you want to know if they’re raising money in Minnesota? Isn’t that a little unusual? Tim Ferriss: Well, you shared a story last time we spoke about being asked to raise a hundred grand in donations just to get a meeting with a Congress. Bill Gurley: Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yeah. Our mutual friend, Rich Barton, talks about shining flashlights in dark places. This technology that we have access to should — I think donations should be on the blockchain, quite frankly. There’s no reason why this information needs to be in the dark. I think there’s a lot of opportunity around data aggregation. Tim Ferriss: Any other ideas that are percolating? Bill Gurley: I’m enamored by state versus state competition. Part of it pops into my brain from the China experience and the provincial competition, but you see Newsom and Abbott fighting back and forth, and maybe there can be a positive outcome from this. I think some of the Federalist Papers envisioned that different states could try different experiments and we could see what happens as a result of that. Tim Ferriss: We’re seeing some of it with Texas and Arizona. Bill Gurley: We are seeing something. I think it could be pretty interesting and provocative and could lead to positive change. I have this dream that some state, and maybe this state that we’re sitting in that has a surplus, would do something crazy with teacher salaries. What if a state just all of a sudden said, “We’re going to pay 50% more for teachers”? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: Think about the dynamic that would create. It’d be pretty wild. Tim Ferriss: It would be. Bill Gurley: Maybe I’ll go tilt it that one, too. Tim Ferriss: So other problems on your mind — well, I’ll just present a list here from some prep notes. We have US healthcare, regulatory capture, intellectual property, US-China, fairness and financial markets, US K-12. Could you speak to intellectual property and fairness in financial markets, how you might be thinking about those? Bill Gurley: I’ve got to be a top 10,000% supporter of open source. This gets back to Ridley’s book, The Rational Optimist, but he talks about prosperity comes when ideas have sex. Just the sharing of information, in my mind, should be free, that it shouldn’t cost anything. It’s very unclear to me that the patent system actually adds value. I’m quite doubtful that the human mind wouldn’t innovate if it didn’t come with a 17-year financial protection. I’m doubtful of that. I think there’s great scientists at every university working on problems that aren’t necessarily being patented. Your ability for hyper competition and innovation is so much higher when there aren’t restrictions in place. Anyway, I think the world’s a better place when ideas are shared and not protected. Tim Ferriss: Since the system we’re working with is the system we’re currently working with, how might something like drug development work without patent protection? Bill Gurley: Well, here’s an interesting thing. The NIH gives out $40 billion a year and a lot of that money goes to companies that end up getting venture capital backing. Tim Ferriss: I’ve had some very open fights with people about this. Bill Gurley: Yeah. Why doesn’t an NIH grant come with an open source rider? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: Yeah. If the VCs want to fund — Tim Ferriss: With federal funding, yeah. Bill Gurley: Yeah, it’s federal funding. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I agree with that. Bill Gurley: Right now, there’s a big fight over whether just their research papers have to go on non-private networks instead of the private ones they’re on today. I mean, they just want the information out there. That’s a minor step I would consider a major step. You don’t have to take the money, but why is the US government giving people money that ends up becoming proprietary inventions? That makes no sense to me. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Whether it’s the US government or individual philanthropists or foundations. I mean, on some level, if that, then at some point — right. I agree with that, but are there industries that — I mean, the only one that first came to mind was drug development where the R&D costs are so high. Bill Gurley: They all cry. The VCs will tell you, “It’ll never work. No one will have any incentive if we don’t have a 17-year protection.” The entire Silicon Valley — Tim Ferriss: I’m not saying I believe that. Bill Gurley: I know. I’ve lived in a world where if someone comes into our office and talks about patents, we roll our eyes because none of the types of businesses that we’ve backed at Benchmark in Silicon Valley are ever about patents. Elon has famously open sourced all his Tesla patents. It’s such a bold thing to do and so gracious, I think, really to society, but his point is — oddly, I was talking to Ted Cruz about this and he said, “Yeah, Elon thinks the same thing.” He views the edge of competition is how fast are you moving, how great are your products, the consumers love them, not, “Can I defend them in a court of law?” The protection that the drug guys get is so much — no one can really use software patents to get protection, an algorithm, or something. No one even tries. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: But with drugs, if I have this particular genome sequence, all of a sudden I get this huge proprietary window in the market. It’s just nutty. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. This is not exactly the same thing, but, I mean, what a service to humanity. I was just watching — I think the documentary name, people can watch it for free on YouTube and other places, The Thinking Game, about DeepMind and Demis and his team really seeing AlphaFold. I mean, all the structures of these proteins, I mean, it’s just like, oh, my God, what an incredible resource for humanity. Bill Gurley: Well, there’s an interesting example right there. The original paper they wrote was open source and OpenAI doesn’t exist without that discovery, which happened at Google in an open source. They just exploited it the fastest. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, wild. Bill Gurley: And by the way, I mean, not to divert too much back, but right now China has 10 open source AI models that are all in hyper competition with each other. That is a dangerously effective primordial soup for innovation compared to what we have here. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I mean, I should probably know this, but I don’t, how does China handle — what are the policies around and laws around intellectual property, patents, things like that? Bill Gurley: Well, interestingly, I found a document online that someone had put together a PowerPoint about the history of open source at China and it’s 20 years old. It’s not like they just stumbled into it. Go back 20 years ago, one of the primary criticisms of China was that they stole IP. If you’re the Chinese government and there’s this new thing called open source, you’re going to embrace it because there’s no fault there because everyone’s sharing and everyone — If you look at the big open source projects, Linux, MySQL, and you go on the webpages, you’ll see Alibaba, Tencent — these companies have been supporting these technologies for a while. Every five years, they write this five year plan, the Chinese government puts it out. Five years ago, they had a huge section on open source. They’re clearly suggesting to the entrepreneurs that the government favors that approach. Going back to Ridley’s book and the notion of pure competition, I think the society — Tim Ferriss: This is The Rational Optimist? Bill Gurley: Yeah, I think the society benefits from that. I use this example. Imagine there’s two feudal societies that are all agricultural based. There’s two of them, though. And in one, once a week the farmers come to market and just trade goods and then they leave. And the other one, the farmers come to market and they’re required to share their best practices with everybody else and then they leave. Going back to this peer example in the book, that one’s going to be much more performant than the other one. This gets to Ridley’s point about ideas having sex. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I mean, open source also, we talked about this a decent amount in our last conversation, but it can be used as an incredible strategy or counterpunch from for-profit companies like Android. I mean, my God, I mean, it’s like you can do a lot. It’s an incredibly powerful tool. Bill Gurley: I think that using open source as a defensive tool instead of an offensive tool is one of the most sophisticated corporate strategies a company can possibly do. It’s very hard to do because it goes against all of your instincts. But I would suggest that Amazon and Apple and maybe Meta who has toyed with it should run at the idea of jointly supporting an open source model. I don’t think they’re doing it, but I think they should, because their incumbency is at risk if someone else has a massive proprietary advantage. Tim Ferriss: Fairness in financial markets, what does that mean? Bill Gurley: I’ve been tilting against this insider’s game of the IPO market for some time and I’m very passionate that when you bring a company public — Tim Ferriss: Does that come with the luxury of retirement or — Bill Gurley: Maybe. I mean, yeah, if you tilt against the investment banks, you got to be comfortable not going to conferences, that’s for sure. They owe some really nice funds. You fall off the invite real quick. But the way that an IPO’s price is so God awful stupid, they pick who gets the stock and they pick the price. I’ve said it over and over again, but a freshman comp size student and a freshman finance student, if you told them to design the IPO, they would just match supply and demand anonymously. It’s how every bond is priced. It’s interestingly how every initial coin offering works. I’ve become a late to the game crypto enthusiast because I’m so sick of this damn IPO process being broken. Tim Ferriss: Could you say a bit more about how it’s broken? Just walk us through a hypothetical example of why it’s broken. Bill Gurley: Yeah. When a company’s coming public, the bankers — literally, they ask everyone for orders, but then they pick who gets the stock and they pick the price. They don’t let supply and demand pick. Supply and demand can automagically pick the allocation and the price. Automagically is the wrong word, can algorithmically. This is super easy. It’s not hard. Tim Ferriss: Why don’t they do it that way? Bill Gurley: Because they’re handing free money to their clients. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, there we go. That’s what I was looking for. Bill Gurley: Yeah. No, it’s been known for a long time. I uncovered an email from 1999 at Goldman Sachs, which I’ve posted on Twitter several times where they’re like saying, “Oh, we can use this hot stock to reward our top clients.” They know what’s going on. The fact that the SEC doesn’t get involved really bothers me, but this tokenization thing is a real way to get around it because the crypto community’s already decided to use algoriththms to allocate and determine price. The price and the allocation should just be determined. It’s how direct listing work. Everyone knows how to do it. They just don’t do it. It’s horrible. But there’s other things too in this category. The long prevalence of Visa and MasterCard is just ridiculous, 2.5%, and stablecoins have so much momentum right now. I think those two companies are going to be in real trouble within a five-year window. Most of the financial problems are pure regulatory capture, like the reason that there’s a problem. Tim Ferriss: Tell me if I’m explaining this well, because I’m not sure we said this directly, but basically the incumbents help to write laws and regulations that favor them and prevent newcomers from competing effectively. Bill Gurley: After ’09, we wrote this thing Dodd-Frank and we thought, “Oh, we’re going to make things better,” and all you’ve had is consolidation and banking since then. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: If you look at the offering, especially at the low end for the poorest citizens of the US, free checking went away. The poor people have a hard time paying their bills, so they don’t even have the tools to do it because free checking went away. Free checking went away after Dodd-Frank. Tim Ferriss: Right. Just to please push back if I’m oversimplifying this, but the regulatory capture is not just bad for startups in Silicon Valley who hope to grow and disrupt and fill in the blank, it’s also bad for everybody. Bill Gurley: Oh, it’s horrible for consumers. I mean, the US healthcare situation, which seems to be getting worse on a daily basis, is a huge example of regulatory cap. Somewhere in the past 10 years, they just told physicians they can’t run hospitals. They just eliminated probably — I mean, who other than a doctor is going to go start a new hospital? The amount of competition you eliminated in this one swoop is enormous, just enormous. That’s just a single example, but there’s hundreds of them in that area. Tim Ferriss: What would success be for this book? Six months after it comes out, what will lead you to have been happy with putting the time in? It’s taken a while. It’s taken a lot of work. What do you hope the outcome will be? Bill Gurley: It really started as a passion project and I have no financial goals for whatsoever. In fact, as we get to book launch, I’m going to launch a foundation that gives grants to people who want to chase their dream job but don’t have the financial wherewithal to do it. I’m going to start working on that in addition to P3. For me, it’s all about how many people do I affect in the way that McConaughey’s dad did or that this book did for Seinfeld. Some of them saw the talk on YouTube from the UT presentation that I gave and I’ve already reached out and said thank you and they’ve shared how it changed their life. But the more people I can do that for, I will just be tickled pink. I’d just be so excited, because I think when people get out of this pragmatic lane and go do these types of things, they tend to be unusually successful, which I think then has a bigger impact than just on them themselves. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, for sure. Bill Gurley: The number of humans positively impacted by Danny Meyer’s success is in the thousands, I’m certain. Tim Ferriss: Oh, for sure. Bill Gurley: And I’m not counting customers of Shake Shack. Tim Ferriss: People, check it out. I mean, I love your writing, Bill. You’re not just a commentator. You’ve been an operator.

Tim Ferriss: And I thought we would start with a prop that you brought. So there was a very thick book with a tattered cover and I think that is as good a lead in as anything. And what are you holding? Bill Gurley: I’m holding a book called The Last Laugh by Phil Berger. The reason it’s tattered is I think it may be out of print, like I bought it used because I wanted to see it and have it. Tim Ferriss: What’s the subtitle? Bill Gurley: The Last Laugh: The World of the Stand-up Comics. Tim Ferriss: Why do you have this book? Are you thinking of making a career switch? Bill Gurley: No. No. No. No. So as part of researching my new book, Runnin’ Down a Dream, my co-writer and I were, we spent six years just diving through stories because I had done this speech at the University of Texas and we wanted to enhance it when we went to the printed form. And one of the stories we came across was Jerry Seinfeld and his decision to pursue a career as a comedian. And he was in New York. He wasn’t sure what he wanted to do with his life. He had an inkling, an inkling that he might want to be a standup comic, but he didn’t know what that meant. He didn’t know if it was a real career. He didn’t know that you could make money. And he read this book and it profiles, I don’t know, it looks like 15 different — it’s got Woody Allen, Bill Cosby, George Carlin, Lily Tomlin, Robert Klein. It profiled them in a way that was very disinhibiting to him. It gave him permission to go do this career that’s not a typical career. When you go to college, they don’t list standup comedian as something that you can go do. Tim Ferriss: The guidance counselor is not generally putting that on the multiple choice. Bill Gurley: Exactly. But this book served as something that granted him permission to go do that. Tim Ferriss: And we’re going to come back to that. I will say that I bookmarked this for future conversations, and of course we’re chatting outside of these recordings, but because two years ago, almost exactly when we did our first episode, you mentioned that you were working on a book idea based on the belief that it’s easier than ever to rise up because access to mentors and information is unprecedented. So we’ll come back to that, of course, and discuss it and the frameworks and the approaches and the stories at some length. But I wanted to start with some topical subject matter: AI bubble or not? And if so, what does that mean? Bill Gurley: Yeah. So I think this is super interesting. My partner, Peter, reminded me of a book that we had seen a while ago by Carlota Perez. It has this very benign title, Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital. It was written in like 2002. And what Perez simplifies and notices, which I just find perfect for trying to understand whether there’s a bubble or not, is that every time there’s been a technology wave that leads to wealth creation, especially fast wealth creation, that will inherently invite speculators, carpetbaggers, interlopers that want to come take advantage of it, think of the Gold Rush. And so people want to make it a debate. Do you believe in AI or is it a bubble? And if you say you think it’s a bubble, they say, “Oh, you don’t believe in AI.” Like, this “Got you!” kind of thing. And if you study Perez, and I think this is absolutely correct, if the wave is real, then you’re going to have bubble-like behavior. They come together as a pair, precisely because any time there’s very quick wealth creation, you’re going to get a lot of people that want to come try and take advantage of that or participate in it. So you get a flood of those types of people coming at it. And so it’s odd. There’s a real technology wave that’s fundamentally changing the world and there’s also massive speculation simultaneously. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, they come as a pair. I recall not too long ago, maybe two weeks ago, saw a short interview with your friend, Jeff Bezos, and he distinguished between financial bubbles and industrial bubbles and cited, and I’m paraphrasing here, but 2008 as an example of a bad bubble, financial bubble, versus, let’s just say, the early 2000s, ’98, ’99, 2000, where a lot of very important technology was created that then was durable after the fact and created new generations of entrepreneurs and a lot of economic growth. And he believes that AI would fall into the industrial bubble category of things. But I suppose, given that the dancing pair you described come together, how would you think about investing in private companies, modern venture capital at this point in time? And just, I suppose, as it’s changed since you were most active. Bill Gurley: Just a quick comment on that industrial bubble thing. One thing that is surprising to me is that even though I fundamentally believe this is an important real technology wave, the big players, even the Mag Seven, have all decided to do things from a deal perspective. You’ve read about these circular deals and whatnot. Tim Ferriss: Could you explain what you mean by that? Bill Gurley: Yeah. There’s a lot of talk out there, but it all started when Microsoft invested in OpenAI. OpenAI agreed to buy services from Microsoft, which is called a circular deal because you’re giving them money they wouldn’t have otherwise. And when Dario was on stage at DealBook last week, he said, “Oh, I can explain this. It’s not that hard.” Amazon wanted us to spend money we didn’t have, so they gave us even more money. And I’m like, “Well, that’s precisely why this is a questionable behavior.” But it’s gotten bigger. NVIDIA’s handed out money and then NVIDIA gave CoreWeave money, but then also agreed to buy any services they have left over. This stuff’s not ideal. Like if you were to say, “What’s crisp, clean accounting?” You wouldn’t do these things. And some of them say, “Well, it’s not material.” And which I would say, “Well, then why are you doing it?” And I’ve asked other people to try and understand how even big, sophisticated companies might get speculative using a word from previous discussion. And I hear things like, “Well, loss aversion tends to go down when you’re winning.” Like if you’re on a hot streak in a casino, you take more risk, things like that. But it is surprising to me. So when it comes to retail investors, I would be particularly concerned for them at this stage in the AI game because there is a plethora of SPV vehicles, but you’ve heard that phrase, I’m sure, SPV. This is where someone has an in on an investment and they do a one-off VC fund, if you will. Tim Ferriss: A special purpose vehicle. Bill Gurley: Yeah. It’s a single entity just for that one — Tim Ferriss: We have a chance to invest in X. We have an allocation of however much money, and then they can allow Jane Doe and John Doe potentially — Bill Gurley: And they take a rake on it. And there’s people promoting SPVs in situations where they don’t even actually have the underlying stock, or maybe they hope to get it. It’s the wild, wild west. And most of the people on that edge, I would put in the category of interloper carpet bagger. These are people that have come to this thing, and I just think you got to be quite careful. The investments that were made that have already had 100 X plus returns were made a while ago before this thing started. And that’s not to say there won’t be an incremental AI investment that makes money, I think there will, but your odds right now of that being the case are really, really low. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I would add to that and say, and this applies to me as much as anyone else, but your actual risk tolerance may differ, probably does differ significantly from your perceived risk tolerance if you haven’t had a huge drawdown, right? If you haven’t actually ridden a few of those waves and see how you respond in those circumstances, and you should be, I suppose, skeptical of how you view your own intestinal fortitude with some of those things, or maybe the losses you can absorb. Because I recall, for instance, I’ve seen this many, many times, but with these types of SPVs, people get involved, and let’s just say they’re not typically an angel investor, they don’t have the experience of watching 60%, 70%, 80% of their investments go to zero or become the walking dead, and they sign off on all of the, not necessarily waivers, but they accept, accept, accept the SBV terms of service, which I’ll say, “You could lose all of your investment. This is incredibly risky.” But then when it does go to zero, the financial and psychological impact is catastrophic. Bill Gurley: There’s a lot of people, and I think this comes from a very good place. I think they’re very well intentioned who look at the world and say — well, first of all, rising inequality, why can’t everyone have access to the same things? And then companies are staying private longer. So they say, we need to institutionalize the generic public’s ability to invest in private companies. And the problem, I think there’s two problems. One you just hinted at, which is most private company VC backed even go to zero, like the majority, which is not something people really — they sense that they want the lottery ticket, they want the Uber, they want the one that goes to the moon, but they don’t understand that that comes along with it. Tim Ferriss: They don’t want to buy losing lottery tickets for 12 years. Bill Gurley: Right. Right. Exactly. And the second problem is the information transparency in the private company game is just low. And I think the institutional investors have come to understand that and know what they’re getting into and know how to evaluate things. But if you come at it with a public market mindset thinking, “Oh, every set of financials I’ve been handed is audited and is correct.” And that’s just not the case. It’s super loosey-goosey. Tim Ferriss: So if you were, this may be a difficult question, but if you were angel investing right now, how would you be thinking about your approach? Bill Gurley: I’ll tell you a funny story. When I decided to hang up my gloves, if you will, and stop making institutional venture capital investments, I had a whole bunch of ideas about what I wanted to do next. And one of them was, “Oh, I’ll do a bunch of angel investing.” Bezos did it on the side. This would be fantastic. Tim Ferriss: He did pretty well with his angel investing. Bill Gurley: I was explaining this to a, I won’t say who it is, but a Silicon Valley CEO, very successful. And he said, “What are you going to do now?” And I said, “I was thinking of doing angel investing.” He goes, “Why would you do that?” He said, “I got 50 of these things. People don’t return my calls.” He goes, “I wish I’d never done it.” So there’s a unglamorous side to it as much as there is a glamorous side. And you’ve participated in this world before. So what would I say? I think if I were doing angel investments, I’d try and find in an intersection of people that are super curious and are playing with all these AI tools, but bring a perspective from a particular industry that gives them an advantage in that area where they could simultaneously be maybe the smartest user of AI in their genre, in their vertical. Tim Ferriss: So despite the, or maybe because of, because we talked about the pair, the AI bubble, you would still be looking at AI intersected opportunities if you were angel investing. Bill Gurley: Yeah. There’s a weird reality out there right now, and this could end if ever a bubble has popped or whatever, but the institutional investors have zero interest in non-AI deals. Zero. It’s more black and white than I could be successful in — Tim Ferriss: And for people who do not know the term, define the institutional investor. Bill Gurley: People who are paid both a salary and a piece of the return to be active investors of other people’s money, using other people’s money. But the reason that kind of matters is if you angel fund a deal and have any hope of it raising money in the future, if it’s not AI related, right now — Tim Ferriss: Could die of neglect. Bill Gurley: There is no interest. I can’t state clearly enough how there’s zero interest. And I could simultaneously make fun of that reality, but I could also justify that reality, but it is the reality right now. And by the way, while I mention that, I feel obligated for your audience. I don’t care what field you’re in, you should be playing with this stuff. It has the potential to impact your role in your career, and the best way to protect against any risk of your career being obfuscated or eliminated from AI is to be the most AI-enabled version of yourself you can possibly be. PREROLL Tim Ferriss: How would you think about, maybe you can give a hypothetical example of looking for someone who has very, very sophisticated domain expertise and experience who’s now intersecting with AI and has a unique, because of the combination perspective on things, to invest in as an angel investor and separate that from something that’s just going to be consumed by the fundamental models and these larger companies that — Bill Gurley: From a career perspective or — Tim Ferriss: From an angel investment perspective, how would you pick folks you don’t think are just going to end up working on something that gets replicated in short order by the bigger companies? Bill Gurley: Yeah. The key is just to stay pretty far away from the edge of whatever. You can go online and see interviews with the people at Anthropic or OpenAI and what they’re working on. If it’s the next thing they’re going to do, I don’t think you’re going to be protected. But as I think about founders and angel investors, you’re talking about a pretty broad array of things. At this point, as I mentioned earlier, you’re not going to back the next big model company. Besides, if you were, you need a billion dollar angel investment to go make that happen. It’s just really, the game’s changed. There’s so much money involved. And so I think you’re going to want to be off the beaten path anyway. When I think about these deeper verticals, I don’t think it will make sense for OpenAI to go crush every little vertical. Tim Ferriss: Waste management. Bill Gurley: And even if the model’s capable of understanding that subject matter, there are workflows, there are data sets that are local to your customer, and that stuff has to be stitched together. So I think having an understanding of a particular industry and one that’s not going to be on the next thing to do list at OpenAI, it would probably be your best bet. Tim Ferriss: Got it. So is it fair to say, if I’m understanding you correctly, that effectively looking for something that would not be a high priority for one of these larger companies and also a proprietary dataset of some type? Bill Gurley: Proprietary datasets, the more workflows that exist are better because you can build software around those things that — Tim Ferriss: What is a workflow? Bill Gurley: The thing that popped into my head, I’m on the board of Zillow. Zillow’s been investing for the past five years in tools that help the realtor do their day-to-day job. They have a tool called Showing Time that helps you book in person tours at houses as an example, but there’s putting the mortgage together, getting the sign-offs on. There’s just all these tasks that have to be happened that can be automated in the — And so tasks that can be automated, that can be integrated with AI, the more of that stuff you can build into a system, the better off you’re going to be protecting yourself from a model that just answers questions, which is why I brought it up. Tim Ferriss: All right. Let’s move on to big topic, big country, China. You spent 10 days there over the past summer. What was your experience? What did you see? What made an impression? What did you do? Bill Gurley: Yeah. I’d been about six times before, so this is like my seventh trip. It was one thing that was different. My daughter is an Asian studies major, as you were, and she spent the summer in Hong Kong. So we picked her up and then we toured six cities in 10 days. And my objective with this trip, in the past trips, it was mostly just to meet with entrepreneurs and founders and mutual sharing of information, that thing. This time I was more interested in just kind of being eyes wide open and learning. And so we took two of the high speed trains just as an experience that I got a tour of the Xiaomi factory with their new car, the SU7, and was trying to get a feel for what’s most recent there. And we went to Shenzhen, the overnight city, which has gone from, I think, less than 100,000 people in 1980 to 20 million people. And just to see the scale and scope of the whole thing, there’s a lot of rhetoric in the US about what is or isn’t happening in China. And I just wanted to have a better feel for it. And we’re making policy decisions that are going to impact the global footprint, and God forbid, end up in a World War three situation. So anyway, I just wanted a better understanding. I was aided by the fact that Dan Wang shared his book Breakneck with me right before I left, and I read it while I was there, which was interesting. And then it came out, and of course it ended up on the bestseller list. But I think China’s misperceived in a lot of ways. Tim Ferriss: What are some of those misperceptions? Bill Gurley: The biggest one is that people who have a rudimentary understanding of what is happening there, you use this word communism to infer a lot of other things. And one of the things that’s inferred by communism is top down state run system. And I think they think of Russia and they assume, “Well, that’ll always lead to bad capital allocation, no innovation.” Because they have this picture in their mind of these, I don’t know, brick buildings, like with snow all around them and not much happening. And the reality there is just far, far different from that. I think Dan Wang did a great job of explaining how the country puts out this five-year plan, but then the provinces, which they’re a lot bigger than a US state, but they’re the equivalent, like it’s how the country segment and they compete with each other. And the effective mayor of the province, if he does well, has a chance to move up in the system, which is not a reality in the US system. But what that leads to is just a massive amount of competition and — Tim Ferriss: What are the metrics by which they’re being judged? Do you have any idea on a province level? Is it some equivalent of GDP? It’s not the right term, but — Bill Gurley: I’m guessing probably we could go talk to AI and get a better answer than I have right now. But yeah, I would think that’s part of it, prosperity, employment, those things. By the way, this provincial competition has also led to overbuild of buildings. It’s not always positive, bridges that aren’t used, there’s a Go cities. Go cities, yes. But you end up with hyper competition. So I think the thing that a lot of people in Silicon Valley love about capitalism is this notion of the invisible hand and competition that leads to innovation and best practice, and the winners rise up and they’re better for it. That is happening there. And if you read about the solar industry or the EV industry or now the robotics industry, they have hundreds of different companies competing in these fields and it’s brutal competition. And as a result of that, they’re ending up with very innovative companies, which once again, I think people wouldn’t prescribe to being possible in a communist world and remarkable execution from an industrial standpoint. So the price points of the products that will be sold around the globe are well below anything that could be done in the US. Tim Ferriss: How do you go about getting a tour of Xiaomi factory? I would think that they would be very closed about that. What’s in it for them and how do they — Bill Gurley: I don’t know if you saw this going around the internet yesterday, but they shipped a car to this YouTuber. Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah. I saw it. Yeah. Absolutely. Bill Gurley: Which is brilliant. And he did like a 15 — that’s the SG7, that’s the factory I went to. As I mentioned, I’d been there before, so I met Lei Jun, who’s the Founder of Xiaomi in 2005 when he was chairman of Joyo, which was a E-commerce company that Amazon bought. So he’s been around a while. He has evolved into, the best thing I could say is he’s the Steve Jobs of China right now. When he quit doing Joyo and he had this other company as well, he declared 10 years ago he was going to build a smartphone. Just out of the blue, I’m going to build a smartphone. He didn’t have any smartphone experience, but Xiaomi’s now the third-largest manufacturer of handsets in the globe. And about four or five years ago, at about the exact same time Apple hinted they were interested in building a car, he said, “I’m going to build a car.” Tim Ferriss: Well, not only did he say I’m going to build a car, but that was a response to sanctions. That was an emergency. Well, I listened to the translation of, even though my Chinese is decent, but it’s not as good as it once was. I think it was 2024 company-wide address where he talked about the sanctions coming in saying, “What if we couldn’t make phones? What would we do? Bill Gurley: But that talk is unbelievable, and it’s translated on YouTube, and I would encourage people to watch from about minute 30 to about an hour 15, which is where he talks about his process for designing the car. I don’t know if you saw that part. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I did. Bill Gurley: But it’s crazy. He says, he put a note on any car in his parking lot that he had never drove, and he would ask each employee to give him three positives, three negatives and loan them the car. Said he drove 200 of his employees cars. When you hear that stuff, you’re like, “Wow, I wonder if anyone at Apple did that.” It’s just such a bottom up, just ground truth way to start the process. But even still, even if he did that, a bunch of people could do that. How do you have the wherewithal to build a factory? He’d never built a factory before. And I’ve been in other car factories here in the US. It was phenomenal. Anyway, back to your question why I could get in. I knew Lei Jun from way back when. Tim Ferriss: What does the process look like? Are there a bunch of clearances and you have to get the okay from the provincial? Bill Gurley: I don’t think we went through the whole factory, but no, it wasn’t that. They’re a public company. I think they’re interested in being well understood, which I think hints at why they enabled this. I think they had to send a car to this guy, the YouTuber. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: And by the way, the President of Ford went over there about six months before I did, went on the same tour, so they let him go there. And he had an SU7 shipped to Michigan, and he drove it for several weeks and he’s talked about how incredible it is. Tim Ferriss: Well, he also, if I’m remembering correctly, has talked about EV production, and battery dominance or at least component dominance from China and the risks inherent in that. And I don’t want to bleed too far into geopolitics, but it’s hard not to pull it into the conversation. So this is a question from X, the artist formerly known as Twitter, one of many questions. But I’ll ask, what are your top handful of critiques say of the Chinese tech ecosystem or CCP after going on a tour there? What would you say they’re not doing well or things that complicate their ability to compete? Bill Gurley: Well, the first one that’s I think been well publicized is when an entrepreneur has risen to a level of success and then uses that as a platform, the government seems uninterested in that. Tim Ferriss: Exhibit A. Bill Gurley: The Jack Ma. Tim Ferriss: Jack Ma. Bill Gurley: Yeah, exactly. And there’s a saying that I think I heard while I was over there, “Don’t be the tallest tree.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah, this is, Don’t Be The Tallest Tree. Yeah, the nail that sticks out gets hammered down in Japan. They have a totally different system obviously. Bill Gurley: The other entrepreneur outside of Lei Jun is the ByteDance CEO. And ByteDance is probably got the leading position for the consumer AI, like Open AI, but over there right now, in addition to just incredible revenue growth. This is the company that owned TikTok and whatnot, but they’re not going public and you don’t see him at all, which may get to this tallest tree thing. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, celebrities also disappear over there. Bill Gurley: No doubt. Tim Ferriss: Very mysteriously. Bill Gurley: Yes. Well, and business people. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: So yes, that does happen. Tim Ferriss: I will say, and for people who are wondering, because there are a lot of — how should we put this? There are people who are very angry, very hawkish. Some people are very, very supportive, and then their agendas or alliances get questioned. I, like you, I’m just interested in understanding what is happening to the extent that I can. What is the actual truth on the ground? What are the details? And frankly, the innovation over there is remarkable. And what they’ve done in terms of establishing access to rare metals and everything they need to manufacture is remarkable. You go to South America or Africa, and it is Chinese everywhere on infrastructure projects. They’ve been very, very smart about it. So I’m deeply interested in all of it, and please hold your thought because I want to hear everything you have to say. What I would say is a piece of the three-dimensional chess that I’ve been impressed with is how well the Chinese government is able to — well, of course they’re able to integrate with the private sector so that they’re able to use, in a sense, products to widen their scope of access potentially. Like DJI, for instance, great example. People have a lot of questions around these cars, as spectacular as they might be. Are they an extension of surveillance? These are open questions that I think are worth asking. But you were about to say something, so I’ll let you — Bill Gurley: No, no, no. I think let’s come to that. Let me make one point and then let’s come to that. So there’s two other things I wanted to mention. Obviously, infrastructure. So they are building new nuclear fission plants. So fission being old school, not new school, at one fourth the price that we do it here in the US. So is South Korea, by the way. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. And the numbers are incredible. Bill Gurley: But when we sit here and say, “Oh, we want to re-shore manufacturing, and they can build things at one fourth the price we can.” If you don’t solve that, you’re going to re-shore something and we’re going to not be price competitive globally. And then because you won’t import what they have, and you’re going to make our citizens buy from this new factory where we’re making things way more expensive, it doesn’t work. Tim Ferriss: The math doesn’t math. Bill Gurley: It doesn’t work. And by the way, I’m not sure it brings jobs. The Xiaomi factory was a third based on some numbers I was able to acquire, a third the number of employees per car output. And I got to believe in 10 years it’ll be a sixth. And so you could calculate the total number of jobs that you’d be bringing back if you brought back all this car production and it’d be hundreds of thousands. It’s not millions and millions of jobs. So anyway, that infrastructure thing’s for real. And I think Dan Wong does a good job of saying that America’s run by lawyers. Tim Ferriss: And this is the author of Breakneck. Bill Gurley: Our country’s run by lawyers and theirs is run by engineers. Engineers. And so when you try and build something here, the lawyers just get in the way and try and block it, which certainly when you hear Elon talks about why the Gigafactory is here in Austin and not in California, it all relates to those things. So anyway, that’s infrastructure. There’s another thing that’s I think quite interesting, which is the government may not care about whether or not their companies have really big market caps. And when I first realized this, you saw what happened when they took down Alibaba when they went after Jack Ma, and Amp Financial could have been this big thing and it got a haircut, and you question, well, do they care? And if you are pushing your companies to be low cost providers, maybe that’s at odds with them being hyper profitable and really big. And then you can turn around and ask the question. Hearing that caused me to ask the question, does America really benefit by the fact that the Mag Seven have $3 trillion market caps? I know the employees of those companies do, but is that a sign of our competitive capitalistic society not being truly competitive? Tim Ferriss: On a global scale. Bill Gurley: No, even within. There’s a notion you learn about in economics classes called pure competition. And in pure competition, no one has an intellectual property advantage. Marginal profits are whittled down just to the cost of capital, and the consumer benefits because there’s no excessive profit capture. If we have all these companies that are able to have excessive profits, is that a form of market failure? And does the fact that they exist help America in any way? At first, of course I’m a venture capitalist. I want to think, yes, of course. But then as I think about it, I don’t know that our government, or our society, or our people are better off because these six companies have $3 trillion market caps. It’s not that many people that — the percentage of the country that’s employed by those companies is small on an overall basis. And so anyway, I think they have a different perspective on whether big market caps matter, and I think that is somewhat intriguing. Tim Ferriss: What do you think about the innovation in China leading in some cases to the development of superior technology at a lower cost, that is plausibly an extension of the intelligence gathering apparatus of the government? Is that a real thing? Bill Gurley: I’m not in a good place to know. Tim Ferriss: I would have to imagine it seems like they would have to be stupid not to use that given their ability to penetrate the private sector. Bill Gurley: Yeah. I think it’s certainly well known that they do surveillance of their own people. I know that would be particularly upsetting to people like Greg Luciano that runs FIRE and is very interested in free speech. The flip side is there’s very little street crime. You walk around, you don’t worry about that when you’re there. Tim Ferriss: It’s true also in Japan though, right? Bill Gurley: It doesn’t make it right or wrong. It is what it is. And I don’t know that we have this ability to tell them how they have to do it. Now, to the extent that the Huawei stuff where their products are being shipped out, and then those are used to gather intelligence out of their country and the rest of the world, of course that’s a problem. But I think the way to deal with it, I’m not a politician, but I think the way to deal with it — I’m more of a believer of the engage. Engage, talk about what you don’t like and what you do like, and try and negotiate that problem away like we’re trying to do with the fentanyl precursors. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Well, way back in the day when I was an East Asian studies major, this was lifetimes ago. And keeping in mind, I was at the Capitol University of Business Economics in 1996. That was the bicycle era, these old photographs of Beijing with millions of bicycles with people in their long green jackets. I had one of those jackets for the winters. It gets really cold. But things have changed a lot. At the time, I was looking forward and thinking I might be one of those people who could engage in Chinese. I think the way to do it is in English, frankly, for a whole host of reasons. But even if you speak the other language, Putin speaks English pretty well, but he does all of his negotiations when he’s speaking in Russian for a lot of good reasons, the same good reasons. Bill Gurley: I get that. But look, so first of all, I do get accused of being like an agent of the CCP or something, even by some of the people that responded to your Twitter thing. I’m not. I’ve only visited a few times. I don’t know anybody in the government, but I worry greatly that we make bad policy decisions if we misunderstand what’s really going on. Tim Ferriss: Oh, I agree with that. Yeah, I fully agree with that. I’ve thought about — I frankly am worried about it. I would take a burner phone and a burner laptop. I’ve thought about it, because I want to get a better understanding of the culture of innovation that can be fostered, and exactly how things are to the extent that it would be visible to me, how things are developing in China. I’ve thought about going there. I thought about doing the same thing in India, too, to go and interview 10 of the top entrepreneurs. But the reason I haven’t done it is that I’m just like, I don’t know what radars that’s going to put me on, what surveillance, what fill in the blank, how difficult is it going to be? Whose rings am I going to have to kiss? Am I overthinking it or is it straightforward? Bill Gurley: I think you’re overthinking it. I think the odds that Tim Ferriss would disappear in China is really [inaudible 00:44:26]. Tim Ferriss: Oh, I’m not worried about disappearing. That would be a terrible — the upside downside on that doesn’t make any sense. I’m not worried about disappearing. Bill Gurley: There are companies that may not speak with you. When I was there, DeepSeek and Unitree, the word was out on the street that they’re not meeting with Westerners for reasons that are — Tim Ferriss: Well, I’m sure that’s true conversely in the US too, right? Bill Gurley: Yes. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I’m sure that’s — and by the way, I think that reflective lens, when you think about the country is helpful. When Alex Karp was just on stage at DealBook last week, he was talking about surveillance and he says, “Well, of course our tools are used to surveil the enemy.” And I’m like, “Okay, well, my God, the Chinese are surveilling us, but obviously we’re surveilling them too. Let’s be honest about these things.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah. It’s a lot easier for a bunch of obvious reasons. It’s in some respects, a lot easier for them to surveil us than the other way around. Partially just due to the homogeneity of the society over there. You can’t send a bunch of blonde-haired, blue eyes, black, Latino, whatever, to China to end up at top universities, top companies, et cetera. It’s just a lot harder. Bill Gurley: By the way, to put a bow on this part, I would say there’s two other things. One, you hinted at. One, the supply chains are so integrated in China down to the raw material level, that even if you brought a factory back here, it’d be more of an assembly shop and you’d still be sourcing from there, which isn’t necessarily cost competitive. And to replicate all of it would take a very, very, very long time. Tim Ferriss: Well, including raw materials for staple pharmaceuticals, There’s a lot going on. So what at this point, is it a day late and a dollar short for the US? I know I almost promised we weren’t going to go into this, but I want to know your opinion. I’m so curious. What are the keys to the US remaining globally competitive and vibrant as an economy? You hinted to one, which is, it seems inevitable, nuclear power or more power. So how do you do that? I’m not sure how quickly you can right the ship, although it seems like a handful of people have done a pretty good job of changing the narrative. What are some of the key things in your opinion that the US needs to do? Bill Gurley: One is make it easier to build. Tim Ferriss: Build companies? Build? Bill Gurley: I think build infrastructure. If you’re going to build semiconductor plants, if you’re going to build nuclear plants on time and on budget, that’s very hard to do in the US right now. And the glimmer of hope I would say is that a few states seem to have governors that want to get stuff out of the way. And I think it’s red tape and bureaucracy, and lawyers, and litigation that make this stuff so expensive. And so Texas and Arizona seem to be getting their unfair share of data centers and semiconductor plants. And I think because of that attitude, I’ve seen a similar attitude in Pennsylvania where they repaired I-95 in 12 days, but they literally had to take a bunch of statutes that are on the books and say that they don’t apply right now. So that mindset I think needs a lot more momentum. That’d be one thing. There’s another thing that I think is important for people to understand on the China front. There are numerous people with a loud microphone that will say, “Oh, they know how to scale out plants, but they don’t know how to do any innovation.” And that’s just flat wrong. Whoever’s saying that just hasn’t been there. They don’t know the facts on the ground. These entrepreneurs are every bit as good as the entrepreneurs they are here. There are examples like in LIDAR, they built a MEMS LiDAR product that’s like $130 a car. Tim Ferriss: What is MEMS LiDAR? Bill Gurley: It’s solid state. It uses solid state semiconductor technology instead of that big spinning radar. And so the LiDAR on a Waymo is $5,000. And it’s $130 for MEMS LIDAR. They’re putting it on every car. You can go into ChatGPT and say, “Tell me about MEMS LiDAR innovation in China.” But it’s a great example. Le Jun’s another one, but anybody that thinks there’s no innovation is just — Tim Ferriss: Yeah, they’re just wrong. Bill Gurley: They got blinders on. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. No, that’s not true. That’s definitely not true. I asked you two years ago if there are any countries that you’re long on. At the time, I’d be curious if this is still the case. You said you’re long on the UK, less regulatory capture. Bill Gurley: Did I say that? Tim Ferriss: Losing party pay is in the legal system. Bill Gurley: I do love that. Tim Ferriss: Which reduces frivolous litigation compared to the US. Any thoughts on where you’re bullish these days? Bill Gurley: Well, ironically, Matt Ridley was in town a few weeks ago in Austin. Tim Ferriss: The Rational Optimist, other books. Bill Gurley: I love his stuff, but he would say that I would be dead wrong on that. Things aren’t going well there. And he lives there. So I’ll just take that as I got that one wrong. Tim Ferriss: Well, it depends on the timeframe too. Is it two years, or is it five years or is it 10 years? Bill Gurley: One of the things that’s been impressive about China is since Deng Xiaoping brought back capitalism, 500 million people have come out of poverty. And you look at countries that have a very strong work ethic, and a high education, and a currently low per populate income, and you would think more jobs would come their way. So two that would pop for me are Vietnam and Turkey, who check all those boxes. Tim Ferriss: All right. Bill Gurley: Hopefully I do better then. Tim Ferriss: Check in in another two years. All right. So let’s talk about, this is going to be a segue to talking about Runnin’ Down a Dream and all things involved with that. Maybe we could start with an anecdote from a fellow Austinite, likes to play the bongos, long hair, associated with smoking reefer every once in a while. Matthew, we were talking about a short anecdote about Matthew before we started recording. Would you mind sharing that? Bill Gurley: Yeah. As I was preparing, as I was wrapping up the book, I started listening to Greenlights, and I was told you had to listen to it because of course he reads it. So you get all the great McConaughey affectations as you read it. But there’s a story in it that just popped in my brain and summarized exactly what I’m trying to accomplish with this book, Runnin’ Down a Dream. And he had spent the vast majority of his young adult life—so this anecdote is from when he was like 20, 21—telling his family he was going to be a lawyer. And so he’d gotten into the University of Texas. He was Pre-Law. Every time he went home, he talked about, “Yeah, I’m going to be a lawyer.” And he had met some people at Texas that had convinced him that he should switch to film school. And he had immense anxiety about sharing this with his father. This is all in the book, but his father’s a very tough individual. And so reason to be fearful when you’re going to drop some news. “I’m no longer going to be a lawyer. I’m going to go to film school.” And he builds it up a lot in the book. I didn’t know when I was going to talk to him. You can imagine being in that situation, you’re delaying, delaying, delaying. But he finally tells his dad and his dad utters this very simple phrase, “Well, don’t half ass it.” And he says, “Of all the reactions he could have had, don’t half ass it were the last words I expected to hear and the best words he could have ever said to me.” And he said in that single moment, he gave him blessing, consent, approval, validation, privilege, honor, freedom, and responsibility, called it rocket fuel. And I’d like to believe there are a number of people out there, young adults, maybe even some midlife career who have this notion that they should be doing something else, but society has put them on a path, or just the way they matriculated through college, put them into a career that they just don’t love and that they have this inkling that they could go do this thing. Or maybe you’re a young kid and you really want to do X, but everybody else is telling you to do A, B and C. I want to help them have the confidence and permission to go do X, to go chase this dream. And as you hinted at from our last call, I think the amount of your ability to make connections and to gather information and learn on your own pace, has never been better. You can literally just sit there and talk to ChatGPT six hours a day if you so choose, and learn so much about any particular field. And so your ability to take things into your own hands, and to go try and be successful in this thing that you feel passionate about, I think has never been better. Tim Ferriss: Why do you think when you initially gave and subsequently had to go online, Runnin’ Down a Dream as a presentation, why do you think that took? Why did it strike a chord in the way that it did? What do you think it was? Bill Gurley: Well, I think we’ve built a society, like nobody’s fault. We just have built a society where we love to celebrate people that are successful in a lot of different fields, but when it comes to our own children, we tend to think way more pragmatically about what they should be doing. Lawyers, consultants, doctors, computer scientists, it’s all these jobs that have certainty to the financial component. And I think that’s so well intended. I don’t think there’s mal intent of anyone in the system. And I’m a parent of three, I’ve been through this. You just feel this obligation to try and push them towards prosperity, but it’s not intellectual prosperity, it’s not happiness, it’s financial. Tim Ferriss: Stability. Bill Gurley: Yes, that most people are guiding children towards. And this isn’t that complicated math, but most people end up working 80,000 hours in their life. It’s a third of your life. Why do something you don’t like? There’s Gallup poll data on career engagement and 59% of people say they’re not engaged at work. And this is that whole quiet quitting thing that we hear so much about. And some of these numbers are at an all-time low. It just seems horrific that people are sauntering through life. Tim Ferriss: So what are some of the keys to taking the path less traveled then in this case? And there are a few I highlighted for myself, but where should we start? I highlighted one for myself. We don’t have to start here, but go where the action is. I just think this is so underrated, and people further undervalue it maybe in a digital world, but we can start anywhere you want. That’s just one that really jumped out to me because I think it’s really underrated. But where would you like to start? Bill Gurley: I think in the book, one of the things that we tie together very early on is the interplay between passion, or fascination, or curiosity and learning. And the way to be most successful in any endeavor, but certainly if you’re going to go tilt it something that’s less pragmatic, is to be the smartest, most knowledgeable person you can possibly be. And knowledge is free now, as we’ve talked about. And I have this test for whether or not you’re actually truly passionate about what you’re trying to do, which is do you self-learn on your own time? Would you not watch Breaking Bad and read about this field and be energized by that activity? If you are, and we have 20, 30 different stories in the book of people that have been successful, almost all of them check that box. You just have this amazing ability to gain knowledge so much faster than everyone else you would be competing with. And that’s going to be useful. That’s unquestionably going to be useful. Tim Ferriss: I mean, it makes me think of an interview I saw a long time ago, actually. It was quite a few years ago, but it was an interview with Joe Rogan and he said something that surprised me, it might surprise a lot of people, which was along the lines of he’s not good at, it was either willpower or discipline, which he’s in great shape. Obviously he’s black belt in jujitsu. He’s done what he’s done with the podcast. He’s the undisputed king of podcasting, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. And he said, “I’m not actually good at whether it was discipline or willpower, but I am good at obsession. It’s all on or all off.” And I’ve seen that, I’m sure you’ve seen this in a lot of the entrepreneurs who actually make it to the other side and create these mega successes, they are just obsessed. Bill Gurley: No doubt. Tim Ferriss: And that gives them a huge, not just knowledge advantage, but endurance advantage. You just go down the checkboxes. It’s all advantages, and — Bill Gurley: I had the opportunity to talk to Angela Duckworth when I was working on this and her book, Grit, talks about two components, passion and perseverance. And I heard a podcast she had done recently where she said if she could go back, she would put far more weight on the passion and the perseverance because she says, “We’ve taught our children to grind.” And so once again, starting in sixth grade, they’re told to learn the flute and take lacrosse and do all this stuff and crush the SATs and take the extra credit classes and all this. And they all do it and they all do it. And then they go to college and, “Oh, how are you doing?” They take six hours of class instead of four and they’re just going. But eventually she says, “If you don’t have that passion, you just burn out.” And so you’re right about the energy part. I think it’s both knowledge and you’ve put in more cycles. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. It makes me think of, maybe this is cliched in Silicon Valley because it gets so oft repeated, but a lot of folks listening will not have heard it, which is if you’re looking for the next technological breakthrough or something on the edge, look for what the nerds are doing on the weekends. But it’s not just a great way to find what might be coming around the corner in a few years. It’s a great way to find the people to bet on who are already using their excess, their free time to work on these things. Bill Gurley: No doubt. Tim Ferriss: I think of [inaudible 01:01:43] and 3D printing. I mean, I can just go down the list. How do you — Bill Gurley: And by the way, that’s another advantage of going to the epicenter is there’s more people doing that all the time. Tim Ferriss: Maybe you could, let’s talk about, people might be surprised by this, but Bob Dylan. I think this is just the quintessential example. Why is he relevant to what we’re talking about? Bill Gurley: When this idea popped in my head, I had finished a third biography and contrasted it with these other two and I just saw all these patterns. VC is a game of pattern recognition I guess my brain has just developed. I was like, “Oh, my God, it’s all this lock thing where these three people had all done the same thing.” And one was a basketball coach, one was a restaurateur and the other was Bob Dylan, not people you would, not industry, “Oh, this is where you should get career development advice.” There’s a part of the Dylan story that most people wouldn’t know unless they had read all the biographies or maybe seen the Scorsese documentary. But the new movie misses the whole thing, which is the pre-New York Bob Dylan was hanging out in Minnesota studying folk music at such a deep level that I feel confident in saying when he left, he knew more about folk music than any other human in Minnesota. And he was borrowing, and maybe that’s even a euphemism. He was stealing his friends albums, he was going into the record store, into these listening booths. He knew all there was to know and had studied every bit of it. And he’s referred to by Scorsese as a music expeditionary. And the people that knew him in New York said he could mimic any one song. It’s not what you would think of when you hear a Dylan song that he had mastered the bedrock underneath and then started innovating. Picasso, by the way, the same thing, perfect realist painter at age 14. If you go to the Barcelona Picasso Museum, it’s in geographic order and you’re shocked at how good a realist this kid was before he went and did this other thing. That bedrock knowledge I think is so differentiating for someone to have all the history and then to start doing the innovation. Tim Ferriss: What was the before and after on Dylan, Minnesota, New York City? And why is that such an important piece of the puzzle? Bill Gurley: By the way, and just to even pile on more on this studious part of Bob Dylan, he did a podcast series for a while where he just walks through all these different genres of music and he’s — Tim Ferriss: You’re talking about Bob Dylan himself? Bill Gurley: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Oh, I didn’t realize this. Bill Gurley: Yes, yes. You can go find it. He stopped, but he’s — and then that book he put out of the 50 best songs, the coffee table book that came out two years ago, it’s incredible the amount of knowledge he has about songs outside of his genre, everything. He’s a clear student of what he’s doing. I think this is well known and is covered at the beginning of the movie. He went to New York to find Woody Guthrie, probably the single most deterministic and ambitious mentor pursuit story that I’ve ever heard of. He hitchhiked there with no money and found him and became friends with him. Tim Ferriss: I mean, this echoes back to go where the action is also, right? Bill Gurley: Oh, no doubt. And by the way, he landed in Manhattan at the center of the folk music scene and all those people he was studying when he was listening in Minnesota, they were all there and he got to know them all. If that doesn’t happen, I don’t think Dylan happens. Tim Ferriss: How relevant do you think the go where the action is now considering the access to information using ChatGPT or other tools, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera? Maybe less so access to mentors, although you can have virtual relationships, but how relevant do you think that is? I’ve got my own opinion, but — Bill Gurley: You could certainly have the type of peer and mentor experiences that are remote. I have a great anecdote about MrBeast in the book that we could talk about that was a remote one, but the benefits of being in and around a whole bunch of people that are chasing the same thing is so high. And I think the intuition is, “Oh, well, it’s going to be even more competitive, so why would I go? Wouldn’t it be better to try and do this in a town where it’s less of a big deal?” But the problem is your learning is impacted, your access to peers and mentors is drastically reduced, and then probably most importantly, your optionality gets cut so dramatically. People think that a lot of success stories, they attribute it to luck, but there’s that famous saying, luck is when preparation meets opportunity. And when you’re in the epicenter, both your preparation and your opportunity go up 10 X. And so your ability to just have that lucky moment where you get brought into something is so much higher. Tim Ferriss: The lucky moment is, I think, really important to underscore in terms of going where the action is because there’s a lot you can do virtually, but let’s just say you’re using ChatGPT, you’re going to get what you prompt. In other words, you’re asking for something and that can take you down a rabbit hole, but there, at least in my lived experience, and certainly I still see this happening, when I moved to Silicon Valley in 2000, and then I look back at my angel investing career, I look back at all these collaborations, the vast majority of them did not come from me going out with an agenda and seeking something. They came from serendipitous bumping into somebody at a coffee shop. I literally met Naval Ravikant because I was hitting on his girlfriend at the time when she was getting her coffee, didn’t realize they were together. And then you look at Garrett Camp, Kevin Rose. These are, at a barbecue I met Kevin Rose. And you go down the list and you look at all of these formative, massively impactful, personally and professionally relationships. They almost all came from serendipity and you just don’t seem to get that density unless you’re in the center of the action. And perhaps it’s easier to relocate yourself, I’m sure it is, when you have fewer responsibilities, but God, I can’t even imagine what my life would have looked like had I not left Long Island and then ultimately moved to Silicon Valley. Bill Gurley: Yeah, and same for me. I had thought about the notion of venture capital and practicing it and probably would have jumped at any job I could have got. Like when I was at McCombs here in Austin, I tried to get an interview at Austin Ventures. I didn’t get one, but had they said yes, maybe I practiced there. And I’m glad that didn’t happen. Going and practicing it where I did was the exact right place to do it. I do think if you can, if you can, because there are financial constraints, and if you want to be great at a field and that field has an epicenter, I think you should go. Tim Ferriss: And there are different types of epicenters too. You think about, let’s just say AI, not to repeatedly bang that drum, but you could just say, okay, AI, first thing that comes to mind, Silicon Valley, but this is going to be a bit of a digression, but I remember asking Derek Sivers, a friend of mine, amazing entrepreneur, philosopher programmer, people can look him up, but I asked him, “Who’s the first person who comes to mind when you think of the word successful?” And he said, “Well, actually the most interesting or more interesting question might be who’s the third person who comes to mind?” Because I might say something really obvious like Richard Branson, but is he successful? I don’t really know what his goals were. I’d have to compare his goals to his outcomes. And then you get to the third. Similarly, with an epicenter, you could say Silicon Valley first, but there might be something that is dense in learning, but has other advantages like, I think it’s the University of Waterloo, but one of these universities where industry is trying to raid the academic program because it’s so strong in terms of teaching the technical side. There’s so many different ways to approach it, but let’s talk about a virtual example. You mentioned MrBeast. Could you describe that story? Bill Gurley: Yeah. I actually heard it on a podcast, but I also got a chance to talk to Jimmy Donaldson, so we got it firsthand. When he was infatuated with YouTube, he was one of the first people that was infatuated with YouTube, his parents were rightfully trying to get him to go to school and college, which he wasn’t doing because he was playing around on YouTube all day. He met three other people who were equally fascinated with YouTube. And this is a virtual epicenter story, but it’s really a peer story. One of my six principles is embrace your peers. And I think far too many people have sharp elbows to peers because they think they’re climbing the ladder and they’ve got to beat these people. And the world’s just way too prosperous to have that mindset. You can learn so much and get so much value from co-climbing that you should definitely do that. And I think it’s not taught enough and people don’t do it enough, but Jimmy happened on these three people and they got on a Skype call, he said 20 hours a day and for years — Tim Ferriss: Sounds like Jimmy. Bill Gurley: For years, they shared best practices on this call, which apparently in that world, the color of the icon on the post you do on Instagram to send them to YouTube, like all these little bitty esoteric things can impact conversion. And he said when he was talking about this, that they all became millionaires. And he said, “If you or any random individual had been a fifth person on those calls, you would have too, because of that.” And it’s just a wonderful example of how peers — he on this podcast said something that was very clever. He took the 10,000 hours thing from Gladwell and said, “Well, there were four of us spending 10,000 hours and then sharing ideas so you get 40,000 hours of expertise.” Tim Ferriss: How would you suggest people who are not on YouTube where you can identify outliers perhaps, I shouldn’t say easily. In this day and age, I mean, it’s a sea of participants, but how should people go about seeking peers? And do you rank order your principles in a way, for instance, do you want to first check the box if you can of go where the action is and then embrace your peers because the level will be higher? I think about, for instance, my experience in Silicon Valley, it could have just as easily for something else been Nashville or New York City or who knows, Shanghai. I mean, it just depends on what you’re doing. The mentors, let’s just say like Mike Maples Jr., who taught me the very basic ropes of angel investing, he definitely, without him, I don’t go zero to one in terms of having any basic literacy or access. That was the first rung on the ladder. But then once I was in, you look at people who were, in a sense, just getting started at the time. I mean, holy shit, some of them have really exploded. I mean, they’ve all done really well. Kevin Rose, Naval, Chris Sacca. The remaining — I mean, the latter goes on forever, but 49 rungs after that initial step up, zero to one, it was all peer driven. And those guys, we were comparing notes the whole way. Bill Gurley: See, that’s the thing. I would say, first of all, I would practice it wherever you are. I would practice it virtually. I’d practice it locally. And if you can move to the epicenter, I’d practice it there. I don’t know that it’s an either or thing. You can have multiple groups of peers. You can have multiple circles of peers. But I think there’s only two tests, and one is trust. There are people in this world who view everything as a zero-sum game and they will elbow you out the first chance they can get. And so those shouldn’t be your peers. Those people you should quickly push to the side. Trust and then this shared interest in learning. And if they are equally learning on their own dime in their free time, which is my test for whether you actually truly are passionate about something, if they are doing that also, that’s perfect. And those experiences you’ve talked about, I’ve had so many of them myself, they get excited to tell you what they just learned, right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Yeah. Bill Gurley: Yeah. And then you reciprocate. And by the way, Mike’s a great example. I really have both a passion and a lot of respect for people that are writers in their industry, and Buffett did it and Howard Marks did it, who I benefited greatly from. I tried my entire career to write quite a bit, but Mike does this. Mike’s very — he’s a huge sharer when it comes to his knowledge about the subject matter and it’s so great — Tim Ferriss: He is. Yeah. Pattern Breakers is an excellent book also. Bill Gurley: So great. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Yeah, Mike, I’m hoping to see him again soon. It’s been a minute. We’ve talked about MrBeast, Bob Dylan. In both cases, like poor kids with nothing to lose, in a sense. Not in any destitute sense, but they’re starting at — Bill Gurley: It’s funny — Tim Ferriss: — futons and ramen, right? Bill Gurley: He was just interviewed at DealBook also, and his mother was in the front row who apparently works for him now. He was telling the story about when he went to tell her he was dropping out of college, similar to the McConaughey story, not quite as abrupt, or Jimmy’s being more abrupt, but of course she’s happy now. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it all worked out. I mean, there’s always a little survivorship bias, but — Bill Gurley: No doubt, no doubt. Tim Ferriss: But let’s talk about Danny Meyer because I want to give an example of someone who gave something up to then pursue X instead of A, B, or C. Could you say a little bit about Danny? I’ve interviewed him on the podcast. I might have met him through you. I don’t even remember how I initially connected with him, but who is Danny Meyer and what is this Genesis story of Danny Meyer, the restaurateur? Bill Gurley: It’s funny, when someone asks me who is Danny Meyer, I feel compelled the first thing to say he’s one of the most genuine humans on the planet. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, for sure. Bill Gurley: Just a wonderful human. Tim Ferriss: For sure. Bill Gurley: But he is also one of the most celebrated restaurateurs of our time. He was working for a company that sold these devices to clip onto clothes so you can’t steal them from a retail store, and he was making good money. He was making about $200,000 a year, and this is — Tim Ferriss: At the time. Bill Gurley: — 40 years ago. Tim Ferriss: Real money. Bill Gurley: Real, real money. And he had convinced himself he was going to be a lawyer. I guess a lot of people convinced themselves of that. And he was about to take the LSAT and he was out to dinner with his uncle and his uncle was probing him and probing him and, “Oh, yeah, he’s going to take the LSAT.” And I think his uncle sensed a lack of real conviction about this thing, this person, this human was going to do. And he literally said to him, “Why are you doing this? You know you want to be a restaurateur.” And when you read Danny’s book, he did spend a ton of time in his youth being fascinated with restaurants and to the point where he would take copious notes prior to even doing this. His family had a reason to know that he had this deep passion, but it’s interesting it’s an uncle. I don’t know that a parent is going to jump in and say that, and maybe that’s an advantage I have not knowing the readers of my book and giving him this permission to do things that aren’t necessarily pragmatic. But anyway, his uncle said, “You should start a restaurant.” And he took the test. He never submitted the scores to a university and very soon thereafter enrolled in some vocational restaurant courses and took a job. He took the first job you could get, which was a front office job at a restaurant that was making about a 10th the salary that he was making in the sales job. Tim Ferriss: And went on to Gramercy Tav — I mean, all these iconic restaurants, then Shake Shack, then I mean, just dot, dot, dot, dot, dot. Bill Gurley: Yeah, and we walked through in detail his path once he made this intention, and one of the variables that my co-writer and I were looking for as we added stories to the book was this moment of intentionality. We didn’t want people that fell into a job and were successful. We wanted people that had made a decision, usually a pivot to say, “I’m going to go do this now.” And once he had made that decision, not only did he take that job, but he took advantage of being in that restaurant to learn about the multiple functions, but then he set up a tour through Europe as a stage in multiple places where he’s working for free, basically. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I’m so glad you brought this up because I wouldn’t have brought it up myself, but I’ve run — this is going to relate in a second. I’ve run a bunch of competitions for, let’s just say, creating artwork for PDFs/free books I’m going to put out or whatever, and there’s always a big hubbub where folks get, some folks get very upset and they say, “Oh, you want people to work for free?” And I’m like, “Well, there’s going to be a winner.” It’s like, if you don’t want to participate, don’t participate. But there’s always this shaking of the fist like, “Ah, it’s so unfair. You want people to work, do work for free.” When I look at almost every example of someone who became the equivalent of Danny Meyer in their world, they did a lot that was unpaid, almost always. I’m sure there are exceptions, but staging is a great example in the restaurant world where it’s like, okay, you want to work at a restaurant where you’re going to have the highest density of learning and you don’t know shit? Guess what? They probably don’t want to pay you a whole lot because it’s actually going to be a bit of a drain on their resources to show you around and teach you how to work your station and do all this stuff. I would just encourage people to not be allergic to that. And the way I got, in a sense, my foot in the door in Silicon Valley was I volunteered at TiE, The Indus Entrepreneur. Bill Gurley: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. [inaudible 01:22:33]. Tim Ferriss: I volunteered with all of these nonprofit groups and quickly realized that most volunteers are doing the absolute minimum to be volunteers. And if you just do 10% more, it doesn’t take much. I would just refill people’s water glasses and stuff after I finished taking their tickets for an event. And suddenly the producers of this event who were also doing it, but had real jobs. I mean, I had a job at a college [inaudible 01:23:00] and I was working a lot. They were like, “Wow, this kid’s a go getter because he’s refilling these water glasses. Let’s give him more responsibility.” And that’s how I ended up connecting with all these speakers and everything, just did some stuff for free on the weekends. It didn’t take a lot. Bill Gurley: There’s a story in the book that’s actually hard to believe. We profiled this woman, Jen Atkins, who’s a hairstylist. It’s an incredible story, but the one anecdote, she’s rising in her career and things are starting to work and she has jobs and she’s getting paid. She would go to Fashion Week in Paris and sneak in the back door and volunteer to do the hair of the models on stage. Snuck in. Not supposed to be there, just to get reps with these top models in this environment. Tim Ferriss: Incredible. Bill Gurley: It sounds unfathomable that someone would do that. She did it multiple times. Tim Ferriss: And she did it. Bill Gurley: Yes. Tim Ferriss: What ended up happening after that? I don’t know her story. Bill Gurley: Oh, she’s become probably the most successful hairstylist of our time. It’s an incredible story. Tim Ferriss: How do you suggest people who are, maybe they’re doing A, B, and C right now, they’re listening to this and they just say, “All right, I want to take the leap. I want to do Z. I want to do whatever the off menu option is.” Bill Gurley: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: They might have to have a conversation with a parent. They might have to have a conversation with a spouse. They may have to have a conversation with who knows, whoever the most important people are in their lives. How might they approach that? And we’re going to talk about choosing paths in a second, because I do have a question about maybe how to sanity check yourself in the world of AI, but how do you suggest having those conversations? Do you moonlight for a while so it’s not either or? Do you time box it or make it time bound in a sense where you’re like, “Hey, just give me permission to try this for six months, a year, two years.” Bill Gurley: It’s interesting that I think any of those approaches is realistic. We profile Sal Khan in the book of Khan Academy and he told his wife he wanted to go try it for a year. He had also, he worked at a hedge fund just like Danny Meyer. He was making real money. Tim Ferriss: Wow. I didn’t realize that about Sal Khan. Wild. Bill Gurley: And started working with his cousins across the globe online doing these tutorial exercises and ended up posting a few on YouTube. They started working and he told his wife, “I really want to go tilt at this.” He didn’t even know what the business model was and he went and changed it. Look, I think the real test comes back to this passion element, or we use a lot of different words because passion’s been considered trite, but fascination, curiosity. If you have this deep desire to know so much about this one thing that that curiosity is so high, I think the odds that that’s not apparent to whoever these people are you’re trying to convince is pretty low. And if you can show that you’re — because if you’re going to tilt at something that hard and if you’re going to really differentiate yourself by being that learned in that field, I think it’d be hard for someone to tell you not to go do it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: It’s not going to be easy. I don’t want anyone to think that, “Oh, just read this book and magic happens.” It requires effort. And that’s why this test matters so much, this test of whether you would learn about this thing on your free time. Tim Ferriss: And maybe are you already learning about this? Bill Gurley: Are you already learning about it on your free time? Tim Ferriss: Right. Bill Gurley: Yes. No doubt. Tim Ferriss: At least have one — Bill Gurley: You should be. You should be. I doubt you’re going to turn it on. Tim Ferriss: — data point based on history. Bill Gurley: Yeah. Well, actually, I have an example of someone who just turned it on. We have a chapter called Never Too Late, which is where the [inaudible 01:27:32] thing is because that happened when he was close to 40. Another local Austinite, Bert Tito Beveridge started his endeavor in the spirit business. Tim Ferriss: So wild, I was just thinking about him while I was driving here for no good reason. Bill Gurley: At the age of 40. Tim Ferriss: All right. Bill Gurley: He’s watching a PBS special. This is also hard to believe. He’s watching a PBS special. And back probably when there were only four channels or whatever, but they said on the screen, they said, “Take a blank sheet of paper, draw a line down it, put what you love to do on the left and what you’re really good at on the right. Just a list of those things and then contemplate what might be in the middle.” And he had studied chemistry and a lot of stuff and he liked going out to bars and socializing. And he was making flavored vodka as Christmas presents in his spare time. Tim Ferriss: What was his day job? Bill Gurley: His first career was in seismetology and the oil field and that dragged him to South America. And then when that became dangerous, both in Midland and in South America, he became a mortgage broker. Tim Ferriss: Okay. Bill Gurley: But he didn’t love either. He didn’t love either of them. But the reason I brought it up when you said, “already.” I don’t know that he was already studying the spirit business, but once he made that intentionality to go do this, then he studied it writ large. Tim Ferriss: How did he start, just out of curiosity? Because I was just thinking about him. He just acquired — well, Tito Beveridge just acquired Lala Tequila, which I was involved with. Bill Gurley: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: That’s probably why he popped to mind. But how did he start? Bill Gurley: He first started by just studying the distilling process writ large, like read everything he possibly could. And then it turns out there were no distilleries in the state of Texas and there were laws on the books that made it nearly impossible. So then he had to study that and literally rewrite regulation to make it possible. Interestingly, he did the whole thing on credit cards, so he owns 100% of the business, which is a huge business. It’s the single largest spirit sold in America today. Tim Ferriss: I didn’t realize that. Bill Gurley: Yes. Tim Ferriss: I didn’t realize it was that big. Bill Gurley: It’s huge. Tim Ferriss: Wow. Good for him. Bill Gurley: Yes. Tim Ferriss: That’s so wild. So wild. So I promised to get to this and I do want to get to it. Are there any sanity checks that you would put in place to compliment the fascination/obsession/what I’m doing in my spare time or would pay to do or do for free? Because I’m wondering if there are any things you would take off the table or how you would hone that given the rapidly developing technology of AI. So if someone said, “What I love to do in my spare time is copy editing.” I might not suggest that they throw caution to the wind and burn the ships and go into copy editing. Any thoughts? Because this is something that is — Bill Gurley: Well, the first thing I would note is that many of those pragmatic jobs that the well-intentioned parents have been pushing their children towards are at risk. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, for sure. Bill Gurley: So comp-sci. Tim Ferriss: Right. Yeah, risky, but as compared to what? Bill Gurley: Comp-sci went from being the most least risky major you could possibly get to one that’s somewhat risky overnight. And so that’d be my first notion. And the second thing I would add to that, which I already said is, no matter what your endeavor is, you need to be playing with this tool. It’s a modern tool. It’s the equivalent of a laptop and Microsoft Word was, it’s equivalent of what a calculator was. You don’t want to go out in the world and play without the modern tool set. It’s a part of what you need. If you’re playing with those things and you’re curious, you know where the edge is of whatever you’re passionate about and what the technology’s capable of. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So in order to find that edge and follow that edge, which will move, you have to be playing with the tools. Bill Gurley: And look, I think in any field, one thing I love to suggest on the learning side is, know the history and know the new innovative edge. If you bring both of those things to the table, you are highly compelling. That could be true even if you’re not chasing your dream job. Even if you’re just a marketing major, if you walk into an interview at Clorox and you can simultaneously show that you’ve studied all the historical best marketers and you also understand how TikTok works, that’s heavily differentiating in that interview. Like you’re going to get the job, I would argue, versus someone else, if you can portray those things. Tim Ferriss: How would you apply that here? Is that just, I guess, field dependent or are you referring to AI? Bill Gurley: No. Yeah. Well, I think AI is the leading edge of almost any industry. So yeah, I’m saying you should just study what it’s capable of. Look, the thing that LLMs are most capable of, it’s a large language model. The language type stuff, like your copy editing example, things that were just rote moving words around, yeah, it’s really good at that stuff. But it doesn’t mean that you can’t be the person that really understands what it’s capable of and then superpower yourself to go attack a particular interest. The other thing, you had started a question by saying warnings. I think there are a lot of fields where talent really does matter. I don’t know that I can make you a singer or I certainly can’t make you an NBA basketball player, but in all those fields, whether it be Hollywood or sports or even Danny Meyer at one time thought he was going to be a chef and he just became a restaurateur. He wasn’t a chef. I would say that for any artistic field, there are way more jobs that support those artists than there are the jobs of the artist. Tim Ferriss: What do you mean by that? Bill Gurley: I mean, we have an example in the book of a Hollywood agent and that individual had not thought about a job in Hollywood when they were growing up because they felt they couldn’t act. So they’re like, “Oh, I can’t go do that.” But there’s tons of jobs — Tim Ferriss: I see what you’re saying. Bill Gurley: — in Hollywood that aren’t — Tim Ferriss: Within the sector of entertainment. Bill Gurley: — that aren’t the talent itself. So if you’re passionate about basketball or you’re passionate about the chef example of a restaurant, like there’s tons of jobs you can go do, music industry, without being that particular person. Tim Ferriss: This makes me think of an interview I was watching recently, Patrick O’Shaughnessy, Invest With The Best. He was interviewing Ari Emanuel, so famous super agent, force of nature. His whole family is just like, they’re drinking different water. I don’t know what’s going on there. But he has raised a ton of money to invest in live events, sports and so on as an anti-AI or maybe AI anti-fragile bet, right? And there are lots of ways to make money when you raise a lot of money. So putting that aside, any other AI resilient or anti-AI bets that you think are interesting outside of live events, live sports? Bill Gurley: I think a lot of the service industries, I think humans enjoy experiences and I don’t think that changes personally that much. And so restaurateurs or hoteliers, I think all those things are going to thrive and people that know how to really differentiate experiences in that way, I think are — I personally doubt that — I don’t share this thought that we’re all going to go watch movies that we’ve imagined that are made just for ourselves. I find that hard to believe. I think people enjoy great art in many different forms. They enjoy talking about it and they enjoy the community element of having seen the same thing. And so it may be that if you’re a movie maker, you’re using AI instead of this expensive CGI tool set, but I think the storytelling and the imagination and the writing, I think all those things will still be real. I really do. And obviously just general business, entrepreneurship. I took my dad, who’s 93, fly-fishing in Montana this summer and we were at a lodge and one of the other guests that was staying there is a 28-year-old entrepreneur from the tip of Texas down near Corpus Christi area. And he had started three or four businesses and was well off, like I’m not saying — but he was so enamored with AI. He said, “And then I needed this, and then it did this, and then I needed this, and then I did this. And then I wanted to know where to put the next one of these. And I just ask it, where would you put it in the city? And it immediately gave me answers.” This guy was already successful, but he was running triple speed because he had tipped into this stuff and he was learning what was possible because he had an open mind towards it solving problems. And I thought, “Holy shit, if other people just leaned at it the way he’s leaning at it, they would become super powered themselves.” I was really blown away by that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. This makes me think of Kevin Rose. Kevin Rose is spending the vast majority of his free time playing with all these tools, vibe coding, using them endlessly. And I feel like that is probably over the next few weeks where I need to put some more time and just take a layup with wherever it happens to intersect with someplace that makes it easy to apply. Who’s Sam Hinkie? Bill Gurley: Sam Hinkie is a gentleman that about, I don’t know, six years ago became maybe the youngest GM in the history of the NBA. He became the general manager of the Philadelphia 76ers. Tim Ferriss: Why is his story relevant? Bill Gurley: He was a amazing student. He grew up in Oklahoma. His father worked for Halliburton. He made good grades, good students, kind of classic, did everything right, became a consultant. I think he was working for McKinsey, and they moved him to Australia. And he’s sitting there and he’s reading other things in his spare time. He’s not reading about how to be a better consultant. And he reads a book called Moneyball, which we all know of, the Michael Lewis book about the Oakland A’s. And in almost what seems like an instant decided, “I really need to be in sports analytics.” And I mentioned that a lot of the stories we found have this intentionality. So that book, just like The Last Laugh did for Seinfeld, that book told him, “I’m going to go do this.” And from the day he read that book to getting the job as the head of GM of the 76ers was about 10 years. So no experience whatsoever in the field to youngest GM of all time in 10 years. Tim Ferriss: Was he obsessed with sports already at that point? Bill Gurley: I think so. He played — this gets back to what I said about maybe your original obsession came from participating or being the talent, but then he’s not particularly big. And so yeah, he was successful in high school, but there was no path to keep going down that field. So yeah, he had immense passion for the category, but had never imagined himself in the field in one of these other roles until that book disinhibited him and gave him permission to think, “Well, you know what? I could be differentiated on this dimension, on this dimension of understanding analytics.” He immediately was applying to business school, and he used that as a pivot point. For those that have the needs and the resources, I think in MBA programs can be a great place to switch careers and go chase a different dream. And there’s a great interesting anecdote in the book where he’s trying to decide between Harvard and Stanford, which is a choice for most humans [inaudible 01:41:42]. Tim Ferriss: Quality problem. Bill Gurley: Yeah, exactly. But he went and told them both what he wanted to do and Harvard basically said, “Well, we don’t really have any programs like that.” And Stanford, to give Stanford a lot of credit, said, “You know what? That’s super interesting. We have this person associated with the school that does this. We’ll introduce you to these four people.” And were a lot like McConaughey’s dad when Sam brought them that challenge. Tim Ferriss: Sounds about right. That checks out for me. Bill Gurley: Yeah. Based on what you know of the two institutions. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: Yeah. And then he just started, he ended up meeting Michael Lewis because he was in the Bay Area and some of the Stanford people knew Michael. And so he talked to the guy that wrote the book that inspired him. He hustled his ass off. I don’t want to make it sound like — he kind of built his own curriculum, but it worked. Tim Ferriss: For people who are not going to get an MBA, would you still suggest everyone read the first three chapters of Michael Porter’s Competitive Strategy Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors? Bill Gurley: Unquestionably. Tim Ferriss: All right. Just wanted to — Bill Gurley: Anyone that’s going to do anything in business should read that book. Tim Ferriss: All right. I wanted to give the throwback to our first conversation. Bill Gurley: By the way, at the back of the book, it lists about 50 books. At the very end. Tim Ferriss: Just to whet the appetite? Bill Gurley: Well, I think you did the same thing. I’ve gone through your — Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah. Oh, no. Bill Gurley: In fact, I looked at yours for the structure when I wanted to see how to lay it out. Tim Ferriss: Oh, amazing. Amazing. I want to get your expansion on avoiding false failures. Let me explain what I mean by that. So there’s this expression, if you do what you love, you’ll never work a day in your life. Bill Gurley: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Right? Bill Gurley: It’s in my note. Tim Ferriss: But my experience has been, it’s not always fun, even if you’re doing what you love. Sometimes there’s burnout. Sometimes you go through chapters where things do feel like a grind. I mean, maybe I’m an outlier, but that’s been my experience. When I realized, for instance, in the case of the podcast, it’s like, “Wow, I have much more sponsor demand than I could ever fill. If I just doubled the number of episodes, I’d double the number of revenue. So why don’t I do that?” And it started to feel like a bad job. Not a bad job. Bill Gurley: I get it. Tim Ferriss: It’s still a great job, but the volume was too high. And I can imagine if people take the expression I just mentioned, if you love what you do, you’ll never work a day in your life. They pursue X, whatever that is, the songwriting and the performing in the case of Bob Dylan, Danny Meyer, whatever it might be. And then they hit a really hard stretch. Maybe it’s early on, maybe it’s later, maybe they’re [inaudible 01:44:46] and some French guy yelling at them. Bill Gurley: Yeah certainly. Tim Ferriss: It’s the case with a friend of mine. And they’re like, “Wow, God, this really feels painful. Maybe this isn’t my path.” How do you distinguish between growing pains that are temporary and an indication that you’re not doing the right thing? Bill Gurley: Yeah. It’s funny. I’ll take a short diversion in answering the question. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Long diversions. Bill Gurley: Because people often ask me, “How do you use AI?” When I was wrapping up the book, my publisher and editor said, “I want you to write the concluding chapter.” And I wrote what I think most people would do, which is I just summarized the whole book and I submitted it to him and he said, “No, this is no good.” And so then I went to ChatGPT deep research mode and I said, “Tell me about the 10 best nonfiction concluding chapters that you know of.” And it went and did like a 20-page report and sent it to me. And what I noticed in reading that was that most of these great concluding chapters were orthogonal. They weren’t a summary. They were a different take on the whole thing. Well, my concluding chapter is now titled It Ain’t Easy, to your point. And I went through all of the stories that we have in the book and I pulled out the darkest hour moments for each one of those people and included it at the end, because I didn’t want to leave people with the impression that it’s just all smiles and babies and hugs. I don’t think that’s true in any field. And I guess my answer would be, do you still feel this natural curiosity to learn the entire time? Is the impediment something that truly means you should stop like, “I can’t get around it. I can’t…” Or is it something that maybe can be avoided, something I can get around? I push heavily on the peer thing because one of the things a peer group can do is help you in those moments, both just from emotional support, but also to put perspective on whatever this speed bump is and whether it’s insurmountable or not. Mentors can help with that too, but I think peers are better for that because you worry about being judged in disclosing this. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, 100%. Bill Gurley: And so peers don’t judge. That’s why that trust thing really matters also, another reason why it matters. And they can help you. I think they can help you determine whether that is as big a blocker as it may seem like. But there’s going to be some of that in any field. I don’t think there’s any run that’s just without paying. Tim Ferriss: I’m also imagining that one of the challenges that I had and some of my friends had at different points in pursuing, fill in the blank, starting our first companies, just beginning to invest, having a career in X, right? When I got out of college, it was mass data storage and hitting these really rough patches and feeling like you’re the first person in the world to experience this and it’s because of your unique flaws or uniquely bad decisions. And I’m just realizing now, I haven’t tried this, I’m sure it would work, that you could just describe the dark chapter you’re going through into ChatGPT or one of these tools and say, “Can you give me any comparable examples from other people who have succeeded in other fields?” Bill Gurley: I’m sure that’ll work. It’ll also give you five answers on how to deal with it, how to get around it. Tim Ferriss: How to deal with it. Bill Gurley: But by the way, one thing that’s important when we’re talking about this is, Daniel Pink has this great book on regret, and he talks about it as a valid motivator to get you to make good decisions. And there is a reality that that anxiety you may feel may mean you’re not in the right lane. And so when you were at that sales job, you got to the point where you’re like, “Holy shit, I don’t want to be doing this anymore.” And I had two careers before I became a VC, one as an engineer and one as a sell-side analyst. I enjoyed both. I think I was good at both, but I reached a point about three years in with each where I was like, “I don’t want to do this the rest of my life.” And so I would say, equally with like, don’t give up too early, but if the signal is really telling you, I don’t want to do this the rest of my life, jump out. That’s the precise moment to move on and try something new. And I spend a ton of time in the early chapters trying to get people to understand that’s okay. Most people don’t end up in a career that their major was. I think one of the reasons people grind too long is because they think they’re supposed to. They just think they’re supposed to stay in this lane they’re in. Tim Ferriss: How did you conclude it was time to hop in those cases? We don’t have to go into tons of the background because we talked about so much of your history and decisions and so on, including, I don’t want to say stealing palm pilots, but it’s a pretty good story about getting a palm pilot with contact information. But was it just a gut feeling? Was it a disquiet that you felt in your system or was it more than that? Bill Gurley: I’m sure I’ve overplayed it in my brain, but they feel like very concrete moments where I had almost near certainty. The first one was, I started my third project at Compact Computer Corporation where I was an engineer and the projects were these computers we were releasing and the third one was another computer with a little faster clock speed and a better Intel chip, but the rest of it was all the same and we were going to do it again. I’m like, “That doesn’t seem that interesting to me.” And I’d become curious about other things. So when I was doing external learning, which is what I refer to as this kind of spare time learning, it wasn’t that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Right. Bill Gurley: It was something else. I was reading Peter Lynch’s book on stocks and stuff like that. Tim Ferriss: Right. Segue to the sell-side analyst. Bill Gurley: Yes. The thing that happened as a sell-side analyst, and and I may parlay this into something from the Daniel Pink book, but this notion of, do you want to do this the rest of your life? The sell-side job is wonderful. You get access so early in your life to so many amazing people, but you have to work really hard. And this classic thing where you’re in your 20s and you’re working on Wall Street, they serve dinner at the office. The cafeteria is open, that’ll tell you something. And it was like 10:30 or 11:00 PM and the entire research department was on the 36th floor of Park Avenue Plaza and I did a loop. The four corner offices were the most senior analysts. And for whatever reason, I popped my head in each of their office and they were career sell-side analysts. I said, “Do I want to be this person when I’m 60?” It just stuck in my head. I went to the next one, went to the next one. Hopefully — I don’t know who those people were, but I was like, “No, I don’t.” Like that night, I made the decision that I got to go do something else. Tim Ferriss: No, it’s one of — Bill Gurley: If you don’t mind. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, fire away. Bill Gurley: In Daniel Pink’s book, he talks a lot about boldness regrets. And this is where I say, “Do you want to do this for the rest of your life?” He says, “One of the most robust findings in the academic research and my own is that over time we are much more likely to regret the chances we didn’t take than the chances we did.” What haunts us is the inaction itself. Foregone opportunities all linger in the same way.” And he says that they’ve studied this across China, Russia, Japan, it’s common across all of them. And you may have heard of this YouTube video where Bezos talks about his regret minimization framework. And so he had the same thing. He’s walking around Central Park, “Should I stay in this incredible job at D.E. Shaw,” where he’s making tons of money, “or should I take this flyer on this online bookstore I want to do?” And he put it in his mind that test, which is when I’m 80 and looking back, am I going to regret not doing this? Tim Ferriss: Well, it makes me think of, and this is also a dicey proposition quoting Niccolo Machiavelli, but, “Make mistakes of ambition, not mistakes of sloth.” Bill Gurley: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Right? Bill Gurley: It’s the same thing. Tim Ferriss: And I do think about that a lot myself. I mean, I’m at a point where I’m trying to figure out what my next chapter is too, because this podcasting game’s getting pretty crowded. Bill Gurley: It is. Tim Ferriss: And I still enjoy doing it, but that’s only because I refuse to play by the incentives that the platforms and algorithms provide, which is economically punishing, but intellectually rewarding. Bill Gurley: Because you’ve had two successful careers as, not just a podcaster and influencer, but as an angel investor, I would encourage you to read Arthur Brooks’ book, Strength to Strength. Tim Ferriss: I did. I did. It was great. Bill Gurley: Okay. You already read it? Tim Ferriss: It was great. It was great. Bill Gurley: I think it gives great perspective for a later career shift. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I should go back and look at my notes from that book again. So let’s chat for a second. People should all check this out. I mean, you’re such an operator. Track record’s incredible. Runnin’ Down a Dream: How to Succeed and Thrive in a Career You Love, we’ll talk about that again. We’ll mention it again at the end. What do you want to do after this book? I mean, you can’t sit on your hands very long. Bill Gurley: No. And as I mentioned, when I made the decision to stop the venture career, which I think we talked about on the last podcast — Tim Ferriss: A little bit, yeah. Bill Gurley: — where I read the Steve Martin book. But I didn’t know. I knew I wanted to do something else. And I went on a listening tour and I talked to all these people that had — Tim Ferriss: Can you just reiterate what a listening tour is? Bill Gurley: Oh, I identified several people who had successfully—retired is a strong word—but made a decision to stop doing a job they were very successful at. And then what do you do now? It’s similar to the Arthur Brooks book, but it was just a personal life. A lot of people angel invest, a lot of people go on boards, a lot of people manage their own money. I had this list that people teach and I slowly was checking them off. Tim Ferriss: Just crossing out, yeah. Bill Gurley: Scratch them out, yeah. I don’t really want to manage my own money. I don’t really want to angel invest. I don’t want to start my own venture firm. I’ve done that. I found myself crossing them all off and I couldn’t discover something that got me excited and tied into this what are you doing with your external learning thing. Slowly, I’ve come around to an idea that I made up. It’s not a career that other people have, but I think I’d like to start a policy institute. I’ve come up with a name P3, which stands for Purpose, Progress, and Prosperity. When I was doing the BG2 podcast, which I recently stepped away from, we did a episode at the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Facility. Before I did that episode, I spent three or four weeks calling everyone I knew to make sure that I was prepared for that. That was one of our more successful episodes and I just really enjoyed that. I look at the shifting mindset around the globe on nuclear energy in the past five years as an example of what’s possible with really great policy work. It wasn’t one person. I think the fact that Steve Pinker was banging the drum was super important, but Andreessen and Elon and all these people started pounding that same drum. Joe Gebbia’s wife made this a big life passion project of hers. But it’s shocking how quick we went from, “This stuff’s bad,” to, “Oh, no, we made a mistake. It’s actually good.” That could have a powerful impact on the planet. I don’t know how many of those type things there are to find. I don’t want to go grind on state by state legislation. I don’t have any interest in that. But looking at big problems, looking at US-China relations, US healthcare system has some massive problems. Can you come up with ideas that help shift these things? I’ve already got to know some really innovative professors who are thinking in very innovative ways and I look to use my financial capabilities to do grant writing through people like that and see what we can go do, see what we can go change. Regulatory capture is another one that I’ve spent time tilting at. Tim Ferriss: If you’re not doing this state by state legislative change, what does the work of P3 potentially look like? What is policy work? I know that seems like a silly question but — Bill Gurley: We’re at day one, but I’ll give you — Tim Ferriss: What might it look like? Bill Gurley: Yeah, here’s an example. A professor approached me on the regulatory capture front. “What if we put — Tim Ferriss: Could you define that just for people who didn’t hear episode one? Bill Gurley: Yeah. There’s a Nobel Prize winner from the University of Chicago named George Stigler. He’s passed away but who made the very strong argument that regulation is the friend of the incumbent, that large businesses learn how to lobby Washington. No matter how well intention the policy is that’s passed, it ends up benefiting the incumbent more than restricting the incumbent. He won a Nobel Prize for that work. I gave a speech at the All-In Summit that you can go watch on YouTube. It has five million views on this topic, but I think this happens in the majority of the time rather than — anyway, this — Tim Ferriss: That’s why ACH takes three days to clear, right? Bill Gurley: Yes, yes, yes, yes, but stablecoin may solve that. But this professor approached me about making maybe a global database that scores countries on how captured they are and that identifies the best practices from the countries that have the best scores. That kind of thing, like investing in that type of data and transparency, is pretty compelling to me. That’s an example of what I might go do. Tim Ferriss: Well, let me chew on that for a second. Let’s say you create this data set that presents these scores on a country by country basis. What are the hoped for outcomes of that? That countries that have worse scores start to model the countries with better scores? Certainly, there might be talent flight from one place to another. I mean, we already see that in some respects. I mean, that’s not purely regulatory capture determined, but when you share that data, what would the hope be? Bill Gurley: The hope would be that you can shine a light on the best practices and try to get those implemented — Tim Ferriss: In other places. Bill Gurley: — here in the US. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: That would be the hope. Also, I think just shining a light on them is — I’ll give you an example that relates to regulatory capture. After you’ve been a senator or congressman for a while, you get invited onto committees. The minute you’re on a committee, you are in charge of regulation that affects different industries. I don’t even know if most humans know this. What happens is your local senator or your local congressman who you think is representing your district now starts raising money nationally. They go around and meet with businesses because they’re on that committee and have influence and they’re raising money nationally. I think that’s ridiculous personally. You could imagine restrictions against that, transparency towards it. If your congressman represents this zip code in Austin, wouldn’t you want to know if they’re raising money in Minnesota? Isn’t that a little unusual? Tim Ferriss: Well, you shared a story last time we spoke about being asked to raise a hundred grand in donations just to get a meeting with a Congress. Bill Gurley: Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yeah. Our mutual friend, Rich Barton, talks about shining flashlights in dark places. This technology that we have access to should — I think donations should be on the blockchain, quite frankly. There’s no reason why this information needs to be in the dark. I think there’s a lot of opportunity around data aggregation. Tim Ferriss: Any other ideas that are percolating? Bill Gurley: I’m enamored by state versus state competition. Part of it pops into my brain from the China experience and the provincial competition, but you see Newsom and Abbott fighting back and forth, and maybe there can be a positive outcome from this. I think some of the Federalist Papers envisioned that different states could try different experiments and we could see what happens as a result of that. Tim Ferriss: We’re seeing some of it with Texas and Arizona. Bill Gurley: We are seeing something. I think it could be pretty interesting and provocative and could lead to positive change. I have this dream that some state, and maybe this state that we’re sitting in that has a surplus, would do something crazy with teacher salaries. What if a state just all of a sudden said, “We’re going to pay 50% more for teachers”? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: Think about the dynamic that would create. It’d be pretty wild. Tim Ferriss: It would be. Bill Gurley: Maybe I’ll go tilt it that one, too. Tim Ferriss: So other problems on your mind — well, I’ll just present a list here from some prep notes. We have US healthcare, regulatory capture, intellectual property, US-China, fairness and financial markets, US K-12. Could you speak to intellectual property and fairness in financial markets, how you might be thinking about those? Bill Gurley: I’ve got to be a top 10,000% supporter of open source. This gets back to Ridley’s book, The Rational Optimist, but he talks about prosperity comes when ideas have sex. Just the sharing of information, in my mind, should be free, that it shouldn’t cost anything. It’s very unclear to me that the patent system actually adds value. I’m quite doubtful that the human mind wouldn’t innovate if it didn’t come with a 17-year financial protection. I’m doubtful of that. I think there’s great scientists at every university working on problems that aren’t necessarily being patented. Your ability for hyper competition and innovation is so much higher when there aren’t restrictions in place. Anyway, I think the world’s a better place when ideas are shared and not protected. Tim Ferriss: Since the system we’re working with is the system we’re currently working with, how might something like drug development work without patent protection? Bill Gurley: Well, here’s an interesting thing. The NIH gives out $40 billion a year and a lot of that money goes to companies that end up getting venture capital backing. Tim Ferriss: I’ve had some very open fights with people about this. Bill Gurley: Yeah. Why doesn’t an NIH grant come with an open source rider? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: Yeah. If the VCs want to fund — Tim Ferriss: With federal funding, yeah. Bill Gurley: Yeah, it’s federal funding. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I agree with that. Bill Gurley: Right now, there’s a big fight over whether just their research papers have to go on non-private networks instead of the private ones they’re on today. I mean, they just want the information out there. That’s a minor step I would consider a major step. You don’t have to take the money, but why is the US government giving people money that ends up becoming proprietary inventions? That makes no sense to me. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Whether it’s the US government or individual philanthropists or foundations. I mean, on some level, if that, then at some point — right. I agree with that, but are there industries that — I mean, the only one that first came to mind was drug development where the R&D costs are so high. Bill Gurley: They all cry. The VCs will tell you, “It’ll never work. No one will have any incentive if we don’t have a 17-year protection.” The entire Silicon Valley — Tim Ferriss: I’m not saying I believe that. Bill Gurley: I know. I’ve lived in a world where if someone comes into our office and talks about patents, we roll our eyes because none of the types of businesses that we’ve backed at Benchmark in Silicon Valley are ever about patents. Elon has famously open sourced all his Tesla patents. It’s such a bold thing to do and so gracious, I think, really to society, but his point is — oddly, I was talking to Ted Cruz about this and he said, “Yeah, Elon thinks the same thing.” He views the edge of competition is how fast are you moving, how great are your products, the consumers love them, not, “Can I defend them in a court of law?” The protection that the drug guys get is so much — no one can really use software patents to get protection, an algorithm, or something. No one even tries. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: But with drugs, if I have this particular genome sequence, all of a sudden I get this huge proprietary window in the market. It’s just nutty. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. This is not exactly the same thing, but, I mean, what a service to humanity. I was just watching — I think the documentary name, people can watch it for free on YouTube and other places, The Thinking Game, about DeepMind and Demis and his team really seeing AlphaFold. I mean, all the structures of these proteins, I mean, it’s just like, oh, my God, what an incredible resource for humanity. Bill Gurley: Well, there’s an interesting example right there. The original paper they wrote was open source and OpenAI doesn’t exist without that discovery, which happened at Google in an open source. They just exploited it the fastest. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, wild. Bill Gurley: And by the way, I mean, not to divert too much back, but right now China has 10 open source AI models that are all in hyper competition with each other. That is a dangerously effective primordial soup for innovation compared to what we have here. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I mean, I should probably know this, but I don’t, how does China handle — what are the policies around and laws around intellectual property, patents, things like that? Bill Gurley: Well, interestingly, I found a document online that someone had put together a PowerPoint about the history of open source at China and it’s 20 years old. It’s not like they just stumbled into it. Go back 20 years ago, one of the primary criticisms of China was that they stole IP. If you’re the Chinese government and there’s this new thing called open source, you’re going to embrace it because there’s no fault there because everyone’s sharing and everyone — If you look at the big open source projects, Linux, MySQL, and you go on the webpages, you’ll see Alibaba, Tencent — these companies have been supporting these technologies for a while. Every five years, they write this five year plan, the Chinese government puts it out. Five years ago, they had a huge section on open source. They’re clearly suggesting to the entrepreneurs that the government favors that approach. Going back to Ridley’s book and the notion of pure competition, I think the society — Tim Ferriss: This is The Rational Optimist? Bill Gurley: Yeah, I think the society benefits from that. I use this example. Imagine there’s two feudal societies that are all agricultural based. There’s two of them, though. And in one, once a week the farmers come to market and just trade goods and then they leave. And the other one, the farmers come to market and they’re required to share their best practices with everybody else and then they leave. Going back to this peer example in the book, that one’s going to be much more performant than the other one. This gets to Ridley’s point about ideas having sex. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I mean, open source also, we talked about this a decent amount in our last conversation, but it can be used as an incredible strategy or counterpunch from for-profit companies like Android. I mean, my God, I mean, it’s like you can do a lot. It’s an incredibly powerful tool. Bill Gurley: I think that using open source as a defensive tool instead of an offensive tool is one of the most sophisticated corporate strategies a company can possibly do. It’s very hard to do because it goes against all of your instincts. But I would suggest that Amazon and Apple and maybe Meta who has toyed with it should run at the idea of jointly supporting an open source model. I don’t think they’re doing it, but I think they should, because their incumbency is at risk if someone else has a massive proprietary advantage. Tim Ferriss: Fairness in financial markets, what does that mean? Bill Gurley: I’ve been tilting against this insider’s game of the IPO market for some time and I’m very passionate that when you bring a company public — Tim Ferriss: Does that come with the luxury of retirement or — Bill Gurley: Maybe. I mean, yeah, if you tilt against the investment banks, you got to be comfortable not going to conferences, that’s for sure. They owe some really nice funds. You fall off the invite real quick. But the way that an IPO’s price is so God awful stupid, they pick who gets the stock and they pick the price. I’ve said it over and over again, but a freshman comp size student and a freshman finance student, if you told them to design the IPO, they would just match supply and demand anonymously. It’s how every bond is priced. It’s interestingly how every initial coin offering works. I’ve become a late to the game crypto enthusiast because I’m so sick of this damn IPO process being broken. Tim Ferriss: Could you say a bit more about how it’s broken? Just walk us through a hypothetical example of why it’s broken. Bill Gurley: Yeah. When a company’s coming public, the bankers — literally, they ask everyone for orders, but then they pick who gets the stock and they pick the price. They don’t let supply and demand pick. Supply and demand can automagically pick the allocation and the price. Automagically is the wrong word, can algorithmically. This is super easy. It’s not hard. Tim Ferriss: Why don’t they do it that way? Bill Gurley: Because they’re handing free money to their clients. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, there we go. That’s what I was looking for. Bill Gurley: Yeah. No, it’s been known for a long time. I uncovered an email from 1999 at Goldman Sachs, which I’ve posted on Twitter several times where they’re like saying, “Oh, we can use this hot stock to reward our top clients.” They know what’s going on. The fact that the SEC doesn’t get involved really bothers me, but this tokenization thing is a real way to get around it because the crypto community’s already decided to use algoriththms to allocate and determine price. The price and the allocation should just be determined. It’s how direct listing work. Everyone knows how to do it. They just don’t do it. It’s horrible. But there’s other things too in this category. The long prevalence of Visa and MasterCard is just ridiculous, 2.5%, and stablecoins have so much momentum right now. I think those two companies are going to be in real trouble within a five-year window. Most of the financial problems are pure regulatory capture, like the reason that there’s a problem. Tim Ferriss: Tell me if I’m explaining this well, because I’m not sure we said this directly, but basically the incumbents help to write laws and regulations that favor them and prevent newcomers from competing effectively. Bill Gurley: After ’09, we wrote this thing Dodd-Frank and we thought, “Oh, we’re going to make things better,” and all you’ve had is consolidation and banking since then. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: If you look at the offering, especially at the low end for the poorest citizens of the US, free checking went away. The poor people have a hard time paying their bills, so they don’t even have the tools to do it because free checking went away. Free checking went away after Dodd-Frank. Tim Ferriss: Right. Just to please push back if I’m oversimplifying this, but the regulatory capture is not just bad for startups in Silicon Valley who hope to grow and disrupt and fill in the blank, it’s also bad for everybody. Bill Gurley: Oh, it’s horrible for consumers. I mean, the US healthcare situation, which seems to be getting worse on a daily basis, is a huge example of regulatory cap. Somewhere in the past 10 years, they just told physicians they can’t run hospitals. They just eliminated probably — I mean, who other than a doctor is going to go start a new hospital? The amount of competition you eliminated in this one swoop is enormous, just enormous. That’s just a single example, but there’s hundreds of them in that area. Tim Ferriss: What would success be for this book? Six months after it comes out, what will lead you to have been happy with putting the time in? It’s taken a while. It’s taken a lot of work. What do you hope the outcome will be? Bill Gurley: It really started as a passion project and I have no financial goals for whatsoever. In fact, as we get to book launch, I’m going to launch a foundation that gives grants to people who want to chase their dream job but don’t have the financial wherewithal to do it. I’m going to start working on that in addition to P3. For me, it’s all about how many people do I affect in the way that McConaughey’s dad did or that this book did for Seinfeld. Some of them saw the talk on YouTube from the UT presentation that I gave and I’ve already reached out and said thank you and they’ve shared how it changed their life. But the more people I can do that for, I will just be tickled pink. I’d just be so excited, because I think when people get out of this pragmatic lane and go do these types of things, they tend to be unusually successful, which I think then has a bigger impact than just on them themselves. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, for sure. Bill Gurley: The number of humans positively impacted by Danny Meyer’s success is in the thousands, I’m certain. Tim Ferriss: Oh, for sure. Bill Gurley: And I’m not counting customers of Shake Shack. Tim Ferriss: People, check it out. I mean, I love your writing, Bill. You’re not just a commentator. You’ve been an operator.

Tim Ferriss: And I thought we would start with a prop that you brought. So there was a very thick book with a tattered cover and I think that is as good a lead in as anything. And what are you holding? Bill Gurley: I’m holding a book called The Last Laugh by Phil Berger. The reason it’s tattered is I think it may be out of print, like I bought it used because I wanted to see it and have it. Tim Ferriss: What’s the subtitle? Bill Gurley: The Last Laugh: The World of the Stand-up Comics. Tim Ferriss: Why do you have this book? Are you thinking of making a career switch? Bill Gurley: No. No. No. No. So as part of researching my new book, Runnin’ Down a Dream, my co-writer and I were, we spent six years just diving through stories because I had done this speech at the University of Texas and we wanted to enhance it when we went to the printed form. And one of the stories we came across was Jerry Seinfeld and his decision to pursue a career as a comedian. And he was in New York. He wasn’t sure what he wanted to do with his life. He had an inkling, an inkling that he might want to be a standup comic, but he didn’t know what that meant. He didn’t know if it was a real career. He didn’t know that you could make money. And he read this book and it profiles, I don’t know, it looks like 15 different — it’s got Woody Allen, Bill Cosby, George Carlin, Lily Tomlin, Robert Klein. It profiled them in a way that was very disinhibiting to him. It gave him permission to go do this career that’s not a typical career. When you go to college, they don’t list standup comedian as something that you can go do. Tim Ferriss: The guidance counselor is not generally putting that on the multiple choice. Bill Gurley: Exactly. But this book served as something that granted him permission to go do that. Tim Ferriss: And we’re going to come back to that. I will say that I bookmarked this for future conversations, and of course we’re chatting outside of these recordings, but because two years ago, almost exactly when we did our first episode, you mentioned that you were working on a book idea based on the belief that it’s easier than ever to rise up because access to mentors and information is unprecedented. So we’ll come back to that, of course, and discuss it and the frameworks and the approaches and the stories at some length. But I wanted to start with some topical subject matter: AI bubble or not? And if so, what does that mean? Bill Gurley: Yeah. So I think this is super interesting. My partner, Peter, reminded me of a book that we had seen a while ago by Carlota Perez. It has this very benign title, Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital. It was written in like 2002. And what Perez simplifies and notices, which I just find perfect for trying to understand whether there’s a bubble or not, is that every time there’s been a technology wave that leads to wealth creation, especially fast wealth creation, that will inherently invite speculators, carpetbaggers, interlopers that want to come take advantage of it, think of the Gold Rush. And so people want to make it a debate. Do you believe in AI or is it a bubble? And if you say you think it’s a bubble, they say, “Oh, you don’t believe in AI.” Like, this “Got you!” kind of thing. And if you study Perez, and I think this is absolutely correct, if the wave is real, then you’re going to have bubble-like behavior. They come together as a pair, precisely because any time there’s very quick wealth creation, you’re going to get a lot of people that want to come try and take advantage of that or participate in it. So you get a flood of those types of people coming at it. And so it’s odd. There’s a real technology wave that’s fundamentally changing the world and there’s also massive speculation simultaneously. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, they come as a pair. I recall not too long ago, maybe two weeks ago, saw a short interview with your friend, Jeff Bezos, and he distinguished between financial bubbles and industrial bubbles and cited, and I’m paraphrasing here, but 2008 as an example of a bad bubble, financial bubble, versus, let’s just say, the early 2000s, ’98, ’99, 2000, where a lot of very important technology was created that then was durable after the fact and created new generations of entrepreneurs and a lot of economic growth. And he believes that AI would fall into the industrial bubble category of things. But I suppose, given that the dancing pair you described come together, how would you think about investing in private companies, modern venture capital at this point in time? And just, I suppose, as it’s changed since you were most active. Bill Gurley: Just a quick comment on that industrial bubble thing. One thing that is surprising to me is that even though I fundamentally believe this is an important real technology wave, the big players, even the Mag Seven, have all decided to do things from a deal perspective. You’ve read about these circular deals and whatnot. Tim Ferriss: Could you explain what you mean by that? Bill Gurley: Yeah. There’s a lot of talk out there, but it all started when Microsoft invested in OpenAI. OpenAI agreed to buy services from Microsoft, which is called a circular deal because you’re giving them money they wouldn’t have otherwise. And when Dario was on stage at DealBook last week, he said, “Oh, I can explain this. It’s not that hard.” Amazon wanted us to spend money we didn’t have, so they gave us even more money. And I’m like, “Well, that’s precisely why this is a questionable behavior.” But it’s gotten bigger. NVIDIA’s handed out money and then NVIDIA gave CoreWeave money, but then also agreed to buy any services they have left over. This stuff’s not ideal. Like if you were to say, “What’s crisp, clean accounting?” You wouldn’t do these things. And some of them say, “Well, it’s not material.” And which I would say, “Well, then why are you doing it?” And I’ve asked other people to try and understand how even big, sophisticated companies might get speculative using a word from previous discussion. And I hear things like, “Well, loss aversion tends to go down when you’re winning.” Like if you’re on a hot streak in a casino, you take more risk, things like that. But it is surprising to me. So when it comes to retail investors, I would be particularly concerned for them at this stage in the AI game because there is a plethora of SPV vehicles, but you’ve heard that phrase, I’m sure, SPV. This is where someone has an in on an investment and they do a one-off VC fund, if you will. Tim Ferriss: A special purpose vehicle. Bill Gurley: Yeah. It’s a single entity just for that one — Tim Ferriss: We have a chance to invest in X. We have an allocation of however much money, and then they can allow Jane Doe and John Doe potentially — Bill Gurley: And they take a rake on it. And there’s people promoting SPVs in situations where they don’t even actually have the underlying stock, or maybe they hope to get it. It’s the wild, wild west. And most of the people on that edge, I would put in the category of interloper carpet bagger. These are people that have come to this thing, and I just think you got to be quite careful. The investments that were made that have already had 100 X plus returns were made a while ago before this thing started. And that’s not to say there won’t be an incremental AI investment that makes money, I think there will, but your odds right now of that being the case are really, really low. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I would add to that and say, and this applies to me as much as anyone else, but your actual risk tolerance may differ, probably does differ significantly from your perceived risk tolerance if you haven’t had a huge drawdown, right? If you haven’t actually ridden a few of those waves and see how you respond in those circumstances, and you should be, I suppose, skeptical of how you view your own intestinal fortitude with some of those things, or maybe the losses you can absorb. Because I recall, for instance, I’ve seen this many, many times, but with these types of SPVs, people get involved, and let’s just say they’re not typically an angel investor, they don’t have the experience of watching 60%, 70%, 80% of their investments go to zero or become the walking dead, and they sign off on all of the, not necessarily waivers, but they accept, accept, accept the SBV terms of service, which I’ll say, “You could lose all of your investment. This is incredibly risky.” But then when it does go to zero, the financial and psychological impact is catastrophic. Bill Gurley: There’s a lot of people, and I think this comes from a very good place. I think they’re very well intentioned who look at the world and say — well, first of all, rising inequality, why can’t everyone have access to the same things? And then companies are staying private longer. So they say, we need to institutionalize the generic public’s ability to invest in private companies. And the problem, I think there’s two problems. One you just hinted at, which is most private company VC backed even go to zero, like the majority, which is not something people really — they sense that they want the lottery ticket, they want the Uber, they want the one that goes to the moon, but they don’t understand that that comes along with it. Tim Ferriss: They don’t want to buy losing lottery tickets for 12 years. Bill Gurley: Right. Right. Exactly. And the second problem is the information transparency in the private company game is just low. And I think the institutional investors have come to understand that and know what they’re getting into and know how to evaluate things. But if you come at it with a public market mindset thinking, “Oh, every set of financials I’ve been handed is audited and is correct.” And that’s just not the case. It’s super loosey-goosey. Tim Ferriss: So if you were, this may be a difficult question, but if you were angel investing right now, how would you be thinking about your approach? Bill Gurley: I’ll tell you a funny story. When I decided to hang up my gloves, if you will, and stop making institutional venture capital investments, I had a whole bunch of ideas about what I wanted to do next. And one of them was, “Oh, I’ll do a bunch of angel investing.” Bezos did it on the side. This would be fantastic. Tim Ferriss: He did pretty well with his angel investing. Bill Gurley: I was explaining this to a, I won’t say who it is, but a Silicon Valley CEO, very successful. And he said, “What are you going to do now?” And I said, “I was thinking of doing angel investing.” He goes, “Why would you do that?” He said, “I got 50 of these things. People don’t return my calls.” He goes, “I wish I’d never done it.” So there’s a unglamorous side to it as much as there is a glamorous side. And you’ve participated in this world before. So what would I say? I think if I were doing angel investments, I’d try and find in an intersection of people that are super curious and are playing with all these AI tools, but bring a perspective from a particular industry that gives them an advantage in that area where they could simultaneously be maybe the smartest user of AI in their genre, in their vertical. Tim Ferriss: So despite the, or maybe because of, because we talked about the pair, the AI bubble, you would still be looking at AI intersected opportunities if you were angel investing. Bill Gurley: Yeah. There’s a weird reality out there right now, and this could end if ever a bubble has popped or whatever, but the institutional investors have zero interest in non-AI deals. Zero. It’s more black and white than I could be successful in — Tim Ferriss: And for people who do not know the term, define the institutional investor. Bill Gurley: People who are paid both a salary and a piece of the return to be active investors of other people’s money, using other people’s money. But the reason that kind of matters is if you angel fund a deal and have any hope of it raising money in the future, if it’s not AI related, right now — Tim Ferriss: Could die of neglect. Bill Gurley: There is no interest. I can’t state clearly enough how there’s zero interest. And I could simultaneously make fun of that reality, but I could also justify that reality, but it is the reality right now. And by the way, while I mention that, I feel obligated for your audience. I don’t care what field you’re in, you should be playing with this stuff. It has the potential to impact your role in your career, and the best way to protect against any risk of your career being obfuscated or eliminated from AI is to be the most AI-enabled version of yourself you can possibly be. PREROLL Tim Ferriss: How would you think about, maybe you can give a hypothetical example of looking for someone who has very, very sophisticated domain expertise and experience who’s now intersecting with AI and has a unique, because of the combination perspective on things, to invest in as an angel investor and separate that from something that’s just going to be consumed by the fundamental models and these larger companies that — Bill Gurley: From a career perspective or — Tim Ferriss: From an angel investment perspective, how would you pick folks you don’t think are just going to end up working on something that gets replicated in short order by the bigger companies? Bill Gurley: Yeah. The key is just to stay pretty far away from the edge of whatever. You can go online and see interviews with the people at Anthropic or OpenAI and what they’re working on. If it’s the next thing they’re going to do, I don’t think you’re going to be protected. But as I think about founders and angel investors, you’re talking about a pretty broad array of things. At this point, as I mentioned earlier, you’re not going to back the next big model company. Besides, if you were, you need a billion dollar angel investment to go make that happen. It’s just really, the game’s changed. There’s so much money involved. And so I think you’re going to want to be off the beaten path anyway. When I think about these deeper verticals, I don’t think it will make sense for OpenAI to go crush every little vertical. Tim Ferriss: Waste management. Bill Gurley: And even if the model’s capable of understanding that subject matter, there are workflows, there are data sets that are local to your customer, and that stuff has to be stitched together. So I think having an understanding of a particular industry and one that’s not going to be on the next thing to do list at OpenAI, it would probably be your best bet. Tim Ferriss: Got it. So is it fair to say, if I’m understanding you correctly, that effectively looking for something that would not be a high priority for one of these larger companies and also a proprietary dataset of some type? Bill Gurley: Proprietary datasets, the more workflows that exist are better because you can build software around those things that — Tim Ferriss: What is a workflow? Bill Gurley: The thing that popped into my head, I’m on the board of Zillow. Zillow’s been investing for the past five years in tools that help the realtor do their day-to-day job. They have a tool called Showing Time that helps you book in person tours at houses as an example, but there’s putting the mortgage together, getting the sign-offs on. There’s just all these tasks that have to be happened that can be automated in the — And so tasks that can be automated, that can be integrated with AI, the more of that stuff you can build into a system, the better off you’re going to be protecting yourself from a model that just answers questions, which is why I brought it up. Tim Ferriss: All right. Let’s move on to big topic, big country, China. You spent 10 days there over the past summer. What was your experience? What did you see? What made an impression? What did you do? Bill Gurley: Yeah. I’d been about six times before, so this is like my seventh trip. It was one thing that was different. My daughter is an Asian studies major, as you were, and she spent the summer in Hong Kong. So we picked her up and then we toured six cities in 10 days. And my objective with this trip, in the past trips, it was mostly just to meet with entrepreneurs and founders and mutual sharing of information, that thing. This time I was more interested in just kind of being eyes wide open and learning. And so we took two of the high speed trains just as an experience that I got a tour of the Xiaomi factory with their new car, the SU7, and was trying to get a feel for what’s most recent there. And we went to Shenzhen, the overnight city, which has gone from, I think, less than 100,000 people in 1980 to 20 million people. And just to see the scale and scope of the whole thing, there’s a lot of rhetoric in the US about what is or isn’t happening in China. And I just wanted to have a better feel for it. And we’re making policy decisions that are going to impact the global footprint, and God forbid, end up in a World War three situation. So anyway, I just wanted a better understanding. I was aided by the fact that Dan Wang shared his book Breakneck with me right before I left, and I read it while I was there, which was interesting. And then it came out, and of course it ended up on the bestseller list. But I think China’s misperceived in a lot of ways. Tim Ferriss: What are some of those misperceptions? Bill Gurley: The biggest one is that people who have a rudimentary understanding of what is happening there, you use this word communism to infer a lot of other things. And one of the things that’s inferred by communism is top down state run system. And I think they think of Russia and they assume, “Well, that’ll always lead to bad capital allocation, no innovation.” Because they have this picture in their mind of these, I don’t know, brick buildings, like with snow all around them and not much happening. And the reality there is just far, far different from that. I think Dan Wang did a great job of explaining how the country puts out this five-year plan, but then the provinces, which they’re a lot bigger than a US state, but they’re the equivalent, like it’s how the country segment and they compete with each other. And the effective mayor of the province, if he does well, has a chance to move up in the system, which is not a reality in the US system. But what that leads to is just a massive amount of competition and — Tim Ferriss: What are the metrics by which they’re being judged? Do you have any idea on a province level? Is it some equivalent of GDP? It’s not the right term, but — Bill Gurley: I’m guessing probably we could go talk to AI and get a better answer than I have right now. But yeah, I would think that’s part of it, prosperity, employment, those things. By the way, this provincial competition has also led to overbuild of buildings. It’s not always positive, bridges that aren’t used, there’s a Go cities. Go cities, yes. But you end up with hyper competition. So I think the thing that a lot of people in Silicon Valley love about capitalism is this notion of the invisible hand and competition that leads to innovation and best practice, and the winners rise up and they’re better for it. That is happening there. And if you read about the solar industry or the EV industry or now the robotics industry, they have hundreds of different companies competing in these fields and it’s brutal competition. And as a result of that, they’re ending up with very innovative companies, which once again, I think people wouldn’t prescribe to being possible in a communist world and remarkable execution from an industrial standpoint. So the price points of the products that will be sold around the globe are well below anything that could be done in the US. Tim Ferriss: How do you go about getting a tour of Xiaomi factory? I would think that they would be very closed about that. What’s in it for them and how do they — Bill Gurley: I don’t know if you saw this going around the internet yesterday, but they shipped a car to this YouTuber. Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah. I saw it. Yeah. Absolutely. Bill Gurley: Which is brilliant. And he did like a 15 — that’s the SG7, that’s the factory I went to. As I mentioned, I’d been there before, so I met Lei Jun, who’s the Founder of Xiaomi in 2005 when he was chairman of Joyo, which was a E-commerce company that Amazon bought. So he’s been around a while. He has evolved into, the best thing I could say is he’s the Steve Jobs of China right now. When he quit doing Joyo and he had this other company as well, he declared 10 years ago he was going to build a smartphone. Just out of the blue, I’m going to build a smartphone. He didn’t have any smartphone experience, but Xiaomi’s now the third-largest manufacturer of handsets in the globe. And about four or five years ago, at about the exact same time Apple hinted they were interested in building a car, he said, “I’m going to build a car.” Tim Ferriss: Well, not only did he say I’m going to build a car, but that was a response to sanctions. That was an emergency. Well, I listened to the translation of, even though my Chinese is decent, but it’s not as good as it once was. I think it was 2024 company-wide address where he talked about the sanctions coming in saying, “What if we couldn’t make phones? What would we do? Bill Gurley: But that talk is unbelievable, and it’s translated on YouTube, and I would encourage people to watch from about minute 30 to about an hour 15, which is where he talks about his process for designing the car. I don’t know if you saw that part. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I did. Bill Gurley: But it’s crazy. He says, he put a note on any car in his parking lot that he had never drove, and he would ask each employee to give him three positives, three negatives and loan them the car. Said he drove 200 of his employees cars. When you hear that stuff, you’re like, “Wow, I wonder if anyone at Apple did that.” It’s just such a bottom up, just ground truth way to start the process. But even still, even if he did that, a bunch of people could do that. How do you have the wherewithal to build a factory? He’d never built a factory before. And I’ve been in other car factories here in the US. It was phenomenal. Anyway, back to your question why I could get in. I knew Lei Jun from way back when. Tim Ferriss: What does the process look like? Are there a bunch of clearances and you have to get the okay from the provincial? Bill Gurley: I don’t think we went through the whole factory, but no, it wasn’t that. They’re a public company. I think they’re interested in being well understood, which I think hints at why they enabled this. I think they had to send a car to this guy, the YouTuber. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: And by the way, the President of Ford went over there about six months before I did, went on the same tour, so they let him go there. And he had an SU7 shipped to Michigan, and he drove it for several weeks and he’s talked about how incredible it is. Tim Ferriss: Well, he also, if I’m remembering correctly, has talked about EV production, and battery dominance or at least component dominance from China and the risks inherent in that. And I don’t want to bleed too far into geopolitics, but it’s hard not to pull it into the conversation. So this is a question from X, the artist formerly known as Twitter, one of many questions. But I’ll ask, what are your top handful of critiques say of the Chinese tech ecosystem or CCP after going on a tour there? What would you say they’re not doing well or things that complicate their ability to compete? Bill Gurley: Well, the first one that’s I think been well publicized is when an entrepreneur has risen to a level of success and then uses that as a platform, the government seems uninterested in that. Tim Ferriss: Exhibit A. Bill Gurley: The Jack Ma. Tim Ferriss: Jack Ma. Bill Gurley: Yeah, exactly. And there’s a saying that I think I heard while I was over there, “Don’t be the tallest tree.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah, this is, Don’t Be The Tallest Tree. Yeah, the nail that sticks out gets hammered down in Japan. They have a totally different system obviously. Bill Gurley: The other entrepreneur outside of Lei Jun is the ByteDance CEO. And ByteDance is probably got the leading position for the consumer AI, like Open AI, but over there right now, in addition to just incredible revenue growth. This is the company that owned TikTok and whatnot, but they’re not going public and you don’t see him at all, which may get to this tallest tree thing. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, celebrities also disappear over there. Bill Gurley: No doubt. Tim Ferriss: Very mysteriously. Bill Gurley: Yes. Well, and business people. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: So yes, that does happen. Tim Ferriss: I will say, and for people who are wondering, because there are a lot of — how should we put this? There are people who are very angry, very hawkish. Some people are very, very supportive, and then their agendas or alliances get questioned. I, like you, I’m just interested in understanding what is happening to the extent that I can. What is the actual truth on the ground? What are the details? And frankly, the innovation over there is remarkable. And what they’ve done in terms of establishing access to rare metals and everything they need to manufacture is remarkable. You go to South America or Africa, and it is Chinese everywhere on infrastructure projects. They’ve been very, very smart about it. So I’m deeply interested in all of it, and please hold your thought because I want to hear everything you have to say. What I would say is a piece of the three-dimensional chess that I’ve been impressed with is how well the Chinese government is able to — well, of course they’re able to integrate with the private sector so that they’re able to use, in a sense, products to widen their scope of access potentially. Like DJI, for instance, great example. People have a lot of questions around these cars, as spectacular as they might be. Are they an extension of surveillance? These are open questions that I think are worth asking. But you were about to say something, so I’ll let you — Bill Gurley: No, no, no. I think let’s come to that. Let me make one point and then let’s come to that. So there’s two other things I wanted to mention. Obviously, infrastructure. So they are building new nuclear fission plants. So fission being old school, not new school, at one fourth the price that we do it here in the US. So is South Korea, by the way. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. And the numbers are incredible. Bill Gurley: But when we sit here and say, “Oh, we want to re-shore manufacturing, and they can build things at one fourth the price we can.” If you don’t solve that, you’re going to re-shore something and we’re going to not be price competitive globally. And then because you won’t import what they have, and you’re going to make our citizens buy from this new factory where we’re making things way more expensive, it doesn’t work. Tim Ferriss: The math doesn’t math. Bill Gurley: It doesn’t work. And by the way, I’m not sure it brings jobs. The Xiaomi factory was a third based on some numbers I was able to acquire, a third the number of employees per car output. And I got to believe in 10 years it’ll be a sixth. And so you could calculate the total number of jobs that you’d be bringing back if you brought back all this car production and it’d be hundreds of thousands. It’s not millions and millions of jobs. So anyway, that infrastructure thing’s for real. And I think Dan Wong does a good job of saying that America’s run by lawyers. Tim Ferriss: And this is the author of Breakneck. Bill Gurley: Our country’s run by lawyers and theirs is run by engineers. Engineers. And so when you try and build something here, the lawyers just get in the way and try and block it, which certainly when you hear Elon talks about why the Gigafactory is here in Austin and not in California, it all relates to those things. So anyway, that’s infrastructure. There’s another thing that’s I think quite interesting, which is the government may not care about whether or not their companies have really big market caps. And when I first realized this, you saw what happened when they took down Alibaba when they went after Jack Ma, and Amp Financial could have been this big thing and it got a haircut, and you question, well, do they care? And if you are pushing your companies to be low cost providers, maybe that’s at odds with them being hyper profitable and really big. And then you can turn around and ask the question. Hearing that caused me to ask the question, does America really benefit by the fact that the Mag Seven have $3 trillion market caps? I know the employees of those companies do, but is that a sign of our competitive capitalistic society not being truly competitive? Tim Ferriss: On a global scale. Bill Gurley: No, even within. There’s a notion you learn about in economics classes called pure competition. And in pure competition, no one has an intellectual property advantage. Marginal profits are whittled down just to the cost of capital, and the consumer benefits because there’s no excessive profit capture. If we have all these companies that are able to have excessive profits, is that a form of market failure? And does the fact that they exist help America in any way? At first, of course I’m a venture capitalist. I want to think, yes, of course. But then as I think about it, I don’t know that our government, or our society, or our people are better off because these six companies have $3 trillion market caps. It’s not that many people that — the percentage of the country that’s employed by those companies is small on an overall basis. And so anyway, I think they have a different perspective on whether big market caps matter, and I think that is somewhat intriguing. Tim Ferriss: What do you think about the innovation in China leading in some cases to the development of superior technology at a lower cost, that is plausibly an extension of the intelligence gathering apparatus of the government? Is that a real thing? Bill Gurley: I’m not in a good place to know. Tim Ferriss: I would have to imagine it seems like they would have to be stupid not to use that given their ability to penetrate the private sector. Bill Gurley: Yeah. I think it’s certainly well known that they do surveillance of their own people. I know that would be particularly upsetting to people like Greg Luciano that runs FIRE and is very interested in free speech. The flip side is there’s very little street crime. You walk around, you don’t worry about that when you’re there. Tim Ferriss: It’s true also in Japan though, right? Bill Gurley: It doesn’t make it right or wrong. It is what it is. And I don’t know that we have this ability to tell them how they have to do it. Now, to the extent that the Huawei stuff where their products are being shipped out, and then those are used to gather intelligence out of their country and the rest of the world, of course that’s a problem. But I think the way to deal with it, I’m not a politician, but I think the way to deal with it — I’m more of a believer of the engage. Engage, talk about what you don’t like and what you do like, and try and negotiate that problem away like we’re trying to do with the fentanyl precursors. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Well, way back in the day when I was an East Asian studies major, this was lifetimes ago. And keeping in mind, I was at the Capitol University of Business Economics in 1996. That was the bicycle era, these old photographs of Beijing with millions of bicycles with people in their long green jackets. I had one of those jackets for the winters. It gets really cold. But things have changed a lot. At the time, I was looking forward and thinking I might be one of those people who could engage in Chinese. I think the way to do it is in English, frankly, for a whole host of reasons. But even if you speak the other language, Putin speaks English pretty well, but he does all of his negotiations when he’s speaking in Russian for a lot of good reasons, the same good reasons. Bill Gurley: I get that. But look, so first of all, I do get accused of being like an agent of the CCP or something, even by some of the people that responded to your Twitter thing. I’m not. I’ve only visited a few times. I don’t know anybody in the government, but I worry greatly that we make bad policy decisions if we misunderstand what’s really going on. Tim Ferriss: Oh, I agree with that. Yeah, I fully agree with that. I’ve thought about — I frankly am worried about it. I would take a burner phone and a burner laptop. I’ve thought about it, because I want to get a better understanding of the culture of innovation that can be fostered, and exactly how things are to the extent that it would be visible to me, how things are developing in China. I’ve thought about going there. I thought about doing the same thing in India, too, to go and interview 10 of the top entrepreneurs. But the reason I haven’t done it is that I’m just like, I don’t know what radars that’s going to put me on, what surveillance, what fill in the blank, how difficult is it going to be? Whose rings am I going to have to kiss? Am I overthinking it or is it straightforward? Bill Gurley: I think you’re overthinking it. I think the odds that Tim Ferriss would disappear in China is really [inaudible 00:44:26]. Tim Ferriss: Oh, I’m not worried about disappearing. That would be a terrible — the upside downside on that doesn’t make any sense. I’m not worried about disappearing. Bill Gurley: There are companies that may not speak with you. When I was there, DeepSeek and Unitree, the word was out on the street that they’re not meeting with Westerners for reasons that are — Tim Ferriss: Well, I’m sure that’s true conversely in the US too, right? Bill Gurley: Yes. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I’m sure that’s — and by the way, I think that reflective lens, when you think about the country is helpful. When Alex Karp was just on stage at DealBook last week, he was talking about surveillance and he says, “Well, of course our tools are used to surveil the enemy.” And I’m like, “Okay, well, my God, the Chinese are surveilling us, but obviously we’re surveilling them too. Let’s be honest about these things.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah. It’s a lot easier for a bunch of obvious reasons. It’s in some respects, a lot easier for them to surveil us than the other way around. Partially just due to the homogeneity of the society over there. You can’t send a bunch of blonde-haired, blue eyes, black, Latino, whatever, to China to end up at top universities, top companies, et cetera. It’s just a lot harder. Bill Gurley: By the way, to put a bow on this part, I would say there’s two other things. One, you hinted at. One, the supply chains are so integrated in China down to the raw material level, that even if you brought a factory back here, it’d be more of an assembly shop and you’d still be sourcing from there, which isn’t necessarily cost competitive. And to replicate all of it would take a very, very, very long time. Tim Ferriss: Well, including raw materials for staple pharmaceuticals, There’s a lot going on. So what at this point, is it a day late and a dollar short for the US? I know I almost promised we weren’t going to go into this, but I want to know your opinion. I’m so curious. What are the keys to the US remaining globally competitive and vibrant as an economy? You hinted to one, which is, it seems inevitable, nuclear power or more power. So how do you do that? I’m not sure how quickly you can right the ship, although it seems like a handful of people have done a pretty good job of changing the narrative. What are some of the key things in your opinion that the US needs to do? Bill Gurley: One is make it easier to build. Tim Ferriss: Build companies? Build? Bill Gurley: I think build infrastructure. If you’re going to build semiconductor plants, if you’re going to build nuclear plants on time and on budget, that’s very hard to do in the US right now. And the glimmer of hope I would say is that a few states seem to have governors that want to get stuff out of the way. And I think it’s red tape and bureaucracy, and lawyers, and litigation that make this stuff so expensive. And so Texas and Arizona seem to be getting their unfair share of data centers and semiconductor plants. And I think because of that attitude, I’ve seen a similar attitude in Pennsylvania where they repaired I-95 in 12 days, but they literally had to take a bunch of statutes that are on the books and say that they don’t apply right now. So that mindset I think needs a lot more momentum. That’d be one thing. There’s another thing that I think is important for people to understand on the China front. There are numerous people with a loud microphone that will say, “Oh, they know how to scale out plants, but they don’t know how to do any innovation.” And that’s just flat wrong. Whoever’s saying that just hasn’t been there. They don’t know the facts on the ground. These entrepreneurs are every bit as good as the entrepreneurs they are here. There are examples like in LIDAR, they built a MEMS LiDAR product that’s like $130 a car. Tim Ferriss: What is MEMS LiDAR? Bill Gurley: It’s solid state. It uses solid state semiconductor technology instead of that big spinning radar. And so the LiDAR on a Waymo is $5,000. And it’s $130 for MEMS LIDAR. They’re putting it on every car. You can go into ChatGPT and say, “Tell me about MEMS LiDAR innovation in China.” But it’s a great example. Le Jun’s another one, but anybody that thinks there’s no innovation is just — Tim Ferriss: Yeah, they’re just wrong. Bill Gurley: They got blinders on. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. No, that’s not true. That’s definitely not true. I asked you two years ago if there are any countries that you’re long on. At the time, I’d be curious if this is still the case. You said you’re long on the UK, less regulatory capture. Bill Gurley: Did I say that? Tim Ferriss: Losing party pay is in the legal system. Bill Gurley: I do love that. Tim Ferriss: Which reduces frivolous litigation compared to the US. Any thoughts on where you’re bullish these days? Bill Gurley: Well, ironically, Matt Ridley was in town a few weeks ago in Austin. Tim Ferriss: The Rational Optimist, other books. Bill Gurley: I love his stuff, but he would say that I would be dead wrong on that. Things aren’t going well there. And he lives there. So I’ll just take that as I got that one wrong. Tim Ferriss: Well, it depends on the timeframe too. Is it two years, or is it five years or is it 10 years? Bill Gurley: One of the things that’s been impressive about China is since Deng Xiaoping brought back capitalism, 500 million people have come out of poverty. And you look at countries that have a very strong work ethic, and a high education, and a currently low per populate income, and you would think more jobs would come their way. So two that would pop for me are Vietnam and Turkey, who check all those boxes. Tim Ferriss: All right. Bill Gurley: Hopefully I do better then. Tim Ferriss: Check in in another two years. All right. So let’s talk about, this is going to be a segue to talking about Runnin’ Down a Dream and all things involved with that. Maybe we could start with an anecdote from a fellow Austinite, likes to play the bongos, long hair, associated with smoking reefer every once in a while. Matthew, we were talking about a short anecdote about Matthew before we started recording. Would you mind sharing that? Bill Gurley: Yeah. As I was preparing, as I was wrapping up the book, I started listening to Greenlights, and I was told you had to listen to it because of course he reads it. So you get all the great McConaughey affectations as you read it. But there’s a story in it that just popped in my brain and summarized exactly what I’m trying to accomplish with this book, Runnin’ Down a Dream. And he had spent the vast majority of his young adult life—so this anecdote is from when he was like 20, 21—telling his family he was going to be a lawyer. And so he’d gotten into the University of Texas. He was Pre-Law. Every time he went home, he talked about, “Yeah, I’m going to be a lawyer.” And he had met some people at Texas that had convinced him that he should switch to film school. And he had immense anxiety about sharing this with his father. This is all in the book, but his father’s a very tough individual. And so reason to be fearful when you’re going to drop some news. “I’m no longer going to be a lawyer. I’m going to go to film school.” And he builds it up a lot in the book. I didn’t know when I was going to talk to him. You can imagine being in that situation, you’re delaying, delaying, delaying. But he finally tells his dad and his dad utters this very simple phrase, “Well, don’t half ass it.” And he says, “Of all the reactions he could have had, don’t half ass it were the last words I expected to hear and the best words he could have ever said to me.” And he said in that single moment, he gave him blessing, consent, approval, validation, privilege, honor, freedom, and responsibility, called it rocket fuel. And I’d like to believe there are a number of people out there, young adults, maybe even some midlife career who have this notion that they should be doing something else, but society has put them on a path, or just the way they matriculated through college, put them into a career that they just don’t love and that they have this inkling that they could go do this thing. Or maybe you’re a young kid and you really want to do X, but everybody else is telling you to do A, B and C. I want to help them have the confidence and permission to go do X, to go chase this dream. And as you hinted at from our last call, I think the amount of your ability to make connections and to gather information and learn on your own pace, has never been better. You can literally just sit there and talk to ChatGPT six hours a day if you so choose, and learn so much about any particular field. And so your ability to take things into your own hands, and to go try and be successful in this thing that you feel passionate about, I think has never been better. Tim Ferriss: Why do you think when you initially gave and subsequently had to go online, Runnin’ Down a Dream as a presentation, why do you think that took? Why did it strike a chord in the way that it did? What do you think it was? Bill Gurley: Well, I think we’ve built a society, like nobody’s fault. We just have built a society where we love to celebrate people that are successful in a lot of different fields, but when it comes to our own children, we tend to think way more pragmatically about what they should be doing. Lawyers, consultants, doctors, computer scientists, it’s all these jobs that have certainty to the financial component. And I think that’s so well intended. I don’t think there’s mal intent of anyone in the system. And I’m a parent of three, I’ve been through this. You just feel this obligation to try and push them towards prosperity, but it’s not intellectual prosperity, it’s not happiness, it’s financial. Tim Ferriss: Stability. Bill Gurley: Yes, that most people are guiding children towards. And this isn’t that complicated math, but most people end up working 80,000 hours in their life. It’s a third of your life. Why do something you don’t like? There’s Gallup poll data on career engagement and 59% of people say they’re not engaged at work. And this is that whole quiet quitting thing that we hear so much about. And some of these numbers are at an all-time low. It just seems horrific that people are sauntering through life. Tim Ferriss: So what are some of the keys to taking the path less traveled then in this case? And there are a few I highlighted for myself, but where should we start? I highlighted one for myself. We don’t have to start here, but go where the action is. I just think this is so underrated, and people further undervalue it maybe in a digital world, but we can start anywhere you want. That’s just one that really jumped out to me because I think it’s really underrated. But where would you like to start? Bill Gurley: I think in the book, one of the things that we tie together very early on is the interplay between passion, or fascination, or curiosity and learning. And the way to be most successful in any endeavor, but certainly if you’re going to go tilt it something that’s less pragmatic, is to be the smartest, most knowledgeable person you can possibly be. And knowledge is free now, as we’ve talked about. And I have this test for whether or not you’re actually truly passionate about what you’re trying to do, which is do you self-learn on your own time? Would you not watch Breaking Bad and read about this field and be energized by that activity? If you are, and we have 20, 30 different stories in the book of people that have been successful, almost all of them check that box. You just have this amazing ability to gain knowledge so much faster than everyone else you would be competing with. And that’s going to be useful. That’s unquestionably going to be useful. Tim Ferriss: I mean, it makes me think of an interview I saw a long time ago, actually. It was quite a few years ago, but it was an interview with Joe Rogan and he said something that surprised me, it might surprise a lot of people, which was along the lines of he’s not good at, it was either willpower or discipline, which he’s in great shape. Obviously he’s black belt in jujitsu. He’s done what he’s done with the podcast. He’s the undisputed king of podcasting, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. And he said, “I’m not actually good at whether it was discipline or willpower, but I am good at obsession. It’s all on or all off.” And I’ve seen that, I’m sure you’ve seen this in a lot of the entrepreneurs who actually make it to the other side and create these mega successes, they are just obsessed. Bill Gurley: No doubt. Tim Ferriss: And that gives them a huge, not just knowledge advantage, but endurance advantage. You just go down the checkboxes. It’s all advantages, and — Bill Gurley: I had the opportunity to talk to Angela Duckworth when I was working on this and her book, Grit, talks about two components, passion and perseverance. And I heard a podcast she had done recently where she said if she could go back, she would put far more weight on the passion and the perseverance because she says, “We’ve taught our children to grind.” And so once again, starting in sixth grade, they’re told to learn the flute and take lacrosse and do all this stuff and crush the SATs and take the extra credit classes and all this. And they all do it and they all do it. And then they go to college and, “Oh, how are you doing?” They take six hours of class instead of four and they’re just going. But eventually she says, “If you don’t have that passion, you just burn out.” And so you’re right about the energy part. I think it’s both knowledge and you’ve put in more cycles. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. It makes me think of, maybe this is cliched in Silicon Valley because it gets so oft repeated, but a lot of folks listening will not have heard it, which is if you’re looking for the next technological breakthrough or something on the edge, look for what the nerds are doing on the weekends. But it’s not just a great way to find what might be coming around the corner in a few years. It’s a great way to find the people to bet on who are already using their excess, their free time to work on these things. Bill Gurley: No doubt. Tim Ferriss: I think of [inaudible 01:01:43] and 3D printing. I mean, I can just go down the list. How do you — Bill Gurley: And by the way, that’s another advantage of going to the epicenter is there’s more people doing that all the time. Tim Ferriss: Maybe you could, let’s talk about, people might be surprised by this, but Bob Dylan. I think this is just the quintessential example. Why is he relevant to what we’re talking about? Bill Gurley: When this idea popped in my head, I had finished a third biography and contrasted it with these other two and I just saw all these patterns. VC is a game of pattern recognition I guess my brain has just developed. I was like, “Oh, my God, it’s all this lock thing where these three people had all done the same thing.” And one was a basketball coach, one was a restaurateur and the other was Bob Dylan, not people you would, not industry, “Oh, this is where you should get career development advice.” There’s a part of the Dylan story that most people wouldn’t know unless they had read all the biographies or maybe seen the Scorsese documentary. But the new movie misses the whole thing, which is the pre-New York Bob Dylan was hanging out in Minnesota studying folk music at such a deep level that I feel confident in saying when he left, he knew more about folk music than any other human in Minnesota. And he was borrowing, and maybe that’s even a euphemism. He was stealing his friends albums, he was going into the record store, into these listening booths. He knew all there was to know and had studied every bit of it. And he’s referred to by Scorsese as a music expeditionary. And the people that knew him in New York said he could mimic any one song. It’s not what you would think of when you hear a Dylan song that he had mastered the bedrock underneath and then started innovating. Picasso, by the way, the same thing, perfect realist painter at age 14. If you go to the Barcelona Picasso Museum, it’s in geographic order and you’re shocked at how good a realist this kid was before he went and did this other thing. That bedrock knowledge I think is so differentiating for someone to have all the history and then to start doing the innovation. Tim Ferriss: What was the before and after on Dylan, Minnesota, New York City? And why is that such an important piece of the puzzle? Bill Gurley: By the way, and just to even pile on more on this studious part of Bob Dylan, he did a podcast series for a while where he just walks through all these different genres of music and he’s — Tim Ferriss: You’re talking about Bob Dylan himself? Bill Gurley: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Oh, I didn’t realize this. Bill Gurley: Yes, yes. You can go find it. He stopped, but he’s — and then that book he put out of the 50 best songs, the coffee table book that came out two years ago, it’s incredible the amount of knowledge he has about songs outside of his genre, everything. He’s a clear student of what he’s doing. I think this is well known and is covered at the beginning of the movie. He went to New York to find Woody Guthrie, probably the single most deterministic and ambitious mentor pursuit story that I’ve ever heard of. He hitchhiked there with no money and found him and became friends with him. Tim Ferriss: I mean, this echoes back to go where the action is also, right? Bill Gurley: Oh, no doubt. And by the way, he landed in Manhattan at the center of the folk music scene and all those people he was studying when he was listening in Minnesota, they were all there and he got to know them all. If that doesn’t happen, I don’t think Dylan happens. Tim Ferriss: How relevant do you think the go where the action is now considering the access to information using ChatGPT or other tools, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera? Maybe less so access to mentors, although you can have virtual relationships, but how relevant do you think that is? I’ve got my own opinion, but — Bill Gurley: You could certainly have the type of peer and mentor experiences that are remote. I have a great anecdote about MrBeast in the book that we could talk about that was a remote one, but the benefits of being in and around a whole bunch of people that are chasing the same thing is so high. And I think the intuition is, “Oh, well, it’s going to be even more competitive, so why would I go? Wouldn’t it be better to try and do this in a town where it’s less of a big deal?” But the problem is your learning is impacted, your access to peers and mentors is drastically reduced, and then probably most importantly, your optionality gets cut so dramatically. People think that a lot of success stories, they attribute it to luck, but there’s that famous saying, luck is when preparation meets opportunity. And when you’re in the epicenter, both your preparation and your opportunity go up 10 X. And so your ability to just have that lucky moment where you get brought into something is so much higher. Tim Ferriss: The lucky moment is, I think, really important to underscore in terms of going where the action is because there’s a lot you can do virtually, but let’s just say you’re using ChatGPT, you’re going to get what you prompt. In other words, you’re asking for something and that can take you down a rabbit hole, but there, at least in my lived experience, and certainly I still see this happening, when I moved to Silicon Valley in 2000, and then I look back at my angel investing career, I look back at all these collaborations, the vast majority of them did not come from me going out with an agenda and seeking something. They came from serendipitous bumping into somebody at a coffee shop. I literally met Naval Ravikant because I was hitting on his girlfriend at the time when she was getting her coffee, didn’t realize they were together. And then you look at Garrett Camp, Kevin Rose. These are, at a barbecue I met Kevin Rose. And you go down the list and you look at all of these formative, massively impactful, personally and professionally relationships. They almost all came from serendipity and you just don’t seem to get that density unless you’re in the center of the action. And perhaps it’s easier to relocate yourself, I’m sure it is, when you have fewer responsibilities, but God, I can’t even imagine what my life would have looked like had I not left Long Island and then ultimately moved to Silicon Valley. Bill Gurley: Yeah, and same for me. I had thought about the notion of venture capital and practicing it and probably would have jumped at any job I could have got. Like when I was at McCombs here in Austin, I tried to get an interview at Austin Ventures. I didn’t get one, but had they said yes, maybe I practiced there. And I’m glad that didn’t happen. Going and practicing it where I did was the exact right place to do it. I do think if you can, if you can, because there are financial constraints, and if you want to be great at a field and that field has an epicenter, I think you should go. Tim Ferriss: And there are different types of epicenters too. You think about, let’s just say AI, not to repeatedly bang that drum, but you could just say, okay, AI, first thing that comes to mind, Silicon Valley, but this is going to be a bit of a digression, but I remember asking Derek Sivers, a friend of mine, amazing entrepreneur, philosopher programmer, people can look him up, but I asked him, “Who’s the first person who comes to mind when you think of the word successful?” And he said, “Well, actually the most interesting or more interesting question might be who’s the third person who comes to mind?” Because I might say something really obvious like Richard Branson, but is he successful? I don’t really know what his goals were. I’d have to compare his goals to his outcomes. And then you get to the third. Similarly, with an epicenter, you could say Silicon Valley first, but there might be something that is dense in learning, but has other advantages like, I think it’s the University of Waterloo, but one of these universities where industry is trying to raid the academic program because it’s so strong in terms of teaching the technical side. There’s so many different ways to approach it, but let’s talk about a virtual example. You mentioned MrBeast. Could you describe that story? Bill Gurley: Yeah. I actually heard it on a podcast, but I also got a chance to talk to Jimmy Donaldson, so we got it firsthand. When he was infatuated with YouTube, he was one of the first people that was infatuated with YouTube, his parents were rightfully trying to get him to go to school and college, which he wasn’t doing because he was playing around on YouTube all day. He met three other people who were equally fascinated with YouTube. And this is a virtual epicenter story, but it’s really a peer story. One of my six principles is embrace your peers. And I think far too many people have sharp elbows to peers because they think they’re climbing the ladder and they’ve got to beat these people. And the world’s just way too prosperous to have that mindset. You can learn so much and get so much value from co-climbing that you should definitely do that. And I think it’s not taught enough and people don’t do it enough, but Jimmy happened on these three people and they got on a Skype call, he said 20 hours a day and for years — Tim Ferriss: Sounds like Jimmy. Bill Gurley: For years, they shared best practices on this call, which apparently in that world, the color of the icon on the post you do on Instagram to send them to YouTube, like all these little bitty esoteric things can impact conversion. And he said when he was talking about this, that they all became millionaires. And he said, “If you or any random individual had been a fifth person on those calls, you would have too, because of that.” And it’s just a wonderful example of how peers — he on this podcast said something that was very clever. He took the 10,000 hours thing from Gladwell and said, “Well, there were four of us spending 10,000 hours and then sharing ideas so you get 40,000 hours of expertise.” Tim Ferriss: How would you suggest people who are not on YouTube where you can identify outliers perhaps, I shouldn’t say easily. In this day and age, I mean, it’s a sea of participants, but how should people go about seeking peers? And do you rank order your principles in a way, for instance, do you want to first check the box if you can of go where the action is and then embrace your peers because the level will be higher? I think about, for instance, my experience in Silicon Valley, it could have just as easily for something else been Nashville or New York City or who knows, Shanghai. I mean, it just depends on what you’re doing. The mentors, let’s just say like Mike Maples Jr., who taught me the very basic ropes of angel investing, he definitely, without him, I don’t go zero to one in terms of having any basic literacy or access. That was the first rung on the ladder. But then once I was in, you look at people who were, in a sense, just getting started at the time. I mean, holy shit, some of them have really exploded. I mean, they’ve all done really well. Kevin Rose, Naval, Chris Sacca. The remaining — I mean, the latter goes on forever, but 49 rungs after that initial step up, zero to one, it was all peer driven. And those guys, we were comparing notes the whole way. Bill Gurley: See, that’s the thing. I would say, first of all, I would practice it wherever you are. I would practice it virtually. I’d practice it locally. And if you can move to the epicenter, I’d practice it there. I don’t know that it’s an either or thing. You can have multiple groups of peers. You can have multiple circles of peers. But I think there’s only two tests, and one is trust. There are people in this world who view everything as a zero-sum game and they will elbow you out the first chance they can get. And so those shouldn’t be your peers. Those people you should quickly push to the side. Trust and then this shared interest in learning. And if they are equally learning on their own dime in their free time, which is my test for whether you actually truly are passionate about something, if they are doing that also, that’s perfect. And those experiences you’ve talked about, I’ve had so many of them myself, they get excited to tell you what they just learned, right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Yeah. Bill Gurley: Yeah. And then you reciprocate. And by the way, Mike’s a great example. I really have both a passion and a lot of respect for people that are writers in their industry, and Buffett did it and Howard Marks did it, who I benefited greatly from. I tried my entire career to write quite a bit, but Mike does this. Mike’s very — he’s a huge sharer when it comes to his knowledge about the subject matter and it’s so great — Tim Ferriss: He is. Yeah. Pattern Breakers is an excellent book also. Bill Gurley: So great. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Yeah, Mike, I’m hoping to see him again soon. It’s been a minute. We’ve talked about MrBeast, Bob Dylan. In both cases, like poor kids with nothing to lose, in a sense. Not in any destitute sense, but they’re starting at — Bill Gurley: It’s funny — Tim Ferriss: — futons and ramen, right? Bill Gurley: He was just interviewed at DealBook also, and his mother was in the front row who apparently works for him now. He was telling the story about when he went to tell her he was dropping out of college, similar to the McConaughey story, not quite as abrupt, or Jimmy’s being more abrupt, but of course she’s happy now. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it all worked out. I mean, there’s always a little survivorship bias, but — Bill Gurley: No doubt, no doubt. Tim Ferriss: But let’s talk about Danny Meyer because I want to give an example of someone who gave something up to then pursue X instead of A, B, or C. Could you say a little bit about Danny? I’ve interviewed him on the podcast. I might have met him through you. I don’t even remember how I initially connected with him, but who is Danny Meyer and what is this Genesis story of Danny Meyer, the restaurateur? Bill Gurley: It’s funny, when someone asks me who is Danny Meyer, I feel compelled the first thing to say he’s one of the most genuine humans on the planet. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, for sure. Bill Gurley: Just a wonderful human. Tim Ferriss: For sure. Bill Gurley: But he is also one of the most celebrated restaurateurs of our time. He was working for a company that sold these devices to clip onto clothes so you can’t steal them from a retail store, and he was making good money. He was making about $200,000 a year, and this is — Tim Ferriss: At the time. Bill Gurley: — 40 years ago. Tim Ferriss: Real money. Bill Gurley: Real, real money. And he had convinced himself he was going to be a lawyer. I guess a lot of people convinced themselves of that. And he was about to take the LSAT and he was out to dinner with his uncle and his uncle was probing him and probing him and, “Oh, yeah, he’s going to take the LSAT.” And I think his uncle sensed a lack of real conviction about this thing, this person, this human was going to do. And he literally said to him, “Why are you doing this? You know you want to be a restaurateur.” And when you read Danny’s book, he did spend a ton of time in his youth being fascinated with restaurants and to the point where he would take copious notes prior to even doing this. His family had a reason to know that he had this deep passion, but it’s interesting it’s an uncle. I don’t know that a parent is going to jump in and say that, and maybe that’s an advantage I have not knowing the readers of my book and giving him this permission to do things that aren’t necessarily pragmatic. But anyway, his uncle said, “You should start a restaurant.” And he took the test. He never submitted the scores to a university and very soon thereafter enrolled in some vocational restaurant courses and took a job. He took the first job you could get, which was a front office job at a restaurant that was making about a 10th the salary that he was making in the sales job. Tim Ferriss: And went on to Gramercy Tav — I mean, all these iconic restaurants, then Shake Shack, then I mean, just dot, dot, dot, dot, dot. Bill Gurley: Yeah, and we walked through in detail his path once he made this intention, and one of the variables that my co-writer and I were looking for as we added stories to the book was this moment of intentionality. We didn’t want people that fell into a job and were successful. We wanted people that had made a decision, usually a pivot to say, “I’m going to go do this now.” And once he had made that decision, not only did he take that job, but he took advantage of being in that restaurant to learn about the multiple functions, but then he set up a tour through Europe as a stage in multiple places where he’s working for free, basically. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I’m so glad you brought this up because I wouldn’t have brought it up myself, but I’ve run — this is going to relate in a second. I’ve run a bunch of competitions for, let’s just say, creating artwork for PDFs/free books I’m going to put out or whatever, and there’s always a big hubbub where folks get, some folks get very upset and they say, “Oh, you want people to work for free?” And I’m like, “Well, there’s going to be a winner.” It’s like, if you don’t want to participate, don’t participate. But there’s always this shaking of the fist like, “Ah, it’s so unfair. You want people to work, do work for free.” When I look at almost every example of someone who became the equivalent of Danny Meyer in their world, they did a lot that was unpaid, almost always. I’m sure there are exceptions, but staging is a great example in the restaurant world where it’s like, okay, you want to work at a restaurant where you’re going to have the highest density of learning and you don’t know shit? Guess what? They probably don’t want to pay you a whole lot because it’s actually going to be a bit of a drain on their resources to show you around and teach you how to work your station and do all this stuff. I would just encourage people to not be allergic to that. And the way I got, in a sense, my foot in the door in Silicon Valley was I volunteered at TiE, The Indus Entrepreneur. Bill Gurley: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. [inaudible 01:22:33]. Tim Ferriss: I volunteered with all of these nonprofit groups and quickly realized that most volunteers are doing the absolute minimum to be volunteers. And if you just do 10% more, it doesn’t take much. I would just refill people’s water glasses and stuff after I finished taking their tickets for an event. And suddenly the producers of this event who were also doing it, but had real jobs. I mean, I had a job at a college [inaudible 01:23:00] and I was working a lot. They were like, “Wow, this kid’s a go getter because he’s refilling these water glasses. Let’s give him more responsibility.” And that’s how I ended up connecting with all these speakers and everything, just did some stuff for free on the weekends. It didn’t take a lot. Bill Gurley: There’s a story in the book that’s actually hard to believe. We profiled this woman, Jen Atkins, who’s a hairstylist. It’s an incredible story, but the one anecdote, she’s rising in her career and things are starting to work and she has jobs and she’s getting paid. She would go to Fashion Week in Paris and sneak in the back door and volunteer to do the hair of the models on stage. Snuck in. Not supposed to be there, just to get reps with these top models in this environment. Tim Ferriss: Incredible. Bill Gurley: It sounds unfathomable that someone would do that. She did it multiple times. Tim Ferriss: And she did it. Bill Gurley: Yes. Tim Ferriss: What ended up happening after that? I don’t know her story. Bill Gurley: Oh, she’s become probably the most successful hairstylist of our time. It’s an incredible story. Tim Ferriss: How do you suggest people who are, maybe they’re doing A, B, and C right now, they’re listening to this and they just say, “All right, I want to take the leap. I want to do Z. I want to do whatever the off menu option is.” Bill Gurley: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: They might have to have a conversation with a parent. They might have to have a conversation with a spouse. They may have to have a conversation with who knows, whoever the most important people are in their lives. How might they approach that? And we’re going to talk about choosing paths in a second, because I do have a question about maybe how to sanity check yourself in the world of AI, but how do you suggest having those conversations? Do you moonlight for a while so it’s not either or? Do you time box it or make it time bound in a sense where you’re like, “Hey, just give me permission to try this for six months, a year, two years.” Bill Gurley: It’s interesting that I think any of those approaches is realistic. We profile Sal Khan in the book of Khan Academy and he told his wife he wanted to go try it for a year. He had also, he worked at a hedge fund just like Danny Meyer. He was making real money. Tim Ferriss: Wow. I didn’t realize that about Sal Khan. Wild. Bill Gurley: And started working with his cousins across the globe online doing these tutorial exercises and ended up posting a few on YouTube. They started working and he told his wife, “I really want to go tilt at this.” He didn’t even know what the business model was and he went and changed it. Look, I think the real test comes back to this passion element, or we use a lot of different words because passion’s been considered trite, but fascination, curiosity. If you have this deep desire to know so much about this one thing that that curiosity is so high, I think the odds that that’s not apparent to whoever these people are you’re trying to convince is pretty low. And if you can show that you’re — because if you’re going to tilt at something that hard and if you’re going to really differentiate yourself by being that learned in that field, I think it’d be hard for someone to tell you not to go do it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: It’s not going to be easy. I don’t want anyone to think that, “Oh, just read this book and magic happens.” It requires effort. And that’s why this test matters so much, this test of whether you would learn about this thing on your free time. Tim Ferriss: And maybe are you already learning about this? Bill Gurley: Are you already learning about it on your free time? Tim Ferriss: Right. Bill Gurley: Yes. No doubt. Tim Ferriss: At least have one — Bill Gurley: You should be. You should be. I doubt you’re going to turn it on. Tim Ferriss: — data point based on history. Bill Gurley: Yeah. Well, actually, I have an example of someone who just turned it on. We have a chapter called Never Too Late, which is where the [inaudible 01:27:32] thing is because that happened when he was close to 40. Another local Austinite, Bert Tito Beveridge started his endeavor in the spirit business. Tim Ferriss: So wild, I was just thinking about him while I was driving here for no good reason. Bill Gurley: At the age of 40. Tim Ferriss: All right. Bill Gurley: He’s watching a PBS special. This is also hard to believe. He’s watching a PBS special. And back probably when there were only four channels or whatever, but they said on the screen, they said, “Take a blank sheet of paper, draw a line down it, put what you love to do on the left and what you’re really good at on the right. Just a list of those things and then contemplate what might be in the middle.” And he had studied chemistry and a lot of stuff and he liked going out to bars and socializing. And he was making flavored vodka as Christmas presents in his spare time. Tim Ferriss: What was his day job? Bill Gurley: His first career was in seismetology and the oil field and that dragged him to South America. And then when that became dangerous, both in Midland and in South America, he became a mortgage broker. Tim Ferriss: Okay. Bill Gurley: But he didn’t love either. He didn’t love either of them. But the reason I brought it up when you said, “already.” I don’t know that he was already studying the spirit business, but once he made that intentionality to go do this, then he studied it writ large. Tim Ferriss: How did he start, just out of curiosity? Because I was just thinking about him. He just acquired — well, Tito Beveridge just acquired Lala Tequila, which I was involved with. Bill Gurley: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: That’s probably why he popped to mind. But how did he start? Bill Gurley: He first started by just studying the distilling process writ large, like read everything he possibly could. And then it turns out there were no distilleries in the state of Texas and there were laws on the books that made it nearly impossible. So then he had to study that and literally rewrite regulation to make it possible. Interestingly, he did the whole thing on credit cards, so he owns 100% of the business, which is a huge business. It’s the single largest spirit sold in America today. Tim Ferriss: I didn’t realize that. Bill Gurley: Yes. Tim Ferriss: I didn’t realize it was that big. Bill Gurley: It’s huge. Tim Ferriss: Wow. Good for him. Bill Gurley: Yes. Tim Ferriss: That’s so wild. So wild. So I promised to get to this and I do want to get to it. Are there any sanity checks that you would put in place to compliment the fascination/obsession/what I’m doing in my spare time or would pay to do or do for free? Because I’m wondering if there are any things you would take off the table or how you would hone that given the rapidly developing technology of AI. So if someone said, “What I love to do in my spare time is copy editing.” I might not suggest that they throw caution to the wind and burn the ships and go into copy editing. Any thoughts? Because this is something that is — Bill Gurley: Well, the first thing I would note is that many of those pragmatic jobs that the well-intentioned parents have been pushing their children towards are at risk. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, for sure. Bill Gurley: So comp-sci. Tim Ferriss: Right. Yeah, risky, but as compared to what? Bill Gurley: Comp-sci went from being the most least risky major you could possibly get to one that’s somewhat risky overnight. And so that’d be my first notion. And the second thing I would add to that, which I already said is, no matter what your endeavor is, you need to be playing with this tool. It’s a modern tool. It’s the equivalent of a laptop and Microsoft Word was, it’s equivalent of what a calculator was. You don’t want to go out in the world and play without the modern tool set. It’s a part of what you need. If you’re playing with those things and you’re curious, you know where the edge is of whatever you’re passionate about and what the technology’s capable of. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So in order to find that edge and follow that edge, which will move, you have to be playing with the tools. Bill Gurley: And look, I think in any field, one thing I love to suggest on the learning side is, know the history and know the new innovative edge. If you bring both of those things to the table, you are highly compelling. That could be true even if you’re not chasing your dream job. Even if you’re just a marketing major, if you walk into an interview at Clorox and you can simultaneously show that you’ve studied all the historical best marketers and you also understand how TikTok works, that’s heavily differentiating in that interview. Like you’re going to get the job, I would argue, versus someone else, if you can portray those things. Tim Ferriss: How would you apply that here? Is that just, I guess, field dependent or are you referring to AI? Bill Gurley: No. Yeah. Well, I think AI is the leading edge of almost any industry. So yeah, I’m saying you should just study what it’s capable of. Look, the thing that LLMs are most capable of, it’s a large language model. The language type stuff, like your copy editing example, things that were just rote moving words around, yeah, it’s really good at that stuff. But it doesn’t mean that you can’t be the person that really understands what it’s capable of and then superpower yourself to go attack a particular interest. The other thing, you had started a question by saying warnings. I think there are a lot of fields where talent really does matter. I don’t know that I can make you a singer or I certainly can’t make you an NBA basketball player, but in all those fields, whether it be Hollywood or sports or even Danny Meyer at one time thought he was going to be a chef and he just became a restaurateur. He wasn’t a chef. I would say that for any artistic field, there are way more jobs that support those artists than there are the jobs of the artist. Tim Ferriss: What do you mean by that? Bill Gurley: I mean, we have an example in the book of a Hollywood agent and that individual had not thought about a job in Hollywood when they were growing up because they felt they couldn’t act. So they’re like, “Oh, I can’t go do that.” But there’s tons of jobs — Tim Ferriss: I see what you’re saying. Bill Gurley: — in Hollywood that aren’t — Tim Ferriss: Within the sector of entertainment. Bill Gurley: — that aren’t the talent itself. So if you’re passionate about basketball or you’re passionate about the chef example of a restaurant, like there’s tons of jobs you can go do, music industry, without being that particular person. Tim Ferriss: This makes me think of an interview I was watching recently, Patrick O’Shaughnessy, Invest With The Best. He was interviewing Ari Emanuel, so famous super agent, force of nature. His whole family is just like, they’re drinking different water. I don’t know what’s going on there. But he has raised a ton of money to invest in live events, sports and so on as an anti-AI or maybe AI anti-fragile bet, right? And there are lots of ways to make money when you raise a lot of money. So putting that aside, any other AI resilient or anti-AI bets that you think are interesting outside of live events, live sports? Bill Gurley: I think a lot of the service industries, I think humans enjoy experiences and I don’t think that changes personally that much. And so restaurateurs or hoteliers, I think all those things are going to thrive and people that know how to really differentiate experiences in that way, I think are — I personally doubt that — I don’t share this thought that we’re all going to go watch movies that we’ve imagined that are made just for ourselves. I find that hard to believe. I think people enjoy great art in many different forms. They enjoy talking about it and they enjoy the community element of having seen the same thing. And so it may be that if you’re a movie maker, you’re using AI instead of this expensive CGI tool set, but I think the storytelling and the imagination and the writing, I think all those things will still be real. I really do. And obviously just general business, entrepreneurship. I took my dad, who’s 93, fly-fishing in Montana this summer and we were at a lodge and one of the other guests that was staying there is a 28-year-old entrepreneur from the tip of Texas down near Corpus Christi area. And he had started three or four businesses and was well off, like I’m not saying — but he was so enamored with AI. He said, “And then I needed this, and then it did this, and then I needed this, and then I did this. And then I wanted to know where to put the next one of these. And I just ask it, where would you put it in the city? And it immediately gave me answers.” This guy was already successful, but he was running triple speed because he had tipped into this stuff and he was learning what was possible because he had an open mind towards it solving problems. And I thought, “Holy shit, if other people just leaned at it the way he’s leaning at it, they would become super powered themselves.” I was really blown away by that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. This makes me think of Kevin Rose. Kevin Rose is spending the vast majority of his free time playing with all these tools, vibe coding, using them endlessly. And I feel like that is probably over the next few weeks where I need to put some more time and just take a layup with wherever it happens to intersect with someplace that makes it easy to apply. Who’s Sam Hinkie? Bill Gurley: Sam Hinkie is a gentleman that about, I don’t know, six years ago became maybe the youngest GM in the history of the NBA. He became the general manager of the Philadelphia 76ers. Tim Ferriss: Why is his story relevant? Bill Gurley: He was a amazing student. He grew up in Oklahoma. His father worked for Halliburton. He made good grades, good students, kind of classic, did everything right, became a consultant. I think he was working for McKinsey, and they moved him to Australia. And he’s sitting there and he’s reading other things in his spare time. He’s not reading about how to be a better consultant. And he reads a book called Moneyball, which we all know of, the Michael Lewis book about the Oakland A’s. And in almost what seems like an instant decided, “I really need to be in sports analytics.” And I mentioned that a lot of the stories we found have this intentionality. So that book, just like The Last Laugh did for Seinfeld, that book told him, “I’m going to go do this.” And from the day he read that book to getting the job as the head of GM of the 76ers was about 10 years. So no experience whatsoever in the field to youngest GM of all time in 10 years. Tim Ferriss: Was he obsessed with sports already at that point? Bill Gurley: I think so. He played — this gets back to what I said about maybe your original obsession came from participating or being the talent, but then he’s not particularly big. And so yeah, he was successful in high school, but there was no path to keep going down that field. So yeah, he had immense passion for the category, but had never imagined himself in the field in one of these other roles until that book disinhibited him and gave him permission to think, “Well, you know what? I could be differentiated on this dimension, on this dimension of understanding analytics.” He immediately was applying to business school, and he used that as a pivot point. For those that have the needs and the resources, I think in MBA programs can be a great place to switch careers and go chase a different dream. And there’s a great interesting anecdote in the book where he’s trying to decide between Harvard and Stanford, which is a choice for most humans [inaudible 01:41:42]. Tim Ferriss: Quality problem. Bill Gurley: Yeah, exactly. But he went and told them both what he wanted to do and Harvard basically said, “Well, we don’t really have any programs like that.” And Stanford, to give Stanford a lot of credit, said, “You know what? That’s super interesting. We have this person associated with the school that does this. We’ll introduce you to these four people.” And were a lot like McConaughey’s dad when Sam brought them that challenge. Tim Ferriss: Sounds about right. That checks out for me. Bill Gurley: Yeah. Based on what you know of the two institutions. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: Yeah. And then he just started, he ended up meeting Michael Lewis because he was in the Bay Area and some of the Stanford people knew Michael. And so he talked to the guy that wrote the book that inspired him. He hustled his ass off. I don’t want to make it sound like — he kind of built his own curriculum, but it worked. Tim Ferriss: For people who are not going to get an MBA, would you still suggest everyone read the first three chapters of Michael Porter’s Competitive Strategy Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors? Bill Gurley: Unquestionably. Tim Ferriss: All right. Just wanted to — Bill Gurley: Anyone that’s going to do anything in business should read that book. Tim Ferriss: All right. I wanted to give the throwback to our first conversation. Bill Gurley: By the way, at the back of the book, it lists about 50 books. At the very end. Tim Ferriss: Just to whet the appetite? Bill Gurley: Well, I think you did the same thing. I’ve gone through your — Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah. Oh, no. Bill Gurley: In fact, I looked at yours for the structure when I wanted to see how to lay it out. Tim Ferriss: Oh, amazing. Amazing. I want to get your expansion on avoiding false failures. Let me explain what I mean by that. So there’s this expression, if you do what you love, you’ll never work a day in your life. Bill Gurley: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Right? Bill Gurley: It’s in my note. Tim Ferriss: But my experience has been, it’s not always fun, even if you’re doing what you love. Sometimes there’s burnout. Sometimes you go through chapters where things do feel like a grind. I mean, maybe I’m an outlier, but that’s been my experience. When I realized, for instance, in the case of the podcast, it’s like, “Wow, I have much more sponsor demand than I could ever fill. If I just doubled the number of episodes, I’d double the number of revenue. So why don’t I do that?” And it started to feel like a bad job. Not a bad job. Bill Gurley: I get it. Tim Ferriss: It’s still a great job, but the volume was too high. And I can imagine if people take the expression I just mentioned, if you love what you do, you’ll never work a day in your life. They pursue X, whatever that is, the songwriting and the performing in the case of Bob Dylan, Danny Meyer, whatever it might be. And then they hit a really hard stretch. Maybe it’s early on, maybe it’s later, maybe they’re [inaudible 01:44:46] and some French guy yelling at them. Bill Gurley: Yeah certainly. Tim Ferriss: It’s the case with a friend of mine. And they’re like, “Wow, God, this really feels painful. Maybe this isn’t my path.” How do you distinguish between growing pains that are temporary and an indication that you’re not doing the right thing? Bill Gurley: Yeah. It’s funny. I’ll take a short diversion in answering the question. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Long diversions. Bill Gurley: Because people often ask me, “How do you use AI?” When I was wrapping up the book, my publisher and editor said, “I want you to write the concluding chapter.” And I wrote what I think most people would do, which is I just summarized the whole book and I submitted it to him and he said, “No, this is no good.” And so then I went to ChatGPT deep research mode and I said, “Tell me about the 10 best nonfiction concluding chapters that you know of.” And it went and did like a 20-page report and sent it to me. And what I noticed in reading that was that most of these great concluding chapters were orthogonal. They weren’t a summary. They were a different take on the whole thing. Well, my concluding chapter is now titled It Ain’t Easy, to your point. And I went through all of the stories that we have in the book and I pulled out the darkest hour moments for each one of those people and included it at the end, because I didn’t want to leave people with the impression that it’s just all smiles and babies and hugs. I don’t think that’s true in any field. And I guess my answer would be, do you still feel this natural curiosity to learn the entire time? Is the impediment something that truly means you should stop like, “I can’t get around it. I can’t…” Or is it something that maybe can be avoided, something I can get around? I push heavily on the peer thing because one of the things a peer group can do is help you in those moments, both just from emotional support, but also to put perspective on whatever this speed bump is and whether it’s insurmountable or not. Mentors can help with that too, but I think peers are better for that because you worry about being judged in disclosing this. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, 100%. Bill Gurley: And so peers don’t judge. That’s why that trust thing really matters also, another reason why it matters. And they can help you. I think they can help you determine whether that is as big a blocker as it may seem like. But there’s going to be some of that in any field. I don’t think there’s any run that’s just without paying. Tim Ferriss: I’m also imagining that one of the challenges that I had and some of my friends had at different points in pursuing, fill in the blank, starting our first companies, just beginning to invest, having a career in X, right? When I got out of college, it was mass data storage and hitting these really rough patches and feeling like you’re the first person in the world to experience this and it’s because of your unique flaws or uniquely bad decisions. And I’m just realizing now, I haven’t tried this, I’m sure it would work, that you could just describe the dark chapter you’re going through into ChatGPT or one of these tools and say, “Can you give me any comparable examples from other people who have succeeded in other fields?” Bill Gurley: I’m sure that’ll work. It’ll also give you five answers on how to deal with it, how to get around it. Tim Ferriss: How to deal with it. Bill Gurley: But by the way, one thing that’s important when we’re talking about this is, Daniel Pink has this great book on regret, and he talks about it as a valid motivator to get you to make good decisions. And there is a reality that that anxiety you may feel may mean you’re not in the right lane. And so when you were at that sales job, you got to the point where you’re like, “Holy shit, I don’t want to be doing this anymore.” And I had two careers before I became a VC, one as an engineer and one as a sell-side analyst. I enjoyed both. I think I was good at both, but I reached a point about three years in with each where I was like, “I don’t want to do this the rest of my life.” And so I would say, equally with like, don’t give up too early, but if the signal is really telling you, I don’t want to do this the rest of my life, jump out. That’s the precise moment to move on and try something new. And I spend a ton of time in the early chapters trying to get people to understand that’s okay. Most people don’t end up in a career that their major was. I think one of the reasons people grind too long is because they think they’re supposed to. They just think they’re supposed to stay in this lane they’re in. Tim Ferriss: How did you conclude it was time to hop in those cases? We don’t have to go into tons of the background because we talked about so much of your history and decisions and so on, including, I don’t want to say stealing palm pilots, but it’s a pretty good story about getting a palm pilot with contact information. But was it just a gut feeling? Was it a disquiet that you felt in your system or was it more than that? Bill Gurley: I’m sure I’ve overplayed it in my brain, but they feel like very concrete moments where I had almost near certainty. The first one was, I started my third project at Compact Computer Corporation where I was an engineer and the projects were these computers we were releasing and the third one was another computer with a little faster clock speed and a better Intel chip, but the rest of it was all the same and we were going to do it again. I’m like, “That doesn’t seem that interesting to me.” And I’d become curious about other things. So when I was doing external learning, which is what I refer to as this kind of spare time learning, it wasn’t that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Right. Bill Gurley: It was something else. I was reading Peter Lynch’s book on stocks and stuff like that. Tim Ferriss: Right. Segue to the sell-side analyst. Bill Gurley: Yes. The thing that happened as a sell-side analyst, and and I may parlay this into something from the Daniel Pink book, but this notion of, do you want to do this the rest of your life? The sell-side job is wonderful. You get access so early in your life to so many amazing people, but you have to work really hard. And this classic thing where you’re in your 20s and you’re working on Wall Street, they serve dinner at the office. The cafeteria is open, that’ll tell you something. And it was like 10:30 or 11:00 PM and the entire research department was on the 36th floor of Park Avenue Plaza and I did a loop. The four corner offices were the most senior analysts. And for whatever reason, I popped my head in each of their office and they were career sell-side analysts. I said, “Do I want to be this person when I’m 60?” It just stuck in my head. I went to the next one, went to the next one. Hopefully — I don’t know who those people were, but I was like, “No, I don’t.” Like that night, I made the decision that I got to go do something else. Tim Ferriss: No, it’s one of — Bill Gurley: If you don’t mind. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, fire away. Bill Gurley: In Daniel Pink’s book, he talks a lot about boldness regrets. And this is where I say, “Do you want to do this for the rest of your life?” He says, “One of the most robust findings in the academic research and my own is that over time we are much more likely to regret the chances we didn’t take than the chances we did.” What haunts us is the inaction itself. Foregone opportunities all linger in the same way.” And he says that they’ve studied this across China, Russia, Japan, it’s common across all of them. And you may have heard of this YouTube video where Bezos talks about his regret minimization framework. And so he had the same thing. He’s walking around Central Park, “Should I stay in this incredible job at D.E. Shaw,” where he’s making tons of money, “or should I take this flyer on this online bookstore I want to do?” And he put it in his mind that test, which is when I’m 80 and looking back, am I going to regret not doing this? Tim Ferriss: Well, it makes me think of, and this is also a dicey proposition quoting Niccolo Machiavelli, but, “Make mistakes of ambition, not mistakes of sloth.” Bill Gurley: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Right? Bill Gurley: It’s the same thing. Tim Ferriss: And I do think about that a lot myself. I mean, I’m at a point where I’m trying to figure out what my next chapter is too, because this podcasting game’s getting pretty crowded. Bill Gurley: It is. Tim Ferriss: And I still enjoy doing it, but that’s only because I refuse to play by the incentives that the platforms and algorithms provide, which is economically punishing, but intellectually rewarding. Bill Gurley: Because you’ve had two successful careers as, not just a podcaster and influencer, but as an angel investor, I would encourage you to read Arthur Brooks’ book, Strength to Strength. Tim Ferriss: I did. I did. It was great. Bill Gurley: Okay. You already read it? Tim Ferriss: It was great. It was great. Bill Gurley: I think it gives great perspective for a later career shift. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I should go back and look at my notes from that book again. So let’s chat for a second. People should all check this out. I mean, you’re such an operator. Track record’s incredible. Runnin’ Down a Dream: How to Succeed and Thrive in a Career You Love, we’ll talk about that again. We’ll mention it again at the end. What do you want to do after this book? I mean, you can’t sit on your hands very long. Bill Gurley: No. And as I mentioned, when I made the decision to stop the venture career, which I think we talked about on the last podcast — Tim Ferriss: A little bit, yeah. Bill Gurley: — where I read the Steve Martin book. But I didn’t know. I knew I wanted to do something else. And I went on a listening tour and I talked to all these people that had — Tim Ferriss: Can you just reiterate what a listening tour is? Bill Gurley: Oh, I identified several people who had successfully—retired is a strong word—but made a decision to stop doing a job they were very successful at. And then what do you do now? It’s similar to the Arthur Brooks book, but it was just a personal life. A lot of people angel invest, a lot of people go on boards, a lot of people manage their own money. I had this list that people teach and I slowly was checking them off. Tim Ferriss: Just crossing out, yeah. Bill Gurley: Scratch them out, yeah. I don’t really want to manage my own money. I don’t really want to angel invest. I don’t want to start my own venture firm. I’ve done that. I found myself crossing them all off and I couldn’t discover something that got me excited and tied into this what are you doing with your external learning thing. Slowly, I’ve come around to an idea that I made up. It’s not a career that other people have, but I think I’d like to start a policy institute. I’ve come up with a name P3, which stands for Purpose, Progress, and Prosperity. When I was doing the BG2 podcast, which I recently stepped away from, we did a episode at the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Facility. Before I did that episode, I spent three or four weeks calling everyone I knew to make sure that I was prepared for that. That was one of our more successful episodes and I just really enjoyed that. I look at the shifting mindset around the globe on nuclear energy in the past five years as an example of what’s possible with really great policy work. It wasn’t one person. I think the fact that Steve Pinker was banging the drum was super important, but Andreessen and Elon and all these people started pounding that same drum. Joe Gebbia’s wife made this a big life passion project of hers. But it’s shocking how quick we went from, “This stuff’s bad,” to, “Oh, no, we made a mistake. It’s actually good.” That could have a powerful impact on the planet. I don’t know how many of those type things there are to find. I don’t want to go grind on state by state legislation. I don’t have any interest in that. But looking at big problems, looking at US-China relations, US healthcare system has some massive problems. Can you come up with ideas that help shift these things? I’ve already got to know some really innovative professors who are thinking in very innovative ways and I look to use my financial capabilities to do grant writing through people like that and see what we can go do, see what we can go change. Regulatory capture is another one that I’ve spent time tilting at. Tim Ferriss: If you’re not doing this state by state legislative change, what does the work of P3 potentially look like? What is policy work? I know that seems like a silly question but — Bill Gurley: We’re at day one, but I’ll give you — Tim Ferriss: What might it look like? Bill Gurley: Yeah, here’s an example. A professor approached me on the regulatory capture front. “What if we put — Tim Ferriss: Could you define that just for people who didn’t hear episode one? Bill Gurley: Yeah. There’s a Nobel Prize winner from the University of Chicago named George Stigler. He’s passed away but who made the very strong argument that regulation is the friend of the incumbent, that large businesses learn how to lobby Washington. No matter how well intention the policy is that’s passed, it ends up benefiting the incumbent more than restricting the incumbent. He won a Nobel Prize for that work. I gave a speech at the All-In Summit that you can go watch on YouTube. It has five million views on this topic, but I think this happens in the majority of the time rather than — anyway, this — Tim Ferriss: That’s why ACH takes three days to clear, right? Bill Gurley: Yes, yes, yes, yes, but stablecoin may solve that. But this professor approached me about making maybe a global database that scores countries on how captured they are and that identifies the best practices from the countries that have the best scores. That kind of thing, like investing in that type of data and transparency, is pretty compelling to me. That’s an example of what I might go do. Tim Ferriss: Well, let me chew on that for a second. Let’s say you create this data set that presents these scores on a country by country basis. What are the hoped for outcomes of that? That countries that have worse scores start to model the countries with better scores? Certainly, there might be talent flight from one place to another. I mean, we already see that in some respects. I mean, that’s not purely regulatory capture determined, but when you share that data, what would the hope be? Bill Gurley: The hope would be that you can shine a light on the best practices and try to get those implemented — Tim Ferriss: In other places. Bill Gurley: — here in the US. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: That would be the hope. Also, I think just shining a light on them is — I’ll give you an example that relates to regulatory capture. After you’ve been a senator or congressman for a while, you get invited onto committees. The minute you’re on a committee, you are in charge of regulation that affects different industries. I don’t even know if most humans know this. What happens is your local senator or your local congressman who you think is representing your district now starts raising money nationally. They go around and meet with businesses because they’re on that committee and have influence and they’re raising money nationally. I think that’s ridiculous personally. You could imagine restrictions against that, transparency towards it. If your congressman represents this zip code in Austin, wouldn’t you want to know if they’re raising money in Minnesota? Isn’t that a little unusual? Tim Ferriss: Well, you shared a story last time we spoke about being asked to raise a hundred grand in donations just to get a meeting with a Congress. Bill Gurley: Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yeah. Our mutual friend, Rich Barton, talks about shining flashlights in dark places. This technology that we have access to should — I think donations should be on the blockchain, quite frankly. There’s no reason why this information needs to be in the dark. I think there’s a lot of opportunity around data aggregation. Tim Ferriss: Any other ideas that are percolating? Bill Gurley: I’m enamored by state versus state competition. Part of it pops into my brain from the China experience and the provincial competition, but you see Newsom and Abbott fighting back and forth, and maybe there can be a positive outcome from this. I think some of the Federalist Papers envisioned that different states could try different experiments and we could see what happens as a result of that. Tim Ferriss: We’re seeing some of it with Texas and Arizona. Bill Gurley: We are seeing something. I think it could be pretty interesting and provocative and could lead to positive change. I have this dream that some state, and maybe this state that we’re sitting in that has a surplus, would do something crazy with teacher salaries. What if a state just all of a sudden said, “We’re going to pay 50% more for teachers”? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: Think about the dynamic that would create. It’d be pretty wild. Tim Ferriss: It would be. Bill Gurley: Maybe I’ll go tilt it that one, too. Tim Ferriss: So other problems on your mind — well, I’ll just present a list here from some prep notes. We have US healthcare, regulatory capture, intellectual property, US-China, fairness and financial markets, US K-12. Could you speak to intellectual property and fairness in financial markets, how you might be thinking about those? Bill Gurley: I’ve got to be a top 10,000% supporter of open source. This gets back to Ridley’s book, The Rational Optimist, but he talks about prosperity comes when ideas have sex. Just the sharing of information, in my mind, should be free, that it shouldn’t cost anything. It’s very unclear to me that the patent system actually adds value. I’m quite doubtful that the human mind wouldn’t innovate if it didn’t come with a 17-year financial protection. I’m doubtful of that. I think there’s great scientists at every university working on problems that aren’t necessarily being patented. Your ability for hyper competition and innovation is so much higher when there aren’t restrictions in place. Anyway, I think the world’s a better place when ideas are shared and not protected. Tim Ferriss: Since the system we’re working with is the system we’re currently working with, how might something like drug development work without patent protection? Bill Gurley: Well, here’s an interesting thing. The NIH gives out $40 billion a year and a lot of that money goes to companies that end up getting venture capital backing. Tim Ferriss: I’ve had some very open fights with people about this. Bill Gurley: Yeah. Why doesn’t an NIH grant come with an open source rider? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: Yeah. If the VCs want to fund — Tim Ferriss: With federal funding, yeah. Bill Gurley: Yeah, it’s federal funding. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I agree with that. Bill Gurley: Right now, there’s a big fight over whether just their research papers have to go on non-private networks instead of the private ones they’re on today. I mean, they just want the information out there. That’s a minor step I would consider a major step. You don’t have to take the money, but why is the US government giving people money that ends up becoming proprietary inventions? That makes no sense to me. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Whether it’s the US government or individual philanthropists or foundations. I mean, on some level, if that, then at some point — right. I agree with that, but are there industries that — I mean, the only one that first came to mind was drug development where the R&D costs are so high. Bill Gurley: They all cry. The VCs will tell you, “It’ll never work. No one will have any incentive if we don’t have a 17-year protection.” The entire Silicon Valley — Tim Ferriss: I’m not saying I believe that. Bill Gurley: I know. I’ve lived in a world where if someone comes into our office and talks about patents, we roll our eyes because none of the types of businesses that we’ve backed at Benchmark in Silicon Valley are ever about patents. Elon has famously open sourced all his Tesla patents. It’s such a bold thing to do and so gracious, I think, really to society, but his point is — oddly, I was talking to Ted Cruz about this and he said, “Yeah, Elon thinks the same thing.” He views the edge of competition is how fast are you moving, how great are your products, the consumers love them, not, “Can I defend them in a court of law?” The protection that the drug guys get is so much — no one can really use software patents to get protection, an algorithm, or something. No one even tries. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: But with drugs, if I have this particular genome sequence, all of a sudden I get this huge proprietary window in the market. It’s just nutty. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. This is not exactly the same thing, but, I mean, what a service to humanity. I was just watching — I think the documentary name, people can watch it for free on YouTube and other places, The Thinking Game, about DeepMind and Demis and his team really seeing AlphaFold. I mean, all the structures of these proteins, I mean, it’s just like, oh, my God, what an incredible resource for humanity. Bill Gurley: Well, there’s an interesting example right there. The original paper they wrote was open source and OpenAI doesn’t exist without that discovery, which happened at Google in an open source. They just exploited it the fastest. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, wild. Bill Gurley: And by the way, I mean, not to divert too much back, but right now China has 10 open source AI models that are all in hyper competition with each other. That is a dangerously effective primordial soup for innovation compared to what we have here. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I mean, I should probably know this, but I don’t, how does China handle — what are the policies around and laws around intellectual property, patents, things like that? Bill Gurley: Well, interestingly, I found a document online that someone had put together a PowerPoint about the history of open source at China and it’s 20 years old. It’s not like they just stumbled into it. Go back 20 years ago, one of the primary criticisms of China was that they stole IP. If you’re the Chinese government and there’s this new thing called open source, you’re going to embrace it because there’s no fault there because everyone’s sharing and everyone — If you look at the big open source projects, Linux, MySQL, and you go on the webpages, you’ll see Alibaba, Tencent — these companies have been supporting these technologies for a while. Every five years, they write this five year plan, the Chinese government puts it out. Five years ago, they had a huge section on open source. They’re clearly suggesting to the entrepreneurs that the government favors that approach. Going back to Ridley’s book and the notion of pure competition, I think the society — Tim Ferriss: This is The Rational Optimist? Bill Gurley: Yeah, I think the society benefits from that. I use this example. Imagine there’s two feudal societies that are all agricultural based. There’s two of them, though. And in one, once a week the farmers come to market and just trade goods and then they leave. And the other one, the farmers come to market and they’re required to share their best practices with everybody else and then they leave. Going back to this peer example in the book, that one’s going to be much more performant than the other one. This gets to Ridley’s point about ideas having sex. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I mean, open source also, we talked about this a decent amount in our last conversation, but it can be used as an incredible strategy or counterpunch from for-profit companies like Android. I mean, my God, I mean, it’s like you can do a lot. It’s an incredibly powerful tool. Bill Gurley: I think that using open source as a defensive tool instead of an offensive tool is one of the most sophisticated corporate strategies a company can possibly do. It’s very hard to do because it goes against all of your instincts. But I would suggest that Amazon and Apple and maybe Meta who has toyed with it should run at the idea of jointly supporting an open source model. I don’t think they’re doing it, but I think they should, because their incumbency is at risk if someone else has a massive proprietary advantage. Tim Ferriss: Fairness in financial markets, what does that mean? Bill Gurley: I’ve been tilting against this insider’s game of the IPO market for some time and I’m very passionate that when you bring a company public — Tim Ferriss: Does that come with the luxury of retirement or — Bill Gurley: Maybe. I mean, yeah, if you tilt against the investment banks, you got to be comfortable not going to conferences, that’s for sure. They owe some really nice funds. You fall off the invite real quick. But the way that an IPO’s price is so God awful stupid, they pick who gets the stock and they pick the price. I’ve said it over and over again, but a freshman comp size student and a freshman finance student, if you told them to design the IPO, they would just match supply and demand anonymously. It’s how every bond is priced. It’s interestingly how every initial coin offering works. I’ve become a late to the game crypto enthusiast because I’m so sick of this damn IPO process being broken. Tim Ferriss: Could you say a bit more about how it’s broken? Just walk us through a hypothetical example of why it’s broken. Bill Gurley: Yeah. When a company’s coming public, the bankers — literally, they ask everyone for orders, but then they pick who gets the stock and they pick the price. They don’t let supply and demand pick. Supply and demand can automagically pick the allocation and the price. Automagically is the wrong word, can algorithmically. This is super easy. It’s not hard. Tim Ferriss: Why don’t they do it that way? Bill Gurley: Because they’re handing free money to their clients. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, there we go. That’s what I was looking for. Bill Gurley: Yeah. No, it’s been known for a long time. I uncovered an email from 1999 at Goldman Sachs, which I’ve posted on Twitter several times where they’re like saying, “Oh, we can use this hot stock to reward our top clients.” They know what’s going on. The fact that the SEC doesn’t get involved really bothers me, but this tokenization thing is a real way to get around it because the crypto community’s already decided to use algoriththms to allocate and determine price. The price and the allocation should just be determined. It’s how direct listing work. Everyone knows how to do it. They just don’t do it. It’s horrible. But there’s other things too in this category. The long prevalence of Visa and MasterCard is just ridiculous, 2.5%, and stablecoins have so much momentum right now. I think those two companies are going to be in real trouble within a five-year window. Most of the financial problems are pure regulatory capture, like the reason that there’s a problem. Tim Ferriss: Tell me if I’m explaining this well, because I’m not sure we said this directly, but basically the incumbents help to write laws and regulations that favor them and prevent newcomers from competing effectively. Bill Gurley: After ’09, we wrote this thing Dodd-Frank and we thought, “Oh, we’re going to make things better,” and all you’ve had is consolidation and banking since then. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: If you look at the offering, especially at the low end for the poorest citizens of the US, free checking went away. The poor people have a hard time paying their bills, so they don’t even have the tools to do it because free checking went away. Free checking went away after Dodd-Frank. Tim Ferriss: Right. Just to please push back if I’m oversimplifying this, but the regulatory capture is not just bad for startups in Silicon Valley who hope to grow and disrupt and fill in the blank, it’s also bad for everybody. Bill Gurley: Oh, it’s horrible for consumers. I mean, the US healthcare situation, which seems to be getting worse on a daily basis, is a huge example of regulatory cap. Somewhere in the past 10 years, they just told physicians they can’t run hospitals. They just eliminated probably — I mean, who other than a doctor is going to go start a new hospital? The amount of competition you eliminated in this one swoop is enormous, just enormous. That’s just a single example, but there’s hundreds of them in that area. Tim Ferriss: What would success be for this book? Six months after it comes out, what will lead you to have been happy with putting the time in? It’s taken a while. It’s taken a lot of work. What do you hope the outcome will be? Bill Gurley: It really started as a passion project and I have no financial goals for whatsoever. In fact, as we get to book launch, I’m going to launch a foundation that gives grants to people who want to chase their dream job but don’t have the financial wherewithal to do it. I’m going to start working on that in addition to P3. For me, it’s all about how many people do I affect in the way that McConaughey’s dad did or that this book did for Seinfeld. Some of them saw the talk on YouTube from the UT presentation that I gave and I’ve already reached out and said thank you and they’ve shared how it changed their life. But the more people I can do that for, I will just be tickled pink. I’d just be so excited, because I think when people get out of this pragmatic lane and go do these types of things, they tend to be unusually successful, which I think then has a bigger impact than just on them themselves. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, for sure. Bill Gurley: The number of humans positively impacted by Danny Meyer’s success is in the thousands, I’m certain. Tim Ferriss: Oh, for sure. Bill Gurley: And I’m not counting customers of Shake Shack. Tim Ferriss: People, check it out. I mean, I love your writing, Bill. You’re not just a commentator. You’ve been an operator. You’ve observed a lot of operators, studied outliers, and people who’ve chosen X instead of A, B, or C. The book is Runnin’ Down a Dream: How to Thrive in a Career You Actually Love.

Tim Ferriss: And I thought we would start with a prop that you brought. So there was a very thick book with a tattered cover and I think that is as good a lead in as anything. And what are you holding? Bill Gurley: I’m holding a book called The Last Laugh by Phil Berger. The reason it’s tattered is I think it may be out of print, like I bought it used because I wanted to see it and have it. Tim Ferriss: What’s the subtitle? Bill Gurley: The Last Laugh: The World of the Stand-up Comics. Tim Ferriss: Why do you have this book? Are you thinking of making a career switch? Bill Gurley: No. No. No. No. So as part of researching my new book, Runnin’ Down a Dream, my co-writer and I were, we spent six years just diving through stories because I had done this speech at the University of Texas and we wanted to enhance it when we went to the printed form. And one of the stories we came across was Jerry Seinfeld and his decision to pursue a career as a comedian. And he was in New York. He wasn’t sure what he wanted to do with his life. He had an inkling, an inkling that he might want to be a standup comic, but he didn’t know what that meant. He didn’t know if it was a real career. He didn’t know that you could make money. And he read this book and it profiles, I don’t know, it looks like 15 different — it’s got Woody Allen, Bill Cosby, George Carlin, Lily Tomlin, Robert Klein. It profiled them in a way that was very disinhibiting to him. It gave him permission to go do this career that’s not a typical career. When you go to college, they don’t list standup comedian as something that you can go do. Tim Ferriss: The guidance counselor is not generally putting that on the multiple choice. Bill Gurley: Exactly. But this book served as something that granted him permission to go do that. Tim Ferriss: And we’re going to come back to that. I will say that I bookmarked this for future conversations, and of course we’re chatting outside of these recordings, but because two years ago, almost exactly when we did our first episode, you mentioned that you were working on a book idea based on the belief that it’s easier than ever to rise up because access to mentors and information is unprecedented. So we’ll come back to that, of course, and discuss it and the frameworks and the approaches and the stories at some length. But I wanted to start with some topical subject matter: AI bubble or not? And if so, what does that mean? Bill Gurley: Yeah. So I think this is super interesting. My partner, Peter, reminded me of a book that we had seen a while ago by Carlota Perez. It has this very benign title, Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital. It was written in like 2002. And what Perez simplifies and notices, which I just find perfect for trying to understand whether there’s a bubble or not, is that every time there’s been a technology wave that leads to wealth creation, especially fast wealth creation, that will inherently invite speculators, carpetbaggers, interlopers that want to come take advantage of it, think of the Gold Rush. And so people want to make it a debate. Do you believe in AI or is it a bubble? And if you say you think it’s a bubble, they say, “Oh, you don’t believe in AI.” Like, this “Got you!” kind of thing. And if you study Perez, and I think this is absolutely correct, if the wave is real, then you’re going to have bubble-like behavior. They come together as a pair, precisely because any time there’s very quick wealth creation, you’re going to get a lot of people that want to come try and take advantage of that or participate in it. So you get a flood of those types of people coming at it. And so it’s odd. There’s a real technology wave that’s fundamentally changing the world and there’s also massive speculation simultaneously. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, they come as a pair. I recall not too long ago, maybe two weeks ago, saw a short interview with your friend, Jeff Bezos, and he distinguished between financial bubbles and industrial bubbles and cited, and I’m paraphrasing here, but 2008 as an example of a bad bubble, financial bubble, versus, let’s just say, the early 2000s, ’98, ’99, 2000, where a lot of very important technology was created that then was durable after the fact and created new generations of entrepreneurs and a lot of economic growth. And he believes that AI would fall into the industrial bubble category of things. But I suppose, given that the dancing pair you described come together, how would you think about investing in private companies, modern venture capital at this point in time? And just, I suppose, as it’s changed since you were most active. Bill Gurley: Just a quick comment on that industrial bubble thing. One thing that is surprising to me is that even though I fundamentally believe this is an important real technology wave, the big players, even the Mag Seven, have all decided to do things from a deal perspective. You’ve read about these circular deals and whatnot. Tim Ferriss: Could you explain what you mean by that? Bill Gurley: Yeah. There’s a lot of talk out there, but it all started when Microsoft invested in OpenAI. OpenAI agreed to buy services from Microsoft, which is called a circular deal because you’re giving them money they wouldn’t have otherwise. And when Dario was on stage at DealBook last week, he said, “Oh, I can explain this. It’s not that hard.” Amazon wanted us to spend money we didn’t have, so they gave us even more money. And I’m like, “Well, that’s precisely why this is a questionable behavior.” But it’s gotten bigger. NVIDIA’s handed out money and then NVIDIA gave CoreWeave money, but then also agreed to buy any services they have left over. This stuff’s not ideal. Like if you were to say, “What’s crisp, clean accounting?” You wouldn’t do these things. And some of them say, “Well, it’s not material.” And which I would say, “Well, then why are you doing it?” And I’ve asked other people to try and understand how even big, sophisticated companies might get speculative using a word from previous discussion. And I hear things like, “Well, loss aversion tends to go down when you’re winning.” Like if you’re on a hot streak in a casino, you take more risk, things like that. But it is surprising to me. So when it comes to retail investors, I would be particularly concerned for them at this stage in the AI game because there is a plethora of SPV vehicles, but you’ve heard that phrase, I’m sure, SPV. This is where someone has an in on an investment and they do a one-off VC fund, if you will. Tim Ferriss: A special purpose vehicle. Bill Gurley: Yeah. It’s a single entity just for that one — Tim Ferriss: We have a chance to invest in X. We have an allocation of however much money, and then they can allow Jane Doe and John Doe potentially — Bill Gurley: And they take a rake on it. And there’s people promoting SPVs in situations where they don’t even actually have the underlying stock, or maybe they hope to get it. It’s the wild, wild west. And most of the people on that edge, I would put in the category of interloper carpet bagger. These are people that have come to this thing, and I just think you got to be quite careful. The investments that were made that have already had 100 X plus returns were made a while ago before this thing started. And that’s not to say there won’t be an incremental AI investment that makes money, I think there will, but your odds right now of that being the case are really, really low. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I would add to that and say, and this applies to me as much as anyone else, but your actual risk tolerance may differ, probably does differ significantly from your perceived risk tolerance if you haven’t had a huge drawdown, right? If you haven’t actually ridden a few of those waves and see how you respond in those circumstances, and you should be, I suppose, skeptical of how you view your own intestinal fortitude with some of those things, or maybe the losses you can absorb. Because I recall, for instance, I’ve seen this many, many times, but with these types of SPVs, people get involved, and let’s just say they’re not typically an angel investor, they don’t have the experience of watching 60%, 70%, 80% of their investments go to zero or become the walking dead, and they sign off on all of the, not necessarily waivers, but they accept, accept, accept the SBV terms of service, which I’ll say, “You could lose all of your investment. This is incredibly risky.” But then when it does go to zero, the financial and psychological impact is catastrophic. Bill Gurley: There’s a lot of people, and I think this comes from a very good place. I think they’re very well intentioned who look at the world and say — well, first of all, rising inequality, why can’t everyone have access to the same things? And then companies are staying private longer. So they say, we need to institutionalize the generic public’s ability to invest in private companies. And the problem, I think there’s two problems. One you just hinted at, which is most private company VC backed even go to zero, like the majority, which is not something people really — they sense that they want the lottery ticket, they want the Uber, they want the one that goes to the moon, but they don’t understand that that comes along with it. Tim Ferriss: They don’t want to buy losing lottery tickets for 12 years. Bill Gurley: Right. Right. Exactly. And the second problem is the information transparency in the private company game is just low. And I think the institutional investors have come to understand that and know what they’re getting into and know how to evaluate things. But if you come at it with a public market mindset thinking, “Oh, every set of financials I’ve been handed is audited and is correct.” And that’s just not the case. It’s super loosey-goosey. Tim Ferriss: So if you were, this may be a difficult question, but if you were angel investing right now, how would you be thinking about your approach? Bill Gurley: I’ll tell you a funny story. When I decided to hang up my gloves, if you will, and stop making institutional venture capital investments, I had a whole bunch of ideas about what I wanted to do next. And one of them was, “Oh, I’ll do a bunch of angel investing.” Bezos did it on the side. This would be fantastic. Tim Ferriss: He did pretty well with his angel investing. Bill Gurley: I was explaining this to a, I won’t say who it is, but a Silicon Valley CEO, very successful. And he said, “What are you going to do now?” And I said, “I was thinking of doing angel investing.” He goes, “Why would you do that?” He said, “I got 50 of these things. People don’t return my calls.” He goes, “I wish I’d never done it.” So there’s a unglamorous side to it as much as there is a glamorous side. And you’ve participated in this world before. So what would I say? I think if I were doing angel investments, I’d try and find in an intersection of people that are super curious and are playing with all these AI tools, but bring a perspective from a particular industry that gives them an advantage in that area where they could simultaneously be maybe the smartest user of AI in their genre, in their vertical. Tim Ferriss: So despite the, or maybe because of, because we talked about the pair, the AI bubble, you would still be looking at AI intersected opportunities if you were angel investing. Bill Gurley: Yeah. There’s a weird reality out there right now, and this could end if ever a bubble has popped or whatever, but the institutional investors have zero interest in non-AI deals. Zero. It’s more black and white than I could be successful in — Tim Ferriss: And for people who do not know the term, define the institutional investor. Bill Gurley: People who are paid both a salary and a piece of the return to be active investors of other people’s money, using other people’s money. But the reason that kind of matters is if you angel fund a deal and have any hope of it raising money in the future, if it’s not AI related, right now — Tim Ferriss: Could die of neglect. Bill Gurley: There is no interest. I can’t state clearly enough how there’s zero interest. And I could simultaneously make fun of that reality, but I could also justify that reality, but it is the reality right now. And by the way, while I mention that, I feel obligated for your audience. I don’t care what field you’re in, you should be playing with this stuff. It has the potential to impact your role in your career, and the best way to protect against any risk of your career being obfuscated or eliminated from AI is to be the most AI-enabled version of yourself you can possibly be. PREROLL Tim Ferriss: How would you think about, maybe you can give a hypothetical example of looking for someone who has very, very sophisticated domain expertise and experience who’s now intersecting with AI and has a unique, because of the combination perspective on things, to invest in as an angel investor and separate that from something that’s just going to be consumed by the fundamental models and these larger companies that — Bill Gurley: From a career perspective or — Tim Ferriss: From an angel investment perspective, how would you pick folks you don’t think are just going to end up working on something that gets replicated in short order by the bigger companies? Bill Gurley: Yeah. The key is just to stay pretty far away from the edge of whatever. You can go online and see interviews with the people at Anthropic or OpenAI and what they’re working on. If it’s the next thing they’re going to do, I don’t think you’re going to be protected. But as I think about founders and angel investors, you’re talking about a pretty broad array of things. At this point, as I mentioned earlier, you’re not going to back the next big model company. Besides, if you were, you need a billion dollar angel investment to go make that happen. It’s just really, the game’s changed. There’s so much money involved. And so I think you’re going to want to be off the beaten path anyway. When I think about these deeper verticals, I don’t think it will make sense for OpenAI to go crush every little vertical. Tim Ferriss: Waste management. Bill Gurley: And even if the model’s capable of understanding that subject matter, there are workflows, there are data sets that are local to your customer, and that stuff has to be stitched together. So I think having an understanding of a particular industry and one that’s not going to be on the next thing to do list at OpenAI, it would probably be your best bet. Tim Ferriss: Got it. So is it fair to say, if I’m understanding you correctly, that effectively looking for something that would not be a high priority for one of these larger companies and also a proprietary dataset of some type? Bill Gurley: Proprietary datasets, the more workflows that exist are better because you can build software around those things that — Tim Ferriss: What is a workflow? Bill Gurley: The thing that popped into my head, I’m on the board of Zillow. Zillow’s been investing for the past five years in tools that help the realtor do their day-to-day job. They have a tool called Showing Time that helps you book in person tours at houses as an example, but there’s putting the mortgage together, getting the sign-offs on. There’s just all these tasks that have to be happened that can be automated in the — And so tasks that can be automated, that can be integrated with AI, the more of that stuff you can build into a system, the better off you’re going to be protecting yourself from a model that just answers questions, which is why I brought it up. Tim Ferriss: All right. Let’s move on to big topic, big country, China. You spent 10 days there over the past summer. What was your experience? What did you see? What made an impression? What did you do? Bill Gurley: Yeah. I’d been about six times before, so this is like my seventh trip. It was one thing that was different. My daughter is an Asian studies major, as you were, and she spent the summer in Hong Kong. So we picked her up and then we toured six cities in 10 days. And my objective with this trip, in the past trips, it was mostly just to meet with entrepreneurs and founders and mutual sharing of information, that thing. This time I was more interested in just kind of being eyes wide open and learning. And so we took two of the high speed trains just as an experience that I got a tour of the Xiaomi factory with their new car, the SU7, and was trying to get a feel for what’s most recent there. And we went to Shenzhen, the overnight city, which has gone from, I think, less than 100,000 people in 1980 to 20 million people. And just to see the scale and scope of the whole thing, there’s a lot of rhetoric in the US about what is or isn’t happening in China. And I just wanted to have a better feel for it. And we’re making policy decisions that are going to impact the global footprint, and God forbid, end up in a World War three situation. So anyway, I just wanted a better understanding. I was aided by the fact that Dan Wang shared his book Breakneck with me right before I left, and I read it while I was there, which was interesting. And then it came out, and of course it ended up on the bestseller list. But I think China’s misperceived in a lot of ways. Tim Ferriss: What are some of those misperceptions? Bill Gurley: The biggest one is that people who have a rudimentary understanding of what is happening there, you use this word communism to infer a lot of other things. And one of the things that’s inferred by communism is top down state run system. And I think they think of Russia and they assume, “Well, that’ll always lead to bad capital allocation, no innovation.” Because they have this picture in their mind of these, I don’t know, brick buildings, like with snow all around them and not much happening. And the reality there is just far, far different from that. I think Dan Wang did a great job of explaining how the country puts out this five-year plan, but then the provinces, which they’re a lot bigger than a US state, but they’re the equivalent, like it’s how the country segment and they compete with each other. And the effective mayor of the province, if he does well, has a chance to move up in the system, which is not a reality in the US system. But what that leads to is just a massive amount of competition and — Tim Ferriss: What are the metrics by which they’re being judged? Do you have any idea on a province level? Is it some equivalent of GDP? It’s not the right term, but — Bill Gurley: I’m guessing probably we could go talk to AI and get a better answer than I have right now. But yeah, I would think that’s part of it, prosperity, employment, those things. By the way, this provincial competition has also led to overbuild of buildings. It’s not always positive, bridges that aren’t used, there’s a Go cities. Go cities, yes. But you end up with hyper competition. So I think the thing that a lot of people in Silicon Valley love about capitalism is this notion of the invisible hand and competition that leads to innovation and best practice, and the winners rise up and they’re better for it. That is happening there. And if you read about the solar industry or the EV industry or now the robotics industry, they have hundreds of different companies competing in these fields and it’s brutal competition. And as a result of that, they’re ending up with very innovative companies, which once again, I think people wouldn’t prescribe to being possible in a communist world and remarkable execution from an industrial standpoint. So the price points of the products that will be sold around the globe are well below anything that could be done in the US. Tim Ferriss: How do you go about getting a tour of Xiaomi factory? I would think that they would be very closed about that. What’s in it for them and how do they — Bill Gurley: I don’t know if you saw this going around the internet yesterday, but they shipped a car to this YouTuber. Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah. I saw it. Yeah. Absolutely. Bill Gurley: Which is brilliant. And he did like a 15 — that’s the SG7, that’s the factory I went to. As I mentioned, I’d been there before, so I met Lei Jun, who’s the Founder of Xiaomi in 2005 when he was chairman of Joyo, which was a E-commerce company that Amazon bought. So he’s been around a while. He has evolved into, the best thing I could say is he’s the Steve Jobs of China right now. When he quit doing Joyo and he had this other company as well, he declared 10 years ago he was going to build a smartphone. Just out of the blue, I’m going to build a smartphone. He didn’t have any smartphone experience, but Xiaomi’s now the third-largest manufacturer of handsets in the globe. And about four or five years ago, at about the exact same time Apple hinted they were interested in building a car, he said, “I’m going to build a car.” Tim Ferriss: Well, not only did he say I’m going to build a car, but that was a response to sanctions. That was an emergency. Well, I listened to the translation of, even though my Chinese is decent, but it’s not as good as it once was. I think it was 2024 company-wide address where he talked about the sanctions coming in saying, “What if we couldn’t make phones? What would we do? Bill Gurley: But that talk is unbelievable, and it’s translated on YouTube, and I would encourage people to watch from about minute 30 to about an hour 15, which is where he talks about his process for designing the car. I don’t know if you saw that part. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I did. Bill Gurley: But it’s crazy. He says, he put a note on any car in his parking lot that he had never drove, and he would ask each employee to give him three positives, three negatives and loan them the car. Said he drove 200 of his employees cars. When you hear that stuff, you’re like, “Wow, I wonder if anyone at Apple did that.” It’s just such a bottom up, just ground truth way to start the process. But even still, even if he did that, a bunch of people could do that. How do you have the wherewithal to build a factory? He’d never built a factory before. And I’ve been in other car factories here in the US. It was phenomenal. Anyway, back to your question why I could get in. I knew Lei Jun from way back when. Tim Ferriss: What does the process look like? Are there a bunch of clearances and you have to get the okay from the provincial? Bill Gurley: I don’t think we went through the whole factory, but no, it wasn’t that. They’re a public company. I think they’re interested in being well understood, which I think hints at why they enabled this. I think they had to send a car to this guy, the YouTuber. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: And by the way, the President of Ford went over there about six months before I did, went on the same tour, so they let him go there. And he had an SU7 shipped to Michigan, and he drove it for several weeks and he’s talked about how incredible it is. Tim Ferriss: Well, he also, if I’m remembering correctly, has talked about EV production, and battery dominance or at least component dominance from China and the risks inherent in that. And I don’t want to bleed too far into geopolitics, but it’s hard not to pull it into the conversation. So this is a question from X, the artist formerly known as Twitter, one of many questions. But I’ll ask, what are your top handful of critiques say of the Chinese tech ecosystem or CCP after going on a tour there? What would you say they’re not doing well or things that complicate their ability to compete? Bill Gurley: Well, the first one that’s I think been well publicized is when an entrepreneur has risen to a level of success and then uses that as a platform, the government seems uninterested in that. Tim Ferriss: Exhibit A. Bill Gurley: The Jack Ma. Tim Ferriss: Jack Ma. Bill Gurley: Yeah, exactly. And there’s a saying that I think I heard while I was over there, “Don’t be the tallest tree.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah, this is, Don’t Be The Tallest Tree. Yeah, the nail that sticks out gets hammered down in Japan. They have a totally different system obviously. Bill Gurley: The other entrepreneur outside of Lei Jun is the ByteDance CEO. And ByteDance is probably got the leading position for the consumer AI, like Open AI, but over there right now, in addition to just incredible revenue growth. This is the company that owned TikTok and whatnot, but they’re not going public and you don’t see him at all, which may get to this tallest tree thing. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, celebrities also disappear over there. Bill Gurley: No doubt. Tim Ferriss: Very mysteriously. Bill Gurley: Yes. Well, and business people. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: So yes, that does happen. Tim Ferriss: I will say, and for people who are wondering, because there are a lot of — how should we put this? There are people who are very angry, very hawkish. Some people are very, very supportive, and then their agendas or alliances get questioned. I, like you, I’m just interested in understanding what is happening to the extent that I can. What is the actual truth on the ground? What are the details? And frankly, the innovation over there is remarkable. And what they’ve done in terms of establishing access to rare metals and everything they need to manufacture is remarkable. You go to South America or Africa, and it is Chinese everywhere on infrastructure projects. They’ve been very, very smart about it. So I’m deeply interested in all of it, and please hold your thought because I want to hear everything you have to say. What I would say is a piece of the three-dimensional chess that I’ve been impressed with is how well the Chinese government is able to — well, of course they’re able to integrate with the private sector so that they’re able to use, in a sense, products to widen their scope of access potentially. Like DJI, for instance, great example. People have a lot of questions around these cars, as spectacular as they might be. Are they an extension of surveillance? These are open questions that I think are worth asking. But you were about to say something, so I’ll let you — Bill Gurley: No, no, no. I think let’s come to that. Let me make one point and then let’s come to that. So there’s two other things I wanted to mention. Obviously, infrastructure. So they are building new nuclear fission plants. So fission being old school, not new school, at one fourth the price that we do it here in the US. So is South Korea, by the way. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. And the numbers are incredible. Bill Gurley: But when we sit here and say, “Oh, we want to re-shore manufacturing, and they can build things at one fourth the price we can.” If you don’t solve that, you’re going to re-shore something and we’re going to not be price competitive globally. And then because you won’t import what they have, and you’re going to make our citizens buy from this new factory where we’re making things way more expensive, it doesn’t work. Tim Ferriss: The math doesn’t math. Bill Gurley: It doesn’t work. And by the way, I’m not sure it brings jobs. The Xiaomi factory was a third based on some numbers I was able to acquire, a third the number of employees per car output. And I got to believe in 10 years it’ll be a sixth. And so you could calculate the total number of jobs that you’d be bringing back if you brought back all this car production and it’d be hundreds of thousands. It’s not millions and millions of jobs. So anyway, that infrastructure thing’s for real. And I think Dan Wong does a good job of saying that America’s run by lawyers. Tim Ferriss: And this is the author of Breakneck. Bill Gurley: Our country’s run by lawyers and theirs is run by engineers. Engineers. And so when you try and build something here, the lawyers just get in the way and try and block it, which certainly when you hear Elon talks about why the Gigafactory is here in Austin and not in California, it all relates to those things. So anyway, that’s infrastructure. There’s another thing that’s I think quite interesting, which is the government may not care about whether or not their companies have really big market caps. And when I first realized this, you saw what happened when they took down Alibaba when they went after Jack Ma, and Amp Financial could have been this big thing and it got a haircut, and you question, well, do they care? And if you are pushing your companies to be low cost providers, maybe that’s at odds with them being hyper profitable and really big. And then you can turn around and ask the question. Hearing that caused me to ask the question, does America really benefit by the fact that the Mag Seven have $3 trillion market caps? I know the employees of those companies do, but is that a sign of our competitive capitalistic society not being truly competitive? Tim Ferriss: On a global scale. Bill Gurley: No, even within. There’s a notion you learn about in economics classes called pure competition. And in pure competition, no one has an intellectual property advantage. Marginal profits are whittled down just to the cost of capital, and the consumer benefits because there’s no excessive profit capture. If we have all these companies that are able to have excessive profits, is that a form of market failure? And does the fact that they exist help America in any way? At first, of course I’m a venture capitalist. I want to think, yes, of course. But then as I think about it, I don’t know that our government, or our society, or our people are better off because these six companies have $3 trillion market caps. It’s not that many people that — the percentage of the country that’s employed by those companies is small on an overall basis. And so anyway, I think they have a different perspective on whether big market caps matter, and I think that is somewhat intriguing. Tim Ferriss: What do you think about the innovation in China leading in some cases to the development of superior technology at a lower cost, that is plausibly an extension of the intelligence gathering apparatus of the government? Is that a real thing? Bill Gurley: I’m not in a good place to know. Tim Ferriss: I would have to imagine it seems like they would have to be stupid not to use that given their ability to penetrate the private sector. Bill Gurley: Yeah. I think it’s certainly well known that they do surveillance of their own people. I know that would be particularly upsetting to people like Greg Luciano that runs FIRE and is very interested in free speech. The flip side is there’s very little street crime. You walk around, you don’t worry about that when you’re there. Tim Ferriss: It’s true also in Japan though, right? Bill Gurley: It doesn’t make it right or wrong. It is what it is. And I don’t know that we have this ability to tell them how they have to do it. Now, to the extent that the Huawei stuff where their products are being shipped out, and then those are used to gather intelligence out of their country and the rest of the world, of course that’s a problem. But I think the way to deal with it, I’m not a politician, but I think the way to deal with it — I’m more of a believer of the engage. Engage, talk about what you don’t like and what you do like, and try and negotiate that problem away like we’re trying to do with the fentanyl precursors. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Well, way back in the day when I was an East Asian studies major, this was lifetimes ago. And keeping in mind, I was at the Capitol University of Business Economics in 1996. That was the bicycle era, these old photographs of Beijing with millions of bicycles with people in their long green jackets. I had one of those jackets for the winters. It gets really cold. But things have changed a lot. At the time, I was looking forward and thinking I might be one of those people who could engage in Chinese. I think the way to do it is in English, frankly, for a whole host of reasons. But even if you speak the other language, Putin speaks English pretty well, but he does all of his negotiations when he’s speaking in Russian for a lot of good reasons, the same good reasons. Bill Gurley: I get that. But look, so first of all, I do get accused of being like an agent of the CCP or something, even by some of the people that responded to your Twitter thing. I’m not. I’ve only visited a few times. I don’t know anybody in the government, but I worry greatly that we make bad policy decisions if we misunderstand what’s really going on. Tim Ferriss: Oh, I agree with that. Yeah, I fully agree with that. I’ve thought about — I frankly am worried about it. I would take a burner phone and a burner laptop. I’ve thought about it, because I want to get a better understanding of the culture of innovation that can be fostered, and exactly how things are to the extent that it would be visible to me, how things are developing in China. I’ve thought about going there. I thought about doing the same thing in India, too, to go and interview 10 of the top entrepreneurs. But the reason I haven’t done it is that I’m just like, I don’t know what radars that’s going to put me on, what surveillance, what fill in the blank, how difficult is it going to be? Whose rings am I going to have to kiss? Am I overthinking it or is it straightforward? Bill Gurley: I think you’re overthinking it. I think the odds that Tim Ferriss would disappear in China is really [inaudible 00:44:26]. Tim Ferriss: Oh, I’m not worried about disappearing. That would be a terrible — the upside downside on that doesn’t make any sense. I’m not worried about disappearing. Bill Gurley: There are companies that may not speak with you. When I was there, DeepSeek and Unitree, the word was out on the street that they’re not meeting with Westerners for reasons that are — Tim Ferriss: Well, I’m sure that’s true conversely in the US too, right? Bill Gurley: Yes. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I’m sure that’s — and by the way, I think that reflective lens, when you think about the country is helpful. When Alex Karp was just on stage at DealBook last week, he was talking about surveillance and he says, “Well, of course our tools are used to surveil the enemy.” And I’m like, “Okay, well, my God, the Chinese are surveilling us, but obviously we’re surveilling them too. Let’s be honest about these things.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah. It’s a lot easier for a bunch of obvious reasons. It’s in some respects, a lot easier for them to surveil us than the other way around. Partially just due to the homogeneity of the society over there. You can’t send a bunch of blonde-haired, blue eyes, black, Latino, whatever, to China to end up at top universities, top companies, et cetera. It’s just a lot harder. Bill Gurley: By the way, to put a bow on this part, I would say there’s two other things. One, you hinted at. One, the supply chains are so integrated in China down to the raw material level, that even if you brought a factory back here, it’d be more of an assembly shop and you’d still be sourcing from there, which isn’t necessarily cost competitive. And to replicate all of it would take a very, very, very long time. Tim Ferriss: Well, including raw materials for staple pharmaceuticals, There’s a lot going on. So what at this point, is it a day late and a dollar short for the US? I know I almost promised we weren’t going to go into this, but I want to know your opinion. I’m so curious. What are the keys to the US remaining globally competitive and vibrant as an economy? You hinted to one, which is, it seems inevitable, nuclear power or more power. So how do you do that? I’m not sure how quickly you can right the ship, although it seems like a handful of people have done a pretty good job of changing the narrative. What are some of the key things in your opinion that the US needs to do? Bill Gurley: One is make it easier to build. Tim Ferriss: Build companies? Build? Bill Gurley: I think build infrastructure. If you’re going to build semiconductor plants, if you’re going to build nuclear plants on time and on budget, that’s very hard to do in the US right now. And the glimmer of hope I would say is that a few states seem to have governors that want to get stuff out of the way. And I think it’s red tape and bureaucracy, and lawyers, and litigation that make this stuff so expensive. And so Texas and Arizona seem to be getting their unfair share of data centers and semiconductor plants. And I think because of that attitude, I’ve seen a similar attitude in Pennsylvania where they repaired I-95 in 12 days, but they literally had to take a bunch of statutes that are on the books and say that they don’t apply right now. So that mindset I think needs a lot more momentum. That’d be one thing. There’s another thing that I think is important for people to understand on the China front. There are numerous people with a loud microphone that will say, “Oh, they know how to scale out plants, but they don’t know how to do any innovation.” And that’s just flat wrong. Whoever’s saying that just hasn’t been there. They don’t know the facts on the ground. These entrepreneurs are every bit as good as the entrepreneurs they are here. There are examples like in LIDAR, they built a MEMS LiDAR product that’s like $130 a car. Tim Ferriss: What is MEMS LiDAR? Bill Gurley: It’s solid state. It uses solid state semiconductor technology instead of that big spinning radar. And so the LiDAR on a Waymo is $5,000. And it’s $130 for MEMS LIDAR. They’re putting it on every car. You can go into ChatGPT and say, “Tell me about MEMS LiDAR innovation in China.” But it’s a great example. Le Jun’s another one, but anybody that thinks there’s no innovation is just — Tim Ferriss: Yeah, they’re just wrong. Bill Gurley: They got blinders on. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. No, that’s not true. That’s definitely not true. I asked you two years ago if there are any countries that you’re long on. At the time, I’d be curious if this is still the case. You said you’re long on the UK, less regulatory capture. Bill Gurley: Did I say that? Tim Ferriss: Losing party pay is in the legal system. Bill Gurley: I do love that. Tim Ferriss: Which reduces frivolous litigation compared to the US. Any thoughts on where you’re bullish these days? Bill Gurley: Well, ironically, Matt Ridley was in town a few weeks ago in Austin. Tim Ferriss: The Rational Optimist, other books. Bill Gurley: I love his stuff, but he would say that I would be dead wrong on that. Things aren’t going well there. And he lives there. So I’ll just take that as I got that one wrong. Tim Ferriss: Well, it depends on the timeframe too. Is it two years, or is it five years or is it 10 years? Bill Gurley: One of the things that’s been impressive about China is since Deng Xiaoping brought back capitalism, 500 million people have come out of poverty. And you look at countries that have a very strong work ethic, and a high education, and a currently low per populate income, and you would think more jobs would come their way. So two that would pop for me are Vietnam and Turkey, who check all those boxes. Tim Ferriss: All right. Bill Gurley: Hopefully I do better then. Tim Ferriss: Check in in another two years. All right. So let’s talk about, this is going to be a segue to talking about Runnin’ Down a Dream and all things involved with that. Maybe we could start with an anecdote from a fellow Austinite, likes to play the bongos, long hair, associated with smoking reefer every once in a while. Matthew, we were talking about a short anecdote about Matthew before we started recording. Would you mind sharing that? Bill Gurley: Yeah. As I was preparing, as I was wrapping up the book, I started listening to Greenlights, and I was told you had to listen to it because of course he reads it. So you get all the great McConaughey affectations as you read it. But there’s a story in it that just popped in my brain and summarized exactly what I’m trying to accomplish with this book, Runnin’ Down a Dream. And he had spent the vast majority of his young adult life—so this anecdote is from when he was like 20, 21—telling his family he was going to be a lawyer. And so he’d gotten into the University of Texas. He was Pre-Law. Every time he went home, he talked about, “Yeah, I’m going to be a lawyer.” And he had met some people at Texas that had convinced him that he should switch to film school. And he had immense anxiety about sharing this with his father. This is all in the book, but his father’s a very tough individual. And so reason to be fearful when you’re going to drop some news. “I’m no longer going to be a lawyer. I’m going to go to film school.” And he builds it up a lot in the book. I didn’t know when I was going to talk to him. You can imagine being in that situation, you’re delaying, delaying, delaying. But he finally tells his dad and his dad utters this very simple phrase, “Well, don’t half ass it.” And he says, “Of all the reactions he could have had, don’t half ass it were the last words I expected to hear and the best words he could have ever said to me.” And he said in that single moment, he gave him blessing, consent, approval, validation, privilege, honor, freedom, and responsibility, called it rocket fuel. And I’d like to believe there are a number of people out there, young adults, maybe even some midlife career who have this notion that they should be doing something else, but society has put them on a path, or just the way they matriculated through college, put them into a career that they just don’t love and that they have this inkling that they could go do this thing. Or maybe you’re a young kid and you really want to do X, but everybody else is telling you to do A, B and C. I want to help them have the confidence and permission to go do X, to go chase this dream. And as you hinted at from our last call, I think the amount of your ability to make connections and to gather information and learn on your own pace, has never been better. You can literally just sit there and talk to ChatGPT six hours a day if you so choose, and learn so much about any particular field. And so your ability to take things into your own hands, and to go try and be successful in this thing that you feel passionate about, I think has never been better. Tim Ferriss: Why do you think when you initially gave and subsequently had to go online, Runnin’ Down a Dream as a presentation, why do you think that took? Why did it strike a chord in the way that it did? What do you think it was? Bill Gurley: Well, I think we’ve built a society, like nobody’s fault. We just have built a society where we love to celebrate people that are successful in a lot of different fields, but when it comes to our own children, we tend to think way more pragmatically about what they should be doing. Lawyers, consultants, doctors, computer scientists, it’s all these jobs that have certainty to the financial component. And I think that’s so well intended. I don’t think there’s mal intent of anyone in the system. And I’m a parent of three, I’ve been through this. You just feel this obligation to try and push them towards prosperity, but it’s not intellectual prosperity, it’s not happiness, it’s financial. Tim Ferriss: Stability. Bill Gurley: Yes, that most people are guiding children towards. And this isn’t that complicated math, but most people end up working 80,000 hours in their life. It’s a third of your life. Why do something you don’t like? There’s Gallup poll data on career engagement and 59% of people say they’re not engaged at work. And this is that whole quiet quitting thing that we hear so much about. And some of these numbers are at an all-time low. It just seems horrific that people are sauntering through life. Tim Ferriss: So what are some of the keys to taking the path less traveled then in this case? And there are a few I highlighted for myself, but where should we start? I highlighted one for myself. We don’t have to start here, but go where the action is. I just think this is so underrated, and people further undervalue it maybe in a digital world, but we can start anywhere you want. That’s just one that really jumped out to me because I think it’s really underrated. But where would you like to start? Bill Gurley: I think in the book, one of the things that we tie together very early on is the interplay between passion, or fascination, or curiosity and learning. And the way to be most successful in any endeavor, but certainly if you’re going to go tilt it something that’s less pragmatic, is to be the smartest, most knowledgeable person you can possibly be. And knowledge is free now, as we’ve talked about. And I have this test for whether or not you’re actually truly passionate about what you’re trying to do, which is do you self-learn on your own time? Would you not watch Breaking Bad and read about this field and be energized by that activity? If you are, and we have 20, 30 different stories in the book of people that have been successful, almost all of them check that box. You just have this amazing ability to gain knowledge so much faster than everyone else you would be competing with. And that’s going to be useful. That’s unquestionably going to be useful. Tim Ferriss: I mean, it makes me think of an interview I saw a long time ago, actually. It was quite a few years ago, but it was an interview with Joe Rogan and he said something that surprised me, it might surprise a lot of people, which was along the lines of he’s not good at, it was either willpower or discipline, which he’s in great shape. Obviously he’s black belt in jujitsu. He’s done what he’s done with the podcast. He’s the undisputed king of podcasting, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. And he said, “I’m not actually good at whether it was discipline or willpower, but I am good at obsession. It’s all on or all off.” And I’ve seen that, I’m sure you’ve seen this in a lot of the entrepreneurs who actually make it to the other side and create these mega successes, they are just obsessed. Bill Gurley: No doubt. Tim Ferriss: And that gives them a huge, not just knowledge advantage, but endurance advantage. You just go down the checkboxes. It’s all advantages, and — Bill Gurley: I had the opportunity to talk to Angela Duckworth when I was working on this and her book, Grit, talks about two components, passion and perseverance. And I heard a podcast she had done recently where she said if she could go back, she would put far more weight on the passion and the perseverance because she says, “We’ve taught our children to grind.” And so once again, starting in sixth grade, they’re told to learn the flute and take lacrosse and do all this stuff and crush the SATs and take the extra credit classes and all this. And they all do it and they all do it. And then they go to college and, “Oh, how are you doing?” They take six hours of class instead of four and they’re just going. But eventually she says, “If you don’t have that passion, you just burn out.” And so you’re right about the energy part. I think it’s both knowledge and you’ve put in more cycles. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. It makes me think of, maybe this is cliched in Silicon Valley because it gets so oft repeated, but a lot of folks listening will not have heard it, which is if you’re looking for the next technological breakthrough or something on the edge, look for what the nerds are doing on the weekends. But it’s not just a great way to find what might be coming around the corner in a few years. It’s a great way to find the people to bet on who are already using their excess, their free time to work on these things. Bill Gurley: No doubt. Tim Ferriss: I think of [inaudible 01:01:43] and 3D printing. I mean, I can just go down the list. How do you — Bill Gurley: And by the way, that’s another advantage of going to the epicenter is there’s more people doing that all the time. Tim Ferriss: Maybe you could, let’s talk about, people might be surprised by this, but Bob Dylan. I think this is just the quintessential example. Why is he relevant to what we’re talking about? Bill Gurley: When this idea popped in my head, I had finished a third biography and contrasted it with these other two and I just saw all these patterns. VC is a game of pattern recognition I guess my brain has just developed. I was like, “Oh, my God, it’s all this lock thing where these three people had all done the same thing.” And one was a basketball coach, one was a restaurateur and the other was Bob Dylan, not people you would, not industry, “Oh, this is where you should get career development advice.” There’s a part of the Dylan story that most people wouldn’t know unless they had read all the biographies or maybe seen the Scorsese documentary. But the new movie misses the whole thing, which is the pre-New York Bob Dylan was hanging out in Minnesota studying folk music at such a deep level that I feel confident in saying when he left, he knew more about folk music than any other human in Minnesota. And he was borrowing, and maybe that’s even a euphemism. He was stealing his friends albums, he was going into the record store, into these listening booths. He knew all there was to know and had studied every bit of it. And he’s referred to by Scorsese as a music expeditionary. And the people that knew him in New York said he could mimic any one song. It’s not what you would think of when you hear a Dylan song that he had mastered the bedrock underneath and then started innovating. Picasso, by the way, the same thing, perfect realist painter at age 14. If you go to the Barcelona Picasso Museum, it’s in geographic order and you’re shocked at how good a realist this kid was before he went and did this other thing. That bedrock knowledge I think is so differentiating for someone to have all the history and then to start doing the innovation. Tim Ferriss: What was the before and after on Dylan, Minnesota, New York City? And why is that such an important piece of the puzzle? Bill Gurley: By the way, and just to even pile on more on this studious part of Bob Dylan, he did a podcast series for a while where he just walks through all these different genres of music and he’s — Tim Ferriss: You’re talking about Bob Dylan himself? Bill Gurley: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Oh, I didn’t realize this. Bill Gurley: Yes, yes. You can go find it. He stopped, but he’s — and then that book he put out of the 50 best songs, the coffee table book that came out two years ago, it’s incredible the amount of knowledge he has about songs outside of his genre, everything. He’s a clear student of what he’s doing. I think this is well known and is covered at the beginning of the movie. He went to New York to find Woody Guthrie, probably the single most deterministic and ambitious mentor pursuit story that I’ve ever heard of. He hitchhiked there with no money and found him and became friends with him. Tim Ferriss: I mean, this echoes back to go where the action is also, right? Bill Gurley: Oh, no doubt. And by the way, he landed in Manhattan at the center of the folk music scene and all those people he was studying when he was listening in Minnesota, they were all there and he got to know them all. If that doesn’t happen, I don’t think Dylan happens. Tim Ferriss: How relevant do you think the go where the action is now considering the access to information using ChatGPT or other tools, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera? Maybe less so access to mentors, although you can have virtual relationships, but how relevant do you think that is? I’ve got my own opinion, but — Bill Gurley: You could certainly have the type of peer and mentor experiences that are remote. I have a great anecdote about MrBeast in the book that we could talk about that was a remote one, but the benefits of being in and around a whole bunch of people that are chasing the same thing is so high. And I think the intuition is, “Oh, well, it’s going to be even more competitive, so why would I go? Wouldn’t it be better to try and do this in a town where it’s less of a big deal?” But the problem is your learning is impacted, your access to peers and mentors is drastically reduced, and then probably most importantly, your optionality gets cut so dramatically. People think that a lot of success stories, they attribute it to luck, but there’s that famous saying, luck is when preparation meets opportunity. And when you’re in the epicenter, both your preparation and your opportunity go up 10 X. And so your ability to just have that lucky moment where you get brought into something is so much higher. Tim Ferriss: The lucky moment is, I think, really important to underscore in terms of going where the action is because there’s a lot you can do virtually, but let’s just say you’re using ChatGPT, you’re going to get what you prompt. In other words, you’re asking for something and that can take you down a rabbit hole, but there, at least in my lived experience, and certainly I still see this happening, when I moved to Silicon Valley in 2000, and then I look back at my angel investing career, I look back at all these collaborations, the vast majority of them did not come from me going out with an agenda and seeking something. They came from serendipitous bumping into somebody at a coffee shop. I literally met Naval Ravikant because I was hitting on his girlfriend at the time when she was getting her coffee, didn’t realize they were together. And then you look at Garrett Camp, Kevin Rose. These are, at a barbecue I met Kevin Rose. And you go down the list and you look at all of these formative, massively impactful, personally and professionally relationships. They almost all came from serendipity and you just don’t seem to get that density unless you’re in the center of the action. And perhaps it’s easier to relocate yourself, I’m sure it is, when you have fewer responsibilities, but God, I can’t even imagine what my life would have looked like had I not left Long Island and then ultimately moved to Silicon Valley. Bill Gurley: Yeah, and same for me. I had thought about the notion of venture capital and practicing it and probably would have jumped at any job I could have got. Like when I was at McCombs here in Austin, I tried to get an interview at Austin Ventures. I didn’t get one, but had they said yes, maybe I practiced there. And I’m glad that didn’t happen. Going and practicing it where I did was the exact right place to do it. I do think if you can, if you can, because there are financial constraints, and if you want to be great at a field and that field has an epicenter, I think you should go. Tim Ferriss: And there are different types of epicenters too. You think about, let’s just say AI, not to repeatedly bang that drum, but you could just say, okay, AI, first thing that comes to mind, Silicon Valley, but this is going to be a bit of a digression, but I remember asking Derek Sivers, a friend of mine, amazing entrepreneur, philosopher programmer, people can look him up, but I asked him, “Who’s the first person who comes to mind when you think of the word successful?” And he said, “Well, actually the most interesting or more interesting question might be who’s the third person who comes to mind?” Because I might say something really obvious like Richard Branson, but is he successful? I don’t really know what his goals were. I’d have to compare his goals to his outcomes. And then you get to the third. Similarly, with an epicenter, you could say Silicon Valley first, but there might be something that is dense in learning, but has other advantages like, I think it’s the University of Waterloo, but one of these universities where industry is trying to raid the academic program because it’s so strong in terms of teaching the technical side. There’s so many different ways to approach it, but let’s talk about a virtual example. You mentioned MrBeast. Could you describe that story? Bill Gurley: Yeah. I actually heard it on a podcast, but I also got a chance to talk to Jimmy Donaldson, so we got it firsthand. When he was infatuated with YouTube, he was one of the first people that was infatuated with YouTube, his parents were rightfully trying to get him to go to school and college, which he wasn’t doing because he was playing around on YouTube all day. He met three other people who were equally fascinated with YouTube. And this is a virtual epicenter story, but it’s really a peer story. One of my six principles is embrace your peers. And I think far too many people have sharp elbows to peers because they think they’re climbing the ladder and they’ve got to beat these people. And the world’s just way too prosperous to have that mindset. You can learn so much and get so much value from co-climbing that you should definitely do that. And I think it’s not taught enough and people don’t do it enough, but Jimmy happened on these three people and they got on a Skype call, he said 20 hours a day and for years — Tim Ferriss: Sounds like Jimmy. Bill Gurley: For years, they shared best practices on this call, which apparently in that world, the color of the icon on the post you do on Instagram to send them to YouTube, like all these little bitty esoteric things can impact conversion. And he said when he was talking about this, that they all became millionaires. And he said, “If you or any random individual had been a fifth person on those calls, you would have too, because of that.” And it’s just a wonderful example of how peers — he on this podcast said something that was very clever. He took the 10,000 hours thing from Gladwell and said, “Well, there were four of us spending 10,000 hours and then sharing ideas so you get 40,000 hours of expertise.” Tim Ferriss: How would you suggest people who are not on YouTube where you can identify outliers perhaps, I shouldn’t say easily. In this day and age, I mean, it’s a sea of participants, but how should people go about seeking peers? And do you rank order your principles in a way, for instance, do you want to first check the box if you can of go where the action is and then embrace your peers because the level will be higher? I think about, for instance, my experience in Silicon Valley, it could have just as easily for something else been Nashville or New York City or who knows, Shanghai. I mean, it just depends on what you’re doing. The mentors, let’s just say like Mike Maples Jr., who taught me the very basic ropes of angel investing, he definitely, without him, I don’t go zero to one in terms of having any basic literacy or access. That was the first rung on the ladder. But then once I was in, you look at people who were, in a sense, just getting started at the time. I mean, holy shit, some of them have really exploded. I mean, they’ve all done really well. Kevin Rose, Naval, Chris Sacca. The remaining — I mean, the latter goes on forever, but 49 rungs after that initial step up, zero to one, it was all peer driven. And those guys, we were comparing notes the whole way. Bill Gurley: See, that’s the thing. I would say, first of all, I would practice it wherever you are. I would practice it virtually. I’d practice it locally. And if you can move to the epicenter, I’d practice it there. I don’t know that it’s an either or thing. You can have multiple groups of peers. You can have multiple circles of peers. But I think there’s only two tests, and one is trust. There are people in this world who view everything as a zero-sum game and they will elbow you out the first chance they can get. And so those shouldn’t be your peers. Those people you should quickly push to the side. Trust and then this shared interest in learning. And if they are equally learning on their own dime in their free time, which is my test for whether you actually truly are passionate about something, if they are doing that also, that’s perfect. And those experiences you’ve talked about, I’ve had so many of them myself, they get excited to tell you what they just learned, right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Yeah. Bill Gurley: Yeah. And then you reciprocate. And by the way, Mike’s a great example. I really have both a passion and a lot of respect for people that are writers in their industry, and Buffett did it and Howard Marks did it, who I benefited greatly from. I tried my entire career to write quite a bit, but Mike does this. Mike’s very — he’s a huge sharer when it comes to his knowledge about the subject matter and it’s so great — Tim Ferriss: He is. Yeah. Pattern Breakers is an excellent book also. Bill Gurley: So great. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Yeah, Mike, I’m hoping to see him again soon. It’s been a minute. We’ve talked about MrBeast, Bob Dylan. In both cases, like poor kids with nothing to lose, in a sense. Not in any destitute sense, but they’re starting at — Bill Gurley: It’s funny — Tim Ferriss: — futons and ramen, right? Bill Gurley: He was just interviewed at DealBook also, and his mother was in the front row who apparently works for him now. He was telling the story about when he went to tell her he was dropping out of college, similar to the McConaughey story, not quite as abrupt, or Jimmy’s being more abrupt, but of course she’s happy now. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it all worked out. I mean, there’s always a little survivorship bias, but — Bill Gurley: No doubt, no doubt. Tim Ferriss: But let’s talk about Danny Meyer because I want to give an example of someone who gave something up to then pursue X instead of A, B, or C. Could you say a little bit about Danny? I’ve interviewed him on the podcast. I might have met him through you. I don’t even remember how I initially connected with him, but who is Danny Meyer and what is this Genesis story of Danny Meyer, the restaurateur? Bill Gurley: It’s funny, when someone asks me who is Danny Meyer, I feel compelled the first thing to say he’s one of the most genuine humans on the planet. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, for sure. Bill Gurley: Just a wonderful human. Tim Ferriss: For sure. Bill Gurley: But he is also one of the most celebrated restaurateurs of our time. He was working for a company that sold these devices to clip onto clothes so you can’t steal them from a retail store, and he was making good money. He was making about $200,000 a year, and this is — Tim Ferriss: At the time. Bill Gurley: — 40 years ago. Tim Ferriss: Real money. Bill Gurley: Real, real money. And he had convinced himself he was going to be a lawyer. I guess a lot of people convinced themselves of that. And he was about to take the LSAT and he was out to dinner with his uncle and his uncle was probing him and probing him and, “Oh, yeah, he’s going to take the LSAT.” And I think his uncle sensed a lack of real conviction about this thing, this person, this human was going to do. And he literally said to him, “Why are you doing this? You know you want to be a restaurateur.” And when you read Danny’s book, he did spend a ton of time in his youth being fascinated with restaurants and to the point where he would take copious notes prior to even doing this. His family had a reason to know that he had this deep passion, but it’s interesting it’s an uncle. I don’t know that a parent is going to jump in and say that, and maybe that’s an advantage I have not knowing the readers of my book and giving him this permission to do things that aren’t necessarily pragmatic. But anyway, his uncle said, “You should start a restaurant.” And he took the test. He never submitted the scores to a university and very soon thereafter enrolled in some vocational restaurant courses and took a job. He took the first job you could get, which was a front office job at a restaurant that was making about a 10th the salary that he was making in the sales job. Tim Ferriss: And went on to Gramercy Tav — I mean, all these iconic restaurants, then Shake Shack, then I mean, just dot, dot, dot, dot, dot. Bill Gurley: Yeah, and we walked through in detail his path once he made this intention, and one of the variables that my co-writer and I were looking for as we added stories to the book was this moment of intentionality. We didn’t want people that fell into a job and were successful. We wanted people that had made a decision, usually a pivot to say, “I’m going to go do this now.” And once he had made that decision, not only did he take that job, but he took advantage of being in that restaurant to learn about the multiple functions, but then he set up a tour through Europe as a stage in multiple places where he’s working for free, basically. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I’m so glad you brought this up because I wouldn’t have brought it up myself, but I’ve run — this is going to relate in a second. I’ve run a bunch of competitions for, let’s just say, creating artwork for PDFs/free books I’m going to put out or whatever, and there’s always a big hubbub where folks get, some folks get very upset and they say, “Oh, you want people to work for free?” And I’m like, “Well, there’s going to be a winner.” It’s like, if you don’t want to participate, don’t participate. But there’s always this shaking of the fist like, “Ah, it’s so unfair. You want people to work, do work for free.” When I look at almost every example of someone who became the equivalent of Danny Meyer in their world, they did a lot that was unpaid, almost always. I’m sure there are exceptions, but staging is a great example in the restaurant world where it’s like, okay, you want to work at a restaurant where you’re going to have the highest density of learning and you don’t know shit? Guess what? They probably don’t want to pay you a whole lot because it’s actually going to be a bit of a drain on their resources to show you around and teach you how to work your station and do all this stuff. I would just encourage people to not be allergic to that. And the way I got, in a sense, my foot in the door in Silicon Valley was I volunteered at TiE, The Indus Entrepreneur. Bill Gurley: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. [inaudible 01:22:33]. Tim Ferriss: I volunteered with all of these nonprofit groups and quickly realized that most volunteers are doing the absolute minimum to be volunteers. And if you just do 10% more, it doesn’t take much. I would just refill people’s water glasses and stuff after I finished taking their tickets for an event. And suddenly the producers of this event who were also doing it, but had real jobs. I mean, I had a job at a college [inaudible 01:23:00] and I was working a lot. They were like, “Wow, this kid’s a go getter because he’s refilling these water glasses. Let’s give him more responsibility.” And that’s how I ended up connecting with all these speakers and everything, just did some stuff for free on the weekends. It didn’t take a lot. Bill Gurley: There’s a story in the book that’s actually hard to believe. We profiled this woman, Jen Atkins, who’s a hairstylist. It’s an incredible story, but the one anecdote, she’s rising in her career and things are starting to work and she has jobs and she’s getting paid. She would go to Fashion Week in Paris and sneak in the back door and volunteer to do the hair of the models on stage. Snuck in. Not supposed to be there, just to get reps with these top models in this environment. Tim Ferriss: Incredible. Bill Gurley: It sounds unfathomable that someone would do that. She did it multiple times. Tim Ferriss: And she did it. Bill Gurley: Yes. Tim Ferriss: What ended up happening after that? I don’t know her story. Bill Gurley: Oh, she’s become probably the most successful hairstylist of our time. It’s an incredible story. Tim Ferriss: How do you suggest people who are, maybe they’re doing A, B, and C right now, they’re listening to this and they just say, “All right, I want to take the leap. I want to do Z. I want to do whatever the off menu option is.” Bill Gurley: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: They might have to have a conversation with a parent. They might have to have a conversation with a spouse. They may have to have a conversation with who knows, whoever the most important people are in their lives. How might they approach that? And we’re going to talk about choosing paths in a second, because I do have a question about maybe how to sanity check yourself in the world of AI, but how do you suggest having those conversations? Do you moonlight for a while so it’s not either or? Do you time box it or make it time bound in a sense where you’re like, “Hey, just give me permission to try this for six months, a year, two years.” Bill Gurley: It’s interesting that I think any of those approaches is realistic. We profile Sal Khan in the book of Khan Academy and he told his wife he wanted to go try it for a year. He had also, he worked at a hedge fund just like Danny Meyer. He was making real money. Tim Ferriss: Wow. I didn’t realize that about Sal Khan. Wild. Bill Gurley: And started working with his cousins across the globe online doing these tutorial exercises and ended up posting a few on YouTube. They started working and he told his wife, “I really want to go tilt at this.” He didn’t even know what the business model was and he went and changed it. Look, I think the real test comes back to this passion element, or we use a lot of different words because passion’s been considered trite, but fascination, curiosity. If you have this deep desire to know so much about this one thing that that curiosity is so high, I think the odds that that’s not apparent to whoever these people are you’re trying to convince is pretty low. And if you can show that you’re — because if you’re going to tilt at something that hard and if you’re going to really differentiate yourself by being that learned in that field, I think it’d be hard for someone to tell you not to go do it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: It’s not going to be easy. I don’t want anyone to think that, “Oh, just read this book and magic happens.” It requires effort. And that’s why this test matters so much, this test of whether you would learn about this thing on your free time. Tim Ferriss: And maybe are you already learning about this? Bill Gurley: Are you already learning about it on your free time? Tim Ferriss: Right. Bill Gurley: Yes. No doubt. Tim Ferriss: At least have one — Bill Gurley: You should be. You should be. I doubt you’re going to turn it on. Tim Ferriss: — data point based on history. Bill Gurley: Yeah. Well, actually, I have an example of someone who just turned it on. We have a chapter called Never Too Late, which is where the [inaudible 01:27:32] thing is because that happened when he was close to 40. Another local Austinite, Bert Tito Beveridge started his endeavor in the spirit business. Tim Ferriss: So wild, I was just thinking about him while I was driving here for no good reason. Bill Gurley: At the age of 40. Tim Ferriss: All right. Bill Gurley: He’s watching a PBS special. This is also hard to believe. He’s watching a PBS special. And back probably when there were only four channels or whatever, but they said on the screen, they said, “Take a blank sheet of paper, draw a line down it, put what you love to do on the left and what you’re really good at on the right. Just a list of those things and then contemplate what might be in the middle.” And he had studied chemistry and a lot of stuff and he liked going out to bars and socializing. And he was making flavored vodka as Christmas presents in his spare time. Tim Ferriss: What was his day job? Bill Gurley: His first career was in seismetology and the oil field and that dragged him to South America. And then when that became dangerous, both in Midland and in South America, he became a mortgage broker. Tim Ferriss: Okay. Bill Gurley: But he didn’t love either. He didn’t love either of them. But the reason I brought it up when you said, “already.” I don’t know that he was already studying the spirit business, but once he made that intentionality to go do this, then he studied it writ large. Tim Ferriss: How did he start, just out of curiosity? Because I was just thinking about him. He just acquired — well, Tito Beveridge just acquired Lala Tequila, which I was involved with. Bill Gurley: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: That’s probably why he popped to mind. But how did he start? Bill Gurley: He first started by just studying the distilling process writ large, like read everything he possibly could. And then it turns out there were no distilleries in the state of Texas and there were laws on the books that made it nearly impossible. So then he had to study that and literally rewrite regulation to make it possible. Interestingly, he did the whole thing on credit cards, so he owns 100% of the business, which is a huge business. It’s the single largest spirit sold in America today. Tim Ferriss: I didn’t realize that. Bill Gurley: Yes. Tim Ferriss: I didn’t realize it was that big. Bill Gurley: It’s huge. Tim Ferriss: Wow. Good for him. Bill Gurley: Yes. Tim Ferriss: That’s so wild. So wild. So I promised to get to this and I do want to get to it. Are there any sanity checks that you would put in place to compliment the fascination/obsession/what I’m doing in my spare time or would pay to do or do for free? Because I’m wondering if there are any things you would take off the table or how you would hone that given the rapidly developing technology of AI. So if someone said, “What I love to do in my spare time is copy editing.” I might not suggest that they throw caution to the wind and burn the ships and go into copy editing. Any thoughts? Because this is something that is — Bill Gurley: Well, the first thing I would note is that many of those pragmatic jobs that the well-intentioned parents have been pushing their children towards are at risk. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, for sure. Bill Gurley: So comp-sci. Tim Ferriss: Right. Yeah, risky, but as compared to what? Bill Gurley: Comp-sci went from being the most least risky major you could possibly get to one that’s somewhat risky overnight. And so that’d be my first notion. And the second thing I would add to that, which I already said is, no matter what your endeavor is, you need to be playing with this tool. It’s a modern tool. It’s the equivalent of a laptop and Microsoft Word was, it’s equivalent of what a calculator was. You don’t want to go out in the world and play without the modern tool set. It’s a part of what you need. If you’re playing with those things and you’re curious, you know where the edge is of whatever you’re passionate about and what the technology’s capable of. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So in order to find that edge and follow that edge, which will move, you have to be playing with the tools. Bill Gurley: And look, I think in any field, one thing I love to suggest on the learning side is, know the history and know the new innovative edge. If you bring both of those things to the table, you are highly compelling. That could be true even if you’re not chasing your dream job. Even if you’re just a marketing major, if you walk into an interview at Clorox and you can simultaneously show that you’ve studied all the historical best marketers and you also understand how TikTok works, that’s heavily differentiating in that interview. Like you’re going to get the job, I would argue, versus someone else, if you can portray those things. Tim Ferriss: How would you apply that here? Is that just, I guess, field dependent or are you referring to AI? Bill Gurley: No. Yeah. Well, I think AI is the leading edge of almost any industry. So yeah, I’m saying you should just study what it’s capable of. Look, the thing that LLMs are most capable of, it’s a large language model. The language type stuff, like your copy editing example, things that were just rote moving words around, yeah, it’s really good at that stuff. But it doesn’t mean that you can’t be the person that really understands what it’s capable of and then superpower yourself to go attack a particular interest. The other thing, you had started a question by saying warnings. I think there are a lot of fields where talent really does matter. I don’t know that I can make you a singer or I certainly can’t make you an NBA basketball player, but in all those fields, whether it be Hollywood or sports or even Danny Meyer at one time thought he was going to be a chef and he just became a restaurateur. He wasn’t a chef. I would say that for any artistic field, there are way more jobs that support those artists than there are the jobs of the artist. Tim Ferriss: What do you mean by that? Bill Gurley: I mean, we have an example in the book of a Hollywood agent and that individual had not thought about a job in Hollywood when they were growing up because they felt they couldn’t act. So they’re like, “Oh, I can’t go do that.” But there’s tons of jobs — Tim Ferriss: I see what you’re saying. Bill Gurley: — in Hollywood that aren’t — Tim Ferriss: Within the sector of entertainment. Bill Gurley: — that aren’t the talent itself. So if you’re passionate about basketball or you’re passionate about the chef example of a restaurant, like there’s tons of jobs you can go do, music industry, without being that particular person. Tim Ferriss: This makes me think of an interview I was watching recently, Patrick O’Shaughnessy, Invest With The Best. He was interviewing Ari Emanuel, so famous super agent, force of nature. His whole family is just like, they’re drinking different water. I don’t know what’s going on there. But he has raised a ton of money to invest in live events, sports and so on as an anti-AI or maybe AI anti-fragile bet, right? And there are lots of ways to make money when you raise a lot of money. So putting that aside, any other AI resilient or anti-AI bets that you think are interesting outside of live events, live sports? Bill Gurley: I think a lot of the service industries, I think humans enjoy experiences and I don’t think that changes personally that much. And so restaurateurs or hoteliers, I think all those things are going to thrive and people that know how to really differentiate experiences in that way, I think are — I personally doubt that — I don’t share this thought that we’re all going to go watch movies that we’ve imagined that are made just for ourselves. I find that hard to believe. I think people enjoy great art in many different forms. They enjoy talking about it and they enjoy the community element of having seen the same thing. And so it may be that if you’re a movie maker, you’re using AI instead of this expensive CGI tool set, but I think the storytelling and the imagination and the writing, I think all those things will still be real. I really do. And obviously just general business, entrepreneurship. I took my dad, who’s 93, fly-fishing in Montana this summer and we were at a lodge and one of the other guests that was staying there is a 28-year-old entrepreneur from the tip of Texas down near Corpus Christi area. And he had started three or four businesses and was well off, like I’m not saying — but he was so enamored with AI. He said, “And then I needed this, and then it did this, and then I needed this, and then I did this. And then I wanted to know where to put the next one of these. And I just ask it, where would you put it in the city? And it immediately gave me answers.” This guy was already successful, but he was running triple speed because he had tipped into this stuff and he was learning what was possible because he had an open mind towards it solving problems. And I thought, “Holy shit, if other people just leaned at it the way he’s leaning at it, they would become super powered themselves.” I was really blown away by that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. This makes me think of Kevin Rose. Kevin Rose is spending the vast majority of his free time playing with all these tools, vibe coding, using them endlessly. And I feel like that is probably over the next few weeks where I need to put some more time and just take a layup with wherever it happens to intersect with someplace that makes it easy to apply. Who’s Sam Hinkie? Bill Gurley: Sam Hinkie is a gentleman that about, I don’t know, six years ago became maybe the youngest GM in the history of the NBA. He became the general manager of the Philadelphia 76ers. Tim Ferriss: Why is his story relevant? Bill Gurley: He was a amazing student. He grew up in Oklahoma. His father worked for Halliburton. He made good grades, good students, kind of classic, did everything right, became a consultant. I think he was working for McKinsey, and they moved him to Australia. And he’s sitting there and he’s reading other things in his spare time. He’s not reading about how to be a better consultant. And he reads a book called Moneyball, which we all know of, the Michael Lewis book about the Oakland A’s. And in almost what seems like an instant decided, “I really need to be in sports analytics.” And I mentioned that a lot of the stories we found have this intentionality. So that book, just like The Last Laugh did for Seinfeld, that book told him, “I’m going to go do this.” And from the day he read that book to getting the job as the head of GM of the 76ers was about 10 years. So no experience whatsoever in the field to youngest GM of all time in 10 years. Tim Ferriss: Was he obsessed with sports already at that point? Bill Gurley: I think so. He played — this gets back to what I said about maybe your original obsession came from participating or being the talent, but then he’s not particularly big. And so yeah, he was successful in high school, but there was no path to keep going down that field. So yeah, he had immense passion for the category, but had never imagined himself in the field in one of these other roles until that book disinhibited him and gave him permission to think, “Well, you know what? I could be differentiated on this dimension, on this dimension of understanding analytics.” He immediately was applying to business school, and he used that as a pivot point. For those that have the needs and the resources, I think in MBA programs can be a great place to switch careers and go chase a different dream. And there’s a great interesting anecdote in the book where he’s trying to decide between Harvard and Stanford, which is a choice for most humans [inaudible 01:41:42]. Tim Ferriss: Quality problem. Bill Gurley: Yeah, exactly. But he went and told them both what he wanted to do and Harvard basically said, “Well, we don’t really have any programs like that.” And Stanford, to give Stanford a lot of credit, said, “You know what? That’s super interesting. We have this person associated with the school that does this. We’ll introduce you to these four people.” And were a lot like McConaughey’s dad when Sam brought them that challenge. Tim Ferriss: Sounds about right. That checks out for me. Bill Gurley: Yeah. Based on what you know of the two institutions. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: Yeah. And then he just started, he ended up meeting Michael Lewis because he was in the Bay Area and some of the Stanford people knew Michael. And so he talked to the guy that wrote the book that inspired him. He hustled his ass off. I don’t want to make it sound like — he kind of built his own curriculum, but it worked. Tim Ferriss: For people who are not going to get an MBA, would you still suggest everyone read the first three chapters of Michael Porter’s Competitive Strategy Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors? Bill Gurley: Unquestionably. Tim Ferriss: All right. Just wanted to — Bill Gurley: Anyone that’s going to do anything in business should read that book. Tim Ferriss: All right. I wanted to give the throwback to our first conversation. Bill Gurley: By the way, at the back of the book, it lists about 50 books. At the very end. Tim Ferriss: Just to whet the appetite? Bill Gurley: Well, I think you did the same thing. I’ve gone through your — Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah. Oh, no. Bill Gurley: In fact, I looked at yours for the structure when I wanted to see how to lay it out. Tim Ferriss: Oh, amazing. Amazing. I want to get your expansion on avoiding false failures. Let me explain what I mean by that. So there’s this expression, if you do what you love, you’ll never work a day in your life. Bill Gurley: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Right? Bill Gurley: It’s in my note. Tim Ferriss: But my experience has been, it’s not always fun, even if you’re doing what you love. Sometimes there’s burnout. Sometimes you go through chapters where things do feel like a grind. I mean, maybe I’m an outlier, but that’s been my experience. When I realized, for instance, in the case of the podcast, it’s like, “Wow, I have much more sponsor demand than I could ever fill. If I just doubled the number of episodes, I’d double the number of revenue. So why don’t I do that?” And it started to feel like a bad job. Not a bad job. Bill Gurley: I get it. Tim Ferriss: It’s still a great job, but the volume was too high. And I can imagine if people take the expression I just mentioned, if you love what you do, you’ll never work a day in your life. They pursue X, whatever that is, the songwriting and the performing in the case of Bob Dylan, Danny Meyer, whatever it might be. And then they hit a really hard stretch. Maybe it’s early on, maybe it’s later, maybe they’re [inaudible 01:44:46] and some French guy yelling at them. Bill Gurley: Yeah certainly. Tim Ferriss: It’s the case with a friend of mine. And they’re like, “Wow, God, this really feels painful. Maybe this isn’t my path.” How do you distinguish between growing pains that are temporary and an indication that you’re not doing the right thing? Bill Gurley: Yeah. It’s funny. I’ll take a short diversion in answering the question. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Long diversions. Bill Gurley: Because people often ask me, “How do you use AI?” When I was wrapping up the book, my publisher and editor said, “I want you to write the concluding chapter.” And I wrote what I think most people would do, which is I just summarized the whole book and I submitted it to him and he said, “No, this is no good.” And so then I went to ChatGPT deep research mode and I said, “Tell me about the 10 best nonfiction concluding chapters that you know of.” And it went and did like a 20-page report and sent it to me. And what I noticed in reading that was that most of these great concluding chapters were orthogonal. They weren’t a summary. They were a different take on the whole thing. Well, my concluding chapter is now titled It Ain’t Easy, to your point. And I went through all of the stories that we have in the book and I pulled out the darkest hour moments for each one of those people and included it at the end, because I didn’t want to leave people with the impression that it’s just all smiles and babies and hugs. I don’t think that’s true in any field. And I guess my answer would be, do you still feel this natural curiosity to learn the entire time? Is the impediment something that truly means you should stop like, “I can’t get around it. I can’t…” Or is it something that maybe can be avoided, something I can get around? I push heavily on the peer thing because one of the things a peer group can do is help you in those moments, both just from emotional support, but also to put perspective on whatever this speed bump is and whether it’s insurmountable or not. Mentors can help with that too, but I think peers are better for that because you worry about being judged in disclosing this. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, 100%. Bill Gurley: And so peers don’t judge. That’s why that trust thing really matters also, another reason why it matters. And they can help you. I think they can help you determine whether that is as big a blocker as it may seem like. But there’s going to be some of that in any field. I don’t think there’s any run that’s just without paying. Tim Ferriss: I’m also imagining that one of the challenges that I had and some of my friends had at different points in pursuing, fill in the blank, starting our first companies, just beginning to invest, having a career in X, right? When I got out of college, it was mass data storage and hitting these really rough patches and feeling like you’re the first person in the world to experience this and it’s because of your unique flaws or uniquely bad decisions. And I’m just realizing now, I haven’t tried this, I’m sure it would work, that you could just describe the dark chapter you’re going through into ChatGPT or one of these tools and say, “Can you give me any comparable examples from other people who have succeeded in other fields?” Bill Gurley: I’m sure that’ll work. It’ll also give you five answers on how to deal with it, how to get around it. Tim Ferriss: How to deal with it. Bill Gurley: But by the way, one thing that’s important when we’re talking about this is, Daniel Pink has this great book on regret, and he talks about it as a valid motivator to get you to make good decisions. And there is a reality that that anxiety you may feel may mean you’re not in the right lane. And so when you were at that sales job, you got to the point where you’re like, “Holy shit, I don’t want to be doing this anymore.” And I had two careers before I became a VC, one as an engineer and one as a sell-side analyst. I enjoyed both. I think I was good at both, but I reached a point about three years in with each where I was like, “I don’t want to do this the rest of my life.” And so I would say, equally with like, don’t give up too early, but if the signal is really telling you, I don’t want to do this the rest of my life, jump out. That’s the precise moment to move on and try something new. And I spend a ton of time in the early chapters trying to get people to understand that’s okay. Most people don’t end up in a career that their major was. I think one of the reasons people grind too long is because they think they’re supposed to. They just think they’re supposed to stay in this lane they’re in. Tim Ferriss: How did you conclude it was time to hop in those cases? We don’t have to go into tons of the background because we talked about so much of your history and decisions and so on, including, I don’t want to say stealing palm pilots, but it’s a pretty good story about getting a palm pilot with contact information. But was it just a gut feeling? Was it a disquiet that you felt in your system or was it more than that? Bill Gurley: I’m sure I’ve overplayed it in my brain, but they feel like very concrete moments where I had almost near certainty. The first one was, I started my third project at Compact Computer Corporation where I was an engineer and the projects were these computers we were releasing and the third one was another computer with a little faster clock speed and a better Intel chip, but the rest of it was all the same and we were going to do it again. I’m like, “That doesn’t seem that interesting to me.” And I’d become curious about other things. So when I was doing external learning, which is what I refer to as this kind of spare time learning, it wasn’t that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Right. Bill Gurley: It was something else. I was reading Peter Lynch’s book on stocks and stuff like that. Tim Ferriss: Right. Segue to the sell-side analyst. Bill Gurley: Yes. The thing that happened as a sell-side analyst, and and I may parlay this into something from the Daniel Pink book, but this notion of, do you want to do this the rest of your life? The sell-side job is wonderful. You get access so early in your life to so many amazing people, but you have to work really hard. And this classic thing where you’re in your 20s and you’re working on Wall Street, they serve dinner at the office. The cafeteria is open, that’ll tell you something. And it was like 10:30 or 11:00 PM and the entire research department was on the 36th floor of Park Avenue Plaza and I did a loop. The four corner offices were the most senior analysts. And for whatever reason, I popped my head in each of their office and they were career sell-side analysts. I said, “Do I want to be this person when I’m 60?” It just stuck in my head. I went to the next one, went to the next one. Hopefully — I don’t know who those people were, but I was like, “No, I don’t.” Like that night, I made the decision that I got to go do something else. Tim Ferriss: No, it’s one of — Bill Gurley: If you don’t mind. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, fire away. Bill Gurley: In Daniel Pink’s book, he talks a lot about boldness regrets. And this is where I say, “Do you want to do this for the rest of your life?” He says, “One of the most robust findings in the academic research and my own is that over time we are much more likely to regret the chances we didn’t take than the chances we did.” What haunts us is the inaction itself. Foregone opportunities all linger in the same way.” And he says that they’ve studied this across China, Russia, Japan, it’s common across all of them. And you may have heard of this YouTube video where Bezos talks about his regret minimization framework. And so he had the same thing. He’s walking around Central Park, “Should I stay in this incredible job at D.E. Shaw,” where he’s making tons of money, “or should I take this flyer on this online bookstore I want to do?” And he put it in his mind that test, which is when I’m 80 and looking back, am I going to regret not doing this? Tim Ferriss: Well, it makes me think of, and this is also a dicey proposition quoting Niccolo Machiavelli, but, “Make mistakes of ambition, not mistakes of sloth.” Bill Gurley: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Right? Bill Gurley: It’s the same thing. Tim Ferriss: And I do think about that a lot myself. I mean, I’m at a point where I’m trying to figure out what my next chapter is too, because this podcasting game’s getting pretty crowded. Bill Gurley: It is. Tim Ferriss: And I still enjoy doing it, but that’s only because I refuse to play by the incentives that the platforms and algorithms provide, which is economically punishing, but intellectually rewarding. Bill Gurley: Because you’ve had two successful careers as, not just a podcaster and influencer, but as an angel investor, I would encourage you to read Arthur Brooks’ book, Strength to Strength. Tim Ferriss: I did. I did. It was great. Bill Gurley: Okay. You already read it? Tim Ferriss: It was great. It was great. Bill Gurley: I think it gives great perspective for a later career shift. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I should go back and look at my notes from that book again. So let’s chat for a second. People should all check this out. I mean, you’re such an operator. Track record’s incredible. Runnin’ Down a Dream: How to Succeed and Thrive in a Career You Love, we’ll talk about that again. We’ll mention it again at the end. What do you want to do after this book? I mean, you can’t sit on your hands very long. Bill Gurley: No. And as I mentioned, when I made the decision to stop the venture career, which I think we talked about on the last podcast — Tim Ferriss: A little bit, yeah. Bill Gurley: — where I read the Steve Martin book. But I didn’t know. I knew I wanted to do something else. And I went on a listening tour and I talked to all these people that had — Tim Ferriss: Can you just reiterate what a listening tour is? Bill Gurley: Oh, I identified several people who had successfully—retired is a strong word—but made a decision to stop doing a job they were very successful at. And then what do you do now? It’s similar to the Arthur Brooks book, but it was just a personal life. A lot of people angel invest, a lot of people go on boards, a lot of people manage their own money. I had this list that people teach and I slowly was checking them off. Tim Ferriss: Just crossing out, yeah. Bill Gurley: Scratch them out, yeah. I don’t really want to manage my own money. I don’t really want to angel invest. I don’t want to start my own venture firm. I’ve done that. I found myself crossing them all off and I couldn’t discover something that got me excited and tied into this what are you doing with your external learning thing. Slowly, I’ve come around to an idea that I made up. It’s not a career that other people have, but I think I’d like to start a policy institute. I’ve come up with a name P3, which stands for Purpose, Progress, and Prosperity. When I was doing the BG2 podcast, which I recently stepped away from, we did a episode at the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Facility. Before I did that episode, I spent three or four weeks calling everyone I knew to make sure that I was prepared for that. That was one of our more successful episodes and I just really enjoyed that. I look at the shifting mindset around the globe on nuclear energy in the past five years as an example of what’s possible with really great policy work. It wasn’t one person. I think the fact that Steve Pinker was banging the drum was super important, but Andreessen and Elon and all these people started pounding that same drum. Joe Gebbia’s wife made this a big life passion project of hers. But it’s shocking how quick we went from, “This stuff’s bad,” to, “Oh, no, we made a mistake. It’s actually good.” That could have a powerful impact on the planet. I don’t know how many of those type things there are to find. I don’t want to go grind on state by state legislation. I don’t have any interest in that. But looking at big problems, looking at US-China relations, US healthcare system has some massive problems. Can you come up with ideas that help shift these things? I’ve already got to know some really innovative professors who are thinking in very innovative ways and I look to use my financial capabilities to do grant writing through people like that and see what we can go do, see what we can go change. Regulatory capture is another one that I’ve spent time tilting at. Tim Ferriss: If you’re not doing this state by state legislative change, what does the work of P3 potentially look like? What is policy work? I know that seems like a silly question but — Bill Gurley: We’re at day one, but I’ll give you — Tim Ferriss: What might it look like? Bill Gurley: Yeah, here’s an example. A professor approached me on the regulatory capture front. “What if we put — Tim Ferriss: Could you define that just for people who didn’t hear episode one? Bill Gurley: Yeah. There’s a Nobel Prize winner from the University of Chicago named George Stigler. He’s passed away but who made the very strong argument that regulation is the friend of the incumbent, that large businesses learn how to lobby Washington. No matter how well intention the policy is that’s passed, it ends up benefiting the incumbent more than restricting the incumbent. He won a Nobel Prize for that work. I gave a speech at the All-In Summit that you can go watch on YouTube. It has five million views on this topic, but I think this happens in the majority of the time rather than — anyway, this — Tim Ferriss: That’s why ACH takes three days to clear, right? Bill Gurley: Yes, yes, yes, yes, but stablecoin may solve that. But this professor approached me about making maybe a global database that scores countries on how captured they are and that identifies the best practices from the countries that have the best scores. That kind of thing, like investing in that type of data and transparency, is pretty compelling to me. That’s an example of what I might go do. Tim Ferriss: Well, let me chew on that for a second. Let’s say you create this data set that presents these scores on a country by country basis. What are the hoped for outcomes of that? That countries that have worse scores start to model the countries with better scores? Certainly, there might be talent flight from one place to another. I mean, we already see that in some respects. I mean, that’s not purely regulatory capture determined, but when you share that data, what would the hope be? Bill Gurley: The hope would be that you can shine a light on the best practices and try to get those implemented — Tim Ferriss: In other places. Bill Gurley: — here in the US. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: That would be the hope. Also, I think just shining a light on them is — I’ll give you an example that relates to regulatory capture. After you’ve been a senator or congressman for a while, you get invited onto committees. The minute you’re on a committee, you are in charge of regulation that affects different industries. I don’t even know if most humans know this. What happens is your local senator or your local congressman who you think is representing your district now starts raising money nationally. They go around and meet with businesses because they’re on that committee and have influence and they’re raising money nationally. I think that’s ridiculous personally. You could imagine restrictions against that, transparency towards it. If your congressman represents this zip code in Austin, wouldn’t you want to know if they’re raising money in Minnesota? Isn’t that a little unusual? Tim Ferriss: Well, you shared a story last time we spoke about being asked to raise a hundred grand in donations just to get a meeting with a Congress. Bill Gurley: Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yeah. Our mutual friend, Rich Barton, talks about shining flashlights in dark places. This technology that we have access to should — I think donations should be on the blockchain, quite frankly. There’s no reason why this information needs to be in the dark. I think there’s a lot of opportunity around data aggregation. Tim Ferriss: Any other ideas that are percolating? Bill Gurley: I’m enamored by state versus state competition. Part of it pops into my brain from the China experience and the provincial competition, but you see Newsom and Abbott fighting back and forth, and maybe there can be a positive outcome from this. I think some of the Federalist Papers envisioned that different states could try different experiments and we could see what happens as a result of that. Tim Ferriss: We’re seeing some of it with Texas and Arizona. Bill Gurley: We are seeing something. I think it could be pretty interesting and provocative and could lead to positive change. I have this dream that some state, and maybe this state that we’re sitting in that has a surplus, would do something crazy with teacher salaries. What if a state just all of a sudden said, “We’re going to pay 50% more for teachers”? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: Think about the dynamic that would create. It’d be pretty wild. Tim Ferriss: It would be. Bill Gurley: Maybe I’ll go tilt it that one, too. Tim Ferriss: So other problems on your mind — well, I’ll just present a list here from some prep notes. We have US healthcare, regulatory capture, intellectual property, US-China, fairness and financial markets, US K-12. Could you speak to intellectual property and fairness in financial markets, how you might be thinking about those? Bill Gurley: I’ve got to be a top 10,000% supporter of open source. This gets back to Ridley’s book, The Rational Optimist, but he talks about prosperity comes when ideas have sex. Just the sharing of information, in my mind, should be free, that it shouldn’t cost anything. It’s very unclear to me that the patent system actually adds value. I’m quite doubtful that the human mind wouldn’t innovate if it didn’t come with a 17-year financial protection. I’m doubtful of that. I think there’s great scientists at every university working on problems that aren’t necessarily being patented. Your ability for hyper competition and innovation is so much higher when there aren’t restrictions in place. Anyway, I think the world’s a better place when ideas are shared and not protected. Tim Ferriss: Since the system we’re working with is the system we’re currently working with, how might something like drug development work without patent protection? Bill Gurley: Well, here’s an interesting thing. The NIH gives out $40 billion a year and a lot of that money goes to companies that end up getting venture capital backing. Tim Ferriss: I’ve had some very open fights with people about this. Bill Gurley: Yeah. Why doesn’t an NIH grant come with an open source rider? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: Yeah. If the VCs want to fund — Tim Ferriss: With federal funding, yeah. Bill Gurley: Yeah, it’s federal funding. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I agree with that. Bill Gurley: Right now, there’s a big fight over whether just their research papers have to go on non-private networks instead of the private ones they’re on today. I mean, they just want the information out there. That’s a minor step I would consider a major step. You don’t have to take the money, but why is the US government giving people money that ends up becoming proprietary inventions? That makes no sense to me. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Whether it’s the US government or individual philanthropists or foundations. I mean, on some level, if that, then at some point — right. I agree with that, but are there industries that — I mean, the only one that first came to mind was drug development where the R&D costs are so high. Bill Gurley: They all cry. The VCs will tell you, “It’ll never work. No one will have any incentive if we don’t have a 17-year protection.” The entire Silicon Valley — Tim Ferriss: I’m not saying I believe that. Bill Gurley: I know. I’ve lived in a world where if someone comes into our office and talks about patents, we roll our eyes because none of the types of businesses that we’ve backed at Benchmark in Silicon Valley are ever about patents. Elon has famously open sourced all his Tesla patents. It’s such a bold thing to do and so gracious, I think, really to society, but his point is — oddly, I was talking to Ted Cruz about this and he said, “Yeah, Elon thinks the same thing.” He views the edge of competition is how fast are you moving, how great are your products, the consumers love them, not, “Can I defend them in a court of law?” The protection that the drug guys get is so much — no one can really use software patents to get protection, an algorithm, or something. No one even tries. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: But with drugs, if I have this particular genome sequence, all of a sudden I get this huge proprietary window in the market. It’s just nutty. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. This is not exactly the same thing, but, I mean, what a service to humanity. I was just watching — I think the documentary name, people can watch it for free on YouTube and other places, The Thinking Game, about DeepMind and Demis and his team really seeing AlphaFold. I mean, all the structures of these proteins, I mean, it’s just like, oh, my God, what an incredible resource for humanity. Bill Gurley: Well, there’s an interesting example right there. The original paper they wrote was open source and OpenAI doesn’t exist without that discovery, which happened at Google in an open source. They just exploited it the fastest. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, wild. Bill Gurley: And by the way, I mean, not to divert too much back, but right now China has 10 open source AI models that are all in hyper competition with each other. That is a dangerously effective primordial soup for innovation compared to what we have here. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I mean, I should probably know this, but I don’t, how does China handle — what are the policies around and laws around intellectual property, patents, things like that? Bill Gurley: Well, interestingly, I found a document online that someone had put together a PowerPoint about the history of open source at China and it’s 20 years old. It’s not like they just stumbled into it. Go back 20 years ago, one of the primary criticisms of China was that they stole IP. If you’re the Chinese government and there’s this new thing called open source, you’re going to embrace it because there’s no fault there because everyone’s sharing and everyone — If you look at the big open source projects, Linux, MySQL, and you go on the webpages, you’ll see Alibaba, Tencent — these companies have been supporting these technologies for a while. Every five years, they write this five year plan, the Chinese government puts it out. Five years ago, they had a huge section on open source. They’re clearly suggesting to the entrepreneurs that the government favors that approach. Going back to Ridley’s book and the notion of pure competition, I think the society — Tim Ferriss: This is The Rational Optimist? Bill Gurley: Yeah, I think the society benefits from that. I use this example. Imagine there’s two feudal societies that are all agricultural based. There’s two of them, though. And in one, once a week the farmers come to market and just trade goods and then they leave. And the other one, the farmers come to market and they’re required to share their best practices with everybody else and then they leave. Going back to this peer example in the book, that one’s going to be much more performant than the other one. This gets to Ridley’s point about ideas having sex. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I mean, open source also, we talked about this a decent amount in our last conversation, but it can be used as an incredible strategy or counterpunch from for-profit companies like Android. I mean, my God, I mean, it’s like you can do a lot. It’s an incredibly powerful tool. Bill Gurley: I think that using open source as a defensive tool instead of an offensive tool is one of the most sophisticated corporate strategies a company can possibly do. It’s very hard to do because it goes against all of your instincts. But I would suggest that Amazon and Apple and maybe Meta who has toyed with it should run at the idea of jointly supporting an open source model. I don’t think they’re doing it, but I think they should, because their incumbency is at risk if someone else has a massive proprietary advantage. Tim Ferriss: Fairness in financial markets, what does that mean? Bill Gurley: I’ve been tilting against this insider’s game of the IPO market for some time and I’m very passionate that when you bring a company public — Tim Ferriss: Does that come with the luxury of retirement or — Bill Gurley: Maybe. I mean, yeah, if you tilt against the investment banks, you got to be comfortable not going to conferences, that’s for sure. They owe some really nice funds. You fall off the invite real quick. But the way that an IPO’s price is so God awful stupid, they pick who gets the stock and they pick the price. I’ve said it over and over again, but a freshman comp size student and a freshman finance student, if you told them to design the IPO, they would just match supply and demand anonymously. It’s how every bond is priced. It’s interestingly how every initial coin offering works. I’ve become a late to the game crypto enthusiast because I’m so sick of this damn IPO process being broken. Tim Ferriss: Could you say a bit more about how it’s broken? Just walk us through a hypothetical example of why it’s broken. Bill Gurley: Yeah. When a company’s coming public, the bankers — literally, they ask everyone for orders, but then they pick who gets the stock and they pick the price. They don’t let supply and demand pick. Supply and demand can automagically pick the allocation and the price. Automagically is the wrong word, can algorithmically. This is super easy. It’s not hard. Tim Ferriss: Why don’t they do it that way? Bill Gurley: Because they’re handing free money to their clients. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, there we go. That’s what I was looking for. Bill Gurley: Yeah. No, it’s been known for a long time. I uncovered an email from 1999 at Goldman Sachs, which I’ve posted on Twitter several times where they’re like saying, “Oh, we can use this hot stock to reward our top clients.” They know what’s going on. The fact that the SEC doesn’t get involved really bothers me, but this tokenization thing is a real way to get around it because the crypto community’s already decided to use algoriththms to allocate and determine price. The price and the allocation should just be determined. It’s how direct listing work. Everyone knows how to do it. They just don’t do it. It’s horrible. But there’s other things too in this category. The long prevalence of Visa and MasterCard is just ridiculous, 2.5%, and stablecoins have so much momentum right now. I think those two companies are going to be in real trouble within a five-year window. Most of the financial problems are pure regulatory capture, like the reason that there’s a problem. Tim Ferriss: Tell me if I’m explaining this well, because I’m not sure we said this directly, but basically the incumbents help to write laws and regulations that favor them and prevent newcomers from competing effectively. Bill Gurley: After ’09, we wrote this thing Dodd-Frank and we thought, “Oh, we’re going to make things better,” and all you’ve had is consolidation and banking since then. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: If you look at the offering, especially at the low end for the poorest citizens of the US, free checking went away. The poor people have a hard time paying their bills, so they don’t even have the tools to do it because free checking went away. Free checking went away after Dodd-Frank. Tim Ferriss: Right. Just to please push back if I’m oversimplifying this, but the regulatory capture is not just bad for startups in Silicon Valley who hope to grow and disrupt and fill in the blank, it’s also bad for everybody. Bill Gurley: Oh, it’s horrible for consumers. I mean, the US healthcare situation, which seems to be getting worse on a daily basis, is a huge example of regulatory cap. Somewhere in the past 10 years, they just told physicians they can’t run hospitals. They just eliminated probably — I mean, who other than a doctor is going to go start a new hospital? The amount of competition you eliminated in this one swoop is enormous, just enormous. That’s just a single example, but there’s hundreds of them in that area. Tim Ferriss: What would success be for this book? Six months after it comes out, what will lead you to have been happy with putting the time in? It’s taken a while. It’s taken a lot of work. What do you hope the outcome will be? Bill Gurley: It really started as a passion project and I have no financial goals for whatsoever. In fact, as we get to book launch, I’m going to launch a foundation that gives grants to people who want to chase their dream job but don’t have the financial wherewithal to do it. I’m going to start working on that in addition to P3. For me, it’s all about how many people do I affect in the way that McConaughey’s dad did or that this book did for Seinfeld. Some of them saw the talk on YouTube from the UT presentation that I gave and I’ve already reached out and said thank you and they’ve shared how it changed their life. But the more people I can do that for, I will just be tickled pink. I’d just be so excited, because I think when people get out of this pragmatic lane and go do these types of things, they tend to be unusually successful, which I think then has a bigger impact than just on them themselves. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, for sure. Bill Gurley: The number of humans positively impacted by Danny Meyer’s success is in the thousands, I’m certain. Tim Ferriss: Oh, for sure. Bill Gurley: And I’m not counting customers of Shake Shack. Tim Ferriss: People, check it out. I mean, I love your writing, Bill. You’re not just a commentator. You’ve been an operator. You’ve observed a lot of operators, studied outliers, and people who’ve chosen X instead of A, B, or C. The book is Runnin’ Down a Dream: How to Thrive in a Career You Actually Love.

Title: Bitcoin’s volatility below Nvidia in 2025 as investor base grew: Bitwise
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-less-volatile-nvidia-in-2025-as-its-investor-base-diversified-bitwise
Time Published: 2025-12-18T03:40:52Z
Full Content:
Bitwise predicted Bitcoin's volatility will stay below Nvidia's in 2026, citing institutional adoption and ETFs as drivers of the asset’s maturation. Bitcoin’s volatility appears to be diminishing, with its movements in 2025 more subdued than those of Nvidia (NVDA), which Bitwise says indicates its investor base is diversifying. Bitwise said on Wednesday that Bitcoin (BTC) will continue to be less volatile than Nvidia in 2026 as “Bitcoin’s volatility has steadily declined over the past ten years.” It added that the shift signals a “derisking” of the asset as its investor base has diversified due to the emergence of institutional investment products. Bitcoin has seen a 68% price change from its lowest level this year, when it fell to $75,000 in April, to its highest level, which was the all-time high of $126,000 in early October. Comparatively, Nvidia has seen more volatility with a 120% price swing from a low of $94 in early April to a 2025 high of $207 in late October. Shares in the chip giant have also outperformed Bitcoin this year and are up 27% year-to-date. Bitcoin, meanwhile, has fallen 8% since the beginning of this year as crypto markets have decoupled from stocks. Bitwise also made several bullish predictions for the coming year, including a new all-time high for Bitcoin and a break of the four-year cycle. “Forces like the Bitcoin halving, interest rate cycles, and crypto booms and busts fueled by leverage are weaker than in past cycles,” it stated. Related: Bitcoin decouples from stocks in second half of 2025 It predicted that more traditional institutions like Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Merrill Lynch would enter crypto, allocations to spot crypto exchange-traded funds would increase, and onchain building would accelerate in 2026. Finally, the pro-crypto regulatory shift will continue to allow companies to adopt crypto at a faster rate, Bitwise said. It also predicted that crypto equities will outperform tech equities.

Title: From Cycles To Continuity: Why Bitcoin’s 4-Year Pattern May Be Breaking

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitcoin has lost more than 30% of its value since early October, triggering a sharp shift in market psychology. What was once viewed as a routine correction is increasingly being interpreted by analysts as a potential cycle top. Sentiment has deteriorated quickly, with fear and apathy replacing the optimism that dominated earlier in the year. Many investors are now positioning defensively, preparing for what they believe could be a prolonged bear market phase similar to past post-peak cycles. However, a recent CryptoQuant report challenges this increasingly popular narrative. According to the analysis, Bitcoin may no longer be following the traditional four-year boom-and-bust cycle that has defined its historical price behavior. Instead, the report introduces the Bitcoin Supercycle thesis, which argues that the classic halving-driven cycle structure could be breaking down in favor of a more extended, structurally supported bull market. The core idea behind the supercycle framework is that Bitcoin’s market dynamics have fundamentally changed. Unlike previous cycles driven largely by speculative retail flows, the current environment is shaped by new forces that did not exist in earlier eras. These structural shifts may be altering how drawdowns, tops, and recoveries unfold, potentially smoothing volatility over longer time horizons. According to the CryptoQuant report, the case for a potential Bitcoin supercycle is built on structural forces that were absent in previous market cycles. The most significant shift comes from institutional adoption. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, led by issuers such as BlackRock, have introduced a persistent and regulated source of demand from traditional finance. Unlike speculative retail flows, these vehicles treat Bitcoin as a strategic asset allocation, creating steady absorption rather than short-lived hype. On-chain data further reinforces this narrative. Exchange reserves continue to trend lower, signaling long-term accumulation and reduced sell-side pressure. At the same time, the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) remains relatively rational. Profit-taking is occurring, but without the euphoric spikes historically associated with cycle tops, suggesting a more mature and disciplined market structure. Infrastructure readiness is another critical pillar. While Bitcoin remains the core asset, scalability improvements across the broader crypto ecosystem—such as Ethereum’s Fusaka upgrade and the rapid expansion of Layer-2 networks—are enabling faster, cheaper transactions and real-world use cases. This enhances Bitcoin’s role as a settlement and reserve asset within a growing digital economy. Finally, the macro backdrop remains supportive. Geopolitical instability and the prospect of future monetary easing strengthen Bitcoin’s appeal as a neutral, decentralized hard asset. Together, these forces form a credible foundation for an extended supercycle, though the report cautions that external shocks could still disrupt this trajectory. Bitcoin’s short-term structure remains fragile, as shown on the 4-hour chart. Price continues to trade below the $90,000 psychological level, with repeated failures to reclaim key moving averages reinforcing the bearish bias. The 200-period moving average (red) is clearly sloping downward and acting as dynamic resistance near the $92,000–$93,000 zone, while the 100- and 50-period averages (green and blue) have compressed and rolled over, signaling fading upside momentum. After the sharp sell-off earlier in the month, Bitcoin attempted a recovery but stalled below descending resistance. Since then, the price has formed a series of lower highs and lower lows, confirming a short-term downtrend. The current consolidation around $86,000–$87,000 suggests indecision, but notably, bounces are becoming weaker, indicating limited demand on relief rallies. From a technical perspective, the $85,000–$86,000 area represents a critical support zone. A sustained break below this range would likely open the door to a deeper correction. Conversely, bulls would need a decisive reclaim of $90,000, followed by acceptance above the descending moving averages, to meaningfully shift momentum. Until then, the chart favors consolidation with downside risk.

Title: ‘Trump Accounts’ for kids get funding boost from Dalio and BlackRock
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/17/trump-accounts-for-kids-get-funding-boost-from-dalio-and-blackrock/
Time Published: 2025-12-17T23:25:56Z

A new savings vehicle, dubbed “Trump accounts,” is designed to help the rising generation of American children build wealth into adulthood. Under the multitrillion-dollar tax and spending bill signed by President Donald Trump in July, the federal government will contribute $1,000 to accounts set up for every American baby born in the next few years. The initiative got a boost on Dec. 2 when billionaires Michael and Susan Dell announced a $6.25 billion gift to seed accounts for millions of older children as well. Other big names in business and finance, including Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio and BlackRock Inc., soon followed with smaller pledges of their own. Lawmakers significantly scaled back the flexibility and tax benefits of the program since the initial proposal. While the accounts could serve as a springboard for long-term savings, there are other investment vehicles, especially 529 plans, that offer greater tax advantages. Here’s how the accounts are supposed to work and how the new infusion of money might affect the program. For each account, annual contributions would be capped at $5,000, an amount that would be adjusted for inflation. The idea is for parents, relatives and even the employers of caregivers to pitch in money over time. The federal government, as well as state, local or tribal governments, could also contribute and aren’t subject to the cap. The accounts would be locked up until the child turns 18. At that point, Trump accounts essentially become individual retirement accounts, which can be used penalty-free for certain expenses such as higher education or first-time home purchases. Only one account is allowed per person. The US Treasury will issue regulations requiring the funds be invested in mutual or exchange-traded index funds (ETFs) that “primarily” hold US stocks. Funds must charge low fees and not use leverage, according to the law signed in July. Another exception to the contribution limit applies to nonprofits, including 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) organizations, which could give to recipients based on where they live. Parents, relatives, employers or philanthropists can contribute to a designated recipient’s Trump account through the year they turn 17. The Internal Revenue Service has said parents will be allowed to start contributing on behalf of children starting on July 4, 2026. Also, through a pilot program, the US government would contribute $1,000 to accounts for babies born from the beginning of 2025 through the end of 2028. Caregivers will be able to sign up children for an account through an online portal administered by the IRS. The commitments from corporations and well-heeled donors demonstrate how companies and business leaders are eager to demonstrate public support for a program that Trump views as part of his presidential legacy. Dalio said his foundation would donate $250 each to roughly 300,000 “Trump accounts” for children in Connecticut. BlackRock said it would match the federal government’s contributions to the accounts for employees’ children, seeding them with $1,000 each. Those pledges follow the Dells’ announcement in early December of a $6.25 billion gift aimed at seeding accounts for 25 million American children age 10 and under who were too old to be eligible for the initial government funding. The donation targets kids living in ZIP Codes with median incomes below $150,000. Each eligible account would receive $250 from the Dells. While that amount is unlikely to grow into a significant nest egg even over a couple decades, Michael Dell, founder of Dell Technologies Inc., said when he disclosed the gift that he hoped to inspire others to give as well. Trump accounts can’t be touched until age 18. At that point, they’re essentially treated like traditional individual retirement accounts. As with IRAs, money can be withdrawn early for certain qualified expenses, including higher education, up to $10,000 toward first-time home purchases and $5,000 per child for birth or adoption expenses. Other distributions trigger a 10% penalty. The accounts grow tax-free, and wouldn’t be taxed until money is withdrawn. Those taxes are complicated, and the US Treasury hasn’t yet issued rules on how exactly they will work. The law says recipients don’t pay taxes on any post-tax contributions to their accounts, such as those from parents and relatives. But any gains or tax-free contributions from government, philanthropists or employers will be taxed like ordinary income upon withdrawal. On top of that, beneficiaries would also face the 10% IRA withdrawal penalty if money is used for non-qualifying expenses. Lawmakers tweaked the Trump accounts so that distributions will be taxed as ordinary income. Early versions of the bill said distributions would be taxed at long-term capital gains rates, which are much lower than those on ordinary income. The accounts also were changed so that they follow IRA withdrawal rules, meaning a recipient’s small business startup costs no longer qualify for penalty-free distributions. Trump accounts have far fewer tax benefits than 529 college savings plans, which also have far higher contribution limits. With a 529 plan, withdrawals are tax-free for qualified educational expenses, and contributions are often eligible for state income tax deductions. Trump account holders would still pay taxes on withdrawals. The Trump accounts program will cost about $15 billion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office, a tiny fraction of the overall tax and spending package approved in July. An idea for government-funded “baby bonds” was first proposed by economist Darrick Hamilton, a professor at the New School for Social Research in New York, as a way to help poor Americans build assets and narrow the racial wealth gap. Several states, including Connecticut, have set up baby bond programs or are in the process of doing so. Hamilton has been skeptical of Trump accounts, calling them an idea to “address wealth inequality on the cheap.” One impetus for the overall approach appears to have come from Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, who along with economist Robert Shapiro last year began promoting the idea of accounts seeded with $1,000 for newborns. It’s a “simple solution to help people be connected to financial markets so everybody in the country shares in the wealth,” Hassett said at a presentation to the Aspen Institute in 2024. Greg Leiserson, an economist who served in the Biden and Obama administrations, warned “tax-preferred accounts primarily benefit families that already have spare time and money, not the families that need the most help.”

Title: Coinbase announces stock trading and new Kalshi-based prediction markets
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/17/coinbase-announces-stock-trading-and-new-kalshi-based-prediction-markets/
Time Published: 2025-12-17T22:30:00Z

Coinbase is taking its biggest step yet into the broader financial sector. On Wednesday, the company announced customers will now be able to trade stocks on its platform, and also place bets on a wide range of events through a partnership with prediction market startup Kalshi. The moves signal that Coinbase is moving beyond its longtime roots as a cryptocurrency company, and are likely to intensify its rivalry with fintech firms like Robinhood. The stock trading and prediction markets announcements came at a San Francisco event titled System Upgrade that featured stage presentations by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and other executives, who also announced new trading features and a platform called Coinbase Business aimed at startups and small businesses. The event comes as the company is seeking to brand itself as an “everything exchange.” Notably, the company did not announce a release date for its own cryptocurrency token, which executives have teased in recent months, but without providing additional details beyond saying they want to ensure any token launch takes place in a fair manner. The new stock trading feature is the most significant announcement by far as it will be a crucial test of whether Coinbase can leverage its dominant crypto brand to expand into other sectors. It will also allow it to compete more directly with Robinhood, which made its name as a stock-trading app, but has since made significant inroads into crypto.Coinbase will initially offer only a curated list of major stocks and ETFs, but says it will expand this to thousands of other stocks in coming months. The company says stock trading will be available 24 hours a day on five days of the week, and that there will be no fee to trade. Early next year, Coinbase plans to roll out perpetual futures for stocks—a type of derivative pioneered by the crypto industry that lets traders hold options that do not expire. The perpetual futures offering will only be available outside the U.S. Coinbase’s new stock offerings come at a time when the financial market is beginning to embrace tokenization. The term describes turning a variety of assets into tokens that can be traded on a blockchain, a process that results in near-instant settlement and allows traders to more efficiently deploy collateral. Currently, firms like BlackRock are offering tokenized versions of Treasury bill and money-market funds. Tokenized stock offerings are still at a preliminary stage, but are expected to gain traction rapidly, which could play to Coinbase’s strengths given the firm’s longtime crypto expertise. For its prediction markets offering, Coinbase will source its order flow from Kalshi, which is the same model used by Robinhood. In practical terms, this entails acting as a distribution platform for the startup, which has grown exponentially this year by offering a new form of betting that invites users to wager against one another on the outcome of events ranging from elections to interest rate cuts to sports games. The Kalshi partnership will likely entail a revenue split of the small fee the platform collects on wagers. Stocks and prediction markets have the potential to offer Coinbase significant new revenue streams, and further the company’s long-stated goal of diversifying its business beyond crypto trading. Coinbase’s stock is roughly flat from the start of the year, having given up big gains in recent months as crypto markets have sagged and the price of Bitcoin has fallen around 30% from its October highs. Coinbase also used the San Francisco event to announce that its Base App is now available in 140 countries. The app, which debuted this summer, aims to let ordinary people launch financial and creative products on the company’s blockchain and earn a share of the revenue they create. Other services unveiled by Coinbase on Wednesday included expanded access to the Solana blockchain via a decentralized exchange, and an AI-powered wealth management tool called Coinbase Advisor.

Title: Ray Dalio donates $75 million to ‘Trump Accounts’ as Scott Bessent leads ‘50 State Challenge’ to invest in America’s kids

The U.S. Treasury asked major philanthropic donors to contribute to new investment accounts for children Wednesday as part of what Secretary Scott Bessent called a “50 State Challenge” to raise funds for the Trump Accounts program. “The president is calling on our nation’s business leaders and philanthropic organizations to help us make America great again by securing the financial future of America’s children,” Bessent said in an address. The billionaire hedge fund founder Ray Dalio, along with his wife Barbara, announced they would commit $250 to 300,000 children under 10 in Connecticut who live in ZIP codes where the median income is less than $150,000. Dalio founded the investment firm Bridgewater Associates and lives in Connecticut. “I have been fortunate to live the American Dream. At an early age I was exposed to the stock market, and it changed my life,” Ray Dalio said in a statement, adding that he sees the accounts as putting children on a path toward financial independence. The Dalios’ $75 million commitment follows the $6.25 billion pledge from billionaires Michael and Susan Dell earlier in December. The Dells promised to invest $250 in the accounts of 25 million children 10 and under who live in ZIP codes across the country that also have that median income. The new investment accounts were created as part of President Donald Trump’s tax and spending legislation, passed over the summer. Under the new law, the U.S. Department of the Treasury will deposit $1,000 into the investment accounts of children born during Trump’s second term. The Treasury has not yet launched the new accounts. “Starting on July 4th, our nation’s 250th anniversary, parents, family members, employers and friends will be able to contribute up to $5,000 to each Trump Account each year,” Bessent said Wednesday. Brad Gerstner, a venture capitalist, who championed the accounts, said the Treasury will create an account for every child in the U.S. who has a Social Security number but private companies will eventually administer the accounts. Parents or guardians will have to claim the accounts on behalf of their children. For children born before Trump came to office and who don’t qualify for the funds from the Dells and the Dalios, their families can open and fund their own Trump Account if they choose. Money in the accounts must be invested in an index fund that tracks the overall stock market. When the children turn 18, they can withdraw the funds to put toward their education, to buy a home or to start a business. Bessent said employers, family members and philanthropists can put funds into the accounts and that the administration hopes states will also eventually set up programs to invest in the accounts. Companies including Visa and BlackRock have also pledged to contribute in some way to the accounts of their employees’ children. ___ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

BlackRock U.S. head of equity ETFs Jay Jacobs explains why more investors should activate active investing and analyzes market performance as stocks slip to kick off December on 'The Claman Countdown.' The exchange-traded fund industry is having a record year, with assets already hitting over $1 trillion, and active managers are driving a big part of that growth. "Third-quarter activity confirmed what we’ve seen building over the past several years: Active ETFs continue to drive innovation and flows," wrote Dan Aronson, managing director, ETF client product specialist group, in Janus Henderson’s "ETF Pulse" through the third quarter. Active managers can be part of the decision-making regarding which stocks to include using the convenience of an ETF. Active ETFs account for 80% of year-to-date launches, with assets under management growing 38% compared to 6% for passive ETFs, he noted. New launches are balanced between fixed income and equities. Janus Henderson reports strong activity among active ETFs (Janus Henderson Investors ) However, not all funds are created equal. Average assets under management are around $120 million for funds between two and three years old, compared to just $40 million for newer funds.

Title: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy announces departure of AI exec Rohit Prasad in leadership shakeup

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy dropped an AI bombshell on employees today, announcing that Rohit Prasad—who has led Amazon’s so-called AGI (artificial general intelligence) team since 2023, overseeing the development of the company’s Nova models—will depart at the end of the year. Prasad previously served as the head scientist behind Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant, a role he held from the product’s earliest days. When he was appointed to lead the new ambitious AGI effort after ChatGPT launched in November 2022, as part of a scramble to develop a competitive LLM that could help reinvigorate the Alexa voice assistant, it was led almost entirely by ex–Alexa executives. In a blog post, Jassy announced that longtime Amazon Web Services (AWS) executive Peter DeSantis will lead a new organization that drives the development of its AI models, custom computer chips (which include its Graviton, Trainium, and Nitro chips), and quantum computing efforts. DeSantis has overseen the many teams designing AWS’s global infrastructure. “With our Nova 2 models just launched at Re:Invent, our custom silicon growing rapidly, and the advantages of optimizing across models, chips, and cloud software and infrastructure, we wanted to free Peter up to focus his energy, invention cycles, and leadership on these new areas,” Jassy wrote, adding that DeSantis would report directly to him.Jassy also said that as part of the organizational change, Pieter Abbeel, an Amazon Distinguished Scientist in robotics who is also an AI and robotics professor at UC Berkeley, will lead the company’s frontier model research team. Abbeel came to Amazon in 2024 along with other cofounders of his robotics startup Covariant, in a deal that also saw Amazon licensing Covariant’s software, which included AI models that gave robots the ability to quickly adapt to new environments and tasks. “Pieter is one of the world’s leading AI researchers and cofounder of Covariant, which pioneered the first commercial foundation model for robotics,” Jassy wrote. “His deep expertise in generative AI and reinforcement learning makes him well-suited to advance Amazon’s AI research as we push the boundaries of what’s possible for customers.” The news of Prasad’s departure comes as somewhat of a surprise, given that he was recently at Amazon’s Re:Invent conference discussing the latest Nova models. However, over the past two years there has been significant media coverage suggesting that Amazon’s Alexa AI and AGI-related efforts have struggled and fallen behind competitors. A year ago, for example, Fortune’s Jason Del Rey reported exclusively that leaked Amazon documents identified critical flaws in the delayed AI reboot of Alexa. And in June 2024, Fortune reported that Amazon had blown Alexa’s shot to dominate AI, according to more than a dozen employees who worked on it—partly owing to a lack of adequate data, even though Prasad pushed the AGI team to work harder and harder, with a message to “get some magic” out of the LLM. In addition, last week’s Amazon layoffs fueled concerns about whether Amazon was still lagging behind in AI, and whether the cuts reflected slowing growth. That came on the heels of comments in October by analyst Mark Shmulik of Bernstein, who said Amazon’s AWS was in “last place” in the AI cloud race. However, The Information as well as Bloomberg reported this week that Amazon was in talks to invest $10 billion in OpenAI. OpenAI, in turn, had agreed to use Amazon’s Trainium AI chips, perhaps helping counter the narrative that the company is behind in AI. OpenAI had previously agreed to spend $38 billion using AWS for computing.Amazon also has a deal with AI company Anthropic, in which Amazon has invested $8 billion. Anthropic has agreed to use AWS’s Trainium chips for training, and Anthropic’s Claude model is being used to answer some queries in the new Alexa Plus.

Title: Billionaire Ray Dalio joins push to fund Trump Accounts: ‘Been fortunate to live the American Dream’

The US Treasury asked major philanthropic donors to contribute to new investment accounts for children Wednesday as part of what Secretary Scott Bessent called a “50 State Challenge” to raise funds for the Trump Accounts program. “The president is calling on our nation’s business leaders and philanthropic organizations to help us make America great again by securing the financial future of America’s children,” Bessent said in an address. The billionaire hedge fund founder Ray Dalio, along with his wife Barbara, announced they would commit $250 to 300,000 children under 10 in Connecticut who live in ZIP codes where the median income is less than $150,000. Dalio founded the investment firm Bridgewater Associates and lives in Connecticut. “I have been fortunate to live the American Dream. At an early age I was exposed to the stock market, and it changed my life,” Ray Dalio said in a statement, adding that he sees the accounts as putting children on a path toward financial independence. The Dalios’ $75 million commitment follows the $6.25 billion pledge from billionaires Michael and Susan Dell earlier in December. The Dells promised to invest $250 in the accounts of 25 million children 10 and under who live in ZIP codes across the country that also have that median income. The new investment accounts were created as part of President Trump’s tax and spending legislation, passed over the summer. Under the new law, the Department of the Treasury will deposit $1,000 into the investment accounts of children born during Trump’s second term. The Treasury has not yet launched the new accounts. “Starting on July 4th, our nation’s 250th anniversary, parents, family members, employers and friends will be able to contribute up to $5,000 to each Trump Account each year,” Bessent said Wednesday. Morning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more. Please provide a valid email. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Never miss a story. Brad Gerstner, a venture capitalist, who championed the accounts, said the Treasury will create an account for every child in the US who has a Social Security number but private companies will eventually administer the accounts. Parents or guardians will have to claim the accounts on behalf of their children. For children born before Trump came to office and who don’t qualify for the funds from the Dells and the Dalios, their families can open and fund their own Trump Account if they choose. Money in the accounts must be invested in an index fund that tracks the overall stock market. When the children turn 18, they can withdraw the funds to put toward their education, to buy a home or to start a business. Bessent said employers, family members and philanthropists can put funds into the accounts and that the administration hopes states will also eventually set up programs to invest in the accounts. Companies including Visa and BlackRock have also pledged to contribute in some way to the accounts of their employees’ children. Advertisement

Title: Binance mulls new US strategy, CZ potentially reducing stake: Report
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-us-strategy-cz-reduce-stake
Time Published: 2025-12-17T18:50:29Z
Full Content:
Binance exited the United States in 2019, and a separate company, Binance.US, has been serving US customers since that time. Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, is considering a strategic reshuffling to strengthen its presence in the US market, a move that could see Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao’s majority stake in the company reduced. Zhao’s controlling stake in Binance has been a “major hurdle” to the company expanding to strategically critical US states, according to Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter. Although no concrete plans have been announced, the conversation surrounding any potential action remains reportedly “fluid.” The company is also considering partnerships with US-based companies, including asset manager BlackRock and decentralized finance (DeFi) platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI), which is linked to US President Donald Trump, to strengthen its footprint in the country. Rumors of Binance’s return to the US began to circulate in October after Trump pardoned Zhao, fueled by speculation from crypto industry executives and comments that Zhao made on social media. “Will do everything we can to help make America the capital of crypto and advance Web3 worldwide,” Zhao said in October after the pardon. In June 2019, Binance announced that it would stop serving US customers, and a separate company, called Binance.US and operated by BAM Trading Services, was formed to provide regulatory-compliant services to US users. In 2023, the US Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that Binance Holdings Ltd. operated both Binance.com and BAM Trading Services. Binance.US does not feature crypto derivatives or access to the global Binance exchange’s liquidity and operates as a completely separate crypto exchange. Cointelegraph reached out to Binance and Binance.US but did not receive a response by the time of publication. The US is considered a key market for crypto exchanges and is ranked as the number two for global crypto adoption, according to Chainalysis’ 2025 Global Crypto Adoption Index. Expanding to the US would open up US liquidity to the world’s largest crypto exchange. Related: Binance names co-founder Yi He co-CEO alongside Richard Teng Trump’s pardon of Zhao in October drew backlash from several Democratic Party lawmakers in the US, including Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and California Congresswoman Maxine Waters. Waters said the pardon was a form of pay-to-play and accused Trump of doing political favors for the crypto industry that “helped line his pockets.”Warren, who is one of the most vocal critics of the crypto industry, also criticized the pardon, characterizing it as “corruption.” The comments reflect pockets of resistance among some Democratic lawmakers to the crypto industry’s continued expansion in the US and could signal potential opposition to Binance returning to the US.

Title: Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez Bezos are awarding $5 million to a leader in neurodiversity education
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/12/17/philanthropy-bezos-neurodiversity/
Time Published: 2025-12-17T18:04:28Z
Full Content:
By JAMES POLLARD NEW YORK (AP) — Mega billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and his wife, former news anchor Lauren Sánchez Bezos, are awarding $5 million to the founder of a neurodivergent student support network, a recognition that the lesser-known recipient credits to the students powering his fast-growing movement for more inclusive classrooms. “I feel like there’s a narrative sometimes that our little actions don’t matter,” Neurodiversity Alliance CEO David Flink said. “That’s just not true. And this proves it. Lots of little actions that happen every day in our work, collectively over time, reached the ears of folks like Lauren and Jeff.” Flink is among this year’s five winners of the Bezos Courage & Civility Award. Given most years since 2021, the grant celebrates barrier-breaking individuals who unify people behind bold solutions to often neglected challenges. The no-strings-attached prize money can be used however honorees want to pursue their charitable goals. The Neurodiversity Alliance began over 25 years ago as a peer-to-peer mentorship program for students with various learning and developmental differences such as autism, ADHD and dyslexia. The nonprofit now reaches more than 600 high schools and colleges, encouraging youth to build educational environments that serve classmates whose brains function differently from what is considered typical. The Bezoses, who tied the knot this summer in a lavish Venice ceremony that drew protests highlighting wealth inequality, did not release any explanation for their support of the cause. The Amazon founder’s net worth sits around $240 billion, according to Forbes, making him the fourth richest person in the world. Bezos has previously shown an interest in early childhood education through his nonprofit network of tuition-free preschools inspired by the Montessori model. Sánchez Bezos grew up with undiagnosed dyslexia. She told “Good Morning America” last year that her children’s book, “The Fly Who Flew to Space,” is for “the 8-year-old me who was told I wasn’t smart.” She credited a college professor, who recruited her to the school newspaper despite her insistence that she could not spell, for encouraging her to get tested. The selection of Flink marks a departure from the award’s previous higher profile recipients. Past honorees include CNN political commentator Van Jones, World Central Kitchen founder José Andrés, actor-director Eva Longoria and country superstar Dolly Parton. The shift reflects a desire to get the money closer to the ground rather than let well-known figures distribute money to the nonprofits of their choice. The smaller scale approach differs from many of Bezos’ ultra wealthy peers, according to an Indiana University professor emeritus in public affairs and philanthropic studies. Leslie Lenkowsky said that today’s entrepreneur-philanthropists — Bill Gates, for example — tend to focus on systemic change in the realms of health or education. “Rather than trying to change the system, what they’re trying to do is provide funding to individuals or communities to deal with important issues,” Lenkowsky said of the Bezoses. “It really is a much older model of philanthropy.” The award’s size is also smaller this year. Five winners are equally splitting a $25 million pot whereas past awards have totaled as much as $100 million. Flink said the money will help the alliance meet its goal of reaching more than 2,000 sites by 2028. He promised to invest in growing the mentorship program, telling more stories that challenge negative narratives about neurodiversity and expanding the national network of student leaders who get training to sustain their schools’ clubs. He said this support is especially important when “the demand has never been greater” and they’ve witnessed “some oscillation” in the resources that schools receive. The Trump administration’s dismantling of the Education Department has included mass layoffs at the agency charged with addressing complaints that students with disabilities are not receiving adequate support from their schools. Earlier this month, the department brought back dozens of Office for Civil Rights staffers, saying their help is needed to tackle a growing backlog of discrimination complaints. Kala Shah, an attorney whose 24-year tenure at the Department of Education included enforcing protections for students with disabilities, said that neurodivergent students depend on that oversight. “This is an especially critical time for private foundations and philanthropy to help fill the gap in resources that’s been created by the current federal climate,” she said.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Hedge fund manager Ray Dalio has joined the list of billionaires backing President Donald Trump's new plan to give $1,000 to every child born in the next three years. Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, and his wife, Barbara, will donate $250 to about 300,000 children in Connecticut who live in zip codes where the median family income is $150,000 or less, Dalio Philanthropies said in a press release. "Barbara and I believe strongly in the importance of equal opportunity and believe this initiative is an important step in that direction," Ray Dalio said in the release. "I have lived the American dream. At an early age, I was exposed to the stock market, and it changed my life. By providing children with savings accounts that compound over time, we are providing them with early insights into financial literacy and a path towards financial independence." BlackRock, too, announced on Wednesday that it would "offer an employee match to the US government contribution of $1,000 for all eligible US employees to Trump Accounts." Several other business leaders, including Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, have also committed to contributing funds to the accounts of their employees' children, according to Invest America, the federal program spearheaded by Altimeter Capital CEO Brad Gerstner that is now commonly known as "Trump Accounts." BNY, a financial services company, also announced last week that it would match Trump Account funds for its employees. Since June, some of the country's wealthiest individuals have been lining up behind Trump's plan to provide a one-time, tax-free federal grant of $1,000 to every American child born between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2028. The accounts will be in the child's name, but their parent will remain the sole custodian until the child turns 18. Others can contribute up to an additional $5,000 tax-free to those accounts every year. The program will officially launch on July 4, 2026. The Dalios' donation follows a substantial commitment from Michael and Susan Dell, who pledged to deposit $250 into the accounts of 25 million American kids — about $6.25 billion — earlier this month. The payments will be automatically deposited into the account of any child who fits the criteria and opens a Trump Account. However, not all billionaires are rushing to contribute to the Trump Accounts. The world's richest man, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, shared his thoughts on the Trump Accounts in a response on X to Ray Dalio, who had posted his praise for the program and Dells' contribution. "It is certainly a nice gesture of the Dells, but there will be no poverty in the future and so no need to save money. There will be universal high income," Musk wrote. Musk once said that Tesla's Optimus robot would "eliminate poverty." Dalio Philanthropies and BlackRock did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Jump to

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) The U.S. Treasury asked major philanthropic donors to contribute to new investment accounts for children Wednesday as part of what Secretary Scott Bessent called a “50 State Challenge” to raise funds for the Trump Accounts program. “The president is calling on our nation’s business leaders and philanthropic organizations to help us make America great again by securing the financial future of America’s children,” Bessent said in an address. The billionaire hedge fund founder Ray Dalio, along with his wife Barbara, announced they would commit $250 to 300,000 children under 10 in Connecticut who live in ZIP codes where the median income is less than $150,000. Dalio founded the investment firm Bridgewater Associates and lives in Connecticut. “I have been fortunate to live the American Dream. At an early age I was exposed to the stock market, and it changed my life,” Ray Dalio said in a statement, adding that he sees the accounts as putting children on a path toward financial independence. The Dalios commitment, which will total at least $75 million, follows the $6.25 billion pledge from billionaires Michael and Susan Dell earlier in December. The Dells promised to invest $250 in the accounts of 25 million children 10 and under who live in ZIP codes across the country that also have that median income. The new investment accounts were created as part of President Donald Trump’s tax and spending legislation, passed over the summer. Under the new law, the U.S. Department of the Treasury will deposit $1,000 into the investment accounts of children born during Trump’s second term. The Treasury has not yet launched the new accounts. “Starting on July 4th, our nation’s 250th anniversary, parents, family members, employers and friends will be able to contribute up to $5,000 to each Trump Account each year,” Bessent said Wednesday. Brad Gerstner, a venture capitalist, who championed the accounts, said the Treasury will create an account for every child in the U.S. who has a Social Security number but private companies will eventually administer the accounts. Parents or guardians will have to claim the accounts on behalf of their children. For children born before Trump came to office and who don’t qualify for the funds from the Dells and the Dalios, their families can open and fund their own Trump Account if they choose. Money in the accounts must be invested in an index fund that tracks the overall stock market. When the children turn 18, they can withdraw the funds to put toward their education, to buy a home or to start a business. Bessent said employers, family members and philanthropists can put funds into the accounts and that the administration hopes states will also eventually set up programs to invest in the accounts. Companies including Visa and BlackRock have also pledged to contribute in some way to the accounts of their employees’ children. Jane Waldfogel, a professor at the Columbia University School of Social Work, said ideally, governments would provide benefits that help families with children afford immediate expenses and programs like the Trump Accounts that help families save for a child’s future. “The problem that many scholars have tried to address and many politicians have tried to address with these child savings accounts is that low-income families and even middle-income families struggle to put aside money and save money for their children’s future,” said Waldfogel, who recently published a book about child benefits. Without regular government contributions targeted toward poorer families, Waldfogel does not expect the accounts to decrease economic inequality as affluent families will take advantage of them but other families will not. Steven Durlauf, a professor at the University of Chicago’s Harris School of Public Policy, said he expects the accounts to make a very modest contribution toward the resources of young adults. His research has examined what factors impact the success of children and he said improving early childhood education and rectifying racial and economic segregation at schools and in neighborhoods would do more to give children the skills and opportunities they need to be productive. Durlauf also said as much as the philanthropy of the affluent is admirable, he thinks it should remain out of politics and controversies. “This is integrating the wealthy into the support of particular government programs that are associated with particular political figures,” he said. “And that strikes me as extraordinarily dangerous.” The Dalios have granted tens of millions to Connecticut public schools over the years, though a $100 million initiative launched in 2019 that would have involved matching public funds fell apart after state lawmakers raised questions over transparency. Altogether, the Dalios say they’ve given $7 billion through their philanthropy, which has focused on education, support for economic advancement and ocean research and education. ___ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Title: Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez Bezos are awarding $5 million to a leader in neurodiversity education
URL: https://www.wsoctv.com/news/business/jeff-bezos-lauren/RPBCAJUCKA2MZJPFLX2QKVBZMI/
Time Published: 2025-12-17T17:15:55Z

WSOC Now Livestream brought to you by: NEW YORK — Mega billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and his wife, former news anchor Lauren Sánchez Bezos, are awarding $5 million to the founder of a neurodivergent student support network, a recognition that the lesser-known recipient credits to the students powering his fast-growing movement for more inclusive classrooms. “I feel like there’s a narrative sometimes that our little actions don’t matter,” Neurodiversity Alliance CEO David Flink said. "That’s just not true. And this proves it. Lots of little actions that happen every day in our work, collectively over time, reached the ears of folks like Lauren and Jeff.” Flink is among this year's five winners of the Bezos Courage & Civility Award. Given most years since 2021, the grant celebrates barrier-breaking individuals who unify people behind bold solutions to often neglected challenges. The no-strings-attached prize money can be used however honorees want to pursue their charitable goals. The Neurodiversity Alliance began over 25 years ago as a peer-to-peer mentorship program for students with various learning and developmental differences such as autism, ADHD and dyslexia. The nonprofit now reaches more than 600 high schools and colleges, encouraging youth to build educational environments that serve classmates whose brains function differently from what is considered typical. The Bezoses, who tied the knot this summer in a lavish Venice ceremony that drew protests highlighting wealth inequality, did not release any explanation for their support of the cause. The Amazon founder's net worth sits around $240 billion, according to Forbes, making him the fourth richest person in the world. Bezos has previously shown an interest in early childhood education through his nonprofit network of tuition-free preschools inspired by the Montessori model. Sánchez Bezos grew up with undiagnosed dyslexia. She told “Good Morning America” last year that her children’s book, “The Fly Who Flew to Space," is for "the 8-year-old me who was told I wasn't smart." She credited a college professor, who recruited her to the school newspaper despite her insistence that she could not spell, for encouraging her to get tested. The selection of Flink marks a departure from the award's previous higher profile recipients. Past honorees include CNN political commentator Van Jones, World Central Kitchen founder José Andrés, actor-director Eva Longoria and country superstar Dolly Parton. The shift reflects a desire to get the money closer to the ground rather than let well-known figures distribute money to the nonprofits of their choice. The smaller scale approach differs from many of Bezos’ ultra wealthy peers, according to an Indiana University professor emeritus in public affairs and philanthropic studies. Leslie Lenkowsky said that today’s entrepreneur-philanthropists — Bill Gates, for example — tend to focus on systemic change in the realms of health or education. “Rather than trying to change the system, what they’re trying to do is provide funding to individuals or communities to deal with important issues,” Lenkowsky said of the Bezoses. “It really is a much older model of philanthropy.” The award's size is also smaller this year. Five winners are equally splitting a $25 million pot whereas past awards have totaled as much as $100 million. Flink said the money will help the alliance meet its goal of reaching more than 2,000 sites by 2028. He promised to invest in growing the mentorship program, telling more stories that challenge negative narratives about neurodiversity and expanding the national network of student leaders who get training to sustain their schools’ clubs. He said this support is especially important when “the demand has never been greater” and they've witnessed “some oscillation" in the resources that schools receive. The Trump administration's dismantling of the Education Department has included mass layoffs at the agency charged with addressing complaints that students with disabilities are not receiving adequate support from their schools. Earlier this month, the department brought back dozens of Office for Civil Rights staffers, saying their help is needed to tackle a growing backlog of discrimination complaints. Kala Shah, an attorney whose 24-year tenure at the Department of Education included enforcing protections for students with disabilities, said that neurodivergent students depend on that oversight. “This is an especially critical time for private foundations and philanthropy to help fill the gap in resources that’s been created by the current federal climate,” she said. __ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP's collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

For more information, please contact: Sequana Medical Investor relationsE: IR@sequanamedical.com T: +44 (0) 797 342 9917 About Sequana Medical Sequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload, a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease, heart failure and cancer. This causes major medical issues including increased mortality, repeated hospitalizations, severe pain, difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care, they become ineffective, intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options, resulting in poor clinical outcomes, high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing "diuretic resistant" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload, and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients, while reducing costs for healthcare systems. The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024, following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. In Sequana Medical's POSEIDON study, a landmark study across 18 centers in the US and Canada, the pivotal cohort of 40 patients implanted with the alfapump showed at 6 and 24 months post-implantation the virtual elimination of therapeutic paracentesis and an improvement in quality of life1,2. Sequana Medical is commercializing the alfapump through a specialty commercial team initially targeting US liver transplant centers – 90 of these centers perform more than 90% of US liver transplants annually. In August 2025, CMS announced that it approved the New Technology Add-on Payment for the alfapump when performed in the hospital inpatient setting as of October 1, 2025. Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE, a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study, have been successfully treated with DSR, resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements3. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients, which is dependent on securing additional financing. Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent, Belgium. For further information, please visit www.sequanamedical.com. Important Safety Information: For important safety information regarding the alfapump® system, see https://www.sequanamedical.com/wp-content/uploads/ISI.pdf.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Neilson Barnard / Getty Images Entertainment via Getty Images Very few investors can match Stanley Druckenmiller. He delivered an average annual return of over 30% over three decades at Duquesne Capital without a single losing year, but he does not own Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR), and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) today. We’ll look into why in a bit. Druckenmiller is a timeless icon who has done very well in the recent past, with his portfolio up 9.07% in just Q3 2025 alone. His current portfolio contains 62 holdings. You’d expect his top holdings to be the usual Mag 7, plus some AI stocks. After all, how can you perform well without investing in these stocks? Almost every hedge fund and ETF that tried to sidestep these stocks ended up lagging the market. Remember, Druckenmiller isn’t just any hedge fund manager. He has managed to do well with his top holdings being almost devoid of any AI software companies, with the only AI bet being Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM). Let’s take a look at his moves with these top AI companies he does not hold. Stanley Druckenmiller started adding Nvidia shares in late 2022, very early on after ChatGPT’s release. He bought in Q4 2022, Q1 2023, and Q2 2023. But starting in Q3 2023, he started shedding his NVDA stake. He sold for 5 straight quarters as NVDA stock climbed higher and higher. He sold his last NVDA share in Q3 2024, when NVDA stock reached nearly $135. The stock is at $178 today, so did Druckenmiller make a massive mistake? Likely not. His top 3 holdings today have done a lot better than Nvidia, and taking profits in 2024 and shifting into those were anything but a miscalculation. Druckenmiller likely identified that NVDA stock became too expensive for his liking and didn’t have comparable upside potential vs. the stocks he moved into. Druckenmiller has had an on-and-off relationship with Palantir. He sold over half his shares in Q3 2021, then bought in Q1 2022 and Q2 2022. Again, he sold for over a year straight from Q3 2022 to Q2 2023. He took a break from the stock before buying in Q1 2024, buying 770,000 shares before selling 94.6% of his shares (728,000) in Q3 2024. He sold whatever PLTR stock he had left in Q1 2025, presumably near the peak price of ~$120, as Palantir’s rally accelerated aggressively. PLTR stock has climbed up to $187.75 today. While he did miss out on Palantir’s gains since Q1, he took out big profits from Palantir and piled into what he saw as “safer” stocks with bigger upside. It would be out of order for an investor like Druckenmiller to pay an earnings multiple deep in the triple digits for PLTR stock. And this paid off. The top 3 stocks in his portfolio have all performed better than or equal to PLTR stock over the past 6 months. His biggest holding outperformed PLTR by over 2x, with the second-biggest holding outperforming it by nearly 3x (it is up 100% in the past 6 months). The third holding is essentially neck and neck with Palantir’s 35.8% performance. Druckenmiller has quite a long history with Eli Lilly, but we’ll be looking into transactions in the past 5 years. He bought for 3 straight quarters, in Q2 2022, Q3 2022, and Q4 2022. Druckenmiller then took profits for 6 straight quarters from Q1 2023 to Q2 2024 as he shed all his LLY stock holdings as the company did exceedingly well. He made a hefty profit doing so, only to re-enter in Q4 2024 as LLY stock dropped from the $900s range to the $700s range. Druckenmiller bought for 3 straight quarters but then ended up selling it all in Q3 2025, equalling a sale of 101,000 shares in total. Q3 had an average closing price of $744.53. LLY stock has since recovered and is at $1,054 as of this writing. Druckenmiller likely grew impatient with this drawn-out recovery and didn’t want to stay in the loop with the company, especially with the uncertainty surrounding drug prices as the government got involved.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Neilson Barnard / Getty Images Entertainment via Getty Images Very few investors can match Stanley Druckenmiller. He delivered an average annual return of over 30% over three decades at Duquesne Capital without a single losing year, but he does not own Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR), and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) today. We’ll look into why in a bit. Druckenmiller is a timeless icon who has done very well in the recent past, with his portfolio up 9.07% in just Q3 2025 alone. His current portfolio contains 62 holdings. You’d expect his top holdings to be the usual Mag 7, plus some AI stocks. After all, how can you perform well without investing in these stocks?

Title: The Trade Desk Lays Off Staff One Year After Its Last Major Reorg

Time Published: 2025-12-17T15:46:47Z

The Trade Desk is cutting its workforce. A company spokesperson confirmed the news with AdExchanger. The layoffs affect less than 1% of the company. The Trade Desk’s current headcount is approximately 3,900. TTD is hosting an all-hands meeting at 12:30 pm eastern to go over the news with remaining employees. In a statement, a spokesperson from The Trade Desk noted that TTD has hired nearly 1,000 people this year, including “dozens” at the senior leadership level. Still, there have been several recent notable departures, including Jud Spencer, who was a lead engineer at TTD for more than 12 years. He left in November. Tuesday’s reorg “is part of our mission to constantly ensure we have the right skills and experiences in place to drive innovation and value for the world’s biggest advertisers in what is a fast-evolving ad tech environment,” the TTD spokesperson said. “And as part of that, a handful of folks are moving on from The Trade Desk.” The restructuring comes almost exactly one year after The Trade Desk underwent what CEO Jeff Green described as “the biggest reorganization” in the company’s history. That reorg, which took place last December, involved restructuring TTD’s client-facing teams, Green told investors in February during the company’s Q4 2024 earnings call. He said this shift was designed to improve how TTD serves advertisers and agencies. That disastrous fourth-quarter earnings report – which included TTD’s first-ever earnings miss – marked the start of a turbulent year for The Trade Desk, including growing pressure from Amazon and Google, its main rivals in the DSP market. During that call, Green acknowledged short-term disruptions caused by the reorg, but said it was necessary to position TTD for efficiency and growth. The layoffs on Tuesday suggest TTD is still adjusting to those changes as it works to balance efficiency with expansion heading into 2026. Get our editors’ roundup delivered to your inbox every weekday. This most recent restructuring also lands amid heightened scrutiny of programmatic supply chains following industry debates – instigated by TTD – about reseller transparency. The Trade Desk has positioned itself as a vocal proponent of greater accountability for advertisers across the open web, but its stance – and the release of OpenAds, its forked version of Prebid’s wrapper – have introduced new friction points between TTD and sell-side platforms. At the same time, The Trade Desk is still leaning into Kokai, the AI-powered update to its media buying platform, which launched in 2023. Despite operational growing plans, Kokai remains central to TTD’s long-term strategy as it continues to face intensifying competition from Amazon and mounting investor pressure to prove that its AI investments can drive meaningful growth.

Title: Amazon Eyes a Big Investment in OpenAI. Is This the Latest Sign of an AI Bubble?

Full Content:
Amazon (AMZN) could be set to unveil an investment of $10 billion or more in ChatGPT maker OpenAI. The companies are in talks for a deal that would see OpenAI buy some of Amazon's custom AI chips, and that would likely push OpenAI's valuation above $500 billion, according to a report from The Information and confirmed by CNBC. The talks reportedly started in October, after OpenAI completed its restructuring to a for-profit company with an agreement with Microsoft (MSFT), its largest investor, making it easier for OpenAI to seek funding from other companies. Amazon and OpenAI did not respond to Investopedia's requests for comment in time for publication. A deal between Amazon and OpenAI would represent the latest in a string of big circular deals in the AI space, with major cloud and hardware providers investing in startups that also count them as suppliers. Such deals have exacerbated worries about an AI bubble, drawing parallels with the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s. OpenAI has already signed over $1 trillion in agreements in recent months to buy chips and computing power. The startup struck massive chip deals Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and agreed to buy $38 billion in computing power from Amazon Web Services earlier this year. OpenAI's ChatGPT and other products don't currently generate enough revenue to cover those commitments, however, raising concerns the company may continue pulling in money from investors and lenders in the years to come before it turns a profit. Investors and analysts have grown increasingly skeptical in recent months of the growing number of circular deals within the AI industry, viewing them as unsustainable signals of a brewing AI bubble. Amazon shares were up less than 1% in recent trading, leaving them just 2% higher for the year so far and about 12% off their highs last month after a pullback in tech stocks in recent weeks.

Title: Jeff Bezos and wife Lauren Sánchez awarding $5M to founder of a neurodiversity education network

NEW YORK — Mega billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and his wife, former news anchor Lauren Sánchez Bezos, are awarding $5 million to the founder of a neurodivergent student support network, a recognition that the lesser-known recipient credits to the students powering his fast-growing movement for more inclusive classrooms. “I feel like there’s a narrative sometimes that our little actions don’t matter,” Neurodiversity Alliance CEO David Flink said. “That’s just not true. And this proves it. Lots of little actions that happen every day in our work, collectively over time, reached the ears of folks like Lauren and Jeff.” Flink is among this year’s five winners of the Bezos Courage & Civility Award. Given most years since 2021, the grant celebrates barrier-breaking individuals who unify people behind bold solutions to often neglected challenges. The no-strings-attached prize money can be used however honorees want to pursue their charitable goals. The Neurodiversity Alliance began over 25 years ago as a peer-to-peer mentorship program for students with various learning and developmental differences such as autism, ADHD, and dyslexia. The nonprofit now reaches more than 600 high schools and colleges, encouraging youth to build educational environments that serve classmates whose brains function differently from what is considered typical. The Bezoses, who tied the knot this summer in a lavish Venice ceremony that drew protests highlighting wealth inequality, did not release any explanation for their support of the cause. The Amazon founder’s net worth sits around $240 billion, according to Forbes, making him the fourth richest person in the world. Bezos has previously shown an interest in early childhood education through his nonprofit network of tuition-free preschools inspired by the Montessori model. Sánchez Bezos grew up with undiagnosed dyslexia. She told “Good Morning America” last year that her children’s book, “The Fly Who Flew to Space,” is for “the 8-year-old me who was told I wasn’t smart.” She credited a college professor, who recruited her to the school newspaper despite her insistence that she could not spell, for encouraging her to get tested. The selection of Flink marks a departure from the award’s previous higher-profile recipients. Past honorees include CNN political commentator Van Jones, World Central Kitchen founder José Andrés, actor-director Eva Longoria, and country superstar Dolly Parton. The shift reflects a desire to get the money closer to the ground rather than let well-known figures distribute money to the nonprofits of their choice. Morning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more. Please provide a valid email. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Never miss a story. The smaller scale approach differs from many of Bezos’ ultra-wealthy peers, according to an Indiana University professor emeritus in public affairs and philanthropic studies. Leslie Lenkowsky said that today’s entrepreneur-philanthropists — Bill Gates, for example — tend to focus on systemic change in the realms of health or education. “Rather than trying to change the system, what they’re trying to do is provide funding to individuals or communities to deal with important issues,” Lenkowsky said of the Bezoses. “It really is a much older model of philanthropy.” The award’s size is also smaller this year. Five winners are equally splitting a $25 million pot, whereas past awards have totaled as much as $100 million. Flink said the money will help the alliance meet its goal of reaching more than 2,000 sites by 2028. He promised to invest in growing the mentorship program, telling more stories that challenge negative narratives about neurodiversity, and expanding the national network of student leaders who get training to sustain their schools’ clubs. He said this support is especially important when “the demand has never been greater,” and they’ve witnessed “some oscillation” in the resources that schools receive. The Trump administration’s dismantling of the Education Department has included mass layoffs at the agency charged with addressing complaints that students with disabilities are not receiving adequate support from their schools. Earlier this month, the department brought back dozens of Office for Civil Rights staffers, saying their help is needed to tackle a growing backlog of discrimination complaints. Kala Shah, an attorney whose 24-year tenure at the Department of Education included enforcing protections for students with disabilities, said that neurodivergent students depend on that oversight. “This is an especially critical time for private foundations and philanthropy to help fill the gap in resources that’s been created by the current federal climate,” she said.

Title: Amazon Set to Waste $10 Billion on OpenAI

Technology Sending You to Google News in 3 © megaflopp / Shutterstock.com Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) apparently cannot help itself. Media reports say it plans to invest $10 billion into OpenAI. OpenAI, which until recently has been the leading artificial intelligence (AI) company in the world, has raised money from a long list of investors. Some are venture capitalists who are simply writing checks to get returns. However, another list consists of money or strategic deals with Microsoft, Oracle, Softbank, Nvidia, and, soon, Disney. What these tech investors are getting is a stake in a company that has had its spot at the top of the industry challenged by Gemini 3. That is an Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) offering. It is also one that the company says will not make money until 2030, one that will need hundreds of billions of dollars to hit its ambiguous goals, and one that has a growing number of direct competitors. These competitors include divisions of public companies, well-funded xAI and Anthropic, and a legion of smaller companies. Bloomberg reports, “OpenAI is in initial discussions to raise at least $10 billion from Amazon.com Inc. and use its chips, a potential win for the online retailer’s effort to broaden its AI industry presence and compete with Nvidia Corp.” Amazon is a tiny player in the AI chip business. Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) dominates, with a market cap of $4.33 trillion, which makes it the most valuable company in the world. Put plainly, the Amazon deal is part of the dangerous “round tripping” that goes on in the industry. One company invests in another. The company that gets the investment uses the money to buy products or services from the investor. Amazon clearly has little chance of competing head-to-head with Nvidia, so it is buying its way into the market. And Amazon can hardly say it is getting special treatment from OpenAI. The Financial Times reports, “OpenAI has already locked in $1.5tn in long-term deals with Nvidia, Oracle, AMD and Broadcom to supply chips and other computing infrastructure.” OpenAI does have one important strategic advantage in an Amazon deal. Like the rest of the AI world, it does not want to be trapped in a world where Nvidia is the only arms supplier. People have begun to ask whether the AI industry has created a valuation bubble. They are worried that the companies leading the race into AI will never make money. Many AI products are currently free. Investors worry that the data centers needed to run AI will take years to build and may not have enough electricity to run them. Still others believe that not all the large AI companies can survive in a brutally competitive market. The total of these investments will eventually move into the trillions of dollars. The Amazon deal with OpenAI is another example that the train has run off the rails.

Some are venture capitalists who are simply writing checks to get returns. However, another list consists of money or strategic deals with Microsoft, Oracle, Softbank, Nvidia, and, soon, Disney. What these tech investors are getting is a stake in a company that has had its spot at the top of the industry challenged by Gemini 3. That is an Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) offering. It is also one that the company says will not make money until 2030, one that will need hundreds of billions of dollars to hit its ambiguous goals, and one that has a growing number of direct competitors. These competitors include divisions of public companies, well-funded xAI and Anthropic, and a legion of smaller companies. Bloomberg reports, “OpenAI is in initial discussions to raise at least $10 billion from Amazon.com Inc. and use its chips, a potential win for the online retailer’s effort to broaden its AI industry presence and compete with Nvidia Corp.” Amazon is a tiny player in the AI chip business. Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) dominates, with a market cap of $4.33 trillion, which makes it the most valuable company in the world. Put plainly, the Amazon deal is part of the dangerous “round tripping” that goes on in the industry. One company invests in another. The company that gets the investment uses the money to buy products or services from the investor. Amazon clearly has little chance of competing head-to-head with Nvidia, so it is buying its way into the market. And Amazon can hardly say it is getting special treatment from OpenAI. The Financial Times reports, “OpenAI has already locked in $1.5tn in long-term deals with Nvidia, Oracle, AMD and Broadcom to supply chips and other computing infrastructure.” OpenAI does have one important strategic advantage in an Amazon deal. Like the rest of the AI world, it does not want to be trapped in a world where Nvidia is the only arms supplier. People have begun to ask whether the AI industry has created a valuation bubble. They are worried that the companies leading the race into AI will never make money. Many AI products are currently free. Investors worry that the data centers needed to run AI will take years to build and may not have enough electricity to run them. Still others believe that not all the large AI companies can survive in a brutally competitive market. The total of these investments will eventually move into the trillions of dollars. The Amazon deal with OpenAI is another example that the train has run off the rails.

Share this article BlackRock deposited 74,973 Ethereum worth $220 million and 4,356 Bitcoin worth $382 million to Coinbase Prime today, according to data from blockchain intelligence firm Arkham Intelligence. The movements come amid uneven flows across BlackRock’s digital asset funds. On Tuesday, the firm’s Bitcoin ETF recorded more than $210 million in net outflows, while its Ethereum ETF saw net redemptions exceeding $220 million. Still, daily ETF flows do not necessarily capture the immediate trading behavior of the underlying assets. Instead, the flows provide insight into share creation and redemption. That said, authorized participants may choose to hold shares in inventory, wait for buyers, or redeem shares for Bitcoin at a later time. This means that inflows and outflows often lag actual market activity, and short-term daily numbers may not accurately reflect investor sentiment or trading pressure.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © LALAKA / Shutterstock.com Shares of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) are up about $3.55 in premarket. All on news OpenAI is in talks with the e-commerce giant about an investment that could exceed $10 billion. It could also include an agreement to use Amazon AI chips, too. This comes not long after OpenAI outlined the details of its relationship with Microsoft. According to CNBC, that relationship will also allow it to raise capital and partner with other AI companies. In addition, Amazon ran higher on news that it will invest $35 billion across India through 2030. By 2030, the investment is expected to quadruple exports to $80 billion. Technically, shares of Amazon just found support at $222.56, with overextensions on RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R. From its last traded price of $222.56, we’d like to see the stock initially break through its 50-day moving average at around $229.25 a share. Helping, Oppenheimer raised its price target for AMZN from $290 to $305, noting that Amazon Web Services (AWS) could double its capacity through 2027, and serve as a key stock catalyst. Severely oversold shares of Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) are showing big signs of life, too. At the moment, it’s up about $2.35 a share in premarket. After gapping lower on AI data center spending fears, the tech giant appears to have caught strong support at $188.65. It’s also overextended on RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R. From here, we’d like to see ORCL initially refill its bearish gap at around $220 a share. Longer-term, we’d like to see ORCL retest $260 a share. Fueling upside, Mizuho analysts say ORCL is among its top enterprise stocks for 2026. The firm says 2025 was a “transformative” year for the company, as it went from “an emerging cloud vendor into a key AI infrastructure player,” as quoted by Seeking Alpha. “We see Oracle as a [long-term] AI beneficiary given its end-to-end stack, including apps, its industry-leading database for mission-critical workloads, and OCI for AI training and inference,” they added. The firm also has an outperform rating on the stock with a price target of $400. Shares of Micron (NASDAQ: MU) are up about $4.40 a share in premarket. The company, which is expected to post earnings after the bell tonight, also received a buy rating from analysts at Needham. In fact, Needham analysts just reiterated a buy on MU with a price target of $300 a share. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo believes MU will benefit from the dynamic random-access market (DRAM), which is expected to grow by about 100%. Fueling upside, TrendForce just increased its 2025 and 2026 DRAM industry estimates, according to Wells Fargo. They now expect to see 2025 DRAM revenues of $165.7 billion, or 73% year-over-year growth. They also expect to see 2026 DRAM revenues of $333.5 billion, or 101% year-over-year growth. Technically, MU is challenging its 50-day moving average, which has served as support for the stock since September.

Title: Most Influential: Carlos Domingo

Time Published: 2025-12-17T15:00:00Z

Eight years after co-founding Securitize in 2017, Carlos Domingo is steering what has quietly become one of the core infrastructure players of the tokenized asset trade. This feature is a part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2025 list. The firm says it has about $3.6 billion in tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) outstanding as of late November and expects to finish the year above $4 billion in assets under management. Securitize is profitable — revenue has grown roughly 10x over the past 18 months — and the firm is preparing to go public via a SPAC merger with Cantor Fitzgerald’s vehicle, with a listing targeted for early next year. “This has been the best year in the company's history, by far,” Domingo said in an interview with CoinDesk. “It’s been the inflection point we’d been waiting for.” If tokenization is one of crypto’s big narratives now, Domingo is quick to point out that Securitize was there when it decidedly wasn’t. “In 2021 I would talk to investors and they’d say, ‘Why would we invest in tokenization? Look at FTX, Celsius, BlockFi, they’re growing so fast,’” he said. “I’d say, ‘Sure, but are you sure those guys will be around tomorrow?’ There were a lot of red flags. Still, we were not the cool kids on the block.” It was a challenging path. Securitize had to raise fresh funding roughly every 18 months, with modest rounds compared to the mega-raises going to unregulated trading platforms. Hiring talent was harder, too. “We couldn’t give people big token packages. We couldn’t pay the highest salaries,” Domingo said. What kept him going was conviction and a bit of survivalist philosophy. “One of our board members, Brad Stephens from Blockchain Capital, told me: you need to be like a cockroach,” Domingo said. “Digitization of any industry is unavoidable, the only thing you don’t know is when. So you need to make sure you don’t die before it happens.” He’s blunt about what happened to early tokenization rivals. “If you look at the companies that looked like they were going to dominate, most disappeared, ran out of money or sold on bad terms,” he said. “Being early is a problem if you don’t survive.” Carlos Domingo will be speaking at CoinDesk's upcoming Consensus Hong Kong in February and Consensus 2026 in Miami in May. When Securitize launched, Domingo thought he was building a software company. “The original idea was to sell a tokenization platform as technology,” he recalled. Banks, asset managers and other issuers would license the stack, tokenize their assets and handle everything themselves. Securitize would just ship code. It took less than a year for reality to bite. “In 2018 it became very clear we needed to pivot from being a technology provider to being a service provider,” he said. “The people that have financial assets are not technology companies. They expect somebody to provide service to them – that’s what BNY, State Street or SS&C do.” That led Securitize to pursue licenses and roles that live deep in the plumbing of traditional finance. The firm became a registered transfer agent in the U.S., then added a broker-dealer, an alternative trading system (ATS), an investment adviser and fund administration capabilities. The transformation culminated with the acquisition of MG Stover’s unit, turning Securitize into the largest digital-asset fund administrator. Today, instead of selling a tokenization toolkit, Domingo pitches a one-stop shop to bring assets onchain. “We go to an asset manager and say: we’ll form the fund, we’ll put your securities onchain, we’ll integrate with the blockchains and DeFi, we’ll do distribution, fund admin, everything,” he said. “You do what you do well — manage assets. We do everything else.” He traces that strategy back to a dog-eared copy of “Crossing the Chasm,” Geoffrey Moore’s classic on commercializing new technologies. The core idea: early adopters are happy to stitch together multiple vendors; the mainstream market is not. “To cross the chasm, you have to offer the whole product,” Domingo said. “People are not going to piecemeal build things by putting together five different providers." The company has now moved far beyond survival, lining up a powerful roster of backers including BlackRock, Jump Crypto and Cathie Wood's ARK Invest. Securitize helped bring BlackRock’s tokenized fund to market last year and has since expanded it across multiple blockchains, including Solana and BNB Chain. It’s currently the largest tokenized U.S. Treasury offering, with a roughly $2.5 billion market cap. It also lined up a powerful roster of backers Ark Invest, BlackRock and Jump Crypto. Domingo said the important shift isn’t just about putting securities on a “better ledger,” but, instead, what happens after that. The use case he emphasized is collateral. “We’re very bullish on collateral,” he said. “You can take high-quality collateral like people use in TradFi, but move it at crypto speed, 24/7, with the quality of collateral institutions expect.” Securitize has worked with venues like Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange by volume, on using tokenized RWAs as collateral in derivatives and other products. It's the kind of plumbing that doesn’t trend on social media, but it’s where Domingo sees tokenization starting to matter for the broader crypto market structure. The SPAC listing is both a milestone and a new kind of pressure. “I’m very excited about finally going public. It’s going to be a defining moment for us,” he said. “It’s also scary. I’ve never been CEO of a publicly traded company.” While Securitize’s year may look like an overnight success, from Domingo’s point of view, it’s the delayed payoff for being early and refusing to leave. “Now it’s not about whether the industry is happening or not,” he said. “It’s about how much market share we can capture and retain. We’ve been talking about this for eight years. Finally, everybody else is talking about it too.” More For You Protocol Research: GoPlus Security What to know: More For You Foundation behind restaking protocol EigenLayer plans bigger rewards for active users An Incentives Committee would direct programmatic token emissions, focusing allocations on participants that secure AVSs and contribute to the EigenCloud ecosystem.

Title: Did Bitcoin's 4-year cycle break, and is the bull market really over?

Bitcoin ETFs, corporate treasuries and macro tailwinds are challenging BTC’s traditional four-year cycle, which could result in new all-time highs in 2026. Key takeaways: ETFs, treasuries and macro tailwinds may snap Bitcoin’s four-year boom-and-bust pattern. A bearish phase should not be ruled out before new all-time highs. Bitcoin (BTC) has historically moved in four-year cycles tied to its halving events, with prices typically peaking 12-18 months after each supply cut before sliding into a prolonged bear market. This time was no different. Bitcoin peaked near $126,200 in October, exactly eighteen months after the April 2024 halving, before declining by more than 30%. The trend aligns with the early stages of past bearish phases, prompting veteran analysts such as Peter Brandt to see Bitcoin falling toward $25,000 in the coming months. João Wedson, founder of onchain analytics company Alphractal, pointed to the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) Trend Signal, a metric signaling the end of Bitcoin’s bull market. Historically, SOPR marked market turning points by tracking shifts between profit-taking and loss-driven selling. In bull markets, SOPR stayed above 1 as coins were sold at a profit, often preceding local tops. Near the bottom, it fell toward or below 1, signaling a realization of loss. A sustained recovery above 1 later marked easing sell pressure and past rebounds. As of December, SOPR was trending lower, showing BTC was being spent at smaller profits or at a loss. This supported the bearish narrative based on the four-year cycle. “You may believe that Bitcoin’s cycles have changed and that this time is different,” Wedson said, adding: Multiple market observers noted that Bitcoin’s four-year cycle may no longer be applicable, however. On Monday, US-based Grayscale Investments predicted that BTC’s price would reach a new record high in the first half of 2026, citing a growing macro demand due to currency debasement and a supportive regulatory environment in the US. “Fiat currencies (and assets denominated in fiat currencies) face additional risks due to high and rising public sector debt and its potential implications for inflation over time,” Grayscale wrote in its latest report, adding: Fidelity shared a similar bullish outlook in its 2026 crypto outlook report. The investment company discussed the odds of Bitcoin entering a “supercycle,” analogous to commodity supercycles in the 2000s that spanned nearly a decade. Related: Bitcoin’s four-year cycle is intact, but driven by politics and liquidity: Analyst Central to this view is what Chris Kuiper, Fidelity Digital Assets’ vice president of research, called an “entirely new cohort and class of investors,” which could support a longer market expansion than in past cycles. “We’ve seen traditional money managers and investors begin to buy Bitcoin and other digital assets,” he said, adding: As of December, US Bitcoin ETFs backed by BlackRock, Fidelity, and others collectively held over 1.30 million BTC (~$114.13 billion), a 309% increase since their debut in January 2024. At the same time, public companies held over 1.08 million (~$100.42 billion) in their treasuries, an investor cohort that hardly existed before 2020. With Bitcoin miners’ role decreasing with each halving, new demand from ETFs and corporate treasuries may be altering the boom-and-bust dynamics that have historically defined Bitcoin’s four-year cycle.

Since early 2022, just before widespread AI-hype, U.S. job-openings as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics have fallen from roughly 12.1 million to about 7.7 million, a decline of approximately 36%. Over the same period, the S&P 500’s total return (price plus dividends) is roughly 48%, reflecting strong equity markets. Conventional wisdom would tell you a booming stock market should create more jobs, not fewer. But it’s hard to ignore that there are larger forces at play, and a potential harbinger of how companies are starting to view their workforces. According to a new report from the Institute for Corporate Productivity (i4cp), 2026 will be the year that large companies stop treating AI merely as a productivity tool and start wielding it as a strategic lever for workforce restructuring. That’s a far cry from the typical corporate talking points. How many times have we heard executives tout AI as a thought partner, a collaborator, a productivity accelerator? Or as a catalyst for upskilling and repurposing people? And yet, we’re already seeing evidence of this trend. In 2025 alone, UPS cut 48,000, Amazon eliminated 14,000 jobs, and Verizon announced plans to lay off 15,000 employees. The reason for all these cuts? While restructuring, the need for different skills, and business optimization are all frequently cited, increasingly AI is as well. In fact, a World Economic Forum survey found 41% of companies worldwide expect to reduce their workforces over the next five years because of the rise of AI. Reduction doesn’t just mean layoffs; AI is also being used as a reason hiring has slowed in many companies. Of course, not all layoffs or hiring slowdowns will be AI-driven. Some of these changes reflect broader economic “cooling” after the post-COVID hiring boom. Other layoffs are designed to instill more agility in workforces, with some prominent CEOs such as Amazon’s Andy Jassy saying as much. But workers should adjust their expectations and recognize that some companies aren’t fretting about whether or not their employees can adapt to AI. Instead they’re using layoffs as a way to accelerate that adaption. Using AI-driven layoffs as a strategic lever dovetails with three other trends i4cp sees emerging or strengthening in 2026. The first is the need for organizations to be more skills-based. i4cp research shows that companies with high “skills readiness,” or the confidence that their workforce has the skills needed for the next three years, are 12 times more likely to offer upskilling to employees. They are also six times more likely to have cataloged the skills and capabilities of their workforces, and are six times more likely to determine which tasks are best performed by humans versus AI, and vice versa. For decades companies have asked “How many employees do we need?” Instead, high-performing organizations are increasingly asking, “What work needs to be done and who (or what) has the capabilities to do it?” Already, companies like Target and Dow are using custom GPT tools and AI-powered interview guides to help managers connect skills data to business decisions in real time. The path is clear: skills will be the shared language connecting business strategy, tech and talent. In addition to upskilling efforts, i4cp also expects that by the end of 2026, it won’t be uncommon for some professionals to have a personal AI “work twin,” or a digital counterpart trained on their workflows, communication styles and task patterns. While this evolution won’t happen overnight and still seems somewhat in the realm of science fiction, high-performing companies are already realizing that AI isn’t just a tool, but a teammate. Such collaboration will bring new management concerns, such as, “When an employee leaves, does the twin remain?” Or “How do we measure productivity when part of the workforce never sleeps?” This leap in digital work twins will require new governance, new leadership development programs and new mindsets. Best-in-class companies will treat the AI-human relationship as a trust partnership, experimenting with what work is best suited for AI agents versus humans. While twins obviously can be a significant productivity multiplier, companies will need to ensure that doesn’t happen at the expense of organizational culture. All of this shifting also means that leading companies will have more fluid, modular workforces, with systems in place that can match emerging work needs with available capabilities. This will require managers and HR leaders to continuously shape and redeploy teams (of both humans and digital contributors), akin to managing a supply chain rather than a static roster. The organizations that thrive next year and beyond will embrace fluid workforces, treat skills as the company operating system, and work with AI as a trusted collaborator. The defining factor for success will ultimately be which firms navigate this transformation without sacrificing the human elements that ultimately drive growth and innovation.

Given most years since 2021, the grant celebrates barrier-breaking individuals who unify people behind bold solutions to often neglected challenges. The no-strings-attached prize money can be used however honorees want to pursue their charitable goals. The Neurodiversity Alliance began over 25 years ago as a peer-to-peer mentorship program for students with various learning and developmental differences such as autism, ADHD and dyslexia. The nonprofit now reaches more than 600 high schools and colleges, encouraging youth to build educational environments that serve classmates whose brains function differently from what is considered typical. Other award winners announced Wednesday include Ilana Walder-Biesanz of National Math Stars, which supports young mathematicians, and Richard Rusczyk of The Mathcounts Foundation, which provides engaging math programs to middle school students. Kara Ball from Understood.org, a nonprofit that, like the Neurodiversity Alliance, supports those with learning differences including ADHD and dyslexia also received a $5 million award. The Bezoses, who tied the knot this summer in a lavish Venice ceremony that drew protests highlighting wealth inequality, did not release any explanation for their support of the cause. The Amazon founder’s net worth sits around $240 billion, according to Forbes, making him the fourth richest person in the world. Bezos has previously shown an interest in early childhood education through his nonprofit network of tuition-free preschools inspired by the Montessori model. Sánchez Bezos grew up with undiagnosed dyslexia. She told “Good Morning America” last year that her children’s book, “The Fly Who Flew to Space,” is for “the 8-year-old me who was told I wasn’t smart.” She credited a college professor, who recruited her to the school newspaper despite her insistence that she could not spell, for encouraging her to get tested. The selection of Flink marks a departure from the award’s previous higher profile recipients. Past honorees include CNN political commentator Van Jones, World Central Kitchen founder José Andrés, actor-director Eva Longoria and country superstar Dolly Parton. The shift reflects a desire to get the money closer to the ground rather than let well-known figures distribute money to the nonprofits of their choice. The smaller scale approach differs from many of Bezos’ ultra wealthy peers, according to an Indiana University professor emeritus in public affairs and philanthropic studies. Leslie Lenkowsky said that today’s entrepreneur-philanthropists — Bill Gates, for example — tend to focus on systemic change in the realms of health or education. “Rather than trying to change the system, what they’re trying to do is provide funding to individuals or communities to deal with important issues,” Lenkowsky said of the Bezoses. “It really is a much older model of philanthropy.” The award’s size is also smaller this year. Five winners are equally splitting a $25 million pot whereas past awards have totaled as much as $100 million. Flink said the money will help the alliance meet its goal of reaching more than 2,000 sites by 2028. He promised to invest in growing the mentorship program, telling more stories that challenge negative narratives about neurodiversity and expanding the national network of student leaders who get training to sustain their schools’ clubs. He said this support is especially important when “the demand has never been greater” and they’ve witnessed “some oscillation” in the resources that schools receive. The Trump administration’s dismantling of the Education Department has included mass layoffs at the agency charged with addressing complaints that students with disabilities are not receiving adequate support from their schools. Earlier this month, the department brought back dozens of Office for Civil Rights staffers, saying their help is needed to tackle a growing backlog of discrimination complaints. Kala Shah, an attorney whose 24-year tenure at the Department of Education included enforcing protections for students with disabilities, said that neurodivergent students depend on that oversight. “This is an especially critical time for private foundations and philanthropy to help fill the gap in resources that’s been created by the current federal climate,” she said. __ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Today’s top news: Two separate announcements today pointed in the same direction. Stablecoins are moving deeper into the U.S. financial system. First, Visa expanded its USDC settlement program to U.S. banks, enabling participating institutions to settle obligations using Circle’s USDC on Solana. The expansion allows banks and payment firms to move funds outside of traditional banking hours, with onchain settlement finality and integration into Visa’s existing treasury and reconciliation systems. Visa has previously tested stablecoin settlement internationally and with select partners, but this marks a broader U.S. rollout. At the same time, the FDIC approved a proposed rulemaking to implement the GENIUS Act, outlining how FDIC-supervised banks could issue payment stablecoins through subsidiaries. The proposal describes application requirements, governance standards, reserve and liquidity expectations, and ongoing supervisory oversight. Banks would be required to maintain high-quality reserves backing issued stablecoins and operate within defined risk-management and compliance frameworks. “Visa is expanding stablecoin settlement because our banking partners are not only asking about it—they’re preparing to use it” - Visa’s Global Head of Growth Products and Strategic Partnerships Rubail Birwadker “Fintech and crypto innovators increasingly ask us to bring stablecoins into their existing product suite.” - Gilles Gade, founder, president, and CEO of Cross River Bank A powerful milestone in the mainstream adoption and acceptance of USDC, with Visa announcing that all US card issuers (banks, fintechs, crypto firms) can now settle directly with Visa using USDC.

Dollar digital… pic.twitter.com/c7ilmCrXWY — Jeremy Allaire - jda.eth / jdallaire.sol (@jerallaire) December 16, 2025 Stablecoins are increasingly being treated as payments infrastructure rather than a niche crypto product. Visa’s expansion shows how large payment networks are integrating stablecoins into existing systems, while the FDIC’s proposal outlines the framework banks would use to issue and manage them. The combination matters. Institutional adoption tends to accelerate once large financial intermediaries and regulators move in the same direction.

Title: Former SEC counsel explains what it takes to make RWAs compliant
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/former-sec-counsel-ownership-rwa-compliant
Time Published: 2025-12-17T13:45:00Z
Full Content:
The SEC’s changing approach to crypto is supporting RWA growth, but jurisdictional and yield constraints continue to limit compliant models. The key constraint on real-world assets (RWAs) has been regulatory engagement rather than technology, and that dynamic has been shifting in the US, said Ashley Ebersole, chief legal officer of Sologenic. Ebersole joined the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in early 2015, where he served in the agency’s early internal working groups on crypto and the application of securities law to blockchain-based assets. The securities regulator published the DAO Report in 2017, asserting its jurisdiction over tokens that met the definition of securities. What followed was an enforcement-led approach that left little room for sustained dialogue with the industry. “After the DAO Report, it was an enforcement response for the next two years. I expected there would be more of a rotation toward policy while I was still there — that didn’t happen,” he told Cointelegraph. Ebersole said that posture hardened after he left the agency, shortly before Gary Gensler took the helm in April 2021. From private practice, he continued engaging with the SEC until staff were later discouraged from interacting with crypto firms. The communication breakdown made it difficult for companies to design legally compliant RWA products and delayed the development of onchain securities models that are now moving into production. The market for tokenized real-world assets is scaling quickly. Standard Chartered has projected that the value of non-stablecoin RWAs could reach $2 trillion by 2028, driven largely by tokenized equities, funds and other traditional financial instruments migrating onto blockchains. Major financial institutions are positioning for that shift. BlackRock is reportedly exploring tokenization to modernize fund infrastructure, while JPMorgan has launched tokenized money-market products on Ethereum. “There is a right way to do compliant tokenization and issue tokenized assets. It absolutely can be done,” Ebersole said. Related: Ronin and ZKsync’s onchain metrics fell the most in 2025 One model he pointed to involves stock tokens that function similarly to depository receipts. When a user purchases a token, a corresponding share is acquired and held by a regulated clearing broker, while a token is minted to represent contractual rights to that share. “You own it. It’s minted at the time of purchase, and it references contractual rights to a share of stock that was purchased at the same time,” Ebersole said. Ebersole said this approach differs from other tokenized stock products that offer price exposure without conferring ownership. In those cases, stock tokens function as synthetic instruments that track the price of an equity without granting shareholder rights or a legal claim on the underlying asset. The distinction remains relevant today. In late July, Robinhood promoted tokenized exposure linked to OpenAI. The private company publicly distanced itself from the product and said that any transfer of its equity requires approval, which did not occur. Interest in tokenized RWAs is accelerating, but Ebersole warned that it does not eliminate the geographical constraints of securities regulation. In practice, many RWA initiatives run into legal and jurisdictional limits. Securities laws remain nationally bound even if blockchain infrastructure is not. An RWA structure that complies with US requirements does not automatically translate to the European Union or Asian markets, where separate licensing, disclosure and distribution rules apply. “The toughest thing we hear about with tokenized RWA projects is the maze of legal requirements that apply to these assets if you’re doing them in a fully legally compliant way,” Ebersole said. “That’s true in the US, and it’s even more complicated globally.” Related: How crypto is used in 2025: YouTube, Pokémon cards and more That fragmentation has pushed many platforms toward region-specific offerings. Robinhood’s tokenization offering is limited to EU users. It allows trading in tokenized US stocks and exchange-traded products but does not confer direct ownership of the underlying shares. Instead, the tokens mirror the prices of publicly traded securities and are regulated as blockchain-based derivatives under the bloc’s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II). Yield is another area where RWA tokenization often runs into regulatory friction. Ebersole noted that regulators draw a sharp distinction between yield generated through a holder’s own actions — such as participating in transaction validation — and yield that accrues passively simply by holding a token. “If you buy an asset with an inherent yield just by virtue of holding it, regulators are still going to look at that as the hallmark of a security,” he said. That distinction has already shaped enforcement decisions and continues to influence how tokenized products are structured. While regulatory views on staking and other forms of yield have evolved under the current SEC administration, Ebersole said inherent yield remains a sensitive trigger under current law. The practical shift for RWAs has come from a change in how the SEC approaches the industry. During an enforcement-heavy period under the Gensler-led SEC, when staff were discouraged from engaging with crypto firms, would-be issuers were left without a workable path to build compliant onchain products, even when attempting to operate within existing securities law. That posture has begun to soften as the agency signals greater openness to engagement. Ebersole pointed to recent leadership changes at the SEC, including the arrival of Paul Atkins, as contributing to a tone that treats blockchain technology as infrastructure with potential applications for securities markets rather than as an inherent regulatory risk. “Now the SEC is engaging a lot with the industry and saying, ‘Come in and tell us if you are trying to do what we’re trying to do, how would you do it?’” Ebersole said. In that environment, compliant models such as tokenized equities structured through regulated intermediaries and custody arrangements can move from concept to production, even as legal friction persists around cross-border distribution and yield-bearing designs that can still trigger additional securities obligations. Existing securities law continues to govern RWAs, but the move away from an enforcement-only posture does not, in Ebersole’s view, foreclose the possibility of more tailored rules over time if regulators and the market continue working through remaining gaps.

Mega billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez Bezos have donated $5 million to David Flink, founder of the Neurodiversity Alliance NEW YORK -- Mega billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and his wife, former news anchor Lauren Sánchez Bezos, are awarding $5 million to the founder of a neurodivergent student support network, a recognition that the lesser-known recipient credits to the students powering his fast-growing movement for more inclusive classrooms. “I feel like there’s a narrative sometimes that our little actions don’t matter,” Neurodiversity Alliance CEO David Flink said. "That’s just not true. And this proves it. Lots of little actions that happen every day in our work, collectively over time, reached the ears of folks like Lauren and Jeff.” Flink is among this year's five winners of the Bezos Courage & Civility Award. Given most years since 2021, the grant celebrates barrier-breaking individuals who unify people behind bold solutions to often neglected challenges. The no-strings-attached prize money can be used however honorees want to pursue their charitable goals. The Neurodiversity Alliance began over 25 years ago as a peer-to-peer mentorship program for students with various learning and developmental differences such as autism, ADHD and dyslexia. The nonprofit now reaches more than 600 high schools and colleges, encouraging youth to build educational environments that serve classmates whose brains function differently from what is considered typical. The Bezoses, who tied the knot this summer in a lavish Venice ceremony that drew protests highlighting wealth inequality, did not release any explanation for their support of the cause. The Amazon founder's net worth sits around $240 billion, according to Forbes, making him the fourth richest person in the world. Bezos has previously shown an interest in early childhood education through his nonprofit network of tuition-free preschools inspired by the Montessori model. Sánchez Bezos grew up with undiagnosed dyslexia. She told “Good Morning America” last year that her children’s book, “The Fly Who Flew to Space," is for "the 8-year-old me who was told I wasn't smart." She credited a college professor, who recruited her to the school newspaper despite her insistence that she could not spell, for encouraging her to get tested. The selection of Flink marks a departure from the award's previous higher profile recipients. Past honorees include CNN political commentator Van Jones, World Central Kitchen founder José Andrés, actor-director Eva Longoria and country superstar Dolly Parton. The shift reflects a desire to get the money closer to the ground rather than let well-known figures distribute money to the nonprofits of their choice. The smaller scale approach differs from many of Bezos’ ultra wealthy peers, according to an Indiana University professor emeritus in public affairs and philanthropic studies. Leslie Lenkowsky said that today’s entrepreneur-philanthropists — Bill Gates, for example — tend to focus on systemic change in the realms of health or education. “Rather than trying to change the system, what they’re trying to do is provide funding to individuals or communities to deal with important issues,” Lenkowsky said of the Bezoses. “It really is a much older model of philanthropy.” The award's size is also smaller this year. Five winners are equally splitting a $25 million pot whereas past awards have totaled as much as $100 million.

Five winners are equally splitting a $25 million pot whereas past awards have totaled as much as $100 million. Flink said the money will help the alliance meet its goal of reaching more than 2,000 sites by 2028. He promised to invest in growing the mentorship program, telling more stories that challenge negative narratives about neurodiversity and expanding the national network of student leaders who get training to sustain their schools’ clubs. He said this support is especially important when “the demand has never been greater” and they’ve witnessed “some oscillation” in the resources that schools receive. The Trump administration’s dismantling of the Education Department has included mass layoffs at the agency charged with addressing complaints that students with disabilities are not receiving adequate support from their schools. Earlier this month, the department brought back dozens of Office for Civil Rights staffers, saying their help is needed to tackle a growing backlog of discrimination complaints. Kala Shah, an attorney whose 24-year tenure at the Department of Education included enforcing protections for students with disabilities, said that neurodivergent students depend on that oversight. “This is an especially critical time for private foundations and philanthropy to help fill the gap in resources that’s been created by the current federal climate,” she said. __ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the industry-owned clearing and settlement market infrastructure, has selected the privacy-focused Canton Network as a tokenization partner, the companies said on Tuesday. The partnership, which will enable a subset of U.S. Treasury securities custodied at DTC to be minted on the Canton Network, follows DTCC’s recent receipt of a No-Action Letter from the SEC to implement and operate a new service to tokenize real-world, DTC-custodied assets. The organizations are working towards an MVP in a controlled production environment during the first half of 2026, with plans to expand the project's size and scope in the months that follow, based on client interest, according to the press release. “DTCC’s partnership with Digital Asset and the Canton Network is a strategic step forward as we collaborate across the industry to build a digital infrastructure that seamlessly bridges the traditional and digital financial ecosystems and provides unmatched scalability and safety,” said Frank LaSalla, CEO of DTCC. The Canton Network was designed to enable institutions to issue and trade tokenized real-world assets, such as bonds, loans, and funds, on a shared ledger while maintaining privacy and compliance with legal requirements. Digital Asset, the firm behind Canton, is backed by powerful Wall Street firms including BlackRock, Blackstone, Nasdaq, S&P Global, Goldman Sachs, and Citadel Securities. In addition to the tokenization initiative, DTCC will assume a leadership position within the Canton Network’s decentralized governance structure, joining the Canton Foundation as co-chair alongside Euroclear. This new role will enable DTCC to actively participate in setting industry-wide standards for decentralized financial infrastructure, the companies said. “DTCC’s leadership in this space not only accelerates industry adoption but establishes a foundation for meaningful innovation, unlocking new liquidity opportunities, products, and operational improvements,” said Yuval Rooz, Co-Founder and CEO of Digital Asset.

Title: I tried to do all my Christmas shopping at Costco in one trip. Here are the 12 best gifts and deals I found.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/christmas-gift-shopping-costco-2025-best-presents-deals
Time Published: 2025-12-17T12:58:01Z
Full Content:
I've long been a fan of Costco and its mega-sized product offerings, especially when it comes to items my family uses a lot. I often hit the warehouse store for essentials, like milk and coffee, and have even trusted Costco to handle my Thanksgiving dinner in years past. However, I haven't used my membership to shop for my holiday gifting and entertaining needs until this year. Recently, I headed to my local Costco in search of seasonal deals and any items that would come in handy for all the holiday entertaining my family does — and I was pleasantly surprised. Here are 12 of the best offerings I discovered while shopping at Costco this holiday season. Whether you're picking up this Dyson stick vac to help yourself get the house clean after all those holiday gatherings, or you're gifting it to someone else, $230 off is a pretty impressive deal. This wet/dry vacuum is typically priced over $500, but Costco members can grab it for just $330 through the end of December. As someone with lots of pets and a family of four to clean up after, this is an item I'd gladly pick up for myself or add to my Christmas wish list. The holidays are all about time spent together, but sometimes it's nice to get a break from all the cooking (and clean-up) that comes along with this time of year. My 17-year-old son and 15-year-old daughter love eating cinnamon rolls after we open gifts on Christmas morning, but I love the idea of making my morning easier with premade options. This pan of Kirkland Signature heat-and-serve cinnamon rolls is just $13. The time I'll save on Christmas morning alone makes them worth the price, which works out to about $2 per roll. My husband enjoys cooking just as much as I do, and we love using our Vitamix for everything from making soups to creating fun homemade ice creams. A Vitamix would make a perfect gift for any foodie on your holiday shopping list, and the $100 discount is an even greater reason to pick one up at Costco. These savings are also a good excuse to pick one up for yourself, too. A big fan of holiday charcuterie boards throughout the season, I squealed when I found this cute two-pack kit containing kits to make a chalet and tree out of meats, cheeses, olives, and other bites. For $20, it's a great item to pick up and store in the fridge for impromptu holiday gatherings or as a fun way to impress dinner guests. I grabbed a $15 robe for my teenage daughter, as she had been asking for something cozy to wear while getting ready for quite a while. Available in pink and white, these fluffy Room Service robes are usually $19 at Costco, but were $4 off during my trip. Other Room Service robes cost twice as much online, so this felt like a great Costco-exclusive deal to me. I have fond memories of a neighbor who brought me Costco chicken pot pies to help simplify dinnertime both times I had a baby. Since then, they've become something I take to friends who are sick, grieving, or need a little pick-me-up. The ready-to-bake pies are packed with chicken, can serve a large group, and are so easy to pop in the oven. They're great for keeping on hand to feed unexpected guests, or to take to holiday potlucks. Now is a great time to stock up on them, as they're $4 off. My teens see a lot of movies with their friends, so this AMC Theatres gift pack caught my eye right away. For about $40, you can gift the film enthusiast in your life two movie tickets and a $20 digital AMC gift card (perfect for using on snacks). During my shopping trip, the set was $5 off, bringing the total to just $35. This deal is perfect as a gift or stocking stuffer. A few years ago, my teen daughter started asking for her own Dyson hair dryer. I love mine, but I was hesitant to buy another for my kid, given the high price tag. However, the nearly $500 hair dryer is $130 off at Costco, making it just $360. This is one of the best prices I've seen. If there's ever been a time to buy a Dyson for your hair-care-obsessed teen, this may be it. I buy Sand + Fog candles often because they tend to smell amazing and last a long time. The brand's 57-ounce candles are originally $40, but are $6 off at Costco right now. The giant size means they're bound to last the recipient of your gift well into the new year. When I saw this deal on one of my favorite candle brands, I immediately started thinking of who they'd make great gifts for, from teachers to hairdressers. I'm always looking for stocking-stuffer ideas for my husband and teens, and these eos lip balms are exactly the type of thing I like to gift. After all, everyone could use a balm for chapped lips, especially throughout the cooler winter months. Right now, this pack of nine eos lip balms is on sale for $17 at Costco, meaning each costs less than $2. These $20 bouquets of two-dozen roses are my go-to hostess gift, birthday present, and treat for myself. Available in tons of colors, these Costco florals typically last for a long time and are an easy-but-elegant gift to grab for people on your list who may be hard to shop for. They're also perfect for displaying in your own home during the holiday entertaining season, so pick up an extra bouquet for yourself while you're loading up your cart. My teens complain about many hand-sanitizer brands, saying they smell bad or dry out their hands too much. Thankfully, they both like Touchland hand sanitizer sprays, so I keep them in my car and purse to use when we're on the go. While at Costco, I grabbed a four-pack of Touchland sprays for $30 to put into my family's stockings. This felt like a steal because Touchland normally charges $12 per sanitizer. I'd recommend stopping at Costco during the holiday season if you're looking for savings on electronics or ideas for affordable stocking stuffers. In addition to scoring big discounts on the bigger-ticket items my teens and husband have asked for, I grabbed several other gifts at Costco. The wholesale retailer is also a great spot for those entertaining guests this holiday season, whether they need premade cinnamon rolls or creative charcuterie displays. I'm a huge fan of lessening my own workload during the holidays so I can spend more time with my family, and Costco seemed to be the perfect place to do just that. Jump to

Speaking in the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday, MP Raghav Chadha pushed for a tokenization bill that would enable fractional ownership of real estate, infrastructure projects, and other traditionally expensive assets through digital tokens. Why does India need a 𝗧𝗼𝗸𝗲𝗻𝗶𝘀𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗕𝗶𝗹𝗹?I explained in Parliament today. pic.twitter.com/Ucw395cWpg — Raghav Chadha (@raghav_chadha) December 16, 2025 "Just as UPI (Unified Payments Interface) made digital payments inclusive in a way, similarly, to make investment and asset ownership inclusive, we will have to bring a law on tokenization in this country,” Chadha said. He noted that India’s middle class is largely confined to bank savings, mutual funds, and fixed deposits, and that tokenization could open high-return assets to them while providing instant, broker-free liquidity. Chadha said the nation now needs its own “bespoke legislation for asset tokenization” along with a dedicated regulatory sandbox to safely test new models. Such a framework, he argued, would make investment and ownership “truly inclusive for the common man,” while giving India the clarity required to attract global capital flows from hubs like Singapore, the UAE, and Hong Kong. Raj Kapoor, founder and CEO of the India Blockchain Alliance, told Decrypt that India stands at a “decisive inflection point in the evolution of global finance,” calling a dedicated tokenization bill “no longer optional… a strategic necessity to anchor India in the next financial architecture.” Such a law could unlock India-native tokenization of “infrastructure, MSMEs, real estate, carbon credits, gold, and receivables,” he noted, aligning tokenized instruments with existing securities and contract law. "Jurisdictions that provide legal clarity are rapidly becoming magnets for global capital," Kapoor said, noting that India remains, "constrained by regulatory ambiguity around tokenized assets" despite its leadership in the field of digital public infrastructure. “India needs a tokenization bill to retain economic sovereignty, ensuring Indian assets, capital formation, and innovation are tokenized onshore under Indian law, not exported to foreign jurisdictions,” he said. Without a clear statutory framework, Kapoor warned, India risks its assets, startups, and capital formation migrating offshore into friendlier jurisdictions, "often through complex SPVs that strip domestic value creation." His caution comes as global financial heavyweights are already signalling where the world is headed, with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and COO Rob Goldstein recently writing in The Economist that finance is "entering the next major evolution in market infrastructure" driven by blockchain-based tokenization, comparing today's stage to "the internet in 1996." Musheer Ahmed, Founder and MD of Finstep Asia, told Decrypt that while there is skepticism around crypto assets in India, "one needs to distinguish between the asset here being a crypto asset or digital asset, which may have a variety of use cases and concerns around cross-border or money laundering." A tokenization bill would establish clear rules for financial institutions, open high-value asset participation to the middle class, and place India alongside global leaders in next-generation financial innovation, Ahmed added.

"Is that the kind of future you want?" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said that he will push for a moratorium on the construction of AI data centers to ensure that the technology will be useful for the greatest number of Americans and not just the few multi-billionaires who are advocating for the widespread use of artificial intelligence. According to the senator’s X post, this delay “will give democracy a chance to catch up, and ensure that the benefits of technology work for all of us, not just the 1%.” Sanders raised three points in his short video: ‘Who is aggressively pushing AI?’; ‘What will AI and robotics mean economically for the working class of this country?’; and ‘Millions of kids in this country are becoming more and more isolated from real human relationships and are getting their emotional support from AI.’ I will be pushing for a moratorium on the construction of data centers that are powering the unregulated sprint to develop & deploy AI.The moratorium will give democracy a chance to catch up, and ensure that the benefits of technology work for all of us, not just the 1%. pic.twitter.com/PoV5ziA4oQDecember 16, 2025 The current AI build-out is largely driven by big tech companies, including OpenAI, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia, Oracle, and Meta, among others. With trillions of dollars being poured into the infrastructure required to support artificial intelligence, many experts are warning that it’s becoming unsustainable and that we are already in an AI bubble. Aside from this, Microsoft’s push for Copilot+ AI PCs did not deliver the sales it was expecting, with most consumers simply purchasing AI PCs because there’s no other option when upgrading from Windows 10. There have also been concerns about AI replacing people in the workforce. While this hasn’t resulted in widespread layoffs yet, MIT estimates that AI could replace up to 11.7% of American workers across industries, not just in tech. Even Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said that the widespread use of this technology could result in up to 20% unemployment within the next five years, with Ford CEO Jim Farley warning that it will wipe out nearly half of all entry-level white-collar jobs. Sanders also raised concerns about children using AI for companionship instead of building relationships with other people. “Think for a moment about a future when human beings are not interacting with each other and are spending virtually all of their time with devices instead of people,” Sanders said. “Is that the kind of future you want? Well, not me.” The senator from Vermont wants to halt all progress on AI data center construction to address these issues first. He also isn’t the only one concerned about the possible negative impacts of artificial intelligence on society, as Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and two other Democrat senators recently sent letters recently to several big tech companies asking them to explain how their AI data centers are impacting residential energy bills. These moves directly contradict the current administration’s goal of turning the U.S. into an AI powerhouse, with Trump signing an executive order for the so-called ‘Genesis Mission’ — an initiative to drive AI development across the country — and is even comparing its scale with the Manhattan Project.

Databricks has announced plans to raise more than $4bn in a Series L funding round that values the company at $134bn. The San Francisco-based data and AI company surpassed a $4.8bn revenue run-rate during its third quarter, with year-on-year growth of more than 55%. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more Experience unmatched clarity with a single platform that combines unique data, AI, and human expertise. Find out more The run-rate figure includes more than $1bn from its data warehousing business and more than $1bn from its AI products. The company has delivered positive free cash flow over the 12 months since December 2024. Insight Partners, Fidelity Management & Research Company, and JP Morgan Asset Management are leading the Series L investment. Additional investors in the round include Andreessen Horowitz, funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, funds managed by Blackstone, Robinhood Ventures and Thrive Capital. The funding will support product development in three strategic areas: Lakebase, Databricks Apps and Agent Bricks. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. The funding will be used to help customers develop AI applications and agent-based tools using their own proprietary data. The approach will position Lakebase as the system of record, Databricks Apps as the user-facing experience layer and Agent Bricks as the engine for multi-agent workflows. It linked this focus to what it called the parallel rise of “vibe coding” and generative AI (gen AI), which is accelerating the development of data data-intelligent applications in enterprises. Databricks Apps enables organisations to build and deploy data and AI applications quickly and securely. Agent Bricks is designed to simplify the creation and scaling of high-quality agents using an organisation’s own data. According to Databricks, Lakebase is a serverless PostgreSQL database designed specifically to support AI-era workloads. Databricks co-founder and CEO Ali Ghodsi stated: “Enterprises are rapidly reimagining how they build intelligent applications, and the convergence of generative AI with new coding paradigms is opening the door to entirely new workloads. “With this investment, we’re deepening our commitment to help every organisation innovate with AI on their own data.” In its first six months, Lakebase has drawn thousands of customers and is generating revenue growth at twice the pace of its data warehousing product. The Data Warehousing product reached a revenue run-rate of more than $1bn in less than four years from general availability. Databricks’ AI products have achieved a revenue run-rate of more than $1bn. Its net retention rate remains above 140% and more than 700 customers are consuming at an annual revenue run-rate of more than $1m. Databricks expects the new capital to support its growth and to be used to provide liquidity for employees. The company also said the investment is expected to support future AI acquisitions and deepen its AI research.

Title: BlackRock moves 47K Ethereum in a day: But the real story isn’t a sell-off

What are institutions seeing that retail traders are missing? Even as Ethereum’s price hesitates around the $3,000 price level, the institutional engine behind the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) is running at full speed. On the 16th of December, on-chain data flagged a massive $140 million transfer as BlackRock deposited 47,463 ETH into Coinbase Prime. Far from a simple “sell-off” signal, this move reflects the complex rebalancing needed to manage the leading spot Ethereum [ETH] ETF during heavy market liquidations. While retail traders hesitate, BlackRock’s major rebalancing shows strong institutional confidence, as ETF issuers must keep adjusting ETH holdings to match inflows. This strategy helps stabilize the fund during volatility and reinforces Ethereum’s growing acceptance in traditional finance. Though BlackRock remains the institutional “gold standard,” it is no longer the undisputed heavyweight in the Ethereum treasury race. As of mid-December, BlackRock’s ETHA fund holds approximately 3.7 million ETH (approx. $11 billion). However, this massive stash has officially been eclipsed by BitMine Immersion (BMNR). Under the leadership of Tom Lee, BitMine has aggressively expanded its treasury to nearly 4 million ETH, signaling a “MicroStrategy-style” accumulation play that prioritizes protocol-level dominance over simple ETF fee collection. The timing of BlackRock’s 47,463 ETH deposit follows a turbulent period for US-based Ethereum ETFs. On the 16th of December, Farside Investors’ data revealed a staggering net outflow of $221.3 million from BlackRock’s ETHA. This single-day redemption accounted for nearly 99% of the total $224.2 million pulled from all US Ethereum ETFs combined. All in all, this suggests that while the “institutional machinery” is moving funds on-chain, it is largely to facilitate heavy redemptions from investors who are rotating capital or de-risking amidst a lackluster Q4 performance for the asset. That being said, this institutional reshuffling occurred against a backdrop of technical fragility. At the time of reporting, Ethereum was trading at $2,935.44. Despite a microscopic 0.77% gain in a 24-hour window, the broader trend remains bearish with ETH plummeting by 11.58% over the past seven days, according to CoinMarketCap Hence, for BlackRock, the challenge is now two-fold: managing the logistics of massive ETF outflows while simultaneously defending a price floor that retail traders seem increasingly unwilling to support. This coincided with BlackRock’s recent $28.78 million acquisition of Ethereum, which the broader market has largely misread as mere price speculation. In reality, this move signalled BlackRock’s formal validation of Ethereum not as a “digital gold” alternative to Bitcoin, but as the essential financial infrastructure of the future. By securing this bundle of ETH, the world’s largest asset manager is effectively stockpiling the “fuel” necessary to run its BUIDL fund, which operates exclusively on the Ethereum blockchain. Ultimately, this acquisition shows BlackRock is no longer just participating in crypto, but actively building on Ethereum as mission-critical infrastructure for future global finance.

Title: Meet one of BlackRock's top technologists who is supercharging its investment teams with AI

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For 15 years, BlackRock's Kirsty Craig has operated as a kind of "translator" inside the world's largest asset manager, sitting between portfolio managers making big bets and engineers building the systems that help inform those decisions to get both sides aligned on driving returns. This skill set is part of what earned Craig, head of research, data, and AI strategy for portfolio management tech, the title of Tech Fellow, one of the firm's high technological distinctions, held by only two dozen of its thousands of engineers. Craig is one of five new fellows that the firm announced on December 16, recognized for supercharging the asset manager's investment team. This year, she is the only woman and the only fellow who works outside of Aladdin, the lucrative spine of BlackRock's investment technology. When it comes to her impact on how $13.5 trillion money manager BlackRock uses AI, Craig said she's especially proud of her role in Asimov, the agentic AI platform for the firm's fundamental equity business. The "virtual investment analyst" was unveiled by Chief Operating Officer Rob Goldstein at the firm's investor day in June. It leverages AI to automate workflows and research, as many firms race to adopt the technology to speed up what were once monthslong investment processes. Now, as a fellow, Craig is even more embedded in BlackRock's efforts to stay ahead, as the firm continues to center on technological prowess.

At first, Craig wasn't sure she'd become a tech fellow, largely because her work is different than most of the other fellows who work squarely within BlackRock's data analytics and risk platform, Aladdin. Her team of around 60 software engineers, data engineers, and data scientists "sits at the horizontal" across various investment capabilities to help drive investment research. She found out about the honor at the beginning of the month when a meeting was added to her calendar. When she heard the news, Craig started by telling the manager who had nominated her, her sponsor during the application process, her team, and her family, "but they've got no idea what it means," she told Business Insider. Nish Ajitsaria, BlackRock's co-head of Aladdin product engineering and the co-executive sponsor of the fellows program, said that existing tech fellows knew Craig not only for her innovation with AI in investing, but for her collaborative efforts. He described Craig as an "AI native," and added that her team is at the "tip of the spear" when it comes to applying AI to investment. Craig's time at different offices — Edinburgh, San Francisco, and now Philadelphia — has, she thinks, given her a strong foundation of horizontal leadership across teams. "I am responsible for really trying to find the dial movers across data, AI, and technology that really help our investment pillars drive investment research," she said of her work. Craig has learned how to communicate with both investors and Aladdin technologists, and said that building deep trust with both groups has been key to her success. "If you put both of those different personalities or personas together, quite often they're talking above or below each other. They struggle to connect. So for me, it's really been being able to translate both and then come up with a strategy in the middle," she said. For Craig, being a woman in a position of visible leadership is "a huge honor." Of the 24 tech fellows, five are women, including Craig. Women make up 43.8% of BlackRock's global workforce and 33.1% of senior leadership, according to data from January 1, 2025, posted on the firm's site. Craig said being involved in BlackRock's women and LGBTQ+ resource groups has informed her other work at the firm, especially in how they've taught her how to collaborate with people from across divisions and explain complicated topics. "If anything has probably helped me with, one, building my network; two, softer presentation skills; and then three, around how to communicate with impact," Craig said. With the title, she hopes to help more junior female technologists "lean in." For Ajitsaria, it's also important to have a diversity of expertise in the program and ensure that fellows represent all arms of BlackRock. When it comes to driving technology strategy itself, Craig said she's excited to keep figuring out how to leverage AI in active investing. Right now, her team is thinking about how to expand the scope of agentic research, potentially to areas like fixed income and macro investing. As she continues to soak up the news, Craig is also preparing for a very different big life change. Her partner is scheduled to give birth in early January, so, with the due date mere weeks away, Craig said they've kept all celebrating fairly tame so far. "We did go out for a meal. Nothing has been purchased, apart from cribs and bottles," she said. "Definitely some more celebrating will be done post January 6." Jump to

The story ended for her when Amara was sentenced as a terrorist. Or so she thought. Nearly two decades on, a now-paroled Amara reached out. Initially dubious about his claims of rehabilitation, Shephard takes the time to get to know him over several months; the resulting piece is profound. Shephard discovers Amara to be sincere in his search for redemption, but finds that the police and the prison system played no part in his turnaround. Instead, a few key individuals and Amara’s own reading and writing influenced him. But it is not just Amara that has changed. In reviewing her reporting from 20 years ago, Shephard finds herself discomfited by its sensationalist tone, noting that “[a] right-wing blog calling our coverage a triumph of ‘beat reporting over political correctness’ made me feel queasy.” She returns to Amara’s story with a nuanced perspective on how radicalization has “many factors and stages that can last years before police are involved,” and awareness that deradicalization programs need “an intense one-on-one approach involving mentors who have credibility with vulnerable youths.” It is rare—and brave—to review your work with 20 years of hindsight, and while Shephard claims no regrets in her previous reporting, there’s more than one redemption story here. The same writer and subject, a new insight. —CW Clint Rainey | Fast Company | January 7, 2025 | 2,530 words A few months ago, I took my daughter to Pretend City, a children’s museum in Southern California that’s laid out like a miniature town. You can imagine the chaos inside such a space, with children running around pretending to be adults that have things to do and places to be. The grocery store is such a place, and in this kid-sized city, it manifests as a big and boldly branded Trader Joe’s, with colorful wall ads and adorably packaged products. As my daughter enthusiastically selected fake food off the shelves, I had a realization. While I haven’t shopped at Trader Joe’s in ages, I’ve continued to view the brand fondly and positively, ever since shopping there in my 20s. Lured by the inexpensive prices, convenient options, and “exotic” food aisle, Trader Joe’s made shopping and cooking accessible, even fun, when I was a young adult living on my own in San Francisco for the first time. But as Clint Rainey reports, the company has faced a lot of bad press recently: a series of product recalls, low rankings by environmental and animal welfare watchdog groups, and reports of intellectual property theft and workplace misconduct. In this Fast Company read—the first in a three–part series about the company’s brand identity and business practices—Rainey digs into why Trader Joe’s remains one of America’s favorite supermarkets despite the negative press. I apologize in advance if this story shatters the eco-friendly, good-vibes image of your beloved neighborhood Trader Joe’s. But I won’t hold it against you if you decide to pop in one last time to stock up on those sweet and salty umami rice crunchies—they’re ridiculously irresistible. —CLR Fatima Syed | The Local | January 14, 2025 | 4,359 words When I read news articles about Trump’s moves to end asylum and suspend the refugee resettlement program in the US, it’s often hard to see what that looks like on an individual and human level. Many stories on migration and immigration feel abstract, full of numbers and figures, describing people en masse. “It’s easy to forget that every single person migrating has a story,” Longreads writer Caitlin Dwyer once told me. For The Local, Fatima Syed offers a wide view of the shelter crisis in Peel, a suburban municipality in the greater Toronto area. But at the center of this feature is a powerful story of one woman, Delphina Ngigi. Shunned and attacked for being bisexual, she left Kenya—and her four children—and made the journey to Canada. For decades, the Peel region had a “no turn away” policy, but that approach has become unsustainable. Since 2023, Peel’s shelters have been unable to keep up with the surge of asylum seekers such as Delphina, a situation made worse by a severe housing crisis. (One Ontario organization providing transitional shelters saw a 700-percent increase in requests during the pandemic, almost half of whom were asylum seekers.) Delphina arrived in Canada in February 2024, hoping to declare asylum and find a bed at a shelter in Mississauga—only to die waiting for one, on just her fourth day in the country. The Peel municipality’s response to the influx of asylum seekers has saved lives, turning hotels into crisis shelters and providing social work, health care, and community support. It wants to help. But, as Delphina’s death shows, this Band-Aid approach isn’t enough. Syed writes a heartbreaking, necessary read of one woman seeking refuge, while deftly reporting on the compassionate people and organizations on the ground who want to create a real system, and real solutions, to help those like Delphina who land on their doorsteps. —CLR David Roth | Defector | 3,438 words | January 28, 2025 Dispatches from the Consumer Electronics Show have been a mainstay of the tech media for more than 25 years. Given the lurching evolution of the technology industry, those dispatches have diversified just a bit. All the way back in 2013, John Gruber wrote that “[t]here’s a nihilistic streak in tech journalism that I just don’t see in other fields.” But that streak is also increasingly warranted. What other industry has generated so much money from our attention, emotions, and data? All of this to say that Defector sending David Roth to CES is likely the apotheosis of Nihilistic CES Dispatch—and you’ll devour it gleefully. Once upon a time, Roth’s brand of polemic might have been dismissed as “snark.” It is anything but. Roth is deeply unsettled by the tech industry, and he’s deeply unsettled by CES, but what unsettles him the most about both is their insistence on the inevitability of AI. “The technology currently lavishly fucking up your grocery order in a supervised setting,” he writes, “will soon make you breakfast and drive you to work and help raise your child and manage both your glucose levels and those of your pet. It will know everything about you, and it will also care about you.” That’s just the backdrop. Roth navigates the Las Vegas Convention Center with something like awe. Or horror. Or something in between. CES is a zombie show of sorts: there are products from Kodak and Memorex and Radio Shack, all of which are no longer the original companies but rather conglomerates that now own their trademarks. “‘I once loved Memorex’s VHS tapes, so I will now buy this Memorex e-scooter,’ is on the merits an absurd value proposition, but not much more or less absurd than anything else in that space,” he writes. There are gadgets, obviously, many of which seem to be internet-connected sex toys. But what Roth is really interested in is the mounting evidence that our humanity is being extracted, reproduced, and monetized: “The fantasy and utility of AI, for the unconscionably wealthy and relentlessly wary masters of this space, converge in a high and lonesome abstraction—technology designed less to do every human thing for you than to replace all those human things with itself, and then sell that function back to you as a monthly subscription.” Roth has long been a gifted critic of greed—greed in sports, greed in entertainment, greed in politics. But in this specific moment, when we’ve watched a cadre of Big Tech CEOs paying fealty to a demonstratedly corrupt president, that greed has never felt so threatening. At least someone’s on the ramparts trying to help you see it. —PR Charlotte Bailey | Prospect | January 29, 2025 | 5,457 words Asbestos was banned in the UK in 1999. While the number of asbestos-related deaths—at least 5,000 annually—is expected to fall over time, activists are still sounding the alarm about the asbestos that remains in schools, hospitals, homes, and other older buildings in the UK. For Prospect, Charlotte Bailey traces the history and use of asbestos over the decades. Indispensable during World War II, it was hailed as a “mineral of victory and safety” and a crucial building material for the future. After the war, however, big businesses discovered (and buried) the truth: Asbestos exposure was a health risk for everyone, not just factory workers. One woman who studied patients diagnosed with mesothelioma, an aggressive cancer affecting the lining of organs, discovered they had all been exposed to asbestos, yet none of them had worked in the industry. (“They’d been plumbers, housewives and mechanics, a school building inspector and a teacher.”) For Bailey, these facts hit close to home: Her father also died from mesothelioma, likely a result of his time as an apprentice accountant, during which he also did a lot of manual labor in the building. “I had only the haziest understanding of asbestos as some dangerous substance used in decades past,” she writes. “But as I cared for my father, I learned how it came to be ubiquitous in our infrastructure.” Bailey’s reporting on the industry is thorough and vital, while her retelling of her father’s rapid decline, interwoven in the piece, is heartfelt and powerful. “My father was a character in the epilogue of an old story,” she writes. Asbestos may be considered a problem of the past in the UK, but as Bailey shows, this “killer dust” lingers and continues to impact thousands of lives each year. —CLR David Farrier | Emergence Magazine | January 23, 2025 | 4,916 words Spring melts seem to happen earlier, and warmer fall months stretch out, shortening the winter season. To a human who abhors the cold, this might seem like a good thing, but for animals and plants, it can alter and perhaps even endanger their life cycles. Consider mammals that emerge from hibernation earlier than usual, before their preferred foods proliferate. Consider plants that may flower too early, before critical pollinators are out and about. As David Farrier explains in this lyrical piece, such mistiming is called a chronoclasm: “a collision of different orders of time.” What’s behind these somewhat scary developments? You guessed it: climate change due to global warming. But this essay is not all doom and gloom—far from it. Farrier’s poetic look at wild intervals is accessible and thoughtful. He gives equal (ahem) time to reasons we can be hopeful about evolving ecological dependencies and partnerships, such as how new tree species might flourish in forests where conditions were once too cold for them. “Time lives in the body, not as the tick of the clock, but as a pulse in the blood,” he writes. “It is a thought, buried deep in nerve, leaf, and gene. . . . As wild clocks fall out of measure, can we recalibrate our sense of time and foster a rhythm by which all life can flourish?” We know we can’t rewind the clock and reset Earth’s climate. It’s refreshing, however, to read a piece that predicts what the future might hold while planting the seeds of hope. —KS Fletcher Reveley | Undark Magazine | February 19, 2025 | 9,195 words I’ve read some fascinating forensics stories in the past year, and this haunting piece by Fletcher Reveley digs into how Chile has applied the science, unfortunately to disastrous results, in crimes of mass atrocity. For Flor Lazo, the past 50 years have been a “long, long, long, long road in search of the truth.” Her father, two brothers, and two uncles were among the more than 1,000 people who were forcibly disappeared after the 1973 coup, under Augusto Pinochet’s brutal dictatorship. Reveley describes how in the late ’80s, forensic anthropologists began to investigate the regime’s mass graves. A series of scientific errors by the state’s forensic unit, the Servicio Médico Legal, marred the effort, misidentifying victims and delivering bodies to the wrong families. (For years, Lazo visited the grave containing what she believed was her brother Rodolfo’s remains, but after the bones were later exhumed—without her family’s knowledge—she learned that they were not his.) Reveley writes about the devastating affect these grievous mistakes have on victims’ loved ones: “For many of the affected relatives, the impact was seismic, forever altering their relationship to science, the state, and the notion of truth itself.” DNA analysis, remote-sensing technology, and a new initiative under Chile’s current president hold the promise of uncovering the remains of more victims, but as Reveley shows, Lazo and other Chileans continue to grapple with the injustice of these killings and hope for closure that they may never get. This is a meticulously reported account of a dark part of Chilean history, but also the extraordinary journey of families who have shown resilience over a lifetime of suffering. —CLR Julia Webster Ayuso | Noēma | January 28, 2025 | 4,354 words Imagine a language so beautiful and precise that there’s a word to describe “a female reindeer that has lost its calf of the same year but is accompanied by the previous year’s calf.” For the Sámi, Europe’s only recognized Indigenous community, that word is čearpmat-eadni. As Webster Ayuso says, the Sámi also have terms for specific types of snow, “everything from åppås, untouched winter snow without tracks; to habllek, a light, airy dust-like snow; and tjaevi, flakes that stick together and are hard to dig.” Given a warming planet under climate change, will habllek still occur? If that term is used less and less, could it possibly disappear from the Sámi lexicon, and with it, a richer experience of the world? Could preserving languages be one way to help fight climate change and encourage conservation? I learned a lot reading Julia Webster Ayuso’s piece for Noēma. Here, language and science intertwine like twin strands of DNA, and like DNA, they hold the key to preserving life on this planet. The number of languages spoken in the world is dwindling due to shrinking populations, climate change migration, and of course, colonization. “More than half of the world’s 8 billion people speak one of just 25 languages,” she writes. “Most of the remaining 7,139 languages have only a few speakers.” But Webster Ayuso suggests that the environment benefits when language and culture propagate. She cites as one example Hawaiian, which by 1980 was spoken by only 1,500 people. (Colonizers had routinely shamed and punished Hawaiian speakers, and the language languished.) Education programs for young people helped pull that back from the brink; by 2016, the number of Hawaiian speakers had grown by a factor of 10. This revival parallels the lot of the honu, or green sea turtle, “a powerful symbol of Hawaiian culture”: As the Hawaiian language found a new foothold, honu nesting populations grew by five percent annually. Now if only the whole planet wasn’t at such a steep, ongoing, collective loss for words. —KS Adlai Coleman | The Delacorte Review | February 25, 2025 | 6,390 words When I write editor’s picks and recommendations for our weekly Top 5, I make notes about the piece and collect passages to spark my imagination. I know a story is special when my digital scratchpad fills quickly. This is what happened with Adlai Coleman’s Delacorte Review essay. Coleman goes to West Virginia “looking for harm.” There, he meets Danni Dineen and Donna Coleman, two women working to reduce harm for members of their community. Danni runs the Quick Response Team for the city of Charleston, a group of EMTs and recovery specialists who respond to overdose-related 911 calls, offering life-saving Narcan. Danni has been sober for nearly four years; she was given Narcan 23 times before she got treatment. Both her mother and younger sister died of overdoses. Her older sister overdosed and was placed on life support. Now, life support is exactly what Danni does for a living. When not responding to 911 calls, she’s doing wellness checks and connecting with people while she hands out water, bus passes, and Narcan. She meets people exactly where they are because she’s been there. She doesn’t judge. She keeps trying, knowing that today could be the day that a client quits drugs for good. “Danni spends her days holding doors open and watching people walk by,” writes Coleman. Over in Ripley, a town in Jackson County, Donna is the only employee of the Bo-Mar Drop-In-Center, where help varies widely, but always meets an immediate need. Sometimes it’s a free hot sandwich and a safe place to sit for awhile. Sometimes it’s finding a bed in a treatment facility. Sometimes it’s asking a few questions that show she knows what someone is up to, but that she cares anyway. Donna probes to find out what someone needs now, something that might get them one step closer to recovery. Coleman is a keen observer and clocks his own awkwardness, first at developing rapport with Donna and then at making eye contact with the Bo-Mar clients. “There is quiet appraisal in Donna’s gaze, a gentle detachment, as if she is studying you from a distance. She wears rounded glasses and her eyes are warm without being soft. She speaks deliberately, unafraid of silence,” he writes. Each sentence in this essay is stark, each paragraph pairs devastation with earned optimism. No one in this story is comfortable, especially the reader, but that discomfort is a necessary precursor to change, fueled by what Danni and Donna bring to work every day: hope. —KS Kelley Engelbrecht | Chicago Magazine | March 4, 2025 | 6,193 words What happens in a world where machines are trained on stolen creativity? In this story for Chicago Magazine, Kelley Engelbrecht introduces us to Kim Van Deun, a fantasy illustrator who, a few years ago, began searching for a way to protect her work from generative AI tools that could produce images of anything in seconds. Her search led her to Ben Zhao, a computer scientist at the University of Chicago’s SAND Lab, where he and his team have developed protective tech—software called Glaze and Nightshade—that confuses and corrupts AI models that scrape and train on images without consent. “Take an image of a cat,” Engelbrecht explains. “Apply Nightshade to the image, and the AI model will see not a cat but something entirely different — perhaps a chair. Do this to enough images of cats, and gradually the model stops seeing cats and sees only chairs.” Engelbrecht’s profile of Zhao and the SAND Lab’s efforts to disrupt Big Tech highlights the bigger rift between AI companies and independent artists, but it also lingers on something more fundamental. At one point, when Engelbrecht asks Heather Zheng, Zhao’s wife and co-leader of the lab, about pushback to their work, she says, “I’d rather see Glaze and Nightshade as a way to tell the young generation that they have agency.” As a mother to an imaginative, artistic 6-year-old, I felt this on a deeper level. Engelbrecht weaves in a few quiet yet telling moments about children and their art, reminding us why it’s crucial for future generations to create from scratch, to build off a blank canvas, and to make something that’s entirely their own. Because even the most powerful algorithms are nothing without human imagination. —CLR Erika Hayasaki | Men’s Health | March 12, 2025 | 7,584 words Five years after COVID-19 first upended the world, as many as 20 million Americans and at least 400 million people worldwide are battling long COVID, a debilitating and misunderstood condition with few answers and no cure. Erika Hayasaki follows two men—Matthew Light, a pulmonologist, and Levi Henry, a CrossFit enthusiast—who, despite their different approaches to medicine, find themselves in the same boat. They continue to search for something, anything, that might make them feel like themselves again. Light’s shortness of breath persisted for months after getting COVID. “To be a pulmonologist struggling to breathe,” writes Hayasaki, “felt like a special kind of hell.” He developed chronic fatigue syndrome, and after a year of living with his symptoms, he asked himself: “Who is supposed to take care of long COVID patients?” He decided to be that doctor. He now leads a support group at UCHealth Medical Center of the Rockies in Colorado, where a growing community meets to commiserate and learn about potential new treatments without judgment. “They turn to each other,” writes Hayasaki, “because who better to turn to? Science does not yet have the answers.” Levi Henry, the former CrossFitter, had tried a number of experimental therapies—hyperbaric oxygen therapy, red light panels, lymphatic drainage massage, ice baths—before finding Light’s support group. Some treatments seem promising; a low dose of naltrexone has helped Light, for example, but others are risky and unproven. For both men, the search for relief is a kind of survival. In a world that’s moved on from the pandemic, and a new Trump administration decimating everything in its path, their support group is a space to share knowledge, and a lifeline. Hayasaki captures their frustration and resilience with nuance, showing what it’s really like to navigate an illness that remains a mystery. —CLR Piper French | Bolts, in partnership with Mother Jones | March 20, 2025 | 6,239 words A scene from Lawrence Wright’s recent New Yorker feature has stayed with me: A group of nuns visit Melissa, a death row inmate in Texas, on the day of her scheduled execution, only to find her in a cage—a literal cage, not just the metaphorical one of prison. In Piper French’s story, Chris Duncan, who has been on death row in Louisiana’s Angola prison since 1998, tells French that after years of incarceration, all that remained of him was a “body in a cage”—and that execution might be a mercy. The prison-as-cage metaphor is not new, but in French’s telling, its weight is visceral. Duncan was convicted of murdering his then-girlfriend’s toddler daughter. His case was built on now-debunked bite mark forensics, the expertise of discredited doctors, a jailhouse snitch’s faulty testimony, and a damning video never seen at trial. Add to that Louisiana’s history of prosecutorial misconduct—where more than 80 percent of death sentences were overturned between 1976 and 2015—and Duncan’s case becomes a stark reflection of a deeply flawed system. French details his case with care, while zooming out to track the evolution of the state’s legal system, including reforms in recent years that gave incarcerated people, even those on death row, new avenues to claim innocence. But since taking office last year, Governor Jeff Landry has aggressively worked to reinstate executions, reauthorized electrocution, and legalized the experimental method of suffocation by nitrogen gas. After a 15-year pause, Landry got his wish: This past week, Louisiana resumed executions by killing Jessie Hoffman, a man Duncan had grown close to. French’s reporting is urgent, revealing a justice system that gets it wrong far too often—and a governor more focused on sealing the cage than opening it. —CLR Brenna Ehrlich | Rolling Stone | March 29, 2025 | 6,782 words Brenna Ehrlich’s profile of the Reverend Jeff Hood is thick with tension from the opening sentence. Hood, “half metal roadie with his bald head and long, ZZ Top beard and quirky glasses, half classic priest,” ministers to men on death row. We meet him before dawn on the day that Emmanuel Littlejohn might be put to death at Oklahoma State Penitentiary, 30 years after he killed a man in a convenience store robbery. Littlejohn is one of Hood’s “guys,” men who are guilty of murder, rape, and sometimes both, men that Hood ministers to anyway, because he believes that everyone is worthy of love and compassion despite what they’ve done in life. Not all of the repulsive behavior in this piece is committed by the men behind bars: Hood has received death threats for his work, including from a 70-year-old man in a pickup truck while Hood was mowing his front lawn. Then there’s the torture committed by the state. The Pardon and Parole board had granted Littlejohn clemency weeks before his execution date, which put his life into the hands of Oklahoma governor Kevin Stitt. Stitt, who could mandate Littlejohn’s reprieve or death with a single phone call, was said to be praying on the decision—a performance that was still underway when they came to measure Littlejohn’s arms and legs for the straps and gauge his veins for the needle. (Is there anything more cruel than to dangle mercy in front of a man, just because you can?) This is an emotional read. But when you stick it out to the end as Hood does, you’ll find it to be a true testament to faith, hope, and love. —KS Kori Suzuki | High Country News | April 1, 2025 | 6,075 words In April 1943, 63-year-old James Wakasa was walking his dog near the edge of the Topaz Relocation Center, a Japanese American incarceration camp in the Utah desert, when he was shot and killed by a soldier in a guard tower. Fellow prisoners erected a stone and concrete monument in Wakasa’s honor. Decades later, Nancy Ukai, a researcher in Berkeley whose parents had also been incarcerated at Topaz, began to learn more about Wakasa’s story, and that the Roosevelt administration had ordered the monument to be destroyed. Two archaeologists read Ukai’s research, visited Topaz, and—to their surprise—stumbled upon the monument, buried in the ground. But what followed wasn’t a triumphant rediscovery, as Kori Suzuki reports, but an example of how heritage and historical memory can be mishandled. The museum entrusted with preserving Topaz excavated the monument without involving any descendants of those imprisoned there. “In the museum’s actions, [Ukai] saw the same patterns of violence emerging,” writes Suzuki, violence in the form of silence and erasure. Suzuki’s storytelling is quiet and clear-eyed, letting the weight of history press through each sentence. More than 80 years later, Topaz descendants still seek answers about the discovery and excavation of the monument, and still fight for dignity and remembrance. This story isn’t just about an unearthed piece of stone—it’s a mirror and a warning, reminding us that the powerful are more often interested in rewriting history than reckoning with it. —CLR Chelsea Kirk | n+1 | April 7, 2025 | 3,990 words As the Eaton and Palisades wildfires tore through Southern California, destroying neighborhoods and displacing tens of thousands of people, landlords moved swiftly to capitalize on disaster. In this n+1 essay, tenant organizer Chelsea Kirk writes from inside that moment: “A two-bedroom apartment on Montana Avenue was listed for $3,595 on January 7. By the next day, the price had jumped 25 percent to $4,495. By January 9, it climbed another 33 percent, reaching $5,995.” Watching Zillow rental prices surge in real time, Kirk created an open-access Google spreadsheet to track and collect instances of price gouging. The spreadsheet went viral, the number of listings exploded, and what began as one individual’s spontaneous response quickly evolved into a larger act of resistance. Kirk mobilized a network of activists, coders, urban planners, and people who simply wanted to help. “The spreadsheet taps into the anger of people who may never set foot in a tenant union meeting, but who still feel the urgency,” writes Kirk. “This crisis is reaching people who haven’t been part of the fight before.” Despite thousands of documented cases, officials have done almost nothing to protect tenants or hold exploitative landlords and realtors accountable. (Only 14 violators have been charged so far, which is less than 1 percent of total cases.) Meanwhile, the rent gouging continues. But Kirk’s essay is more than an indictment of government inaction and landlord greed; it’s a testament to the power of collective action in a time of layered crises. “What landlords fear is that we might imagine something better: a world where housing isn’t a commodity at all, a world without landlords,” she writes. This is a vision of what’s possible when ordinary people start to imagine something different—and work together to make it real. —CLR Maddy Crowell | Harper’s Magazine | April 21, 2025 | 5,486 words Last year, Harper’s ran a feature about people grappling with systemic, sometimes incapacitating maladies. The afflicted blame the invisible toxins of modernity—electromagnetic frequencies, chemicals, additives—but society sees them as hypochondriacs or crackpots. Maddy Crowell’s piece in the newest issue of Harper’s acts as a bookend of sorts to that story: another case of hardship compounded by dismissal. Frank Vera III worked at George Air Force Base in the 1970s, where he interacted with what we now know are carcinogenic substances; he also claims to have been exposed to radioactive waste, and began exhibiting symptoms that ended his military career. Yet no one would validate his tale, or his suffering. Decades later, Vera began posting on Facebook, where he attracted a tribe of others who worked at the same base and claimed similar health troubles. Enter Crowell—a curious reporter who, to Vera, represented something more like a savior. As Crowell begins to investigate the alleged phenomenon, she finds herself examining the meta-phenomenon of conspiratorial thinking. Vera’s medical troubles are undeniable; so is the fact that the US military has worked with toxic materials. However, Vera’s crusade had also led him onto shakier ground, and his passion was now mixed with paranoia. “The more we spoke, the more confused I became,” Crowell writes. “Many of his most impassioned beliefs seemed wildly incoherent. But Frank’s emotional and physical pain was undeniable. He cried several times. And even if he lacked a smoking gun, he had enough evidence to indicate that the Air Force wasn’t being totally forthright about whatever had been going on at George.” There are no easy answers here. There’s plenty of stonewalling, though, and bureaucracy that seems designed to thwart accountability. So, perhaps unsurprisingly, Crowell is unable to bring her investigation to a satisfying end. But that’s also the only possible outcome here, if you think about it. After all, it’s only wrong if you get caught. And the more power you have, the unlikelier that is. —PR Mariana Serapicos | Electric Literature | April 24, 2025 | 3,935 words My parents, who are in their mid-70s, are preparing to sell the house they’ve lived in for nearly 50 years. I’ve been scanning my mind for the memories we’ve made in that home. In many of them, my dad is tinkering with something—up a ladder, barefoot, hammering on the siding; searching for a tool in the garage; changing the oil in his car. He is a fixer for life, eternally excited about a piece of wood, but these days, I see him resting on the couch a lot more. Reading Mariana Serapicos’s tribute to her own father, it’s hard not to think about my dad getting older. Serapicos’s father got sick when she was a child, diagnosed with ALS at a time when not many people were aware of the disease. Her descriptions of watching his health deteriorate are tough. But her descriptions of his love for his family, and a life of joy despite hardship, are ultimately what I take away from this piece. The first (and last) time she sees her dad in the hospital, they communicate through letters and sentences on a piece of cardboard. “We talked about plain things because everything else was too big, because plainness is the fabric of life,” she writes. This line encapsulates what I love about this essay. She captures everyday details—his Birkenstocks, their days at the pool, the way she danced on his feet and combed his oily hair—that celebrate a hardworking and joyful man who lived fully. Serapicos leaves us with a moving portrait not of decline, but of presence. —CLR Bobbie Johnson | Wired | May 1, 2025 | 3,848 words I’ve worked remotely for almost 15 years, well before logging in from the kitchen or couch became mainstream. There’s a lot you can glean about your coworkers just by being online with them over time. You build rapport, deep respect, and above all, trust. That’s why Bobbie Johnson’s Wired piece about how North Korea used American shills to put fake workers inside over 300 US companies yanked my neck on a chain. Christina Chapman was a shill. Once a worker landed a job, she housed and maintained the fake’s laptop, received their pay, took a cut, and wired the rest of the money to North Korea. Before the law caught up to her, she ran a laptop farm from her Arizona home with dozens of computers linked to different workers. Several people in the US have been charged, and these cases are winding their way through the courts. But where did it all begin? In North Korea, all roads lead to the country’s dictator, Kim Jong Un. Kim is a gaming enthusiast secretly educated in Switzerland, and he made investing in IT a top priority after taking over from his father in 2011. Computer science courses now run in schools, and the most promising students are taught hacking techniques and foreign languages. They’re allowed a glimmer of freedom in access to the actual internet so that they can excel as operatives for the state. Johnson surveys the history of North Korean hacking success, and the surprising (and sad) communal conditions under which operatives work today, all to pad Kim’s pocket. This piece puts you on the edge of your seat for the audacity of the cybercrime alone. It takes a hilarious turn when Johnson rides along with a recruiter, coming face to face with more than one North Korean operative applying for, and in one case, spectacularly failing to land a lucrative American job. It’s a scene you won’t want to miss. —KS Jason Motlagh | Rolling Stone | April 27, 2025 | 6,716 words In a bid to emulate Portugal and France, where “nuanced approaches prioritizing health care over punishment have curtailed overdoses and public drug use,” Oregon decriminalized possession of small amounts of hard drugs like fentanyl and meth in 2020. The state redirected hundreds of millions of dollars earmarked for enforcement and incarceration toward treatment and harm reduction. It all seemed reasonable in theory, but Mexican drug cartels took full advantage. They flooded the US with fentanyl, which forced the price down, making it accessible for as little as $1 per pill. Then came the pandemic, where isolation, despair, and the cheap, plentiful supply became a horrific combination. “Portland became a honeypot for local and out-of-state addicts to score cheap dope and use it freely,” writes Jason Motlagh for Rolling Stone. After the state repealed decriminalization in 2024, Motlagh visited Portland to witness the aftermath. His careful reporting puts him face to face with people on all sides of the drug crisis: He talks to a hotel owner and the local district attorney; he shadows treatment workers and harm reduction volunteers on their rounds; he witnesses a man brought back from the brink of overdose with four naloxone injections; he gets to know addicts as they cycle through rock bottom and relapse. So how’s it going? Today, naloxone is more readily available on the street. Overdoses are down slightly with a less potent supply. (Some say the cartels are trying to keep their customers alive longer.) While at times this was a very difficult read, it was plain to see that in Portland, there is something other than fentanyl available in large supply—hope. —KS Sarah Miller | n+1 | May 20, 2025 | 8,216 words Not so long ago, Sarah Miller was Not Doing Well. Like, Not Doing Well at an existential, nearly cellular level. She despaired about the world and its fate, about her own pessimisim, about her role in the world. She also had no idea how to navigate her despair, let alone resolve it, until she decided—with no small amount of misgiving—that ayahuasca was worth a shot. So: off to Peru! In the 1,500 words it takes for Miller to reach the center where she’ll journey to her own center, you get a very clear sense that you are in very good hands. Not only does she wield a gratifyingly caustic sense of humor, but she has the rare gift of bidirectional analysis; she is both intensely self-aware and intensely judgmental, leveling the same withering gaze inward and outward. (Let me be clear: This is a compliment. No one likes everybody. The least you can do is own your reasoning.) And when she arrives, all these traits combine to create a psychedelia of their own. There’s the pre-trip purgation, of course. The seven (seven!) ayahuasca experiences, each of which manages to disappoint or even re-traumatize Miller in some novel way. The other people, who she renders with a keen meanness, or possibly a mean keenness. Yet, none of this feels like punching down, or self-absorption, or any of the other pitfalls that lurk in a piece like this. It’s not that she hates, it’s that she hurts. Does the ayahuasca care? It does not. Instead, it pushes her through the darkness, again and again. “My life was a selfish joke,” she writes of the reality that consumed her during her sixth trip. “My desire to express myself was risible. I had come here to find hope but what I found instead was the definitive end of it.” The theme of the latest issue of n+1 is Harsh Realm, and this very unfunny realization in the midst of a very funny piece makes clear that, for most of us, the harshest realm of all is the doubt that lurks inside us. —PR Andy Greenberg | Wired | May 22, 2025 | 12,182 words Over the past week, I shared so many stories about psychedelics in a group chat that a friend asked me if I had a new hobby she should know about. I only get high on narrative journalism, maaaaan, and Andy Greenberg’s piece about Akasha Song’s DMT empire is a trip. (It also lasts longer than the average DMT experience, and causes little to no ego death.) Song fell in love with LSD in high school, back when he was named Joseph Clements; 20 years later, he discovered the mind-altering joys of dimethyltryptamine. First he learned to make the drug, extracting it from a tree bark that’s legal to buy. Then he started selling it to friends. Then he found the dark web and started selling more. A lot more. His operation grew. He laundered the money through crypto. He moved from Colorado to Texas to Northern California, expanding all the while—until, inevitably, it all came crashing down. Greenberg specializes in this sort of story, having profiled McDonald’s ice-cream machine hackers, swatting teenagers, white-hat hackers, and more, and he’s in characteristically fine form here. It helps that Song landed on his feet, and shared a trove of the detail (and proof) that’s so crucial to that cinematic feel. You’re reading Greenberg’s words, but you’re in Song’s world, from the first tab to the last chat. —PR Katya Apekina | Alta Journal | June 3, 2025 | 1,561 words A mile from our home marks the burn line from a wildfire that ignited on a scorching day in May and consumed 4,000 hectares within hours, urged on by gusting south winds. Pines, poplars, and skinny ash trees are dead standing in that eerie, blackened landscape. The trees and the brush will grow back. Two people on our small peninsula did not make it out in time. This is the worst wildfire season in my province’s history and it’s only the beginning of June. I’ve read and heard many wildfire stories over the years; a US colleague used to live through the summers with a “go” bag packed with essentials and family treasures, should the worst come to pass and threaten their home. I never really understood what that meant until I read The Great Displacement by Jake Bittle, in which he reports on climate change-induced migration, wildfire being one cause. (It’s a terrific, eye-opening book, full of personal stories. You should check it out.) Ever since, I’ve been compelled to read every wildfire story I find. That’s why Katya Apekina’s account of the Palisades and Eaton Fires for Alta Journal caught my attention. The morning of January 7, 2025, dawns like an ordinary Tuesday. The Santa Ana winds feel a little spooky, a little exciting for Apekina, the “L.A. version of a snowstorm.” But then the winds pick up. The fire, which had started 20 miles away, roars closer. The tension in this essay grows and develops like a fully-fledged character as she recounts a surreal scene: her husband reading “a biography of J. Edgar Hoover by candlelight as the fire rages in the windows behind him.” Soon, the air turns acrid with dense smoke. It tastes toxic. People are losing their houses as the fire advances. They are dying. Paper artifacts of lives lived float to earth the following day, having escaped the flames. “Pages from the Bible, or Alcoholics Anonymous literature, or old encyclopedias—thin pages that traveled downwind for several miles—drifted into people’s yards,” she writes in the aftermath, a period in which she questions her future in Los Angeles and how to live, moment to moment, while processing the catastrophe. “I’m in a state of hysterical terror. I want to go home. This is not my home.” As Apekina suggests, it may be time for many of us to reconsider what home really means. If you can make a space for home in your heart, at least you can take it with you when you have to flee. —KS Archie Bland | The Guardian | May 24, 2025 | 7,053 words At seven weeks old, Max stopped breathing. His father, Guardian journalist Archie Bland, recounts what followed with harrowing clarity: performing CPR on his infant son, the frantic ambulance ride, an insect crawling “along a fluorescent light,” each detail etched into his trauma-heightened memory. Two years on, Max lives with cerebral palsy, the result of oxygen deprivation during a likely SIDS event. Bland writes not just to honor his son—“already a thousand times more interesting than anyone I’ve ever met”—but to hold a mirror up to himself. He examines the quiet entitlement of his life before (“As a white man named Archibald, I always suspected I was missing something about the impact of privilege”) and the raw rage he feels parenting a disabled child in a world full of “absolute doughnuts,” people who compare Max’s condition to a child’s squint or ask no questions at all. Bland’s writing is funny, furious, and brutally honest. “I understand things about myself and the world now that I can’t wish I didn’t know,” he writes, no longer a “genial ignoramus.” Max himself brings so much joy, and Bland wants us to know him not for what he lacks but for everything he is. After reading, listen to Bland’s interview on Today in Focus. You’ll hear Max laugh, and it’s beautiful. —CW Suzy Hansen | New York | June 16, 2025 | 10,071 words Finally. That was my first thought when I finished reading Suzy Hansen’s damning cover story detailing Israel’s violations of international humanitarian law in Gaza. These violations have been repeated and flagrant, and they have been documented by brave Palestinian journalists and civilians, as well as NGOs, UN agencies, and visiting medical providers. Indeed, Hansen’s feature isn’t an investigation, because an investigation wasn’t necessary—mountains of evidence of Israel’s crimes were readily available. What took so long for a writer at a legacy media publication in the West to muster that evidence and say what is so plainly true? Hansen has an answer, because her essential piece is also about the international complicity that has allowed Israel to kill, terrorize, and humiliate its targets unchecked. Chief among Israel’s aiders and abettors was the Biden administration, building on a post-9/11 legacy of normalizing humanitarian abuses; its successor is no better. “As the theologian Abraham Joshua Heschel said, in a free society, ‘few are guilty, all are responsible.’ This includes many institutions outside government, like the mainstream media,” Hansen writes. “[W]estern newspapers and networks still faithfully print Israeli talking points, excuses, and outright lies.” The cumulative effect of this rampant cruelty and complicity is, of course, mass suffering, but it also signals the ultimate failure of a body of law established over the last century to prevent exactly that. This failure was not inevitable. Power and prejudice are to blame. Hansen hopes there is something to salvage here, a shared standard of human decency. But I’m doubtful, and I’m not alone. “Elite impunity is the sole remaining area of bipartisan consensus,” Matt Duss, Bernie Sanders’s former foreign-policy chief and the executive vice-president of the Center for International Policy, tells Hansen. “They understand that whatever they do, it’s not going to really hurt them because, you know, Donald Rumsfeld died in his bed.” —SD Alyssa Roenigk | ESPN | June 20, 2025 | 4,016 words My husband’s cousin and her family lost their home in the Eaton Fire. Nothing was salvageable. While I was putting together a care package for them, I would look at an item in a store and wonder, “Do they already have this?” Then I’d remember: They don’t have anything. This happened again and again, as my brain struggled to grasp the fact and meaning of total loss. Here, Alyssa Roenigk spends time with students at Altadena’s John Muir High School, where unthinkable loss is nearly endemic: One in four kids at Muir lost their homes or were displaced by the fire. Roenigk gracefully timestamps sections of her piece with the number of days since the fire began, echoing the way many Altadenans now think: “Dates are no longer defined by a calendar but instead by how much time has passed since that fateful Tuesday.” Nine days after the fire, Muir senior Jasmine Collins is living in a motel with her mother and siblings; all of their worldly possessions now fit into their truck. Fifty days after the fire, someone breaks into the truck and steals everything. This is one of many details Roenigk musters to remind her readers that disaster has a long, painful, and unpredictable tail. “Money from online fundraisers is drying up,” she writes. “Donation centers are packing up and closing. The rebuilding process is slow.” People are leaving Altadena, too, including some whose families have been there for generations. Those who remain must adjust to a new normal. “If we’re choosing to stay,” one of Roenigk’s subjects says, “then we’re going to have to embrace that it’s never going to be the same again.” There is beauty, of course, in rising from the ashes. But Roenigk’s story shows that there is also beauty in making space for grief. In a memorable scene, Jasmine’s water polo coach asks how she’s doing after a game that takes place just 16 days after the fire: “Jasmine looks up. ‘I . . . ’ She stops. Her eyes fill with tears. She smiles and forms a heart with her hands.” —SD Lewis Hyde | Harper’s Magazine | June 18, 2025 | 6,655 words Frequent readers of our curation have probably sussed out that different editors have different pet topics. Every Friday, one Longreads spouse tries to match each Top 5 pick to an editor, just from reading the headlines. (Results vary.) I have my own, but reading Lewis Hyde’s piece this week added another to the list: deep time. The fact that change happens on a scale that humans simply can’t register continues to light up the wonder center in my brain. In the past, this has happened with a 2023 Lachlan Summers Aeon story about how Mexico City residents are “stranded” in time; now, it’s Hyde’s exploration of how Charles Lyell first envisioned deep time, and how Charles Darwin rested his most famous theory on it. Species evolve, as Carolyn reminded us recently, in fits and starts, in a way that’s nearly impossible for humans to witness. Increasingly, though, that work is being undone on a scale that’s tragically perceptible. “Eleven thousand years of survival versus a few decades of decline: it may not be clear how we are to reckon with spans of time so utterly out of proportion with one another,” Hyde writes, “but that is now the task at hand as more species decline or go extinct.” Frankly, I wrestled with whether to include any quote from the piece in this blurb, since it just makes me want to share a half-dozen others. I read this story with my jaw half-open, as I always do when a writer manages to communicate science’s most incomprehensible truths. It’s the kind of writing that sends me to the bookstore, that gets my note-taking hand twitching, that makes my brain feel hungry for more. It might just do the same for you. —PR Aaron Parsley | Texas Monthly | July 10, 2025 | 4,383 words Imagine being at your family house on the Guadalupe River in Texas, ready to enjoy some July Fourth summer fun. Now imagine waking in the wee hours to discover that flash flood waters have trapped you in the house. Your elderly dad and your partner are there. Your sister and brother-in-law are there too, along with their two children, a daughter, age 4, and a son, 20 months old. It’s dark. The water is at the deck, which is 20 feet off the ground. The water is moving fast and filled with debris and it’s rising. Window glass shatters as the river invades the house. There is nowhere to evacuate to. You feel the room shift and tilt as the house is lifted off the foundation and seconds later is torn apart. This is the scene Aaron Parsley describes in his harrowing and unforgettable first-person account of the flash flooding in Kerr County, Texas. Parsley’s writing is so taut and tense and immediate that time slowed, and then stopped as I read this piece. This is a story I’ll always remember. It put my heart in my throat as I choked back sobs, bereft for this family and their tragedy. “Alissa managed to keep both kids on the countertop, one hand on each, still trying to reassure them,” he writes. “As the house came undone, she grabbed one in each arm. This is the part that will forever haunt me.” This piece doesn’t concern itself with second-guessing weather forecasts, warnings, or the timeliness of the emergency response. Those facts are important, of course, but here, they’re far beside the point. Given the catastrophic loss Parsley and his family suffered, does anything else really matter? —KS John Woodrow Cox, Sarah Blaskey, and Matt McClain | The Washington Post | June 21, 2025 | 5,553 words There’s a moment in this piece I’ve been thinking about ever since I read it. Otto Vargas, a farmhand from Guatemala, asks his new boss, JJ Fricken, whether he has other employees who work his land in Colorado. Fricken hears the question through an earbud that translates in real time—the men don’t speak the same language, so this is how they communicate. Fricken points at himself, then at Vargas. “Just you and me,” he says. The scene, evoking both vulnerability and solidarity, is a succinct illustration of the wider story, which details how the two men’s fates came to be intertwined. The federal government had promised Fricken a $200,000 grant to hire a worker from Latin America, who would be given an H-2A visa. “In a place where local, legal help was nearly impossible to keep, the extra worker would give him the freedom to handle more jobs and invest in his own equipment,” the authors explain. “It was an opportunity that could transform his family’s future.” Vargas’s future was on the line too: “He’d prayed that he’d get a job interview, and when he did, he prayed he’d do well, and when he did, he prayed he’d receive an offer, and when he did, he prayed the United States would let him come.” Then the Trump administration, despite boasting about its love for American farmers, froze the grant money. Suddenly, Fricken was in debt, and while Vargas was able to come to Colorado, it wasn’t clear how long his job would last. To survive the administration’s cuts and cruelty, a Trump voter and an immigrant needed each other. What a terrible, beautiful thought. —SD Liam Taylor | 1843 Magazine | July 24, 2025 | 6,235 words At the risk of sounding idiotically obvious, mining is an extractive process—for those doing the mining as well as the resources being mined. Workers can meet their doom suddenly (collapse, fall, explosion), or after many years (lung disease), but to escape unscathed feels almost miraculous. No such miracles awaited many of the men who flocked to South Africa’s Buffelsfontein mine after it closed in 2013. This was mining minus any illusion of safety; any gold left was deeper underground and farther from entry shafts than ever before, requiring “zama-zamas,” or illegal miners, to live hundreds of meters below the surface for months at a time. And while some zama-zamas came on their own, others arrived under false pretenses or even duress, forced by gangs who controlled the access points. What was already difficult and dangerous became even more so last year, when the South African police began blocking both food supplies going into Buffels and the rope crews who helped zama-zamas get out. Many starved. Many died. Even when people were allowed to leave, they were arrested, with migrants from neighboring countries being held without bail. Liam Taylor’s feature about the tragedy doesn’t shy away from the horrific conditions that led to illegal mining, nor from the fact that blame lay at multiple feet: police, famo gangs, mine owners, the government, and the long shadows of colonialism and apartheid. It’s always sobering to learn of a human-rights disaster. All the more reason that journalism like this—nimble reporting, unaffected prose, and the sole purpose of making sure the world knows—is so crucial. —PR Hannah S. Palmer | Earth Island Journal | Summer 2025 | 3,457 words I recently moved inland from the San Francisco Bay Area, and 90-degree-plus days are now the norm. While it’ll take time to get used to the heat, I love how often we’ve gone swimming this summer. For $6 a visit, we can enjoy two massive sparkling pools and a waterslide in a leafy park, supervised by a rotating team of lifeguards. The quick bike ride to this public pool was one reason we bought our house—and it’s made me think a lot about recreational access to water: pools, lakes, beaches, and other places to play and cool off. In this excerpt from her new book, The Pool is Closed: Segregation, Summertime, and the Search for a Place to Swim, Hannah S. Palmer reflects on lost Southern waters, retracing the history of integration in the South and how it led to the abandonment of public pools and other facilities. “When we talk about water, we’re talking about race and class,” she writes. Wondering where her young sons can learn how to swim, Palmer visits public pools in Atlanta and creeks and lakes in the region: “I drove all over Georgia investigating places where people used to swim that faded from the map after integration: pools filled, lakes drained, beaches sliced into private properties.” When white people rebuilt their own private versions of these places, these spaces were lost to everyone else, particularly Black communities. Her reflections on pools ripple outward: What she discovers also applies to parks, schools, libraries, transit. “Life is not so different from what happens when we swim in public,” she writes. This piece is a compelling introduction to her research on water and public space, as well as parenting in a time of environmental crisis. —CLR Tony Ho Tran | Slate | August 13, 2025 | 5,565 words In April, as the US marked 50 years since the end of the Vietnam War and a flood of anniversary projects rolled across the journalism plains, Tony Ho Tran was on the Vietnam coast with his parents and brother. This wasn’t a voyage of commemoration, but a long-delayed trip that just happened to coincide with the milestone. Still, coincidence means little when you return to the place that made you and then blew apart. The backdrop of the celebration heightens the usual tensions of a family vacation: Tran’s father goes full Dad Mode by telling everyone he meets in Hanoi that he’d served in the South Vietnamese army; Tran’s mother insists on repeating everything Tran and his brother say to locals, as though their Vietnamese is indecipherable. Ultimately, though, the enormity of the occasion snuffs out any internecine squabbles. Sharing a beer with his dad on Hạ Long Bay, Tran fills in gaps of the man’s life he’d never even known were there, and the travelogue gives way to something altogether more lyrical, something that Tran has been moving toward all along. “Returning, I realize now, was never going to answer any questions or heal us,” he writes. “Returning gives shape to memory. It allows us to feel the ragged trenches of its scars, map the landscape it creates—and that, in turn, changes us. But the past will always be with us: in the stories we tell strangers, the old enemies we welcome back, and the fights we have with those we love.” We are the strangers here, and Tran’s family story—and, particularly, its arresting final image—will stay with you for some time. —PR Eric McHenry | The American Scholar | August 14, 2025 | 3,122 words On one hand, the word “folklore” will never lose its ability to make me feel like a bored, fidgety kid. It sounds like field trips to one-room schoolhouses. But on the other hand, the word also thrums with enormous power—the same power that makes the blues the most potent artform born on American soil. The Mississippi Delta isn’t terminus in this case, but origin: The stories and tropes that made their way into the music proliferated through this country’s very sensibility, and through every other mode of expression that it spawned. And with that much embedded folklore, there’s always another discovery lurking, another path to tread from song to song, another history to uncover. Eric McHenry’s investigation for The American Scholar exercises that sonic sleuthing in journalistic form, following the character of “the Mercy Man” back through the decades all the way to its seeming genesis. It’s a fascinating investigation, whether or not you’re familiar with Alan Lomax’s famed field recordings or even the blues at all. McHenry dives into the levee camp holler, a plaintive song form born when Black men of the late 19th and early 20th century joined work crews controlled by viciously racist contractors and featuring conditions that seemed nearly indistinguishable from slavery itself. After tracing various renditions of a story in which a contractor known as Mr. Charlie kills an animal welfare officer, McHenry finally finds a 1909 incident that seems to explain everything; from there, he re-expands his search, adding vital texture to the event and sketching a stunning depiction of what inequality really looked like at the time. (Spoiler: It looks like a whole lot of Mr. Charlies.) This is a story about American history, but it’s also a story about how we cope with the unspeakable, and about how art can grow from the abject. And if you’re anything like me, it’ll remind you that the word “folklore” isn’t so boring after all. —PR Viola Zhou | Rest of World | September 2, 2025 | 4,472 words Something happened to me last year that I’ve yet to fully unpack. I was doing sit-ups when, suddenly, the left side of my body was overtaken by tingling. A colorful corona bloomed in my left eye. I found it hard to speak. My wife drove me to the emergency room. There was a cardiology investigation. Then there were others. I got a neurologist, and then a gastroenterologist. I started getting monthly blood tests. Doctors scanned my brain and tested my nerves. Each test showed me to be in good health. And yet symptoms of something have persisted. Where I live, family doctors are hard to come by, so I’ve been required to piece together my own care. My wife provides tremendous emotional support, but we’re not all so fortunate. Where, then, should we look for solace? Viola Zhou’s mother has lived with chronic kidney problems for two decades. As China’s aging population puts increased pressure on the nation’s healthcare infrastructure, Zhou’s mother has seen her marriage fracture and her daughter leave the country. In her isolation, she has turned to DeepSeek, an AI-powered chatbot, for medical guidance, tasking it with interpreting her medical records, changing her diet, and reducing her immunosuppressant dose. She warmly thanks the chatbot, and it responds in kind. Zhou brings her mother’s chat records to specialists, who point out the errors in Dr. DeepSeek’s responses. And yet Zhou’s mother dismisses the shortcomings. “DeepSeek is more humane,” she tells Zhou. “Doctors are more like machines.” These days, there is no shortage of stories about people in crisis who turn to AI for support, sometimes to perilous ends. Zhou’s feature reminds us that such stories are symptoms—of technological limits, isolation, and dysfunctional healthcare systems. —BF Ivy Knight | Oxford American | August 6, 2025 | 3,266 words Earlier this week, I watched a video of people on a street outside London’s Royal Courts of Justice, moving barriers away from a wall to uncover a Banksy mural. The artwork—depicting a judge using a gavel to strike a protester who holds a blood-spattered sign—is likely a commentary on the recent mass arrests at pro-Palestinian demonstrations. There’s been a lot of online chatter about it: the court’s swift cover-up, the legal implications for altering a listed building, and whether the artwork was genuine, which Banksy confirmed on Instagram. This question of authenticity was fresh in my mind after reading Ivy Knight’s Oxford American piece about Boy on a Life Preserver Swing, one of the murals Banksy left behind in New Orleans in the years after Hurricane Katrina. Knight tells a delightful story about an unlikely trio—a dump truck driver, a real estate developer, and an art conservator—who come together to save the piece. Originally painted on the exterior wall of a biker bar, the mural was defaced with red spray paint, then reduced to rubble when the building was demolished. Ronnie Fredericks, the truck driver, salvaged the cinderblocks and stored them for years until he stumbled upon an opportunity with Sean Cummings, an art-loving hotelier, to bring the work back to life. “Joy” is not a word I usually associate with Banksy, but I felt it while reading Knight’s account of the restoration effort, and the science behind the careful process. (“She tried every removal method in her arsenal,” Knight writes of Elise Grenier, the art conservator challenged with the task, “but she could find no way to remove spray paint from spray paint.”) The trio’s shared curiosity and appreciation for the art is palpable, and as I watched the clip of Londoners removing security barriers to glimpse Banksy’s latest critique, I felt a similar sense of collective awe and empowerment. Together, these interactions with both murals speak to Banksy’s enduring role as a chronicler of human struggle and resilience, and the power of public art, even—or, perhaps, especially—in the face of erasure and suppression. —CLR Gordy Megroz | National Geographic | September 16, 2025 | 2,432 words* Nature has left me awestruck time and time again: whether gazing at the Big Sur coastline from a mountaintop monastery, watching the Colorado River carve a sharp U-turn at Dead Horse Point in Utah, or standing where Kīlauea’s lava meets the sea on Hawaii’s Big Island. A few years ago, Henry Wismayer’s essay on the science of awe made me wonder what, exactly, stirs such emotion. This question reemerged for me as I read Gordy Megroz’s National Geographic profile of Kai Xu, a 23-year-old mountain-loving mathematician who set out to measure this feeling. On a visit to California’s Eastern Sierra region, Xu was wowed by the sight of Mount Tom. At 13,652 feet, it’s far shorter than Mount Everest, the world’s tallest peak at 29,032 feet, but Xu found Mount Tom’s presence just as extraordinary. Are there attributes other than height that make a mountain great? Could awe be quantified? “He had never laid eyes on the Himalaya or the Andes or any of the world’s largest mountains,” writes Megroz, “but he couldn’t have been more impressed if he had.” Xu invented a new formula to calculate grandeur, factoring in a mountain’s height above its surroundings and the steepness of its rise to produce a single number called “jut”—a measure of how dramatically a peak thrusts into the sky. Math lovers will enjoy the story’s nerdy bent, but what stays with me most is Megroz’s ability to balance technical detail with emotional resonance. He never loses sight of the human story—of a bright, curious young man who sees the world in a new way, and challenges us to do the same. —CLR * requires an email address to read Alice Hines | New York | September 24, 2025 | 5,189 words A couple of stories about cloned animals have made it into our Top 5 in recent memory—specifically, polo ponies and dogs. But ponies and dogs aren’t exactly rare. What happens when someone uses cloning to propagate a species thousands of miles from its natural home? Even weirder, what happens when they use biotech to de-extinct a species—or create one that doesn’t exist? Enter Montana Mountain King, a Marco Polo argali who was born not in Central Asia, where all the spiral-horned ruminants live, but in (duh) Montana, where rancher Jack Schubarth had implanted cloned argali embryos into his pneumonia-prone sheep. That Schubarth managed this feat of husbandry was a miracle unto itself; had he done it legally, rather than sending his son to smuggle a strip of argali hide back from Kyrgyzstan, he’d likely be a hero of the conservation movement. Instead, he got six months in federal prison. The story of Schubarth and MMK is a fascinating one, even before ketamine and rectal probes make an appearance, but it’s also just the beginning. Alice Hines expands the scope from Schubarth’s operation to a thriving, if ethically ambiguous, animal biohacking industry. One company has seemingly revived the dire wolf and has its sight set on the dodo; another wants to breed unicorns and dragons. (All together, now: What could go wrong?) Throughout, Hines melds story and science with a deft touch, and turns what might otherwise be the tale of a single resourceful rancher into a more troubling look at a future that’s roaring toward us. The bleating edge of science, indeed. —PR Nicholas Hune-Brown | The Local | September 25, 2025 | 6,315 words Speight Rasees, a 2-year-old bay filly, suffered a catastrophic breakdown at Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, Ontario, in November 2024, crashing to the turf in an “awful tangle of limbs.” Jason Hoyte, the jockey, broke his shoulder in the accident, but Speight Rasees was not so lucky: She was euthanized by lethal injection. As Nicholas Hune-Brown reports for The Local, Speight Rasees was one of 10 horses to die after breakdowns at Woodbine in a two-month period in 2024, with several more injured. Proponents say horses receive the care and treatment of elite athletes. Critics charge that the injuries and deaths are proof that the sport needs to end. Given that the Ontario government props up racing with slot machine revenue because wagering alone is not enough to fund purses, the spate of carnage raises hard questions about precisely what the government is subsidizing. “That puts horse racing in a position that’s uncomfortable to defend,” writes Hune-Brown. “Each day at the track, hundreds of thousands of dollars in prize money are paid out to the owners of racehorses, a large percentage of which is government subsidy.” Horses break down and death is inevitable in racing. Hune-Brown worked at the track as a teen and, while reporting, even placed a $2 bet on a horse called Little Teddy. Despite rising to his feet “unconsciously along with the rest of the roaring crowd, a puppet on a string as the horses pounded their way down the homestretch,” Hune-Brown wears no rose-colored glasses of nostalgia. This piece is deeply sourced. He spoke to industry workers, horse owners, animal welfare activists, and Michael Copeland, CEO of Woodbine Entertainment Group. Hune-Brown urges us to take the reins, to take a close look at the horse racing industry and ask some questions: Who’s winning and who’s losing, and most importantly, why does Ontario choose to pay the price? —KS Robert Sanchez | 5280 | October 2, 2025 | 4,765 words I recently attended the funeral of my uncle, who suffered a severe cervical fracture after a fall. His health had rapidly deteriorated over the years. After being admitted to the hospital, he was awake and alert, but by the next morning, he was gone. On the day of his burial, I was struck by the orderliness of the military ceremony: the precise folding of the American flag handed to his wife; the Army vets in silent procession, lifting and firing their rifles in unison; the swift, almost ritualistic way a bulldozer covered his casket and smoothed the earth. This planned, meditative efficiency was a stark contrast to the suddenness of his death. It left me thinking about how we die, and what—if anything—we can control when our time comes. Nearly 10 years ago, Colorado voters passed the End of Life Options Act, legalizing medical aid in dying for terminally ill adults who meet specific criteria. Since then, about 1,100 people in the state have chosen this path. For 5280, Robert Sanchez spent the summer learning about this option through Denver Health’s Medical Aid in Dying clinic. Who is eligible? (A person of “sound mind” with six months or less to live.) Where can an “ingestion” take place? (Either a family’s home or the home of someone volunteering their property, since hospitals and hospices don’t permit the practice.) Sanchez was invited to witness families in their most intimate and vulnerable moments. There’s Alan, a man with aggressive lung cancer, who posed for a final family photo before taking his last drink. And there’s Astrid, a woman with ALS who requested to expedite the process to end her suffering. Sanchez captures tough scenes, including a moment when Astrid uses all her strength to reach for the doctor’s syringe to initiate the procedure (a patient must administer the dose themself). Sanchez writes with compassion and curiosity, observing without intrusion, and letting the moments unravel. Through these stories, he invites us to wrestle with this question: “How much control should we have over the terms of our own deaths?” The clinic’s director, a former ER doctor, tells him that “[a]ll stories need to have an ending, and we want our stories to matter.” I keep thinking about my uncle—and how, if given the chance, he would have shaped his own ending. —CLR John Woodrow Cox | The Washington Post | October 14, 2025 | 4,630 words It’s hard to watch videos of ICE agents snatching people in broad daylight across the US. They surface again and again in all of my feeds, each one blurring into the next. Most of the time, I can’t finish them. It’s easier to look away. Which is exactly why we need more pieces like this one: a thoughtful, deeply reported narrative that makes immigration and mass deportation feel less abstract. For The Washington Post, John Woodrow Cox writes about “H,” an Afghan man who supported the US during the war in Afghanistan. After arriving here through the humanitarian parole program, he applied for asylum and built a life—and raised two US-born kids—with his wife. But the Trump administration has since terminated the protections that allow Afghans like H to stay, with one Homeland Security staffer calling him an “unvetted alien from a high threat country.” H is anything but. He and his wife are law-abiding, hardworking, and educated: He took accounting classes, became a bookkeeper, and immersed himself in American culture, singing “Wheels on the Bus” in English to his kids and learning the language with the help of subtitles on Lost episodes. “He celebrated Thanksgiving with new friends, adopted the Chicago Bears, savored the buffet at Golden Corral,” writes Cox. “He imagined taking the naturalization oath and raising his family in the suburbs. He believed in Donald Trump.” Small yet vivid details like these make H’s journey impossible to ignore. Homeland Security claims that sending Afghans like H back to Taliban-controlled Afghanistan would pose no danger, but H believes that deportation means death for him and his family. For safety reasons, Cox withholds identifying details, but through interviews with H, his family, and their network of friends and colleagues, he builds a portrait of a man defined by hard work and faith—someone who still believes in the American dream, even as America turns him away. —CLR Carolyn Ariella Sofia | Aeon | October 20, 2025 | 4,013 words A chance meeting in a bookstore changed Carolyn Ariella Sofia’s life. The encounter was with Jerzy Kosiński, the Jewish Polish-American author of The Painted Bird, a harrowing novel about a boy wandering through Eastern European villages during the Second World War. Sofia describes the book with terrified awe: “a desperate note sent in a glass bottle that broke in my hands and made me bleed.” The two eventually go to dinner, where Sofia probes and unsettles Kosiński with her theory that one of his writing strategies is to “hide wartime details in female characters.” He resists exposure. Hiding had been deeply engraved into his psyche during childhood, when he survived the Holocaust by living with a Christian family, and Sofia cannot quite reach him. Their interactions remain taut and uneasy, almost menacing. He reveals little, even as he continues to draw her into a psychological game of cat and mouse. Beyond Kosiński, Sofia examines how the writers Georges Perec and Sarah Kofman divulge the fractured identities of their own war-torn childhoods, when they, too, suffocated their true selves to save their lives. This is no cozy read, but a piercing insight into how the inner turmoil of Holocaust survivors has painfully, gradually, turned into the raw material of their art. Sofia’s deft blend of psychology and literary analysis left me reeling at the complexity of survival, memory, and self-invention. —CW Jelani Cobb, Taylor Lorenz, Jack Shafer, and Max Tani | Harper’s Magazine | October 22, 2025 | 6,693 words There’s a video production company in Chicago called Mainstream Media, whose mission is to “help companies nationwide connect to their community with crisp and clear live video.” Mainstream Media is not a news organization, a point its founders have tried to make clear over the years, even adding a disclaimer to their website that reads, “We are not the actual ‘mainstream media.’” And yet, every so often—following bad-faith partisan attacks, for instance—the company receives messages from people angry at swaths of the American press. Misguided though they might be, these critics aren’t alone: Trust in the mass media is at its lowest point in half a century, according to one popular poll. And yet the mere existence of those annual polls reveals something about our perennial anxiety over the press. “Americans have never trusted large national institutions,” Jelani Cobb, dean of the Columbia Journalism School, remarks in this lively Harper’s forum with press critic Jack Shafer and reporters Max Tani and Taylor Lorenz. “In the nineteenth century, we didn’t trust the railroad monopolies; in the early twentieth century, we didn’t trust the newly corporatized banks. Today, when people think of a large, faceless, national institution, it’s more often than not the news media.” Is our loss in trust driven primarily by failures in coverage of Gaza or COVID-19, or about our collective distance from remote institutions that fail to reflect the communities they serve? The four journalists here differ in how they apportion responsibility, as well as how they interpret threats against press freedom in the US and what AI will do to entry-level journalism positions. They also complicate each other’s arguments productively, reminding each other, and us, that the mission of the media is, per Tani, to “meet people where they are.” You mean connect to our communities? Looks like Mainstream Media has the right idea. —BF Joanne McNeil | New York Review of Architecture | October 1, 2025 | 2,866 words I would be remiss if I didn’t start this blurb by tipping my hat to the editor who wrote this headline. I suspect many readers have already clicked on the link to the story purely because of this pun. Well done, whoever you are. Now to the meat of the thing: A self-driving Waymo taxi recently killed a bodega cat in San Francisco. In my book, that alone is reason enough to get the machines off the street. But I’m a grouch, so don’t listen to me—listen to Joanne McNeil. A resident of the Echo Park neighborhood of Los Angeles, McNeil considers Waymo and other robots now populating the city’s corridors in the context of the wider techno-capitalist push to force certain workers out of the US economy. McNeil follows a pink Coco food delivery robot to a ghost kitchen, where “twenty-six restaurants that exist only on DoorDash and Grubhub cook food for takeout customers” and “delivery bags and boxes are waiting . . . in lockers.” The endgame of facilities like this, McNeil posits, is to eliminate delivery drivers (and mom-and-pop restaurants, too). “It’s a setup primed for robots,” she writes, that “further warp[s] the coronavirus class divide: With machines (however remotely assisted) where essential workers used to be, those who WFH are ever more shielded from strangers beneath their tax bracket.” McNeil ties the robots in California’s streets to what’s happening in the state’s fields. She speaks to a Lyft driver originally from Salinas, who explains that agricultural companies in the Central Valley “haven’t been that vocal coming out against the ICE raids because they’re assuming that they’ll be able to automate farmwork.” In other words, they’ve decided it isn’t worth protecting the rights and dignity of people they won’t need to make money in the long term. In fewer words, they’re greedy and soulless. McNeil’s story is an essential tour of several overlapping landscapes—physical, technological, and political—shaped by the robber barons of the 21st century. —SD Anya Groner | Southlands | November 11, 2025 | 3,993 words It happens all the time: I’ll look up randomly while working, only to witness a black bear appear out of the bush and amble across our property. I can’t help but pause after these sightings. For me, it’s a moment of reverence for that wild being, and a reminder to be vigilant in the forest we share, to be sure they get the wide berth they deserve. Wendy Cowan tried to avoid conflict with a bear in the woods of Lunenburg County, Virginia, but unfortunately, things didn’t go as planned. In this piece for Southlands (a new publication!), Anya Groner recounts Cowan’s harrowing bear attack and reckons with the increasing encounters between bears and humans across the United States. This braided essay is a study in building tension; I sat motionless reading it, engrossed in Cowan’s encounter and an aftermath that was bloody in more ways than one. “For a moment, they were the same height, face to face and swaying like a dancing couple,” writes Groner. “Then the bear yawned, and Wendy knew she was in trouble.” Groner follows Cowan around Richmond’s East End, observing the survivor as she shares her story and photographic evidence with the curious. The scene work here brings depth to Cowan as a main character, shading in a painful and lengthy recovery period while highlighting the attack’s lasting—and surprisingly positive—emotional outcomes. Cowan’s made deep and profound connections with those who take a moment to listen to her story and to share their own trauma. She’s found a community of survivors, and for this, she’s grateful to the bear. This piece, while at times a terrifying read, is a stark and beautiful reminder of what happens when we refuse to be defined by the things we cannot control. —KS B. ‘Toastie’ Oaster | High Country News | November 7, 2025 | 6,282 words This piece deals with suicide. If you’re having thoughts of self-harm, please call or text 988 in the US, or chat online at 988lifeline.org, for a free, confidential conversation with a trained crisis counselor. Journalist B. ‘Toastie’ Oaster opens their High Country News piece with the words of young Indigenous metalheads on the Blackfeet Nation who have known people who have committed suicide: “Suicide has impacted my old friend group quite a bit.” “I’ve lost friends. I’ve lost family.” “My older brother.” “My sister’s youngest.” Their sobering remarks and the endless pain they hold stopped me in my tracks. Some are still teens. All have found belonging in heavy metal music, release in the fast and the loud. In vivid prose, Oaster reports on the finale of an alternative high school course that dives deep into heavy music and its history, politics, and values. As students discuss the art form, they identify subgenres of metal, deconstruct songs, and respond to what moves them. Some get inspired to start bands. Oaster also covers Fire in the Mountains, a “black metal Coachella” that took place on the Blackfeet Nation over three days in July 2025. Metal can seem violent and harsh to the uninitiated, but that easy assessment overlooks the community behind the music, a safe space where people can work through their troubles in a constructive way. “But something deeper draws metalheads together, perhaps a willingness to inquire on levels the establishment forbids,” writes Oaster. “What most clearly sets it apart from other genres is that it’s so rooted in anger and sadness—or their common ancestors: terror, lack, isolation and despair. Metal, one fan told me, is ‘a strange road to joy.’” Above all, this moving, life-affirming piece reminds us that when the going gets tough, the tough start headbanging. —KS Naomi Klein | Equator | November 26, 2025 | 7,346 words Why does this moment in time feel so uniquely awful? Naomi Klein’s expansive essay about art, philosophy, and political resistance addresses this nagging question, one that I’ve personally struggled to answer through a burst of fury every time I hear someone say, “This too shall pass.” Certainly, the concentration of horrors is part of it. We’re confronted with—and in some cases complicit in—fascism, genocide, and climatological destruction, to name just a few of the catastrophes at hand. And yes, recency bias is a factor. What’s happening now is raw, an open wound. But Klein articulates another crucial aspect. “[Time] doesn’t merely circle,” she writes, “it spirals, returning to places that feel familiar but are fundamentally different, having accumulated all the weight of what came before.” Walter Benjamin, whom Klein references throughout her piece, put it this way: “[History is] one single catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage.” In other words, today feels worse than the past because of the past. What should be the gifts of history have become painful burdens. Hard-won wisdom and knowledge are willfully ignored. Collective pledges to do and be better (“never again”) are perverted to justify new atrocities. How, then, to survive the ever-worsening of the world, the compounding of wreckage? “The interesting thing about spirals,” Klein notes, “is that if they switch directions, they don’t tighten—they broaden, opening like sunflowers, like seashells, like galaxies.” Reversing course means finding shared purpose not just in rejecting cruelty and destruction but in creating their antitheses. Among other people and movements, Klein directs readers to the Surrealists as an example of creative resistance: “We still have much to learn from their efforts—from their endless manifestos, their raucous debates, their sense of play, their solidarities, and their determination to pool their collective powers to meet the scale of their moment in history.” —SD Explore all of our annual collections since 2011.

Title: The ugly truth at the heart of America's miserable job market

When Gbenga Ajilore thinks about America's job market, a few things keep him up at night: The slowing demand for entry-level talent, tariff chaos, and high interest rates. ChatGPT isn't one of them. "There is going to come a point where AI is just a part of everything that we do, but we're not there yet," Ajilore, who is chief economist at the left-leaning Center for Budget Policy and Priorities, said, adding, "The economy is paralyzed." The labor market is showing clear signs of weakness. Long-term unemployment has been trending upward, and the share of Americans looking for work recently eclipsed the number of available roles. Alongside a steady drum of layoff headlines, unemployment ticked up more than expected last month to 4.6%. Young people are having trouble breaking in, older workers are hesitant to retire, and with the "flattening" of many companies, the middle rungs of the career ladder are crumbling. Only healthcare and construction showed substantial growth. It's been called the white-collar recession, an unwelcome awakening for Americans who hoped their college degree would translate to long-term stability and a comfortable salary. Given the timing, it's easy to villainize artificial intelligence. C-Suite leaders across industries have said they're "all in on AI," often to the dismay of rank-and-file employees. The tech is quickly reshaping how workers are assessed on the job and how companies define productivity. It's even shaking up the hiring process: My colleagues have talked to job seekers who submitted hundreds of résumés without landing a role, as HR departments are swamped by AI-assisted applications. Economists and investors can't agree if chatbots are the future of the workforce or a vastly overblown bubble. But, in shouldering the blame for America's job market woes, AI has become a scapegoat for something else: The economy itself is deteriorating. Years of higher interest rates and stubborn inflation, along with slowing wage growth and restrictive trade policies, have created an environment where businesses are slashing budgets and the middle class is living paycheck to paycheck. If you're frustrated by a lower-than-expected raise or the inability to land a new gig, don't blame the robots. Blame Jerome Powell. There is no better example of the AI-is-wrecking-the-job-market fears than the so-called "Scariest Chart in the World." The chart has popped up in X and Bluesky posts, news reports, and a thick stack of Substack newsletters. The simple, two-line chart tracks two pieces of data: the S&P 500 and the number of US job vacancies since 2015. The two run closely together for the first couple of years, but there is a decided break in 2022 — the stock market continues to soar, and the number of available jobs begins to decline. AI doomers are quick to point out that the date those two lines diverged corresponds to the public launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT. The implication being that the explosion of large language models immediately began replacing thousands of jobs while pouring money into Wall Street.

As chatbots and AI tools make employees more productive — drafting emails, writing code, and streamlining administrative tasks — and employers more profitable, the thinking goes, there will be less need for hiring human workers. There's plenty of anecdotal evidence from high-profile companies to support the idea. Nvidia wants employees to use AI "for every task possible," Microsoft is "rethinking" its business model for the AI age, Big Law is hoping AI can make its services faster and cheaper, and top banks and consulting firms are transferring some tasks from people to bots. But is AI already replacing a bunch of jobs? Probably not. Ajilore thinks the AI-sparked white collar downturn is "overblown." Many companies are "using AI as a cheat code as opposed to something that makes them more efficient," he said, "With the cheat code, you actually end up making mistakes and cutting corners." He believes that both chatbots and Corporate America's tech strategy have a long way to go before AI truly disrupts the workforce. Even Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, the most powerful economic policymaker in the world, isn't sold on AI's effects on the current job market. When asked about the technology during the Fed's December meeting, Powell said AI "is part of the story, but it's not a big part of the story yet." There's also an important piece of context missing from "The Scariest Chart in the World": the federal funds rate. Decided eight times a year by Powell and his colleagues on the all-important (and dully-named) Federal Open Markets Committee, the Fed funds rate is the key interest rate that anchors all types of loans. For banks and businesses, the number determines how easily and cheaply they can borrow money. For consumers, Fed rates impact everything from home prices to auto loans and credit card rates. When interest rates are low, businesses can access debt more affordably, which helps them fuel growth and hiring. As the fed fund rate increases, however, the price of borrowing rises too. This can help keep inflation in check, but higher rates make it more expensive for companies to operate, meaning that many are seeking other areas to cut costs — often at the expense of employees. It's true that the S&P 500 and job openings began to diverge right as ChatGPT launched, but that's also when interest rates started to climb. Between early 2022 and late 2024, federal funds jumped by over 5 percentage points. This was a reshaping of monetary strategy meant to curb soaring prices and cool off a too-hot economy, and it was a major break with nearly a generation of previous policy. The Fed originally slashed interest rates to zero in 2008 to address the fallout from the financial crisis, and in the following 12 years, the benchmark interest rate never rose above 2.4%. Following the emergency measures of the early pandemic, the dramatic hikes of 2022 were a sign that the zero-interest-rate era of the 2010s had officially come to an end. This sudden interest rate rise was a turning point many businesses. Hiring boomed in the early pandemic: Job openings skyrocketed to record highs as tech and business fields scrambled to snap up new talent. The Beige Book — a collection of quotes and insights gathered from business owners across the country by the various regional Federal Reserve banks — provides a valuable window into the thinking of hiring managers and executives during this period. Labor market commentary across 2021 and 2022 Beige Books tend to reference "modest to strong" job growth, robust hiring demand, and a shortage of workers, with very few mentions of interest rates. This changed when the Fed started hiking rates. One note in the November 2022 edition of the Beige Book said that "Interest rates and inflation continued to weigh on activity," another said "labor demand weakened overall," pointing to layoffs in tech, finance, and real estate. Both blue-collar and white-collar sectors felt the brunt of interest rates that year, citing steep borrowing costs as a central reason they're not hiring. Americans, meanwhile, stopped quitting their jobs as vacancies dried up, and the job market saw its biggest layoff spike since the 2020 shutdown. Corporate America began to lean into "efficiency" rhetoric alongside rising rates. Reduced bureaucracy and red tape, along with a smaller workforce, were sold by the C-Suite as a profit panacea in the face of higher financing costs. Leaders at Meta, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and others spoke about hiring freezes and job cuts as a productivity bet versus a financial issue. The trend continued: An October 2023 Beige Book note said many sectors "reduced hiring plans" and were "rightsizing" their budgets because of rising rates. Fast forward to today, and businesses are still grappling with the increased cost of funding, even as Powell and the Fed have moved slowly to lower their benchmark rate. In October's Beige Book, businesses big and small mentioned layoffs and attrition more so than new hiring. Beige Book reports over the past year suggest that AI is contributing to hiring softening in certain areas, such as call centers and accounting firms, but not widespread job displacement. Instead, "uncertainty" and "tariffs" were two of the most frequently mentioned words by companies such as Tesla, JPMorgan, and Whirlpool during earnings calls. But saying the need for layoffs is the result of a long-term change in the cost of financing isn't very sexy. Better to point to AI as both an excuse for layoffs and a way to give investors hope for the future. Chen Zhao, head of economics research at the real estate firm Redfin, said many companies are struggling to balance profits with the steep cost of borrowing money. This is especially true in the housing sector, she said, because it's sensitive to the federal funds rate. She said fields like tech are similarly vulnerable. "I think that what's happening is just simple economics," she said, adding, "But when you say that you're going to do layoffs or you're not going to be hiring as much, it doesn't sound very good to investors. It sounds a lot better if you say that you're seeing all these productivity enhancements because of AI." Each recent technological development — computers, cellphones, the internet — has reshaped the job market and the workplace, but people tend to underestimate the timeline. Economists said it will take years, possibly decades, before we have concrete evidence that AI is replacing jobs on a large scale. And AI may create thousands of jobs as it makes others obsolete. "I think the overall evolution of the technology is going to be a lot slower than both the optimists and doomers think," said Scott Lincicome, vice president of economics and trade at the right-leaning Cato Institute. AI has developed rapidly, and while it can perform basic tasks, it is still a long way from replacing human judgment, creativity, and decision-making. "There will certainly be disruptions, that's inevitable," he said. "But it won't be cataclysmic." The job market is in a rut — but chatbots aren't the sole, or even the main, culprit. Despite the weakening job market numbers, the Federal Reserve has cut rates three times this year, a cautious policy stance brought on by economic precarity. Recent Fed reports show that trade policy and inflation are keeping Powell and company from cutting rates at a faster pace, even as the employment outlook weakens. It has also sparked division within the central bank itself: The December meeting saw the highest number of Fed members disagreeing with the interest rate committee's final decision since 2019. Economic projections also show the median committee member expects one rate cut in 2026, less than projected at this time last year. The moves signal an economic situation that isn't catastrophic, so long as Powell plays his cards carefully. A pattern of cuts could start bringing relief for borrowers, but it will take time for the economy to recover — and there are still steep headwinds. Fast-changing tariffs are exacerbating the impact of high rates, making many businesses hesitant to invest or spend money. As Lincicome put it, "Tariff uncertainty is really a drag on the job market because companies are saddled with millions, if not billions, of dollars in additional taxes and tariff costs." Declining immigration due to Trump's deportation policies is also part of the equation: Fewer immigrants in the workforce is contributing to a slowing labor force participation rate. Ajilore also said that the sweeping cost-cutting strategy of DOGE for the federal workforce added fuel to the corporate world's "efficiency" crusade. It all adds up to some extremely valid job anxiety for workers. Economists expect the market to grow and adapt alongside new technology — and the AI takeover forecast is far less grim than most people realize. The chatbot revolution may come someday. But, for better or worse, the real headliner is the federal funds rate. Allie Kelly is a reporter on Business Insider's Economy team.

Title: The ugly truth at the heart of America's miserable job market

When Gbenga Ajilore thinks about America's job market, a few things keep him up at night: The slowing demand for entry-level talent, tariff chaos, and high interest rates. ChatGPT isn't one of them. "There is going to come a point where AI is just a part of everything that we do, but we're not there yet," Ajilore, who is chief economist at the left-leaning Center for Budget Policy and Priorities, said, adding, "The economy is paralyzed." The labor market is showing clear signs of weakness. Long-term unemployment has been trending upward, and the share of Americans looking for work recently eclipsed the number of available roles. Alongside a steady drum of layoff headlines, unemployment ticked up more than expected last month to 4.6%. Young people are having trouble breaking in, older workers are hesitant to retire, and with the "flattening" of many companies, the middle rungs of the career ladder are crumbling. Only healthcare and construction showed substantial growth. It's been called the white-collar recession, an unwelcome awakening for Americans who hoped their college degree would translate to long-term stability and a comfortable salary. Given the timing, it's easy to villainize artificial intelligence. C-Suite leaders across industries have said they're "all in on AI," often to the dismay of rank-and-file employees. The tech is quickly reshaping how workers are assessed on the job and how companies define productivity. It's even shaking up the hiring process: My colleagues have talked to job seekers who submitted hundreds of résumés without landing a role, as HR departments are swamped by AI-assisted applications. Economists and investors can't agree if chatbots are the future of the workforce or a vastly overblown bubble. But, in shouldering the blame for America's job market woes, AI has become a scapegoat for something else: The economy itself is deteriorating. Years of higher interest rates and stubborn inflation, along with slowing wage growth and restrictive trade policies, have created an environment where businesses are slashing budgets and the middle class is living paycheck to paycheck. If you're frustrated by a lower-than-expected raise or the inability to land a new gig, don't blame the robots. Blame Jerome Powell. There is no better example of the AI-is-wrecking-the-job-market fears than the so-called "Scariest Chart in the World." The chart has popped up in X and Bluesky posts, news reports, and a thick stack of Substack newsletters. The simple, two-line chart tracks two pieces of data: the S&P 500 and the number of US job vacancies since 2015. The two run closely together for the first couple of years, but there is a decided break in 2022 — the stock market continues to soar, and the number of available jobs begins to decline. AI doomers are quick to point out that the date those two lines diverged corresponds to the public launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT. The implication being that the explosion of large language models immediately began replacing thousands of jobs while pouring money into Wall Street.

As chatbots and AI tools make employees more productive — drafting emails, writing code, and streamlining administrative tasks — and employers more profitable, the thinking goes, there will be less need for hiring human workers. There's plenty of anecdotal evidence from high-profile companies to support the idea. Nvidia wants employees to use AI "for every task possible," Microsoft is "rethinking" its business model for the AI age, Big Law is hoping AI can make its services faster and cheaper, and top banks and consulting firms are transferring some tasks from people to bots. But is AI already replacing a bunch of jobs? Probably not. Ajilore thinks the AI-sparked white collar downturn is "overblown." Many companies are "using AI as a cheat code as opposed to something that makes them more efficient," he said, "With the cheat code, you actually end up making mistakes and cutting corners." He believes that both chatbots and Corporate America's tech strategy have a long way to go before AI truly disrupts the workforce. Even Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, the most powerful economic policymaker in the world, isn't sold on AI's effects on the current job market. When asked about the technology during the Fed's December meeting, Powell said AI "is part of the story, but it's not a big part of the story yet." There's also an important piece of context missing from "The Scariest Chart in the World": the federal funds rate. Decided eight times a year by Powell and his colleagues on the all-important (and dully-named) Federal Open Markets Committee, the Fed funds rate is the key interest rate that anchors all types of loans. For banks and businesses, the number determines how easily and cheaply they can borrow money. For consumers, Fed rates impact everything from home prices to auto loans and credit card rates. When interest rates are low, businesses can access debt more affordably, which helps them fuel growth and hiring. As the fed fund rate increases, however, the price of borrowing rises too. This can help keep inflation in check, but higher rates make it more expensive for companies to operate, meaning that many are seeking other areas to cut costs — often at the expense of employees. It's true that the S&P 500 and job openings began to diverge right as ChatGPT launched, but that's also when interest rates started to climb. Between early 2022 and late 2024, federal funds jumped by over 5 percentage points. This was a reshaping of monetary strategy meant to curb soaring prices and cool off a too-hot economy, and it was a major break with nearly a generation of previous policy. The Fed originally slashed interest rates to zero in 2008 to address the fallout from the financial crisis, and in the following 12 years, the benchmark interest rate never rose above 2.4%. Following the emergency measures of the early pandemic, the dramatic hikes of 2022 were a sign that the zero-interest-rate era of the 2010s had officially come to an end. This sudden interest rate rise was a turning point many businesses. Hiring boomed in the early pandemic: Job openings skyrocketed to record highs as tech and business fields scrambled to snap up new talent. The Beige Book — a collection of quotes and insights gathered from business owners across the country by the various regional Federal Reserve banks — provides a valuable window into the thinking of hiring managers and executives during this period.

Title: Solana Foundation Outlines Plans To Combat Emerging Quantum Computing Risks
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/solana-foundation-plan-to-combat-quantum-computing/
Time Published: 2025-12-17T09:00:41Z

As concerns about the potential risks posed by quantum computing to the cryptocurrency landscape grow, the Solana Foundation has taken new measures by announcing a collaboration with Project Eleven, which specializes in post-quantum security. In a Tuesday press release, the Solana Foundation outlined its commitment to fortifying the cryptocurrency’s ecosystem against the implications of quantum computing. Through this initiative, Project Eleven has conducted a comprehensive threat assessment and successfully prototyped a functioning testnet utilizing post-quantum digital signatures. Under their engagement, Project Eleven undertook a risk analysis to evaluate how forthcoming breakthroughs in quantum computing could impact various facets of Solana’s infrastructure. Areas scrutinized included user wallets, validator security, and the foundational cryptographic assumptions that underpin the network. Moreover, Project Eleven has implemented a working post-quantum signature system on a Solana testnet, demonstrating that quantum-resistant transactions can be both practical and scalable. Matt Sorg, VP of Technology at the Solana Foundation, emphasized the organization’s approach: “Our responsibility is to ensure Solana remains secure not just today, but decades into the future.” He noted that the culture of innovation within the Solana ecosystem would continue to thrive with the upcoming release of a second client and an advanced consensus mechanism this year. Alex Pruden, CEO of Project Eleven, echoed this sentiment, stating, “Solana didn’t wait for quantum computers to become a headline problem. They invested early, asked the hard questions, and took actionable steps today.” Solana’s stance comes amid alarming reports indicating that quantum computers could potentially undermine blockchain security by developing algorithms capable of deciphering private keys. This scenario raises significant concerns for any digital assets operating on blockchain technology that rely on digital signatures, making them vulnerable to quantum hacking. As such, industry experts are actively exploring various measures to bolster cryptocurrency networks against these threats. Doug Finke, Chief Content Officer at Global Quantum Intelligence, pointed out that several groups are integrating the three post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms established by NIST into their platforms. He emphasized the uncertainty surrounding when a sufficiently powerful quantum computer might be developed, raising the stakes even further. Finke stated, “What’s worse, if an unfriendly party does develop such a computer, they may not let anyone know about it.” Currently, several cryptocurrencies have already begun incorporating quantum-safe cryptography into their architecture, including Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL), Cellframe, and Bitcoin Quantum from BTQ. Among those issuing warnings about the looming threats from quantum computing are notable figures such as Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko, Capriole Investment founder Charles Edwards, and representatives from major firms like BlackRock and Google. Yakovenko has urged the Bitcoin community to accelerate efforts to implement quantum-resistant upgrades. He believes there is a 50% chance of a significant quantum breakthrough occurring within the next five years, further emphasizing the need for vigilance. At the time of writing, SOL is trading at $127, which is a 6.7% decrease in price over the past seven days. Compared to the all-time high of $293 reached earlier this year, SOL is trading at almost 56% below this threshold.

Title: Microsoft, Apple, Meta and Amazon’s stocks are lagging the S&P 500 this year—but Google is up 62% and AI investors think it has room to run
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/17/microsoft-apple-meta-and-amazons-stocks-are-lagging-the-sp-500-this-year-but-google-is-up-62-and-ai-investors-think-it-has-room-to-run/
Time Published: 2025-12-17T09:00:00Z
Full Content:
Investing in Big Tech companies used to be simple and straightforward. You could simply scoop up a basket of the five internet giants—Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and Google’s parent firm, Alphabet—and count on them to outperform the market. Their share prices didn’t move strictly in tandem, but you could expect a close sector-wide correlation. Now, in the AI era, all that’s gone out the window. Looking at the share performance of the Big Five this year, it’s hard to believe these companies are in the same category. Three of the group are lagging slightly behind the overall S&P 500 index, which is on track for a roughly 16% gain this year. The group—Microsoft, Apple, and Meta—is instead pacing at around 13%, 12%, and 10%, respectively. A fourth, onetime market darling Amazon, is floundering far behind with a miserable 1% gain. Then there is Google, whose current gains of around 62% make it one of the best performing stocks of 2025. This wild divergence among the biggest of the Big Tech players is directly tied to how well they are faring in artificial intelligence. In the past two years, AI has become an overriding fixation for investors, and led all five companies to spend eye-popping sums on talent and infrastructure. Google, though, appears to be the only one that has parlayed its investment into a winning business strategy. This raises the question of how exactly the search giant pulled this off, and whether any of the four laggards can do the same—and deliver a similar win for their suffering shareholders. Google’s AI-fueled stock gains are impressive, especially in light of its early misfires with the technology. The most notable of these came in February of 2024 when, in an attempt to pull even with the capabilities of OpenAI’s wildly popular ChatGPT, Google rebooted its first mediocre AI chatbot, Bard, and launched a rebranded, multimodal AI under the new Gemini name. The new product’s error-filled results and blatant political biases—including the depiction of Nazis as people of color—led investors to punish Google stock, and worry that the company’s leadership had already lost the AI race. That narrative soon changed, however, when Google took Gemini back to the shop for a deep overhaul, and released vastly improved versions in the second half of last year. Meanwhile, the company has integrated AI features almost seamlessly into its core search product, while creating buzz around new products like image-generating service Nano Banana, which debuted this summer. These launches have helped boost its share price, but are just one part of a broader AI success story. The reason Google is pulling away is because the company is tapping into various AI strengths, and building a broader flywheel that is generating a constant series of improvements. For starters, the search giant has a powerful research lab in the form of Google DeepMind that has helped it build a model to compete with the likes of OpenAI. It also has its own in-house cloud service, Google Cloud, which provides the infrastructure to satisfy the insatiable energy and compute demands of running a scaled AI service. Critically, its infrastructure stack also includes its in-house AI chips, called Tensor Processing Units, meaning Google doesn’t have to compete in the global scramble for Nvidia chips. Meanwhile, TPUs are far from a second-rate technology. The latest version of the chip, known as Ironwood, is the TPU’s seventh iteration, and is being sought out by other leading AI players. All of this means Google is singularly positioned among its Big Tech rivals to excel in AI technology and know-how. At the same time, its recent performance has allayed fears that broadening its AI offerings meant cannibalizing revenue from its core search business. Instead, Google is showing that AI can be accretive, even allowing the company to charge advertisers more on the ground that clicks tied to tools like AI Overview reflect a high search intent. Even better for the company, it has numerous products where it can test and fine-tune its AI offerings, including YouTube, Maps, and its core search product. And while not known as an enterprise company, products like Google Docs, Sheets, and Gmail mean it has millions of opportunities to test out AI in the workplace. Finally, Google has a strong foothold in the devices sector—where many think the future fight for AI dominance will play out—thanks to Pixel phones and long involvement in the Android operating system. All of Google’s Big Tech rivals, meanwhile, lack some or most of the components making up its AI flywheel. But the story of Silicon Valley is one of constant disruption, meaning any of the other firms still has a shot to build or buy their way back into the lead. The value of Big Tech firms is, like any company, determined by multiple factors. Still, the relatively poor performance of shares in Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Meta appears to be entirely a function of their failing to show big returns on their massive AI investments. Amazon, the worst of the laggards by far, does have one obvious attribute that makes it a contender: its industry-leading AWS cloud, which means the firm is well positioned to run AI operations at scale. Unfortunately, the Seattle firm is falling far short on other fronts. In the case of chips, Amazon has been producing its own, known as Trainium, for some time in order to reduce reliance on Nvidia. The chips, however, appear far from best in class—an assessment reflected in the decision of Amazon’s close partner, Anthropic, to deploy Google’s chips as well. On the LLM front, Amazon has its own models, but has also invested $8 billion in Anthropic, reflecting its ongoing need to build strategic capacity to keep up with other big AI players. Meanwhile, Amazon has few options when it comes to deploying the AI expertise it acquires. Shopping, which is the company’s bread and butter, is just one narrow application in a far broader field, while Amazon’s Alexa and Echo devices have nowhere near the reach of numerous Google products. At the same time, Amazon has not made the most of the device opportunities it does have; reviews of its new AI-branded AIexa+ have been lukewarm. Then there is Meta, which is the second worst stock performer of the Big Five this year, despite flashing early promise in AI. That potential has been most prominent in the company’s family of open-source Llama models, which Meta is deploying across its various properties, including Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram. The most recent versions of Llama, however, have failed to keep up with rivals’ newer models, even as the company is spending eye-watering amounts of money to poach prominent AI researchers. Less encouraging for Meta’s AI efforts are its lack of a cloud and limited in-house chip capacity, which has led it to turn to Google as a supplier. And while its huge social media footprint is a natural distribution platform, tech observers note that Meta has already deployed AI extensively to boost ad performance—and that it may have already reaped most of the significant gains on this front. Worse, according to the New York Times, the splashy new hires have created internal company friction between the researchers who want to push the bounds of AI science, and company executives who want to see concrete financial gains. As for Microsoft, the Big Tech firm that has come closest among the laggards in keeping pace with the S&P 500, it has the same cloud advantage as Amazon and Google. It is also a relatively early mover in the AI field, thanks to its large investment in OpenAI and early ties to the startup. Lately, though, the tie-up between Microsoft and OpenAI’s Sam Altman has been strained, which could complicate the software giant’s future path. Unlike its archrival Google, Microsoft is not known for its chip prowess and has largely relied on Nvidia GPUs over its in-house chips. And while the company has a huge distribution footprint—think Office, Bing, LinkedIn, and more—it has failed to rack up early wins. That includes in the enterprise sector, which Microsoft traditionally dominates, but where its Copilot AI tool has failed to impress. Finally, there is Apple, whose AI record has been sparse and disappointing. This is perhaps surprising given the iPhone maker’s extensive hardware expertise, and long experience with cloud services. Apple, however, faces distinct challenges from other Big Tech firms. Those include making privacy a core part of its brand appeal. This may appeal to consumers, but it’s also not conducive to the sort of massive data-gobbling that goes with building large AI models. The growing perception that Google is pulling away with the AI game is reflected both in vibes and in the company’s share price. At the same time, there is another key metric that suggests the stock price could go higher still. Namely, the P/E ratio—a metric that has long been useful in determining whether a company is overvalued—is currently around 30 for Google. That is around the same level as Meta and Amazon, and significantly lower than that of Microsoft and Apple, which means the market may not have yet baked in the possibility of Google translating its AI performance into revenue growth. Even as Google is enjoying front-of-the-pack status among its longtime internet peers, there are two developments that could significantly shake up the AI race in Big Tech. The first is one of its rivals carrying out a major acquisition to boost their standing in AI, and more effectively take on Google. This may be easier said than done, however, since there are relatively few big AI startups left on the board. The most tempting target may be Anthropic, but its valuation has grown so large that it may be too big even for a Big Tech firm to swallow. The other factor that could shake up the AI race is shifting consumer behavior. There is wide speculation that people will come to embrace new ways to interact with AI, including through new types of wearable or embedded devices. Startups like Friend are selling AI pendants, and Meta is making a major bet on Ray-Ban–style glasses with built-in AI screens. Sales of these wearable AI devices, however, have been modest at best, and it’s not clear they will ever fully catch on. Instead, it’s not hard to imagine consumers choosing to stick with their phones and watches for the foreseeable AI future, until a new paradigm emerges—perhaps one involving internal chips and biometrics. The upshot is that the contours of the AI economy are still emerging, and that new technologies and companies will arrive to serve it en masse. Until then, however, the companies at the core of Big Tech will continue to have a big AI presence—especially Google.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs See Another $277 Million Outflow with Long-Term Holders Selling

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $277 million in net outflows on December 16, led by BlackRock’s IBIT, as total ETF AUM fell sharply over the past two months. Amid the strong Bitcoin BTC $88 095 24h volatility: 1.0% Market cap: $1.76 T Vol. 24h: $65.78 B price correction, spot Bitcoin ETF outflows have surged simultaneously, clocking another $277 million on Dec. 16. This surge in outflows, along with the sell-off from long-term holders, highlights the waning institutional sentiment. BTC price is currently around $86,500 as analysts brace for further volatility ahead of the US CPI, and BoJ rate hike decisions this week. On Tuesday, Dec. 16, spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded outflows for the second consecutive day at $277 million. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led the most outflows at $210 million, followed by Bitwise’s BITB at $50 million as per Farside Investors data. Fidelity’s FBTC was the only Bitcoin fund to see positive inflows at $26.7 million, while the rest others saw zero or negative flows. As per the on-chain data, the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) dumped a total of 2.405 BTC yesterday. However, the trading activity remains elevated with $2.8 billion in total volumes. BlackRock Bitcoin ETF trading: Source: Trader T Moreover, the net assets under management (AUM) across all Bitcoin ETFs saw a sharp drop from $169.5 billion to $120.7 billion over the past 60 days. November alone saw net outflows totaling $3.79 billion, reported market analyst Shanaka Anslem Perera. He added that BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, accounted for a significant portion of the decline, recording approximately $2.7 billion in redemptions over a five-week period. The sustained outflows suggest strong institutional selling pressure in the market. On-chain data shows that long-term holders (LTH) of Bitcoin are locking in gains, while selling on every rise. According to data from CryptoQuant, the recent sell-off from LTHs over the past 30 days is one of the largest in the last five years. It added that selling by this cohort has historically occurred closer to market highs rather than during price bottoms. Current data shows long-term holder supply declining from record levels, while Bitcoin continues to trade well above the LTH realized price. This shows that the recent selling reflects profit-taking behavior instead of any panic-driven capitulation. Market experts like Peter Brandt expect an 80% Bitcoin crash from the highs. Bitcoin long-term holder selloff | Source: CryptoQuant All eyes will be on the macro events such as the release of US CPI data and the Bank of Japan (BoJ) rate hike. The Bank of Japan is expected to raise its policy rate to 0.75%, making it the country’s highest interest rate level since 1995. Each of the Bank of Japan’s previous rate hikes has coincided with sharp declines in Bitcoin, with past drawdowns ranging between 23% and 31%.

Amazon is set to fire 370 people at its European headquarters in Luxembourg in the coming weeks, as Bloomberg reports. That accounts for about 8.5 percent of the workforce. Amazon initially planned to reduce its headcount there by 470, but under European Union law, companies have to negotiate layoffs with employee reps and, in some cases, governments.

PARAMOUNT AFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO SUPERIOR $30 PER SHARE ALL-CASH OFFER FOR WARNER BROS. DISCOVERY Urges WBD shareholders to send a clear message to WBD that they prefer Paramount's superior offer by tendering their shares Confident its fully financed offer will deliver WBD shareholders with superior value and a faster, more certain path to completion than the Netflix transaction Reiterates its commitment to pursuing all options to deliver the value and benefits of its offer for all stakeholders LOS ANGELES and NEW YORK, Dec. 17, 2025 -- Paramount, a Skydance Corporation (NASDAQ: PSKY) ("Paramount"), today affirmed its commitment to acquiring Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ: WBD) ("WBD") in response to the WBD Board's recommendation against Paramount's $30.00 per share all-cash tender offer. Paramount's offer provides WBD shareholders superior value compared to the transaction with Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), including the certainty of 100% cash and no exposure to equity market fluctuations: Paramount's offer is $30 per share in cash versus Netflix's cash component of only $23.25 per share (an $18 billion difference in the aggregate); The value of Netflix's offer has been further reduced as its share price trades below the bottom of the "collar" on its stock component; Netflix's offer would leave WBD shareholders owning a highly leveraged stub in Global Networks and WBD's Board provides no valuation of that stub; and Netflix's offer has a dollar-for-dollar reduction to what WBD shareholders will receive tied to the net debt on Global Networks. Paramount is highly confident its offer would receive timely regulatory approval because it would enhance competition in the creative industries rather than entrench a dominant streaming monopoly that the Netflix transaction envisions. Paramount has lined up all necessary financing to deliver its offer to WBD shareholders, and it is not subject to any financing conditions. Paramount's offer will be financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo. David Ellison, Chairman & CEO, Paramount said: "We remain committed to bringing together two iconic Hollywood studios to create a unique global entertainment leader. Our proposal clearly offers WBD shareholders superior value and certainty, a clear path to close, and does not leave them with a heavily indebted sub-scale linear business. I have been encouraged by the feedback we have received from WBD shareholders who clearly understand the benefits of our offer. We will continue to move forward to deliver this transaction, which is in the best interest of WBD shareholders, consumers, and the creative industries." WBD's own narrative of the actions that led to its inferior transaction with Netflix reveals a process which was not run to secure the best offer for WBD shareholders. Most notably, the absence of any engagement by WBD with Paramount in the face of a superior all-cash $30 per share offer speaks for itself. WBD seeks to justify racing to conclude an inferior deal with Netflix with a "kitchen sink" litany of purported questions and concerns. Missing from the cloud of obfuscation is any explanation for why WBD and its advisors did not lift a finger to get any of those questions answered or concerns addressed? WBD seeks to mislead its shareholders into believing this is a complicated question about legal documents. In reality, it is all quite simple: $30 in cash fully backstopped by a well-capitalized trust (in existence for approximately 40 years) of one of the most well-known founders and entrepreneurs in the world, Larry Ellison. Yet from mid-September all the way through to December 4, what is glaring is the absolute resistance on the part of WBD to even engage in a single negotiating session with Paramount or its advisors, and a refusal even to provide a mark-up of any transaction document. As described in Paramount's letter to WBD shareholders, Paramount's December 4 offer included an equity commitment from the Ellison family trust, which contains over $250 billion of assets (more than 6x the equity funding commitment) including approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares and tens of billions of dollars in other assets. This information is publicly available; and, notably, the trust has been a counterparty in other completed public company transactions including for Twitter, which involved one of WBD's advisors. The equity commitment papers submitted to WBD were identical in all material respects to commitments that the advisors to WBD had agreed to in other large transactions such as Twitter and Electronic Arts. Also missing in WBD's long exposition of its flawed process is any financial analysis whatsoever to show what numbers the WBD Board considered. Where is the valuation of the stub equity in Global Networks? Where is the description of the financial analysis their bankers provided - disclosure that is standard when a board of directors explains its thinking to its shareholders? WBD shareholders deserve to know this information and understand what is being hidden from them. It is also noteworthy that the Board of WBD failed to even make the determination that Paramount's $30 per share all-cash offer "could reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal" under WBD's transaction agreement with Netflix. This failure is yet another example of WBD's pattern of ignoring Paramount's value-maximizing offer, perhaps in the hopes it will just go away. But Paramount is committed to its offer and looks forward to WBD shareholders choosing a Paramount transaction over Netflix. WBD shareholders have the ultimate power to determine the future of WBD. With this in mind, Paramount has acted to provide WBD shareholders with transparency and a voice by taking its superior offer directly to them. The Netflix transaction requires approval by WBD shareholders at a special shareholder meeting. But there is no reason to wait months to have your voice heard. Paramount urges WBD shareholders to send a clear message now to the WBD Board that they prefer Paramount's superior offer by tendering their shares today.

Confident its fully financed offer will deliver WBD shareholders with superior value and a faster, more certain path to completion than the Netflix transaction Reiterates its commitment to pursuing all options to deliver the value and benefits of its offer for all stakeholders LOS ANGELES and NEW YORK, Dec. 17, 2025 -- Paramount, a Skydance Corporation (NASDAQ: PSKY) ("Paramount"), today affirmed its commitment to acquiring Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ: WBD) ("WBD") in response to the WBD Board's recommendation against Paramount's $30.00 per share all-cash tender offer. Paramount's offer provides WBD shareholders superior value compared to the transaction with Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), including the certainty of 100% cash and no exposure to equity market fluctuations: Paramount's offer is $30 per share in cash versus Netflix's cash component of only $23.25 per share (an $18 billion difference in the aggregate); The value of Netflix's offer has been further reduced as its share price trades below the bottom of the "collar" on its stock component; Netflix's offer would leave WBD shareholders owning a highly leveraged stub in Global Networks and WBD's Board provides no valuation of that stub; and Netflix's offer has a dollar-for-dollar reduction to what WBD shareholders will receive tied to the net debt on Global Networks. Paramount is highly confident its offer would receive timely regulatory approval because it would enhance competition in the creative industries rather than entrench a dominant streaming monopoly that the Netflix transaction envisions. Paramount has lined up all necessary financing to deliver its offer to WBD shareholders, and it is not subject to any financing conditions. Paramount's offer will be financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo. David Ellison, Chairman & CEO, Paramount said: "We remain committed to bringing together two iconic Hollywood studios to create a unique global entertainment leader. Our proposal clearly offers WBD shareholders superior value and certainty, a clear path to close, and does not leave them with a heavily indebted sub-scale linear business. I have been encouraged by the feedback we have received from WBD shareholders who clearly understand the benefits of our offer. We will continue to move forward to deliver this transaction, which is in the best interest of WBD shareholders, consumers, and the creative industries." WBD's own narrative of the actions that led to its inferior transaction with Netflix reveals a process which was not run to secure the best offer for WBD shareholders. Most notably, the absence of any engagement by WBD with Paramount in the face of a superior all-cash $30 per share offer speaks for itself. WBD seeks to justify racing to conclude an inferior deal with Netflix with a "kitchen sink" litany of purported questions and concerns. Missing from the cloud of obfuscation is any explanation for why WBD and its advisors did not lift a finger to get any of those questions answered or concerns addressed? WBD seeks to mislead its shareholders into believing this is a complicated question about legal documents. In reality, it is all quite simple: $30 in cash fully backstopped by a well-capitalized trust (in existence for approximately 40 years) of one of the most well-known founders and entrepreneurs in the world, Larry Ellison. Yet from mid-September all the way through to December 4, what is glaring is the absolute resistance on the part of WBD to even engage in a single negotiating session with Paramount or its advisors, and a refusal even to provide a mark-up of any transaction document. As described in Paramount's letter to WBD shareholders, Paramount's December 4 offer included an equity commitment from the Ellison family trust, which contains over $250 billion of assets (more than 6x the equity funding commitment) including approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares and tens of billions of dollars in other assets. This information is publicly available; and, notably, the trust has been a counterparty in other completed public company transactions including for Twitter, which involved one of WBD's advisors. The equity commitment papers submitted to WBD were identical in all material respects to commitments that the advisors to WBD had agreed to in other large transactions such as Twitter and Electronic Arts. Also missing in WBD's long exposition of its flawed process is any financial analysis whatsoever to show what numbers the WBD Board considered. Where is the valuation of the stub equity in Global Networks? Where is the description of the financial analysis their bankers provided - disclosure that is standard when a board of directors explains its thinking to its shareholders? WBD shareholders deserve to know this information and understand what is being hidden from them. It is also noteworthy that the Board of WBD failed to even make the determination that Paramount's $30 per share all-cash offer "could reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal" under WBD's transaction agreement with Netflix. This failure is yet another example of WBD's pattern of ignoring Paramount's value-maximizing offer, perhaps in the hopes it will just go away. But Paramount is committed to its offer and looks forward to WBD shareholders choosing a Paramount transaction over Netflix. WBD shareholders have the ultimate power to determine the future of WBD. With this in mind, Paramount has acted to provide WBD shareholders with transparency and a voice by taking its superior offer directly to them. The Netflix transaction requires approval by WBD shareholders at a special shareholder meeting. But there is no reason to wait months to have your voice heard. Paramount urges WBD shareholders to send a clear message now to the WBD Board that they prefer Paramount's superior offer by tendering their shares today.

With this in mind, Paramount has acted to provide WBD shareholders with transparency and a voice by taking its superior offer directly to them. The Netflix transaction requires approval by WBD shareholders at a special shareholder meeting. But there is no reason to wait months to have your voice heard. Paramount urges WBD shareholders to send a clear message now to the WBD Board that they prefer Paramount's superior offer by tendering their shares today.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This communication contains both historical and forward-looking statements, including statements related to Paramount's future financial results and performance, potential achievements, anticipated reporting segments and industry changes and developments. All statements that are not statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, "forward-looking statements". Similarly, statements that describe Paramount's objectives, plans or goals are or may be forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect Paramount's current expectations concerning future results and events; generally can be identified by the use of statements that include phrases such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "foresee," "likely," "will," "may," "could," "estimate" or other similar words or phrases; and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that are difficult to predict and which may cause Paramount's actual results, performance or achievements to be different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, among others: the outcome of the tender offer by Paramount and Prince Sub Inc. (the "Tender Offer") to purchase for cash all of the outstanding Series A common stock of WBD or any discussions between Paramount and WBD with respect to a possible transaction (including, without limitation, by means of the Tender Offer, the "Potential Transaction"), including the possibility that the Tender Offer will not be successful, that the parties will not agree to pursue a business combination transaction or that the terms of any such transaction will be materially different from those described herein, the conditions to the completion of the Potential Transaction or the previously announced transaction between WBD and Netflix Inc. ("Netflix") pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated December 4, 2025, among Netflix, Nightingale Sub, Inc., WBD. and New Topco 25, Inc. (the "Proposed Netflix Transaction"), including the receipt of any required stockholder and regulatory approvals for either transaction, the proposed financing for the Potential Transaction, the indebtedness Paramount expects to incur in connection with the Potential Transaction and the total indebtedness of the combined companies, the possibility that Paramount may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies within the expected timeframes or at all and to successfully integrate the operations of WBD with those of Paramount, and the possibility that such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected or that operating costs and business disruption (including, without limitation, disruptions in relationships with employees, customers or suppliers) may be greater than expected in connection with the Potential Transaction; risks related to Paramount's streaming business; the adverse impact on Paramount's advertising revenues as a result of changes in consumer behavior, advertising market conditions and deficiencies in audience measurement; risks related to operating in highly competitive and dynamic industries, including cost increases; the unpredictable nature of consumer behavior, as well as evolving technologies and distribution models; risks related to Paramount's decisions to make investments in new businesses, products, services and technologies, and the evolution of Paramount's business strategy; the potential for loss of carriage or other reduction in or the impact of negotiations for the distribution of Paramount's content; damage to Paramount's reputation or brands; losses due to asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets, FCC licenses and content; liabilities related to discontinued operations and former businesses; increasing scrutiny of, and evolving expectations for, sustainability initiatives; evolving business continuity, cybersecurity, privacy and data protection and similar risks; content infringement; domestic and global political, economic and regulatory factors affecting Paramount's businesses generally, including tariffs and other changes in trade policies; the inability to hire or retain key employees or secure creative talent; disruptions to Paramount's operations as a result of labor disputes; the risks and costs associated with the integration of, and Paramount's ability to integrate, the businesses of Paramount Global and Skydance Media, LLC successfully and to achieve anticipated synergies; volatility in the prices of Paramount's Class B Common Stock; potential conflicts of interest arising from Paramount's ownership structure with a controlling stockholder; and other factors described in Paramount's news releases and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including but not limited to Paramount's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Paramount's reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. There may be additional risks, uncertainties and factors that Paramount does not currently view as material or that are not necessarily known. The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date of this report, and Paramount does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. Paramount's offer provides WBD shareholders superior value compared to the transaction with Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), including the certainty of 100% cash and no exposure to equity market fluctuations: Paramount's offer is $30 per share in cash versus Netflix's cash component of only $23.25 per share (an $18 billion difference in the aggregate); The value of Netflix's offer has been further reduced as its share price trades below the bottom of the "collar" on its stock component; Netflix's offer would leave WBD shareholders owning a highly leveraged stub in Global Networks and WBD's Board provides no valuation of that stub; and Netflix's offer has a dollar-for-dollar reduction to what WBD shareholders will receive tied to the net debt on Global Networks. Paramount is highly confident its offer would receive timely regulatory approval because it would enhance competition in the creative industries rather than entrench a dominant streaming monopoly that the Netflix transaction envisions. Paramount has lined up all necessary financing to deliver its offer to WBD shareholders, and it is not subject to any financing conditions. Paramount's offer will be financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo. David Ellison, Chairman & CEO, Paramount said: "We remain committed to bringing together two iconic Hollywood studios to create a unique global entertainment leader. Our proposal clearly offers WBD shareholders superior value and certainty, a clear path to close, and does not leave them with a heavily indebted sub-scale linear business. I have been encouraged by the feedback we have received from WBD shareholders who clearly understand the benefits of our offer. We will continue to move forward to deliver this transaction, which is in the best interest of WBD shareholders, consumers, and the creative industries." WBD's own narrative of the actions that led to its inferior transaction with Netflix reveals a process which was not run to secure the best offer for WBD shareholders. Most notably, the absence of any engagement by WBD with Paramount in the face of a superior all-cash $30 per share offer speaks for itself. WBD seeks to justify racing to conclude an inferior deal with Netflix with a "kitchen sink" litany of purported questions and concerns. Missing from the cloud of obfuscation is any explanation for why WBD and its advisors did not lift a finger to get any of those questions answered or concerns addressed? WBD seeks to mislead its shareholders into believing this is a complicated question about legal documents. In reality, it is all quite simple: $30 in cash fully backstopped by a well-capitalized trust (in existence for approximately 40 years) of one of the most well-known founders and entrepreneurs in the world, Larry Ellison. Yet from mid-September all the way through to December 4, what is glaring is the absolute resistance on the part of WBD to even engage in a single negotiating session with Paramount or its advisors, and a refusal even to provide a mark-up of any transaction document. As described in Paramount's letter to WBD shareholders, Paramount's December 4 offer included an equity commitment from the Ellison family trust, which contains over $250 billion of assets (more than 6x the equity funding commitment) including approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares and tens of billions of dollars in other assets. This information is publicly available; and, notably, the trust has been a counterparty in other completed public company transactions including for Twitter, which involved one of WBD's advisors. The equity commitment papers submitted to WBD were identical in all material respects to commitments that the advisors to WBD had agreed to in other large transactions such as Twitter and Electronic Arts. Also missing in WBD's long exposition of its flawed process is any financial analysis whatsoever to show what numbers the WBD Board considered. Where is the valuation of the stub equity in Global Networks? Where is the description of the financial analysis their bankers provided - disclosure that is standard when a board of directors explains its thinking to its shareholders? WBD shareholders deserve to know this information and understand what is being hidden from them. It is also noteworthy that the Board of WBD failed to even make the determination that Paramount's $30 per share all-cash offer "could reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal" under WBD's transaction agreement with Netflix. This failure is yet another example of WBD's pattern of ignoring Paramount's value-maximizing offer, perhaps in the hopes it will just go away. But Paramount is committed to its offer and looks forward to WBD shareholders choosing a Paramount transaction over Netflix. WBD shareholders have the ultimate power to determine the future of WBD.

This information is publicly available; and, notably, the trust has been a counterparty in other completed public company transactions including for Twitter, which involved one of WBD's advisors. The equity commitment papers submitted to WBD were identical in all material respects to commitments that the advisors to WBD had agreed to in other large transactions such as Twitter and Electronic Arts. Also missing in WBD's long exposition of its flawed process is any financial analysis whatsoever to show what numbers the WBD Board considered. Where is the valuation of the stub equity in Global Networks? Where is the description of the financial analysis their bankers provided - disclosure that is standard when a board of directors explains its thinking to its shareholders? WBD shareholders deserve to know this information and understand what is being hidden from them. It is also noteworthy that the Board of WBD failed to even make the determination that Paramount's $30 per share all-cash offer "could reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal" under WBD's transaction agreement with Netflix. This failure is yet another example of WBD's pattern of ignoring Paramount's value-maximizing offer, perhaps in the hopes it will just go away. But Paramount is committed to its offer and looks forward to WBD shareholders choosing a Paramount transaction over Netflix. WBD shareholders have the ultimate power to determine the future of WBD. With this in mind, Paramount has acted to provide WBD shareholders with transparency and a voice by taking its superior offer directly to them. The Netflix transaction requires approval by WBD shareholders at a special shareholder meeting. But there is no reason to wait months to have your voice heard. Paramount urges WBD shareholders to send a clear message now to the WBD Board that they prefer Paramount's superior offer by tendering their shares today.

These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, among others: the outcome of the tender offer by Paramount and Prince Sub Inc. (the "Tender Offer") to purchase for cash all of the outstanding Series A common stock of WBD or any discussions between Paramount and WBD with respect to a possible transaction (including, without limitation, by means of the Tender Offer, the "Potential Transaction"), including the possibility that the Tender Offer will not be successful, that the parties will not agree to pursue a business combination transaction or that the terms of any such transaction will be materially different from those described herein, the conditions to the completion of the Potential Transaction or the previously announced transaction between WBD and Netflix Inc. ("Netflix") pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated December 4, 2025, among Netflix, Nightingale Sub, Inc., WBD. and New Topco 25, Inc. (the "Proposed Netflix Transaction"), including the receipt of any required stockholder and regulatory approvals for either transaction, the proposed financing for the Potential Transaction, the indebtedness Paramount expects to incur in connection with the Potential Transaction and the total indebtedness of the combined companies, the possibility that Paramount may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies within the expected timeframes or at all and to successfully integrate the operations of WBD with those of Paramount, and the possibility that such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected or that operating costs and business disruption (including, without limitation, disruptions in relationships with employees, customers or suppliers) may be greater than expected in connection with the Potential Transaction; risks related to Paramount's streaming business; the adverse impact on Paramount's advertising revenues as a result of changes in consumer behavior, advertising market conditions and deficiencies in audience measurement; risks related to operating in highly competitive and dynamic industries, including cost increases; the unpredictable nature of consumer behavior, as well as evolving technologies and distribution models; risks related to Paramount's decisions to make investments in new businesses, products, services and technologies, and the evolution of Paramount's business strategy; the potential for loss of carriage or other reduction in or the impact of negotiations for the distribution of Paramount's content; damage to Paramount's reputation or brands; losses due to asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets, FCC licenses and content; liabilities related to discontinued operations and former businesses; increasing scrutiny of, and evolving expectations for, sustainability initiatives; evolving business continuity, cybersecurity, privacy and data protection and similar risks; content infringement; domestic and global political, economic and regulatory factors affecting Paramount's businesses generally, including tariffs and other changes in trade policies; the inability to hire or retain key employees or secure creative talent; disruptions to Paramount's operations as a result of labor disputes; the risks and costs associated with the integration of, and Paramount's ability to integrate, the businesses of Paramount Global and Skydance Media, LLC successfully and to achieve anticipated synergies; volatility in the prices of Paramount's Class B Common Stock; potential conflicts of interest arising from Paramount's ownership structure with a controlling stockholder; and other factors described in Paramount's news releases and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including but not limited to Paramount's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Paramount's reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. There may be additional risks, uncertainties and factors that Paramount does not currently view as material or that are not necessarily known. The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date of this report, and Paramount does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. Netflix's offer would leave WBD shareholders owning a highly leveraged stub in Global Networks and WBD's Board provides no valuation of that stub; and Netflix's offer has a dollar-for-dollar reduction to what WBD shareholders will receive tied to the net debt on Global Networks. Paramount is highly confident its offer would receive timely regulatory approval because it would enhance competition in the creative industries rather than entrench a dominant streaming monopoly that the Netflix transaction envisions. Paramount has lined up all necessary financing to deliver its offer to WBD shareholders, and it is not subject to any financing conditions. Paramount's offer will be financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo. David Ellison, Chairman & CEO, Paramount said: "We remain committed to bringing together two iconic Hollywood studios to create a unique global entertainment leader. Our proposal clearly offers WBD shareholders superior value and certainty, a clear path to close, and does not leave them with a heavily indebted sub-scale linear business. I have been encouraged by the feedback we have received from WBD shareholders who clearly understand the benefits of our offer. We will continue to move forward to deliver this transaction, which is in the best interest of WBD shareholders, consumers, and the creative industries." WBD's own narrative of the actions that led to its inferior transaction with Netflix reveals a process which was not run to secure the best offer for WBD shareholders. Most notably, the absence of any engagement by WBD with Paramount in the face of a superior all-cash $30 per share offer speaks for itself. WBD seeks to justify racing to conclude an inferior deal with Netflix with a "kitchen sink" litany of purported questions and concerns. Missing from the cloud of obfuscation is any explanation for why WBD and its advisors did not lift a finger to get any of those questions answered or concerns addressed? WBD seeks to mislead its shareholders into believing this is a complicated question about legal documents. In reality, it is all quite simple: $30 in cash fully backstopped by a well-capitalized trust (in existence for approximately 40 years) of one of the most well-known founders and entrepreneurs in the world, Larry Ellison. Yet from mid-September all the way through to December 4, what is glaring is the absolute resistance on the part of WBD to even engage in a single negotiating session with Paramount or its advisors, and a refusal even to provide a mark-up of any transaction document. As described in Paramount's letter to WBD shareholders, Paramount's December 4 offer included an equity commitment from the Ellison family trust, which contains over $250 billion of assets (more than 6x the equity funding commitment) including approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares and tens of billions of dollars in other assets.

As described in Paramount's letter to WBD shareholders, Paramount's December 4 offer included an equity commitment from the Ellison family trust, which contains over $250 billion of assets (more than 6x the equity funding commitment) including approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares and tens of billions of dollars in other assets. This information is publicly available; and, notably, the trust has been a counterparty in other completed public company transactions including for Twitter, which involved one of WBD's advisors. The equity commitment papers submitted to WBD were identical in all material respects to commitments that the advisors to WBD had agreed to in other large transactions such as Twitter and Electronic Arts. Also missing in WBD's long exposition of its flawed process is any financial analysis whatsoever to show what numbers the WBD Board considered. Where is the valuation of the stub equity in Global Networks? Where is the description of the financial analysis their bankers provided - disclosure that is standard when a board of directors explains its thinking to its shareholders? WBD shareholders deserve to know this information and understand what is being hidden from them. It is also noteworthy that the Board of WBD failed to even make the determination that Paramount's $30 per share all-cash offer "could reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal" under WBD's transaction agreement with Netflix. This failure is yet another example of WBD's pattern of ignoring Paramount's value-maximizing offer, perhaps in the hopes it will just go away. But Paramount is committed to its offer and looks forward to WBD shareholders choosing a Paramount transaction over Netflix. WBD shareholders have the ultimate power to determine the future of WBD. With this in mind, Paramount has acted to provide WBD shareholders with transparency and a voice by taking its superior offer directly to them. The Netflix transaction requires approval by WBD shareholders at a special shareholder meeting. But there is no reason to wait months to have your voice heard. Paramount urges WBD shareholders to send a clear message now to the WBD Board that they prefer Paramount's superior offer by tendering their shares today.

(the "Tender Offer") to purchase for cash all of the outstanding Series A common stock of WBD or any discussions between Paramount and WBD with respect to a possible transaction (including, without limitation, by means of the Tender Offer, the "Potential Transaction"), including the possibility that the Tender Offer will not be successful, that the parties will not agree to pursue a business combination transaction or that the terms of any such transaction will be materially different from those described herein, the conditions to the completion of the Potential Transaction or the previously announced transaction between WBD and Netflix Inc. ("Netflix") pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated December 4, 2025, among Netflix, Nightingale Sub, Inc., WBD. and New Topco 25, Inc. (the "Proposed Netflix Transaction"), including the receipt of any required stockholder and regulatory approvals for either transaction, the proposed financing for the Potential Transaction, the indebtedness Paramount expects to incur in connection with the Potential Transaction and the total indebtedness of the combined companies, the possibility that Paramount may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies within the expected timeframes or at all and to successfully integrate the operations of WBD with those of Paramount, and the possibility that such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected or that operating costs and business disruption (including, without limitation, disruptions in relationships with employees, customers or suppliers) may be greater than expected in connection with the Potential Transaction; risks related to Paramount's streaming business; the adverse impact on Paramount's advertising revenues as a result of changes in consumer behavior, advertising market conditions and deficiencies in audience measurement; risks related to operating in highly competitive and dynamic industries, including cost increases; the unpredictable nature of consumer behavior, as well as evolving technologies and distribution models; risks related to Paramount's decisions to make investments in new businesses, products, services and technologies, and the evolution of Paramount's business strategy; the potential for loss of carriage or other reduction in or the impact of negotiations for the distribution of Paramount's content; damage to Paramount's reputation or brands; losses due to asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets, FCC licenses and content; liabilities related to discontinued operations and former businesses; increasing scrutiny of, and evolving expectations for, sustainability initiatives; evolving business continuity, cybersecurity, privacy and data protection and similar risks; content infringement; domestic and global political, economic and regulatory factors affecting Paramount's businesses generally, including tariffs and other changes in trade policies; the inability to hire or retain key employees or secure creative talent; disruptions to Paramount's operations as a result of labor disputes; the risks and costs associated with the integration of, and Paramount's ability to integrate, the businesses of Paramount Global and Skydance Media, LLC successfully and to achieve anticipated synergies; volatility in the prices of Paramount's Class B Common Stock; potential conflicts of interest arising from Paramount's ownership structure with a controlling stockholder; and other factors described in Paramount's news releases and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including but not limited to Paramount's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Paramount's reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. There may be additional risks, uncertainties and factors that Paramount does not currently view as material or that are not necessarily known. The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date of this report, and Paramount does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. Paramount has lined up all necessary financing to deliver its offer to WBD shareholders, and it is not subject to any financing conditions. Paramount's offer will be financed by $41 billion of new equity backstopped by the Ellison family and RedBird Capital and $54 billion of debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo. David Ellison, Chairman & CEO, Paramount said: "We remain committed to bringing together two iconic Hollywood studios to create a unique global entertainment leader. Our proposal clearly offers WBD shareholders superior value and certainty, a clear path to close, and does not leave them with a heavily indebted sub-scale linear business. I have been encouraged by the feedback we have received from WBD shareholders who clearly understand the benefits of our offer. We will continue to move forward to deliver this transaction, which is in the best interest of WBD shareholders, consumers, and the creative industries." WBD's own narrative of the actions that led to its inferior transaction with Netflix reveals a process which was not run to secure the best offer for WBD shareholders. Most notably, the absence of any engagement by WBD with Paramount in the face of a superior all-cash $30 per share offer speaks for itself. WBD seeks to justify racing to conclude an inferior deal with Netflix with a "kitchen sink" litany of purported questions and concerns. Missing from the cloud of obfuscation is any explanation for why WBD and its advisors did not lift a finger to get any of those questions answered or concerns addressed? WBD seeks to mislead its shareholders into believing this is a complicated question about legal documents. In reality, it is all quite simple: $30 in cash fully backstopped by a well-capitalized trust (in existence for approximately 40 years) of one of the most well-known founders and entrepreneurs in the world, Larry Ellison.

Paramount urges WBD shareholders to send a clear message now to the WBD Board that they prefer Paramount's superior offer by tendering their shares today. WBD shareholders and other interested parties can find additional information about Paramount's superior offer at www.StrongerHollywood.com.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This communication contains both historical and forward-looking statements, including statements related to Paramount's future financial results and performance, potential achievements, anticipated reporting segments and industry changes and developments. All statements that are not statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, "forward-looking statements". Similarly, statements that describe Paramount's objectives, plans or goals are or may be forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect Paramount's current expectations concerning future results and events; generally can be identified by the use of statements that include phrases such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "foresee," "likely," "will," "may," "could," "estimate" or other similar words or phrases; and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that are difficult to predict and which may cause Paramount's actual results, performance or achievements to be different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, among others: the outcome of the tender offer by Paramount and Prince Sub Inc. (the "Tender Offer") to purchase for cash all of the outstanding Series A common stock of WBD or any discussions between Paramount and WBD with respect to a possible transaction (including, without limitation, by means of the Tender Offer, the "Potential Transaction"), including the possibility that the Tender Offer will not be successful, that the parties will not agree to pursue a business combination transaction or that the terms of any such transaction will be materially different from those described herein, the conditions to the completion of the Potential Transaction or the previously announced transaction between WBD and Netflix Inc. ("Netflix") pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated December 4, 2025, among Netflix, Nightingale Sub, Inc., WBD. and New Topco 25, Inc. (the "Proposed Netflix Transaction"), including the receipt of any required stockholder and regulatory approvals for either transaction, the proposed financing for the Potential Transaction, the indebtedness Paramount expects to incur in connection with the Potential Transaction and the total indebtedness of the combined companies, the possibility that Paramount may be unable to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies within the expected timeframes or at all and to successfully integrate the operations of WBD with those of Paramount, and the possibility that such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected or that operating costs and business disruption (including, without limitation, disruptions in relationships with employees, customers or suppliers) may be greater than expected in connection with the Potential Transaction; risks related to Paramount's streaming business; the adverse impact on Paramount's advertising revenues as a result of changes in consumer behavior, advertising market conditions and deficiencies in audience measurement; risks related to operating in highly competitive and dynamic industries, including cost increases; the unpredictable nature of consumer behavior, as well as evolving technologies and distribution models; risks related to Paramount's decisions to make investments in new businesses, products, services and technologies, and the evolution of Paramount's business strategy; the potential for loss of carriage or other reduction in or the impact of negotiations for the distribution of Paramount's content; damage to Paramount's reputation or brands; losses due to asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets, FCC licenses and content; liabilities related to discontinued operations and former businesses; increasing scrutiny of, and evolving expectations for, sustainability initiatives; evolving business continuity, cybersecurity, privacy and data protection and similar risks; content infringement; domestic and global political, economic and regulatory factors affecting Paramount's businesses generally, including tariffs and other changes in trade policies; the inability to hire or retain key employees or secure creative talent; disruptions to Paramount's operations as a result of labor disputes; the risks and costs associated with the integration of, and Paramount's ability to integrate, the businesses of Paramount Global and Skydance Media, LLC successfully and to achieve anticipated synergies; volatility in the prices of Paramount's Class B Common Stock; potential conflicts of interest arising from Paramount's ownership structure with a controlling stockholder; and other factors described in Paramount's news releases and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including but not limited to Paramount's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Paramount's reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. There may be additional risks, uncertainties and factors that Paramount does not currently view as material or that are not necessarily known. The forward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date of this report, and Paramount does not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. Additional Information This communication does not constitute an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to sell securities. This communication relates to a proposal that Paramount has made for an acquisition of WBD and the Tender Offer that Paramount, through Prince Sub Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, has made to WBD stockholders. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. WBD seeks to justify racing to conclude an inferior deal with Netflix with a "kitchen sink" litany of purported questions and concerns. Missing from the cloud of obfuscation is any explanation for why WBD and its advisors did not lift a finger to get any of those questions answered or concerns addressed? WBD seeks to mislead its shareholders into believing this is a complicated question about legal documents. In reality, it is all quite simple: $30 in cash fully backstopped by a well-capitalized trust (in existence for approximately 40 years) of one of the most well-known founders and entrepreneurs in the world, Larry Ellison. Yet from mid-September all the way through to December 4, what is glaring is the absolute resistance on the part of WBD to even engage in a single negotiating session with Paramount or its advisors, and a refusal even to provide a mark-up of any transaction document. As described in Paramount's letter to WBD shareholders, Paramount's December 4 offer included an equity commitment from the Ellison family trust, which contains over $250 billion of assets (more than 6x the equity funding commitment) including approximately 1.16 billion Oracle shares and tens of billions of dollars in other assets. This information is publicly available; and, notably, the trust has been a counterparty in other completed public company transactions including for Twitter, which involved one of WBD's advisors. The equity commitment papers submitted to WBD were identical in all material respects to commitments that the advisors to WBD had agreed to in other large transactions such as Twitter and Electronic Arts. Also missing in WBD's long exposition of its flawed process is any financial analysis whatsoever to show what numbers the WBD Board considered. Where is the valuation of the stub equity in Global Networks? Where is the description of the financial analysis their bankers provided - disclosure that is standard when a board of directors explains its thinking to its shareholders? WBD shareholders deserve to know this information and understand what is being hidden from them. It is also noteworthy that the Board of WBD failed to even make the determination that Paramount's $30 per share all-cash offer "could reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal" under WBD's transaction agreement with Netflix. This failure is yet another example of WBD's pattern of ignoring Paramount's value-maximizing offer, perhaps in the hopes it will just go away. But Paramount is committed to its offer and looks forward to WBD shareholders choosing a Paramount transaction over Netflix. WBD shareholders have the ultimate power to determine the future of WBD. With this in mind, Paramount has acted to provide WBD shareholders with transparency and a voice by taking its superior offer directly to them. The Netflix transaction requires approval by WBD shareholders at a special shareholder meeting. But there is no reason to wait months to have your voice heard.

The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), filed with the SEC on December 8, 2025. These materials, as may be amended from time to time, contain important information, including the terms and conditions of the offer. Subject to future developments, Paramount (and, if a negotiated transaction is agreed, WBD) may file additional documents with the SEC. This communication is not a substitute for any proxy statement, tender offer statement, or other document Paramount and/or WBD may file with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. Investors and security holders of WBD are urged to read the tender offer statement(s) (including the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and other related offer documents), and any other documents filed with the SEC carefully in their entirety if and when they become available as they will contain important information about the proposed transaction. Any definitive proxy statement(s) (if and when available) will be mailed to stockholders of WBD. Investors and security holders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents (if and when available) and other documents filed with the SEC by Paramount through the website maintained by the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. This communication is neither a solicitation of a proxy nor a substitute for any proxy statement or other filings that may be made with the SEC. Nonetheless, Paramount and its directors and executive officers and other members of management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies against the Proposed Netflix Transaction. You can find information about Paramount's executive officers and directors in Paramount's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 7, 2025, and September 16, 2025, and Paramount's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 10, 2025. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants will be included in one or more proxy statements or other documents filed with the SEC if and when they become available. These documents (if and when available) may be obtained free of charge from the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. Also missing in WBD's long exposition of its flawed process is any financial analysis whatsoever to show what numbers the WBD Board considered. Where is the valuation of the stub equity in Global Networks? Where is the description of the financial analysis their bankers provided - disclosure that is standard when a board of directors explains its thinking to its shareholders? WBD shareholders deserve to know this information and understand what is being hidden from them. It is also noteworthy that the Board of WBD failed to even make the determination that Paramount's $30 per share all-cash offer "could reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal" under WBD's transaction agreement with Netflix. This failure is yet another example of WBD's pattern of ignoring Paramount's value-maximizing offer, perhaps in the hopes it will just go away. But Paramount is committed to its offer and looks forward to WBD shareholders choosing a Paramount transaction over Netflix. WBD shareholders have the ultimate power to determine the future of WBD. With this in mind, Paramount has acted to provide WBD shareholders with transparency and a voice by taking its superior offer directly to them. The Netflix transaction requires approval by WBD shareholders at a special shareholder meeting. But there is no reason to wait months to have your voice heard. Paramount urges WBD shareholders to send a clear message now to the WBD Board that they prefer Paramount's superior offer by tendering their shares today. WBD shareholders and other interested parties can find additional information about Paramount's superior offer at www.StrongerHollywood.com.

The fund is State Street’s way of tapping the retail market, but it might be the last new dominant S&P 500 entrant. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com A hundred billion is the new hundred million. State Street’s SPYM fund surpassed $100 billion in assets last week, making it the fastest to grow from $50 billion to $100 billion, taking just 283 trading days, according to State Street. The ETF is the latest entrant to the core S&P 500 cast and represents the firm’s efforts to access growing retail markets via low fees; SPYM’s is just two basis points. But it may be the last core S&P 500 product breakthrough for a while because of all the funds already tracking the index — and their sheer size. This means advisors shouldn’t expect any new core S&P 500 funds anytime soon, experts said. “It’s more likely that other kinds of broad equity ETFs will be launched in the future as opposed to [trying to] do battle with $100 billion ETFs that are out there,” said Loren Fox, director of research at Fuse Research Network. “At this point, it’s hard to see a lot of space in the market for another S&P 500 ETF that is just tracking the straight beta.” SPYM, which formerly operated under the ticker SPLG, is one of the four primary S&P 500 ETF offerings, said Aniket Ullal, head of ETF Research & Analytics at CFRA Research. The others include the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY). But they cater to different segments of the market: While SPY has traditionally been a fund for institutions, such as asset managers and hedge funds, IVV has honed in on advised retail and VOO on self-directed retail investors. Because of State Street’s institutional focus, added Ullal, the company didn’t really have a product that prioritized the retail segment. “SPYM basically is their way of accessing retail money, by going with a lower-cost product and competing more directly with VOO and IVV,” he said. Inflows and outflows among the rest of the four were varied. In Q3 2025: S Tier. The ETF industry as a whole, Ullal said, can also be broken down into three main price segments: the passively managed, low-cost beta tier; the mid-priced segment, which has more active management; and high-priced funds of roughly 75 basis points and above, including things like derivatives and buffer products. “The newer entrants, like Capital Group, JPMorgan [and] Goldman Sachs, they’re focused more on active management, derivatives and those kinds of products,” Ullal said. But the low-cost segment, he added, is dominated by the likes of Vanguard, State Street and BlackRock — something he doesn’t see changing: “It’s hard to see anybody coming and disrupting these three big players.” With the average cost of health care regularly outpacing inflation, Americans are struggling to afford it. A new legal standing for marijuana could help change how ETFs track and invest in the cannabis industry. The company is planning to add 10 target-maturity ETFs. Vanguard and State Street have also moved to fill out their bond-ladder lines. With more than $1.4 trillion in flows and more than 1,000 product launches, it’s safe to say the industry is booming. A new proposed ETF would hold bitcoin only after markets close. Wanna bet? ETFs aren’t for gambling, but a rise in risk-on products could prove irresistible to a population obsessed with sports betting. After a dive, the company’s stock is still up 8% in 2025, while both long and short leveraged ETFs are down. The world’s largest asset manager and issuer of the biggest crypto ETF is expanding into staked Ethereum. Is there room for anyone else? Active fixed-income strategies accounted for nearly half of ETF inflows so far this year. Niche strategies, like buffer ETFs, could play a larger role in deal activity. Its price is up 100%, significantly ahead of gold’s surge, and the (very) few silver ETFs on the US market have benefited. The company’s flagship ETF, QQQ, is just shy of enough votes to approve its reclassification as an open-end fund. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Δ Osborne will join the company as “Head of OpenAI for Countries” and “lead our work helping governments build for the future with AI,” OpenAI Chief Operating Officer Brad Lightcap said in a Tuesday (Dec. 16) post on X. “We increasingly hear from countries wanting to understand how AI fits into their economic strategy and ability to serve citizens in domains like healthcare, education and more,” Lightcap said. In his own post on X announcing the move, Osborne said that he will be based in London and that he believes OpenAI is “the most exciting and promising company in the world.” “In my conversations with [OpenAI CEO] Sam Altman, Brad Lightcap and other senior colleagues, it’s clear they are exceptionally impressive leaders and that they care very deeply about their mission to ensure the power of artificial intelligence is developed responsibly, and the benefits are felt by all,” Osborne said. “That’s exactly what the OpenAI for Countries initiative intends to achieve, helping societies around the world share the opportunity this powerful technology brings.” Osborne is co-host of a podcast called “Political Currency” and chair of the British Museum, Bloomberg reported Tuesday.

Title: Court to reconsider inquest into death of infant born at Bessborough mother and baby home
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/courts/2025/12/16/court-to-reconsider-inquest-into-death-of-infant-born-at-bessborough-mother-and-baby-home/
Time Published: 2025-12-16T23:45:49Z
Full Content:
Cork South Coroner’s Court will reconsider holding an inquest into the death of a baby boy shortly after his birth at Bessborough mother and baby home, after the court’s chief coroner conceded a High Court challenge brought by the infant’s mother. Madeleine Bridget Marvier was 17-years-old when she was admitted to the home in Blackrock, Cork city, in August 1960. About two months later, she gave birth to her son, William Gerard Walsh. In December 1960, at 37 days old, William died at St Finbarr’s Hospital, Cork. In October 2023, Ms Marvier wrote to the Cork South Coroner asking that an inquest be held into the death of her son, on the grounds that his death was violent or unnatural, or was unexpected and from unknown causes, or was in suspicious circumstances. This request was refused. Ms Marvier brought judicial review proceedings against the Cork South Coroner in July challenging the refusal, claiming that a conclusion that the infant’s death is beyond doubt “cannot reasonably be drawn or inferred” and is “without basis” in the evidence she had put before the coroner. Ms Marvier brought the case alongside her daughter, Carmel Cantwell. On Tuesday, barrister Cillian Bracken, appearing for Ms Marvier, told Mr Justice Micheál O’Higgins that an order could be made on consent quashing the coroner’s decision to refuse to hold an inquest into the infant’s death. Mr Bracken said an order could also be made remitting the case to the deputy coroner for Cork South for reconsideration. An order against the coroner for his clients’ legal costs could also be made, counsel said. Barrister Eoin Sreenan, appearing for the coroner, said his client was consenting to the reliefs. Mr Justice O’Higgins granted the orders. Bessborough mother and baby home was operated by the Sisters of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, an order of nuns, between 1922 and 1998. In 2021, the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes concluded that 923 babies associated with Bessborough died during that time, but burial records for only 64 of them could be found. According to Ms Marvier’s court documents, her son’s death certificate – which she obtained in 1999 – attributed his death to renal abscess septicaemia, sepsis caused by an abscess in the kidney. Ms Marvier said she was previously unaware of the cause attributed to her son’s death. In 2019, after obtaining documents from Tusla, Ms Marvier learned for the first time that William had been buried at Carr’s Hill Cemetery in Cork, within the jurisdiction of the Cork South Coroner. In October 2023, Ms Marvier wrote to the Cork South Coroner asking that an inquest be held into the death of her son, on the grounds that his death was violent or unnatural, or was unexpected and from unknown causes, or was in suspicious circumstances. Included in her request was a report compiled by Dr Michael Munro, a consultant neonatologist, who opined that the death certificate’s stated cause of death was speculative and conjectural. In January this year, the coroner wrote to Ms Marvier refusing the request to hold an inquest. The coroner stated William did not die in a violent or unnatural manner, and on the balance of probabilities, did not die unexpectedly or from unknown causes, Ms Marvier’s court papers stated. Ms Marvier’s case noted the coroner’s purported assumption that in the absence of any record of a postmortem examination of the infant, there was no doubt around the cause of death of the infant, and therefore, there was no sufficient evidence available now to cast doubt on the death certificate’s cause of death. Ms Marvier claimed that the coroner made this assumption while at the same time acknowledging that medical records pertaining to the infant’s care at St Finbarr’s are now unavailable, and that it was not known what medical skills were employed in establishing William’s cause of death.

Title: Spot Bitcoin ETFs see $358M outflow: Are investors abandoning BTC?
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/spot-bitcoin-etfs-see-358m-outflow-are-investors-abandoning-btc
Time Published: 2025-12-16T22:26:55Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin price held above $85,000, but weakening spot ETF flows and year-end volatility tested near-term bullish sentiment. Key takeaways: Bitcoin ETF outflows and a 31% drawdown from the peak have raised doubts, but metrics indicate that institutional investors are not abandoning Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s shifting correlation with gold and steady volatility suggest price behavior remains intact despite the short-term market pressure. Bitcoin (BTC) gained 3% on Tuesday after selling off to the $85,000 level on Monday. An uptick in outflows from the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds appears to show institutional investor demand softening since the Oct. 10 crash. This has tempered near-term upside expectations without signaling a broader shift in institutional positioning The spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $358 million in net outflows on Monday, marking the largest daily withdrawal in over three weeks. The move fueled speculation that institutional investors might be reducing their exposure after the psychological $90,000 support level was breached. More importantly, Bitcoin is currently trading 31% below its all-time high of $126,219, a pullback that could signal the end of the bullish phase that extended into October. According to X user forcethehabit, Bitcoin’s decline does not represent a trend change, as interest rate cuts have been delayed and the US Federal Reserve (Fed) has reduced its balance sheet for longer than expected. The analysis also notes that institutional capital entered primarily through ETFs and corporate reserves, while rotation into riskier and more illiquid assets has yet to materialize. Bitcoin’s correlation with gold prices can be used to assess whether the cryptocurrency is viewed as an alternative store of value or simply a proxy for higher-risk assets. The digital gold narrative has been an important driver of Bitcoin’s upside throughout 2025. How Bitcoin tracks weekly moves in the gold price is more important than its 48% underperformance relative to gold since July. The 60-day correlation metric has oscillated between positive and negative since May, indicating little consistency between Bitcoin and gold price trends. Still, there is no doubt that Bitcoin traders are disappointed by the rejection that followed the loss of the $110,000 level. While such data may appear bearish at first glance, the 31% Bitcoin price drop since October had no impact on the correlation metric. This weakens the argument that institutional investors have shifted their risk perception. Bitcoin may still succeed as an independent and decentralized financial system, even as gold remains the world’s largest store of value, with an estimated $30 trillion market capitalization. It also seems premature to conclude that institutional money has abandoned Bitcoin based solely on a 10-week correction, especially since Bitcoin has outperformed the S&P 500 index by 7% over the past 18 months. Although that difference may appear modest, Bitcoin’s options risk profile closely matches Nvidia (NVDA US) and Broadcom (AVGO US), two of the world’s eight largest companies by market value. Bitcoin options’ implied volatility peaked at 53% in November, roughly in line with the current level for Tesla (TSLA US). When traders anticipate sharp price swings, this metric rises to reflect the higher premiums charged on call (buy) and put (sell) options. Market makers tend to reduce risk exposure when surprise price moves are more likely; however, this does not necessarily mean investors have turned bearish. There is currently no indication that institutional investors have abandoned expectations for Bitcoin to reach $100,000 in the near term. Correlation and volatility metrics suggest that Bitcoin’s price behavior has not materially changed following the 30% decline, meaning a few days of ETF net outflows should not be overemphasized.

Title: Spot Bitcoin ETFs see $358M outflow: Are investors abandoning BTC?

Bitcoin price held above $85,000, but weakening spot ETF flows and year-end volatility tested near-term bullish sentiment. Key takeaways: Bitcoin ETF outflows and a 31% drawdown from the peak have raised doubts, but metrics indicate that institutional investors are not abandoning Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s shifting correlation with gold and steady volatility suggest price behavior remains intact despite the short-term market pressure. Bitcoin (BTC) gained 3% on Tuesday after selling off to the $85,000 level on Monday. An uptick in outflows from the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds appears to show institutional investor demand softening since the Oct. 10 crash. This has tempered near-term upside expectations without signaling a broader shift in institutional positioning The spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $358 million in net outflows on Monday, marking the largest daily withdrawal in over three weeks. The move fueled speculation that institutional investors might be reducing their exposure after the psychological $90,000 support level was breached. More importantly, Bitcoin is currently trading 31% below its all-time high of $126,219, a pullback that could signal the end of the bullish phase that extended into October. According to X user forcethehabit, Bitcoin’s decline does not represent a trend change, as interest rate cuts have been delayed and the US Federal Reserve (Fed) has reduced its balance sheet for longer than expected. The analysis also notes that institutional capital entered primarily through ETFs and corporate reserves, while rotation into riskier and more illiquid assets has yet to materialize. Bitcoin’s correlation with gold prices can be used to assess whether the cryptocurrency is viewed as an alternative store of value or simply a proxy for higher-risk assets. The digital gold narrative has been an important driver of Bitcoin’s upside throughout 2025. How Bitcoin tracks weekly moves in the gold price is more important than its 48% underperformance relative to gold since July. The 60-day correlation metric has oscillated between positive and negative since May, indicating little consistency between Bitcoin and gold price trends. Still, there is no doubt that Bitcoin traders are disappointed by the rejection that followed the loss of the $110,000 level. While such data may appear bearish at first glance, the 31% Bitcoin price drop since October had no impact on the correlation metric. This weakens the argument that institutional investors have shifted their risk perception. Bitcoin may still succeed as an independent and decentralized financial system, even as gold remains the world’s largest store of value, with an estimated $30 trillion market capitalization. It also seems premature to conclude that institutional money has abandoned Bitcoin based solely on a 10-week correction, especially since Bitcoin has outperformed the S&P 500 index by 7% over the past 18 months. Although that difference may appear modest, Bitcoin’s options risk profile closely matches Nvidia (NVDA US) and Broadcom (AVGO US), two of the world’s eight largest companies by market value. Bitcoin options’ implied volatility peaked at 53% in November, roughly in line with the current level for Tesla (TSLA US). When traders anticipate sharp price swings, this metric rises to reflect the higher premiums charged on call (buy) and put (sell) options. Market makers tend to reduce risk exposure when surprise price moves are more likely; however, this does not necessarily mean investors have turned bearish. There is currently no indication that institutional investors have abandoned expectations for Bitcoin to reach $100,000 in the near term. Correlation and volatility metrics suggest that Bitcoin’s price behavior has not materially changed following the 30% decline, meaning a few days of ETF net outflows should not be overemphasized. The effects of the recent liquidity injection from the US Fed have yet to be reflected in markets, making it premature to judge Bitcoin’s performance.

Title: CoreWeave Has Lost a Staggering Amount of Stock Value Over the Past Six Months
URL: http://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/coreweave-lost-value-six-months
Time Published: 2025-12-16T22:10:05Z
Full Content:
By Victor Tangermann Published Dec 16, 2025 5:10 PM EST AI cloud computing company CoreWave exploded onto the scene in March with the biggest tech IPO since 2021. The company’s stock soared by more than 40 percent in the following days, riding on the coattails of immense hype surrounding generative AI. The hype was driven by insatiable AI companies like Microsoft, OpenAI, and Meta leasing hundreds of megawatts of compute as outfits like CoreWeave construct enormous data centers. If AI chipmaker Nvidia is the one selling shovels during the ongoing AI gold rush, in other words, CoreWeave is the one buying those shovels in bulk and leasing access to the digging sites. But persistent fears of an AI bubble have put a massive damper on investor enthusiasm, leaving many to wonder whether CoreWeave could be the canary in the coalmine — and even drawing comparisons to Enron, a company with an extremely speculative valuation that imploded following a major accounting scandal in 2001. As the Wall Street Journal reports, CoreWeave’s share price has plunged 46 percent in just six weeks, with $33 billion of value going up in smoke. At press time, shares are hovering at just under $70, meaning the company has lost a staggering 56 percent of its stock value in just six months. It may well be a sign that investors are jittery that the enormous spending by the likes of CoreWeave may not be justified in the long run. Even AI leaders have warned that a return may still be many years out, with OpenAI admitting last month that it won’t make any money until at least 2030. It doesn’t take much reading between the lines to understand why they’re nervous. Taking on an enormous amount of high-interest debt to construct and lease AI data centers leaves the firm with a considerable degree of risk, potentially putting it first on the chopping block in case the AI bubble were to implode. Its operations are also meeting some major headwinds, both literally and figuratively. Rainstorms in Texas forced the company to delay the pouring of a foundation for an AI data center complex, pushing back the completion date by months, the WSJ reports. Investors have also balked at circular financing arrangements in the sector. For instance, Nvidia owns six percent of the company’s shares, while CoreWeave has signed an exclusivity contract with the AI chipmaker to only use its GPUs. Microsoft represented 62 percent of CoreWeave’s 2024 revenue, as the Wall Street Journal pointed out last month, and is also a major shareholder of CoreWeave’s top customer, OpenAI. Then there’s CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator, who downplayed those fears last month. “If you’re building something that accelerates the economy and has fundamental value to the world, the world will find ways to finance an enormous amount of business,” he said at a Wall Street Journal event in early November. Days after downplaying concerns over an AI bubble, Intrator was probed by investors during a quarterly earnings call about the delays at the Texas data center construction site. He argued that “there are 32 data centers in our portfolio,” and that “this one data center will catch up, and then we will move forward from there.” As per the WSJ, the company’s CFO, Nitin Agrawal, was forced to intervene and clarify that there were delays plaguing several data centers for a single “data center provider.” Investors are also concerned that the enormous amount of debt being taken on could compound significantly due to supply chain bottlenecks. Delays may not sound like a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but considering how much money and interest are on the line, an enormous amount of pressure is on CoreWeave to deliver some good news. “The bull case is that they’ll scale into it, and that a lot of companies have low margins to start, but this is a company at scale,” DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria told the WSJ. “There is no scaling going on here.” More on the AI bubble: AI Investors Furious at Suggestion That There’s an AI Bubble I’m a senior editor at Futurism, where I edit and write about NASA and the private space sector, as well as topics ranging from SETI and artificial intelligence to tech and medical policy.

Title: Google researchers unlock some truths about getting AI agents to actually work

Welcome to Eye on AI. In this edition…President Trump takes aim at state AI regulations with a new executive order…OpenAI unveils a new image generator to catch up with Google’s Nano Banana….Google DeepMind trains a more capable agent for virtual worlds…and an AI safety report card doesn’t provide much reassurance. Hello. 2025 was supposed to be the year of AI agents. But as the year draws to a close, it is clear such prognostications from tech vendors were overly optimistic. Yes, some companies have started to use AI agents. But most are not yet doing so, especially not in company-wide deployments.A McKinsey “State of AI” survey from last month found that a majority of businesses had yet to begin using AI agents, while 40% said they were experimenting. Less than a quarter said they had deployed AI agents at scale in at least one use case; and when the consulting firm asked people about whether they were using AI in specific functions, such as marketing and sales or human resources, the results were even worse. No more than 10% of survey respondents said they had AI agents “fully scaled” or were “in the process of scaling” in any of these areas. The one function with the most usage of scaled agents was IT (where agents are often used to automatically resolve service tickets or install software for employees), and even here only 2% reported having agents “fully scaled,” with an additional 8% saying they were “scaling.” A big part of the problem is that designing workflows for AI agents that will enable them to produce reliable results turns out to be difficult. Even the most capable of today’s AI models sit on a strange boundary—capable of doing certain tasks in a workflow as well as humans, but unable to do others. Complex tasks that involve gathering data from multiple sources and using software tools over many steps represent a particular challenge. The longer the workflow, the more risk that an error in one of the early steps in a process will compound, resulting in a failed outcome. Plus, the most capable AI models can be expensive to use at scale, especially if the workflow involves the agent having to do a lot of planning and reasoning.Many firms have sought to solve these problems by designing “multi-agent workflows,” where different agents are spun up, with each assigned just one discrete step in the workflow, including sometimes using one agent to check the work of another agent. This can improve performance, but it too can wind up being expensive—sometimes too expensive to make the workflow worth automating. Now a team at Google has conducted research that aims to give businesses a good rubric for deciding when it is better to use a single agent, as opposed to building a multi-agent workflow, and what type of multi-agent workflows might be best for a particular task. The researchers conducted 180 controlled experiments using AI models from Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic. They tried them against four different agentic AI benchmarks that covered a diverse set of goals: retrieving information from multiple websites; planning in a Minecraft game environment; planning and tool use to accomplish common business tasks such as answering emails, scheduling meetings, and using project management software; and a finance agent benchmark. That finance test requires agents to retrieve information from SEC filings and perform basic analytics, such as comparing actual results to management’s forecasts from the prior quarter, figuring out how revenue derived from a specific product segment has changed over time, or figuring out how much cash a company might have free for M&A activity. In the past year, the conventional wisdom has been that multi-agent workflows produce more reliable results. (I’ve previously written about this view, which has been backed up by the experience of some companies, such as Prosus, here in Eye on AI.) But the Google researchers found instead that whether the conventional wisdom held was highly contingent on exactly what the task was. If the task was sequential, which was the case for many of the Minecraft benchmark tasks, then it turned out that so long as a single AI agent could perform the task accurately at least 45% of the time (which is a pretty low bar, in my opinion), then it was better to deploy just one agent. Using multiple agents, in any configuration, reduced overall performance by huge amounts, ranging between 39% and 70%. The reason, according to the researchers, is that if a company had a limited token budget for completing the entire task, then the demands of multiple agents trying to figure out how to use different tools would quickly overwhelm the budget. But if a task involved steps that could be performed in parallel, as was true for many of the financial analysis tasks, then multi-agent systems conveyed big advantages. What’s more, the researchers found that exactly how the agents are configured to work with one another makes a big difference, too. For the financial-analysis tasks, a centralized multi-agent system—where a single coordinator agent directs and oversees the activity of multiple sub-agents and all communication flows to and from the coordinator—produced the best result. This system performed 80% better than a single agent. Meanwhile, an independent multi-agent system, in which there is no coordinator and each agent is simply assigned a narrow role that they complete in parallel, was only 57% better than a single agent. Research like this should help companies figure out the best ways to configure AI agents and enable the technology to finally begin to deliver on last year’s promises. For those selling AI agent technology, late is better than never. For the people working in the businesses using AI agents, we’ll have to see what impact these agents have on the labor market. That’s a story we’ll be watching closely as we head into 2026. With that, here’s more AI news.

President Trump signed an executive order giving the U.S. Attorney General broad power to challenge and potentially overturn state laws that regulate artificial intelligence, arguing they hinder U.S. “global AI dominance.” The order also allows federal agencies to withhold funding from states that keep such laws. Trump said he wanted to replace what he called a confusing patchwork of state rules with a single federal framework—but the order did not contain any new federal requirements for those building AI models. Tech companies welcomed the move, but the executive order drew bipartisan criticism and is expected to face legal challenges from states and consumer groups who argue that only Congress can pre-empt state laws.

Oracle denied a Bloomberg report that it had delayed completion of data centers being built for OpenAI, saying all projects remain on track to meet contractual commitments despite labor and materials shortages. The report rattled investors already worried about Oracle’s debt-heavy push into AI infrastructure under its $300 billion OpenAI deal, and investors pummeled Oracle's stock price.

The company debuted a new image generation AI model that it says offers more fine-grained editing control and generates images four times faster than its previous image creators. The move is being widely viewed as an effort by OpenAI to show that it has not lost ground to competitors, in particular Google, whose Nano Banana Pro image generation model has been the talk of the internet since it launched in late November.

A Google DeepMind agent that can make complex plans in a virtual world. The AI lab debuted an updated version of its SIMA agent, called SIMA 2, that can navigate complex, 3D digital worlds, including those from different video games. Unlike earlier systems that only followed simple commands, SIMA 2 can understand broader goals, hold short conversations, and figure out multi-step plans on its own. In tests, it performed far better than its predecessor and came close to human players on many tasks, even in games it had never seen before. Notably, SIMA 2 can also teach itself new skills by setting its own challenges and learning from trial and error. The paper shows progress towards AI that can act, adapt, and learn in environments rather than just analyze text or images. The approach, which is based on reinforcement learning—a technique where an agent learns by trial and error to accomplish a goal—should help power more capable virtual assistants and, eventually, real-world robots.

Is it safe? A few weeks ago, the Future of Life Institute (FLI) released its latest AI Safety Index, a report that grades leading AI labs on how they are doing on a range of safety criteria. A clear gap has emerged between three of the leading AI labs and pretty much everyone else. OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic all received grades in the “C” range. Anthropic and OpenAI both scored a C+, with Anthropic narrowly beating OpenAI on its total safety score. Google DeepMind’s solid C was an improvement from the C- it scored when FLI last graded the field on their safety efforts back in July. But the rest of the pack is doing a pretty poor job. X.ai and Meta and DeepSeek all received Ds, while Alibaba, which makes the popular open source AI model Qwen, got a D-. (DeepSeek’s grade was actually a step up from the F it received in the summer.)Despite this somewhat dismal picture, FLI CEO Max Tegmark—ever an optimist—told me he actually sees some good news in the results. Not only did all the labs pull up their raw scores by at least some degree, more AI companies agreed to submit data to FLI in order to be graded. Tegmark sees this as evidence that the AI Safety Index is starting to have its intended effect of creating “a race to the top” on AI safety. But Tegmark also allows that all three of the top-marked AI labs saw their scores for “current harms” from AI—such as the negative impacts their models can have on mental health—slip since they were assessed in the summer. And when it comes to potential “existential risks” to humanity, none of the labs gets a grade above D. Somehow that doesn’t cheer me. Businesses took big steps forward on the AI journey in 2025, from hiring Chief AI Officers to experimenting with AI agents.

Title: JP Morgan’s move to Ethereum proves Wall Street is quietly hijacking the digital dollar from crypto natives

JP Morgan’s move into tokenized funds poses new challenges to traditional stablecoins like Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. JP Morgan Chase & Co. has formally entered the contest for on-chain cash, and the prize is not just a new product line. It is the billions of dollars in institutional capital that now sit in zero-yield stablecoins and early tokenized funds. On Dec. 15, the $4 trillion banking giant launched the My OnChain Net Yield Fund (MONY) on the Ethereum blockchain, in its attempt to pull back liquidity into a structure it controls and regulators recognize. MONY wraps a traditional money-market fund in a token that can live on public rails, pairing the speed of crypto with the one feature payment stablecoins such as Tether and Circle cannot legally offer under new US rules: yield. That makes MONY less a DeFi experiment than JP Morgan’s attempt to redefine what “cash on-chain” means for large, KYC’d pools of capital. It also puts the bank in more direct competition with BlackRock’s BUIDL and the broader tokenized Treasuries sector, which has grown into a mid–tens of billions market as institutions look for yield-bearing, blockchain-native cash equivalents. To understand the timing, one has to start with the GENIUS Act, the US stablecoin law passed earlier this year. The statute created a full licensing regime for payment stablecoins and, crucially, banned issuers from paying interest to token holders simply for holding the token. As a result, the core business model for regulated dollar stablecoins is now codified: issuers hold reserves in safe assets, collect the yield, and pass none of it through directly. For corporate treasurers and crypto funds that hold large stablecoin balances for weeks or months, that embeds a structural opportunity cost. In a world where front-end rates hover in the mid-single digits, that “stablecoin tax” can run at roughly 4–5% per year on idle balances. MONY is designed to sit outside that perimeter. It is structured as a Rule 506(c) private placement money-market fund, not a payment stablecoin. That means it is treated as a security, sold only to accredited investors, and invested in US Treasuries and fully collateralized Treasury repos. As a money fund, it is structured to pass most of the underlying income back to shareholders after fees, not to trap the entire yield at the issuer level. Crypto research firm Asva Capital noted: “Tokenized money-market funds solve a key problem: idle stablecoins earning zero yield.” By letting qualified investors subscribe and redeem in either cash or USDC via JP Morgan’s Morgan Money platform, MONY effectively creates a two-step workflow. This allows the investors to use USDC or other payment tokens for transactions, then rotate into MONY when the priority shifts to holding and earning. For JP Morgan, this is not a side bet. The bank seeded MONY with around $100 million of its own capital and is marketing it directly into its global liquidity client base. As John Donohue, head of Global Liquidity at JP Morgan Asset Management, put it, the firm expects other global systemically important banks to follow. So, the message is that tokenization has progressed past pilots; it is now a delivery mechanism for core cash products. The economic logic becomes clearer when you look at collateral, not wallets. Crypto derivatives markets, prime brokerage platforms and OTC desks require margin and collateral around the clock. Historically, stablecoins like USDT and USDC have been the default because they are fast and broadly accepted. They are not, however, capital efficient in a high-rate regime. Tokenized money funds are built to fill that gap. Instead of parking $100 million in stablecoins that earn nothing, a fund or trading desk can hold $100 million of MMF tokens that track a conservative portfolio of short-term government assets and still move at blockchain speed between vetted venues. BlackRock’s BUIDL product has already shown how that can evolve. Once it gained acceptance as collateral on large exchanges’ institutional rails, it stopped being “tokenization as demo” and became part of the funding stack. MONY is aimed at the same corridor, but with a different perimeter. While BUIDL has pushed aggressively into crypto-native platforms through partnerships with tokenization specialists, JP Morgan is tying MONY tightly to its own Kinexys Digital Assets stack and the existing Morgan Money distribution network. So, the pitch for MONY is not to the offshore, high-frequency trading crowd. It is to pensions, insurers, asset managers and corporates that already use money-market funds and JP Morgan’s liquidity platforms today. Donohue has argued that tokenization can “fundamentally change the speed and efficiency of transactions.” In practical terms, that means shrinking settlement windows for collateral moves from T+1 into intraday, and doing it without moving out of the banking and fund-regulation perimeter. Moreover, the risk for stablecoins is not that they disappear. It is that a meaningful slice of the large, institutional balances that currently sit in USDC or USDT for collateral and treasury purposes migrate into tokenized MMFs instead, leaving stablecoins more concentrated in payments and open DeFi. Perhaps the clearest signal in MONY’s design is the choice of Ethereum as its base chain. JP Morgan has run private ledgers and permissioned networks for years; putting a flagship cash product on a public blockchain is an acknowledgment that liquidity, tooling and counterparties have converged there. Thomas Lee of BitMine views the move as a watershed moment, stating simply that “Ethereum is the future of finance.” This is a claim now supported by the fact that the world’s largest bank is deploying its flagship tokenized cash product on the network. However, the “public” blockchain launch here comes with an asterisk. MONY is still a 506(c) security. This means that its tokens can only sit in allowlisted, KYC’d wallets, and transfers are controlled to comply with securities law and the fund’s own restrictions. That effectively splits on-chain dollar instruments into two overlapping layers. On the permissionless layer, retail users, high-frequency traders and DeFi protocols will continue to rely on Tether, USDC and similar tokens. Their value proposition is censorship resistance, universal composability and ubiquity across protocols and chains. On the permissioned layer, MONY and peer funds like BUIDL and Goldman’s and BNY Mellon’s tokenized MMFs offer regulated, yield-bearing cash equivalents to institutions that care more about audit trails, governance and counterparty risk than about permissionless composability. Their liquidity is thinner but more curated; their use cases are narrower but higher-value per dollar. Considering this, JP Morgan is betting that the next meaningful wave of on-chain volume will come from that second group: treasurers who want Ethereum’s speed and integration without taking on the regulatory ambiguity that still surrounds a large part of DeFi. Ultimately, MONY looks less like a revolution against the existing system and more like a defensive pivot inside it. For a decade, fintech and crypto firms chipped away at banks’ payment, FX and custody businesses. Stablecoins then went after the most fundamental layer: deposits and cash management, offering a digital bearer-like alternative that could sit outside bank balance sheets entirely. By launching a tokenized money-market fund on public rails, JP Morgan is trying to pull some of that migration back inside its own perimeter, even if it means cannibalizing parts of its traditional deposit base. George Gatch, CEO of J.P. Morgan Asset Management, has emphasized “active management and innovation” as the core of the offering, implicitly contrasting it with the passive float-skimming model of stablecoin issuers. Meanwhile, bank is not alone. BlackRock, Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon have already moved into tokenized MMFs and tokenized cash-equivalent products. So, JP Morgan’s entry shifts that trend from early experimentation to open competition among incumbents over who will own institutional “digital dollars” on public chains. If that competition succeeds, the effect will not be the end of stablecoins or the triumph of DeFi. Instead, it would be a quiet re-bundling as the settlement rails will be public, and the instruments running on them will look a lot like traditional money-market funds. However, the institutions earning a spread on the world’s cash will, once again, be the same Wall Street names that dominated the pre-tokenization era. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Professional money managers are feeling better about the stock market than they have in years. That may be cause for caution. The smart money is more bullish than at any time since July 2021, according to Bank of America’s December Global Fund Manager Survey, which showed optimism about the economic outlook at multi-year highs and cash levels at record lows. That may sound bullish—but the reading has pushed BofA’s "Bull & Bear Indicator" up to 7.9, a tenth of a point away from what the bank considers a "sell signal.” Why is that? The indicator is premised on the idea that market returns are driven by positioning, profit, and policy. The best time to buy risk assets, according to BofA, is when investor positioning is extremely bearish, profit expectations are recessionary, and policymakers are stimulating the economy—and the best time to exit is when positioning is bullish, profits are expected to skyrocketed, and policy is tightening. Investor sentiment is often a pivotal factor determining how the stock market responds to economic data, policy decisions, and corporate news. Excessive optimism can cause investors to overlook warning signs, while excessive pessimism can lead investors to overstate the significance of negative signals. Positioning is extremely bullish today, according to BofA. Fund managers' cash levels were at a record-low 3.3% when the survey was conducted between Dec. 5 and 11. Investors are more overweight stocks and commodities—a reflection of risk appetite—than any point since February 2022. Optimism about corporate profits is also running high. Nearly two-thirds of surveyed investors expect global earnings to increase over the next year, the largest share since August 2021. (A FactSet analysis estimates full-year 2025 earnings growth at above 12%, above the 10-year average.) Only 3% of those surveyed expect the global economy to fall into a recession over the next year. Policy, meanwhile, isn't looking too restrictive at present. Last week, a divided Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the third time this year, electing to support a weakening labor market despite signs inflation is sticking above its 2% target. Labor market data released Tuesday could bolster arguments to continue cutting rates early next year. The tax bill signed into law by President Donald Trump in July is also expected to boost economic growth next year. The Bull & Bear Indicator has flashed “sell” 16 times since 2002. More often than not, the S&P 500 rises in the three months after a sell signal. But historically, pullbacks have been larger than advances, and the index posted an average three-month return of -1.4% during those 16 periods. The indicator has sent two sell signals this year, in July and October. Both came about a month before stretches of exceptional volatility, but neither foretold a prolonged slump. The S&P 500 rose 7.5% in the three months that followed July’s signal. Since the alarm went off in October, the index is up about 1%. Some other sentiment measures are flashing some concern, but don't appear overly dramatic. CNN's Fear & Greed index was recently in a neutral range, less bearish than in recent weeks. And the weekly AAII survey of individual investor sentiment has lately tipped bullish or neutral after recovering from more downbeat readings last month. The VIX, Wall Street's "fear gauge," remains in a zone generally denoting calm. Investors are increasingly concerned about the AI trade that’s defined the bull market of the past three years. Nearly 40% of investors said an AI bubble was the biggest risk facing markets next year. Nearly 20% said the biggest threat to stocks was a “disorderly rise in bond yields.” When asked what would be the most likely cause of distress in credit markets, nearly 30% of those surveyed said “AI hyperscaler capex,” the second-most common response. December’s survey marks the first time respondents have expressed any concern that AI spending could destabilize debt markets. Investor concerns about big tech’s massive spending on AI infrastructure have been a headwind for tech stocks in recent months. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) is down about 4% since hitting a record high in late October. On Monday, one-time darlings of the AI trade, Nvidia (NVDA) and Oracle (ORCL), were trading about 15% and 40% below their respective all-time highs.

Time Published: 2025-12-16T17:26:27Z
Full Content:
Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has warned of AI displacing entry-level workers, and Ford CEO Jim Farley said the tech will wipe out half of white-collar jobs, but Amazon Web Services (AWS) CEO Matt Garman has a wildly different take on young workers’ fate in the age of AI. Earlier this year, Garman said replacing junior software developers with AI was “one of the dumbest things I’ve ever heard,” and it’s a point he stands by. In an interview with WIRED published on Tuesday, Garman said displacing junior engineers and employees with new tech is a bad business move. Entry-level workers are usually paid the least, meaning getting rid of their positions first in favor of higher-paid senior talent is not a cost-effective strategy, he noted. Moreso, these fresh-faced young workers are likely recent college graduates with energy, excitement, and deep familiarity with AI tools. Eliminating them, in Garman’s eyes, would be myopic. “At some point that whole thing explodes on itself,” Garman said. “If you have no talent pipeline that you’re building and no junior people that you’re mentoring and bringing up through the company, we often find that that’s where we get some of the best ideas.” “You’ve gotta think longer term about the health of a company,” he added. “And just saying ‘OK great, we’re never going to hire junior people anymore,’ that’s just a nonstarter for anyone who’s trying to build a long-term company.” A Stanford University study published in August suggested AI is already starting to have its way with entry-level workers. The research revealed that “the AI revolution” is having a “significant and disproportionate impact on entry-level workers in the U.S. labor market,” particularly 22- to 25-year-old software engineers and customer service agents. Despite Garman’s adamance on AI not replacing young workers, Amazon’s own automation advancements have coincided with the company laying off thousands of employees this fall. The tech giant announced in October it would slash 14,000 jobs, mostly middle management positions. Earlier this year, Amazon laid off a smaller portion of workers from divisions including AWS, its Wondery podcast division, and the consumer devices unit. Rather than attribute the axings to AI, Amazon instead said the layoffs were part of an effort to make the business more efficient after a period of growth, as well as resolve cultural mismatches that emerged in the workforce. “The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it’s not even really AI-driven, not right now at least,” CEO Andy Jassy said at the time. “It’s culture.” Still, AI advancements are poised to impact Amazon’s workforce. The memo outlining the fall layoffs cites the transforming technology of AI as the impetus for improving workflows with leaner teams. A June memo from the company said AI efficiency gains will “reduce our total corporate workforce,” and a New York Times investigation published in October reported Amazon had a lofty goal to automate 75% of its work, translating to about 600,000 jobs the tech giant would not ultimately need to hire for. AWS did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment. Garman isn’t naive to the workplace upheaval AI could bring. He predicted the technology will initially create a burst of new jobs, as well as reduce several roles, but he was certain that AI would ultimately transform the nature of work. “One of the things that I tell our own employees is ‘Your job is going to change.’ There’s no two ways about it,” he told WIRED. The 49-year-old AWS CEO said employees have the potential to have more impact and responsibilities as a result of AI, but it will require learning news skills, as well as organizing teams differently. While entry-level workers should not be the primary victims of AI’s workplace shake-ups, other jobs and industries will be impacted, Garman noticed. “If they don’t, they’ll most likely get left behind by people who move faster and do change,” he said. “There is going to be some disruption in there for sure. Like there is no question in my mind.”

In fact, “Overall, the global quantum computing market is expected to grow from $1.6 billion in 2025 to $7.3 billion by 2030, according to BCC Research. That represents a compound annual growth rate of 34.6% over the next five years,” added U.S. News & World Report. Given the surge of interest and potential in quantum computing, it would also help explain why analysts at Jefferies say D-Wave Quantum (NASDAQ: QBTS) could surge 90% higher in 2026. The firm now has a buy rating and a $45 price target. It also cited roadmap execution, commercial traction, and technical proof points as catalysts. In addition, the firm says QBTS has a strong balance sheet with solid liquidity. Analysts at Mizuho gave QBTS an outperform rating, arguing that it accounts for about 20% of the total quantum computing market. The firm has a price target of $46 on the QBTS stock. Last trading at $23.74, we’d like to see QBTS rally back to $37.50 initially. Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) was just upgraded to an overweight rating with a $135 price target by analysts at Morgan Stanley. The firm says ROKU can sustain its double-digit platform revenue growth with stronger platform partnerships, higher streaming prices, premium subscription adoption, and healthier advertising. It added that “sustained platform revenue growth should remain the key driver for valuation going forward, given Roku is still in early stage GAAP profitability,” as noted by CNBC. Analysts at Jefferies upgraded ROKU to a buy rating. It also noted that ROKU is “one of the cleanest revision stories in Internet heading into 2026,” as quoted by Seeking Alpha. The firm also expects 20% upside potential from demand-side platform ramps, politics, and subscriber momentum. Technically, if ROKU can break above double top resistance at around $116.66, it could potentially retest $150 a share. Analysts at Citi just reiterated a buy rating on EssilorLuxotica (OTC: ESLOY), noting that AI glasses are “the next fast-growing edge device,” as quoted by CNBC. At the moment, the company is developing smart glasses with Meta that can “play music, take photos, and translate, and they are emerging as a key growth driver for the luxury eyewear giant, as awareness among richer and tech-savvy customers grows fast. The newest version includes a built-in display that allows users to read messages, view photo previews, and read live captions while having a conversation with someone, using a neural wristband to interact with the device through hand gestures.” Analysts at Citi also expect the AI glasses market to grow by more than 100% a year through 2030. Citi also expects the market to surpass 110 million units by 2030. Other companies that could release AI smart glasses include Alphabet, Snap, Samsung, Tencent, and Apple.

Title: Amazon is set to lay off 370 workers at its European HQ

Amazon is set to fire 370 people at its European headquarters in Luxembourg in the coming weeks, as Bloomberg reports. That accounts for about 8.5 percent of the workforce. Amazon initially planned to reduce its headcount there by 470, but under European Union law, companies have to negotiate layoffs with employee reps and, in some cases, governments. Amazon reportedly told employees at the European HQ in a memo the layoffs are "adjustments that reflect business needs and local strategies." The company claims to be going "well beyond industry benchmarks" in Luxembourg with regards to the severance packages it's offering. An Amazon employee said it would be difficult for hundreds of people who are all going into the job market at the same time to find employment elsewhere in the country. Affected employees who moved from other countries to work for Amazon will have to leave if they don't land another job in Luxembourg within three months. After the layoffs, Amazon is still expected to be the fifth-largest employer in Luxembourg, which has a population of 680,000. One employee told Bloomberg that the cuts would primarily affect software developers amid a push in the tech industry for AI to take on more coding tasks. Amazon said in October it would cut 14,000 jobs from its global workforce amid its deepening embrace of AI. It was reported that same month that the company's plans to ramp up its robotics operations could put around half a million jobs in the US at risk.

Title: Semi-Trailer Dealership Market Set to Reach US$ 17.7 Billion by 2035 | Astute Analytica

December 16, 2025 10:35 ET | Source: AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. Chicago, Dec. 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global semi-trailer dealership market was valued at US$ 10.6 billion in 2025 and is projected to surpass US$ 17.7 billion by 2035, growing at a CAGR of 5.8% during the forecast period 2026–2035. The semi-trailer dealership market is currently defined by a remarkable upswing in new equipment acquisitions. Fleets are clearly investing with confidence. In June 2025, net orders for new trailers in the U.S. climbed to nearly 15,400 units. Such strong monthly performance contributed to a year-to-date total of 92,000 units by the end of that month. Consequently, the momentum continued, pushing the cumulative order count to an impressive 109,800 units by August 2025, signaling a period of aggressive fleet expansion and renewal. Request Sample Pages: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/request-sample/semi-trailer-dealership-market This wave of orders creates a ripple effect, translating directly into healthy backlogs and financial stability for manufacturers. For example, Wabash National reported an order backlog valued at approximately USD 1.2 billion at the end of 2024. Of that substantial figure, USD 813 million was for trailers scheduled for shipment within the next year. The second quarter of 2024 saw a robust 30,900 units ordered in the U.S. market alone. Moreover, this is a global trend, as seen in Spain, where 15,009 new semi-trailers were registered in 2024. Key Findings in Semi-Trailer Dealership Market Strategic Dealer Expansions Reshape Regional Access and Service Delivery To meet this rising demand, key players in the semi-trailer dealership market are strategically expanding their physical footprints. Great Dane recently launched a modern sales and service facility in Sutton, Massachusetts, in mid-2025. Following a similar path, Double A Utility Trailer Sales celebrated the grand opening of its second Ohio location in June 2024. Beyond new builds, consolidation is creating more powerful regional networks. A merger of two major Texas dealers in October 2025 created Utility Trailer of Texas, which already has plans for new stores in Fort Worth and Austin. These strategic moves are designed to enhance service coverage and market penetration. A major consolidation in January 2025 united Utility Trailer dealer groups across Utah, Idaho, Nevada, and Washington, creating a powerhouse in the Mountain West. This expansion is backed by increased manufacturing might. Great Dane is constructing a massive 450,000-square-foot refrigerated trailer plant in Georgia. The new facility will create over 400 jobs, ensuring a steady flow of new inventory into the semi-trailer dealership market. Service and Parts Operations Emerge as Critical Dealership Growth Centers Today’s dealerships are becoming much more than sales lots; they are sophisticated service and parts hubs. The recent merger of Utility Trailer dealers in Texas, for instance, created a network with a combined total of over 140 service bays. Likewise, Northeast Great Dane’s new Massachusetts facility features impressive 180-foot-long drive-through service bays. Double A Utility Trailer Sales' new Ohio location includes a modern shop with eight service bays. These investments underscore the growing importance of maintenance and repair revenue. A thriving parts business is essential to support these advanced service operations in the semi-trailer dealership market. Wabash National’s Parts & Services division reported net sales of USD 48.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, highlighting the segment's financial power. New facilities, like those from Great Dane and Double A Utility, now feature dedicated parts warehouses and showrooms. Furthermore, dealers are adapting to new product lines, with the Valley Equipment group stocking parts and providing service for Cargobull’s refrigeration units, demonstrating a commitment to full-service support. A Dynamic Used Trailer Market Creates Vital Opportunities for Buyers The secondary market provides a crucial and energetic channel within the broader semi-trailer dealership market. Online auctions feature a wide variety of equipment, offering an accessible entry point for smaller fleets and independent operators. Recent auction listings included everything from a 2005 Trailmobile 48-foot dry van to a specialized 2023 Custom Trailer Specialists 45-foot end dump trailer. Even unique assets, like a 1981 Dairy Equipment Co. 7,500-gallon water tank trailer, find new owners through these platforms. The market for late-model used equipment is also remarkably strong, reflecting high residual values. For instance, a 2022 De Lucio USA 53-foot dry van with an 80,000-pound gross vehicle weight rating was sold at auction in May 2024. Power units are also in high demand, with a 2015 Kenworth T800 listed with a starting bid of USD 9,000 and a 2022 Kenworth T370 priced at USD 140,000. The availability of an unused 2024 Peterbilt 389X heavy haul truck further illustrates the depth and liquidity of the used market. Major Fleet Management Cycles Directly Influence Dealership Market Trends The operational cycles of large fleet management companies have a direct and significant impact on the semi-trailer dealership market. Industry giants like Penske, U-Haul, and Walmart are major sellers at auctions, consistently turning over their fleets. Their refreshment cycles provide a steady supply of well-maintained, late-model used trucks and trailers. This inventory is a vital resource for dealerships, allowing them to serve customers who prefer or require pre-owned equipment. These large operators also serve as bellwethers for the industry. Ryder’s 2025 forecast, for example, points to a convergence of spot and contract rates, a trend that will require all fleets to sharpen their pricing strategies. Ryder is also focused on adapting to new customer expectations and evolving regulations. Their strategic decisions and equipment choices often set the standard, influencing demand patterns and technology adoption across the entire semi-trailer dealership market. Specialized Vocational Trailer Segments Drive Niche Market Growth and Diversification Beyond the high-volume dry van and reefer segments, specialized vocational trailers are carving out significant growth areas. The global flatbed trailer market, for example, was projected to reach a size of USD 7.94 billion in 2024, driven by strong activity in manufacturing, energy, and construction. Demand is further supported by government-funded infrastructure projects, creating reliable, long-term opportunities for the semi-trailer dealership market. This trend is global. A 2024 market analysis from Spain showed that specialized vehicles like dump trucks and tankers were leading growth. The refrigerated trailer market has also rebounded strongly. In response, Great Dane's new Georgia plant will have the capacity to produce over 5,000 refrigerated trailers annually. While dry and reefer vans have accounted for more than 75% of U.S. trailer sales in recent years, these specialized segments provide crucial diversification and profitability for dealers. Advanced Technology Integration Is Now a Core Mandate for Modern Dealerships The role of the dealership is transforming into that of a technology solutions provider. Fleets are increasingly adopting AI and data analytics for predictive maintenance and operational efficiency, and they rely on dealers for the installation and servicing of these systems. Enhanced safety sensors for features like lane departure warnings and automatic braking are becoming standard. Investments in sophisticated telematics are also on the rise, helping fleets meet both performance and environmental goals. Regulatory shifts are a major catalyst for this technological evolution. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration is rolling out a new registration system through 2025. At the same time, Electronic Logging Devices (ELDs) are evolving to track detailed driving behavior metrics. Emerging vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication technologies will soon allow trucks to share real-time hazard alerts. The modern semi-trailer dealership market is at the center of deploying and maintaining these complex, interconnected systems. Sophisticated Financial Strategies are Underpinning Semi-Trailer Dealership Market Stability and Growth Financial services are a critical, value-added component of the modern dealership. Financing options are widely promoted for new and used equipment sales, and an improvement in interest rates is expected to fuel even greater demand for equipment loans and leases. Dealerships with strong in-house or partner financing programs have a distinct competitive advantage. The financial health of manufacturers is equally important, providing a stable foundation for the entire market. Wabash National offers a strong example of prudent financial management. In 2024, the company repurchased USD 64.4 million of its common stock while also paying out USD 14.8 million in dividends. It maintained a healthy debt-to-equity ratio of approximately 2.1:1.0 at the end of the year. For 2025, Wabash plans to fund its capital expenditures and working capital from operating cash flows, ensuring a steady production pipeline to support its dealer network. Need a Customized Version? Request It Now: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/ask-for-customization/semi-trailer-dealership-market Overcoming the Skilled Technician Shortage Is the Market's Pressing Challenge The growth trajectory of the entire semi-trailer dealership market faces a significant obstacle: a critical shortage of skilled service technicians. A 2025 survey confirmed that a large number of diesel shops are understaffed. The problem is worsened by an estimated annual churn rate of 120,000 technicians across the industry. Projections from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indicate that demand for qualified technicians will continue to grow, making the competition for talent even more intense. In response, forward-thinking industry leaders are investing heavily in workforce development. Southland Transportation Group, for instance, launched a youth diesel technician apprenticeship program in August 2024, which accepts participants as young as 16 for paid, on-the-job training. The need is urgent. An untrained new hire requires an average of 357 training hours, costing an estimated USD 8,211 in wages alone. Proactive training and recruitment programs are no longer just a good idea; they are essential for future success.

Title: CoreWeave collapse sparks fears of cracks in AI infrastructure boom

CoreWeave (CRWV) has seen its share price fall more than 60% from its June record amid growing concerns that the AI infrastructure boom may have peaked. New details reported Tuesday by the Wall Street Journal highlight how fragile the buildout has become as operational delays collide with heavy leverage and tightening credit conditions. Investors are increasingly focused on two core risks with CRWV, according to the story. First, the company relies heavily on high interest debt to finance purchases of advanced AI chips from NVIDIA (NVDA). Second, the company depends on a small number of large customers, including OpenAI, Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META), for the majority of its revenue. Some of CoreWeave’s problems stemmed from a basic construction setback, the story continued. Heavy rainstorms in North Texas delayed concrete pours at a major data center site, pushing back delivery timelines for computing capacity. Which shows even routine infrastructure bottlenecks can disrupt trillion dollar AI investment plans. Investor confidence weakened further in late October when CoreWeave’s proposed $9 billion acquisition of Core Scientific collapsed. Core Scientific (CORZ), a former bitcoin miner turned data center landlord, rejected the deal after shareholders warned it would expose them to CoreWeave’s volatile share price and leveraged balance sheet. Shares of Oracle (ORCL) and Broadcom (AVGO) have fallen by double digit percentages in the past week after recent third quarter earnings, both companies flagging slower timing for AI related spending. The crypto and AI mining spillover has occurred as a result of new diversified revenues for bitcoin miners. IREN (IREN) and Cipher Mining (CIFR) have pivoted toward AI focused on high performance computing, signing customers including Microsoft. Each had previously surged over 500% this year, but both are down about 50% in recent weeks.. Another cause for concern, meanwhile, is that the bitcoin mining sector is increasingly relying on debt to fund expansion. CoreWeave shares have fallen a further 4% on Tuesday, trading below $70 for the first time since May.

The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all moved lower after November’s unemployment rate jumped to 4.6%, the highest level in four years, despite payrolls rising by 64,000.

Title: Broadcom Can’t Stop Falling. Overreaction or AI Stock Warning Sign?

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Chris Hondros / Hulton Archive via Getty Images Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) has delivered a strong performance in 2025, with shares up approximately 46% year-to-date, driven largely by demand for its artificial intelligence (AI)-related semiconductors and custom chips. The stock reached an all-time high of $414.61 per share last week. However, following the company’s fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report, its shares have declined sharply. The day after it hit its peak — which beat expectations on revenue and earnings per share — the stock fell more than 11% in a single session over concerns about gross margin pressure from a higher mix of AI revenue. Additional declines followed, with shares dropping another 5.6% yesterday, resulting in a cumulative drop of more than 17% over three trading days. Broadcom’s stock is trending lower again this morning in premarket trading. Broader concerns about AI investment returns and profitability have pressured multiple AI-related stocks in recent weeks, though Broadcom had held up better until this pullback. Shares are roughly flat over the prior month. The question for investors is, does this sharp drop indicate more downside ahead, or is it a back-up-the-truck opportunity in a company with robust long-term AI prospects? Broadcom’s ascent in 2025 stemmed primarily from explosive growth in its AI semiconductor business. Fiscal fourth-quarter AI revenue hit $6.5 billion, up 74% year-over-year, reflecting strong demand for custom AI processors and networking solutions from hyperscalers such as Google, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Anthropic, and OpenAI. The chipmaker secured major contracts, including partnerships for custom chips, that contributed to overall revenue growth of 28% in the quarter. Its infrastructure software segment — bolstered by the 2023 VMware acquisition — provided additional ssupport with recurring subscription revenue. These factors propelled the stock’s gains this year, outpacing many peers and solidifying Broadcom’s position as a key beneficiary of the AI infrastructure buildout. Yet, the sharp decline began after the earnings release. Despite beating estimates and guiding for strong first-quarter revenue, management highlighted gross margin pressure from an increase in AI revenue, which carries lower margins than some traditional segments. This sparked investor worries about near-term profitability in the AI boom. The sell-off intensified during a broader rotation out of AI-related stocks, spurred by reports of delayed data center projects and debates over returns on hyperscaler capital expenditures. Rising debt levels have also weighed on the sector. Semiconductor indexes fell significantly — the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index, comprising the 30 largest U.S.-traded semiconductor stocks, is down more than 6% — with Broadcom leading decliners on multiple days. Profit-taking after the year’s massive run also played a role, as expectations had run high heading into earnings, a classic buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news situation. Analysts, though, remain overwhelmingly positive on Broadcom’s outlook. Consensus ratings remain a Strong Buy, with an average one-year price target of $455 per share, implying 33% upside. UBS raised its target to $475 per share after the earnings report, while Trusit Financial set an industry high of $500 per share. Analysts seemed unanimous in their outlook, all reiterating buy or better ratings, citing sustained AI demand, a large backlog, and potential for accelerated growth next year. They point to Broadcom’s leadership in custom AI chips and networking as supporting further sales growth. Broadcom trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio below 25x based on fiscal 2026 estimates, with a price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.69 when factoring in its expected 36% long-term EPS growth. Analysts project that strong earnings expansion will be driven by AI, making Broadcom’s current valuation appear reasonable based on its growth prospects compared to its historical multiples. The chipmaker’s recent drop reflects short-term concerns over margins and AI spending worries rather than any fundamental weakness in demand. With analysts maintaining Buy ratings and lofty price targets, plus ongoing AI revenue acceleration, dips like this present buying opportunities for long-term investors focused on Broadcom’s dominant position in AI infrastructure.

By Eddie Makuch on December 16, 2025 at 6:49AM PST Ubisoft has acquired the game March of Giants from Amazon Games, and this also means that creative director Xavier Marquis has returned to Ubisoft. He was the original creative director on Rainbow Six Siege and comes back to Ubisoft alongside Alex Parizeau, the former managing director of Ubisoft Toronto. March of Giants is a 4v4 tactical multiplayer free-to-play MOBA inspired by technology from the early 1900s. The game combines elements of real-time strategy and lane-based combat. It's called March of Giants because players take on the role of a giant who is controlling troops on the battlefield. Marquis said in a news release that, "Returning to Ubisoft brings things full circle." "We built some of our most meaningful work here, and we’re excited to continue developing March of Giants from within Ubisoft. This game has enormous potential, and I know Ubisoft can help us take it to the next level," he said. Parizeau, meanwhile, thanked Amazon for supporting March of Giants and said he's excited to re-join Ubisoft to "build March of Giants into one of the next great, enduring MOBAs." March of Giants has held multiple playtests on Steam, but there is no word yet on a release date for the full game, nor do we know if it may come to consoles. The sale of March of Giants to Ubisoft comes after Amazon confirmed mass layoffs across the company, including at its gaming division. Financial terms of the sale were not disclosed.

Title: Crypto asset manager Bitwise says bitcoin will break its four-year cycle in 2026

Bitwise is telling clients to brace for a different kind of bitcoin BTC$87,996.38 market in 2026, arguing that the asset is maturing just as institutional money ramps up. The crypto asset manager said bitcoin’s long-watched four-year cycle is breaking down as halvings matter less, rates are expected to fall and leverage has been reined in after major liquidations in late 2025. "The forces that previously drove four-year cycles–the bitcoin halving, interest rate cycles, and crypto’s leverage-fueled booms and busts—are significantly weaker than they’ve been in past cycles," Matt Hougan, Bitwise CIO, said in the Monday blog post. The quadrennial halving slows the rate of growth in bitcoin supply by 50% by reducing the amount of new BTC miners receive as a reward for producing blocks. Combined with spot bitcoin ETF-fueled inflows and easier access on big brokerage platforms, Hougan expects those forces to help drive bitcoin to new all-time highs next year instead of a classic post-halving bust. Hougan also argued that bitcoin is no longer the outlier on risk many investors assume, noting that it has been less volatile than shares of chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) in 2025 and that its swings have been trending lower for a decade as exchange-traded funds broaden ownership. At the same time, Hougan forecasts bitcoin’s correlation with U.S. stocks will fall as crypto-specific catalysts, regulation, adoption and product innovation take the wheel. Put together, Bitwise says, those trends could make 2026 a breakout year for bitcoin as a portfolio asset and pull in tens of billions of dollars in new institutional capital.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Thinkstock The futures are trading lower after what started as a bounce-back Monday turned into a reversal Monday, as the AI/Datacenter rotation trade continues to gather steam during the last whole trading week of 2025. Stocks rallied Monday on the open as traders tried to inject some holiday spirit, but by 12 noon EST, all the major indices had reversed, and by the close, all were lower, though off the session lows. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fared the best on Monday, closing down just 0.007% at 48,416, while the S&P 500 finished the session at 6816. As has been the case recently, the tech-heavy Nasdaq was down the most on Monday, closing 0.59% lower at 23,057. Traders and investors will be laser-focused on this week’s economic data, which was postponed due to the government shutdown. Yields were mixed across the curve on Monday as sellers were focused on the shorter maturities, while buyers stepped in on the intermediate and longer-dated U.S. debt. Like their equity counterparts, bond traders and investors are watching and waiting, just like the rest of Wall Street, for the economic data delayed by the shutdown. Today, we will get the employment report for October and November, and on Thursday, we will see the Consumer Price Index data along with the jobless claims. The 30-year-long bond closed Monday at 4.85% while the benchmark 10-year note was last seen at 4.18% The energy complex started the week the way it finished last week, with the major benchmarks and natural gas all lower on the day. One of the big energy stories was the weakening LNG demand in China. That, combined with the consistent oversupply chatter, meant that the sellers once again had their way. Brent Crude closed trading on Monday at $60.35, down 1.26%, while West Texas Intermediate was last seen at $56.61, down 1.48%. Natural gas was hit again, closing down 2.36% at $4.02. Since hitting the 2025 high over $5 just 10 days ago, nat gas is down a stunning 20%. As is the case seemingly every trading day, Gold and Silver continued their spectacular runs higher. Gold benefited from continued central bank and retail buying, while Silver continues to see significant industrial demand. Gold closed trading on Monday at $4,302 while Silver finished the session at $63.89. Both are trading at all-time highs and look poised to continue the strong moves. The cryptocurrency market traded lower on Monday, with major assets like Bitcoin falling as investors moved away from riskier holdings. The total crypto market capitalization decreased, and most of the top 100 coins were down for the day. The overall risk-off tenor of the market on Monday was another factor. At 8 AM EST, Bitcoin was trading at $87,210 while Ethereum was quoted at $2,952. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders.

Title: 5 Things to Know Before the Stock Market Opens

Stock futures are slightly lower this morning ahead of the release of highly anticipated labor market data; the government is scheduled to release two months of employment figures that were delayed owing to the government shutdown; Ford is roverhauling its electric vehicle business amid stagnant demand in the U.S.; Oracle and Broadcom are among the tech stocks looking to reverse their recent slides; and Tesla shares enter today's session at their highest level of the year. Here's what you need to know. Stock futures are ticking lower as investors await the release of two months of employment data that will provide a clearer picture about the health of the U.S. economy. Futures tied to the tech-heavy Nasdaq were off 0.3% recently, while those linked to the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.1%. On Monday, the major indexes lost ground as concerns around an AI bubble continue to pressure the tech sector. Gold futures were down 0.4% at $4,320 an ounce this morning, after approaching a fresh record high yesterday, while crude oil futures fell 1.6% to $55.90 per barrel. Bitcoin was trading at $87,100, up from an overnight low of $85,200. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects the costs of all sorts of consumer loans, ticked lower to 4.17%. Investors will get a double dose of jobs data on, with the government shutdown-delayed figures from October slated for released alongside November numbers at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists estimate that the October numbers will show a decline in employment owing to mass layoffs of government workers. November employment growth is expected to come in at about 50,000 jobs, a relatively modest increase that would confirm the slowdown in the labor market. The Federal Reserve last week cut its key interest rate for the third time this year, citing concerns about the labor market, and the data released today will factor into the Fed's thinking about future rate adjustments. As of Tuesday morning, the CME Group's FedWatch tracker assigns just a 24% chance of a rate cut at the Fed's Jan. 28 meeting. Ford (F) has announced a major shift in its electric vehicle strategy, with the Michigan automaker expecting to take on about $19.5 billion in one-time charges to account for the costs of its restructuring plans. Ford and other automakers are scaling back electric vehicle plans as demand in the U.S. has fallen after the Trump administration ended the $7,500 EV tax credit earlier this year. In its late-Monday announcement, Ford said its electric vehicle unit should be profitable by 2029 after making these changes, and said some of its battery-producing plants will shift to making stationary batteries for homes, businesses and data centers. The next generation of the brand's F-150 Lightning will also now be an extended range EV rather than a fully electric vehicle, and Ford said its plans to start introducing smaller, more efficient and affordable EVs continues on track for 2027. Ford shares were up 1.5% in recent premarket trading. Shares of several tech stocks are looking to recover this week after recent slides, especially Oracle (ORCL) and Broadcom (AVGO), which have each tumbled since reporting earnings last week. Analysts are largely staying bullish on the stocks, but investors worry about an AI bubble inflating valuations in the market. In the three trading sessions since last Wednesday, when Oracle reported results after the bell, shares of Oracle and Broadcom have each lost more than 15% of their value. Investors are concerned about a range of issues facing the AI trade, from questions over how companies such as Oracle and OpenAI will finance their massive expansion plans while remaining financially stable, to the sustainability of AI demand outside of the few biggest tech companies. Shares of Broadcom and Oracle were little changed ahead of the opening bell. Telsa shares come into today's session at their high point of the year and not far from an all-time high. The company is facing the same lackluster EV demand in the U.S. as other automakers, along with international sales that are being hampered by increasing competition from Chinese automakers. However, investors are increasingly focused on other aspects of Tesla's business, such as its self-driving software, robotaxis, and humanoid robots called Optimus. After piloting its robotaxi program in Austin, Texas in recent months with a Tesla employee in the passenger seat, the company has recently started testing the vehicles' ability to drive autonomously with no one in the car. Tesla shares—which closed yesterday at $475.31, just off the record closing high of $479.86 set last December—were down 0.5% in recent premarket trading.

A group of underdogs surviving within a rigid system by finding clever ways to outsmart it might sound like the plot of a dystopian movie. But despite how fictional that storyline seems, in a world of 8 billion people, a few out-of-the-box free-thinkers exist. Those who want the thrill of rebellion without the guilt of breaking the rules have discovered clever loopholes that let them legally bypass certain situations without actually breaking the law. These ingenious workarounds may sound strange, yet the people who’ve cracked the code and use them repeatedly swear by them, despite how sketchy they might seem. Scroll below to read a few dependable methods Redditors have been using to take advantage of the system that feel completely illegal when you use them, and have been sharing online so others can use them too.

Image source: anon Saying that I will not answer any questions about my medical history unless it is pertinent to the medical information that I *chose* to disclose in order to receive the necessary accommodations. Under HIPAA laws, non government employers are prohibited from asking you for a your medical history, unless you have been diagnosed with any condition or disorder that will 75% prevent you from doing your job. In my case, I have epilepsy, and so I disclosed it and what accommodations I needed. My employer told me that they needed a doctor’s note or letter regarding the diagnosis in order to approve it, and I supplied it. However, when one of the big wigs asked me for one year’s worth of health records, I casually said, “That’s not pertinent to the letter that I sent in, or the diagnosis that required the accommodation letter. You can not ask me for a year’s worth of records, and if you ask again, I will be on the phone with a HIPAA lawyer before you can even blink.”. Image source: KhaosIncarnate5 DoorDash (& other delivery) would mess up my order but if an entire item wasn’t missing, they’d do a tiny partial refund even though I didn’t receive the food I ordered. Forcing me to pay for food I didn’t order. Example: I could order a cheeseburger with onion rings, bacon, BBQ sauce and just receive a plain cheeseburger, and they’d say since it was just missing a few toppings I’d only get a couple bucks back. Basically forcing me to pay full price for an item I didn’t even ask for. Another example: ordering a pizza with pepperoni and jalapenos, having it arrive with only jalapenos. I’d get a $2.50 refund for a missing topping and be stuck with a pizza I didn’t order. Loophole: in the examples above, rather than say my bacon cheeseburger was missing toppings, I’d just say the entire item was missing. I’d tell them I received a burger, but not the burger I ordered, which isn’t lying. My bacon cheeseburger was completely missing and I got someone else’s burger instead. Same with the pizza– it wasn’t just missing a topping, I ordered one pizza and got something completely different. It’s a different way to frame it, but it isn’t dishonest and it’s important because if you got the wrong item, it’s a full refund. If an item was prepared incorrectly, you get hardly anything except food you didn’t ask for.

Image source: GlassCharacter179 TLDR: You can bill a doctor for YOUR time. I have narcolepsy and 18 years ago when we were getting it all sorted out I had to go to the neurologist every month to check in and re-up my prescription (a controlled substance, so they would only do 1 month at a time). Literally every single time I showed up on time and waited 1 hour+ in the waiting room, then they’d put me in the private room where you sit on paper and I’d wait usually another half hour to hour before the Dr. would come in and spend 6 minutes with me. Every time I left the office I paid my copay and every time they made me sign a paper that stated the Dr’s time is valuable and if a patient is more than 5 minutes late for an appointment they’d be billed accordingly (this detail matters for later). I’m pretty patient so I just let it slide for a while. Then one day my insurance changed, I gave them my new insurance info when I paid my copay after my visit. Then a couple months later they sent me a bill for something like $3,000! Turns out they mistakenly tried billing my old insurance for one visit, which obviously didn’t work, so then they tried to get me to pay the absolutely insane amount (for the Dr.’s 6 minutes of time). This was their mistake and I wasn’t going to pay it but they weren’t going to let it go. They told me they would send me to collections. So, I strung them along for several more months to avoid collections and while I was doing that I very carefully and accurately tracked every minute I waited past my scheduled appointment times (remember I went in every 4 weeks). Then I wrote them a letter that was very directly modeled after their “the dr’s time is valuable” letter, it stated that my time is valuable and that starting 10 minutes after my appointment time the Dr is considered late for our appointment and that I would be billing for my time. I stated that I was going to graciously forgive the previous year+ of tardiness but itemized all of my time he had wasted for the last 3-4 months. I came up with a personal hourly rate that made my bill to them about $4,500. They immediately dropped the charges and miraculously I never waited more than about 15 minutes again.

Add it to cart and then right before you pay, change the pickup location to your local store. The price stays the same as the cheaper store. I saved a ton of money on stall mats for my home gym this way. Ordering no ice at Starbucks and asking for a cup of ice on the side. They fill your cup up all the way with no extra charge. Makes no sense. Doesn’t work good for espresso drinks but for iced coffee, cold brew, and refreshers, you’re just getting double the drink for free.

One coupon was for $2 off any item, so I got a $2 bottle of water and they just let me take it for free. Felt amazing. I saw a concert at a venue that didn’t let you leave and re-enter once you were inside. I was telling the merch guy I wanted to buy a poster but not have to hold it all night. He said “just say you have asthma and you need your inhaler, if it’s a medical issue they’re not allowed to ask you any questions.” I was hesitant because I really didn’t want to not get let back in, and he was like “cmon, come with me.” He goes to the door, tells security “hey, this kid has asthma, he needs to go get his inhaler.” I took off running, not even thinking about the connection, brought the poster back to my car, walked back to the side entrance, they stopped me and I was like “I was just in there!” and they were like “eh let him go.” I actually still feel a little guilty about it, but it definitely worked! Gave the merch guy a fist bump. Image source: wossquee Image source: youvegotnail, welcomia I install windows and trim them out.

Edit- to clarify as best I can: -We don’t have the space to store a lot of boards, so if we have a say 4’ cutoff it generally goes in the dumpster unless someone wants it. Someone always takes those for a shelf or something or for a job the next day that we know we can use it for. -I want it, because I have use for 4’ boards. -it’s encouraged for us to take home cut offs, but not full 16’ or 8’ boards. We save those. -it’s unfortunate we can’t store those cuttoffs because they are often all we need. I bring those when we need them. -my boss says that once it hits the dumpster it’s mine. I supply 4 4’ boards from my own house, I’m owed 16 lf. I take home a full 16 footer because I’m swimming in scraps, but sometimes need full boards. -my boss is aware this is dysfunctional.

Yves here. Satyajit Das provides a high level but nevertheless very effective indictment of the scam known as AI. I hope readers will circulate this post widely. By Satyajit Das, a former banker and author of numerous technical works on derivatives and several general titles: Traders, Guns & Money: Knowns and Unknowns in the Dazzling World of Derivatives (2006 and 2010), Extreme Money: The Masters of the Universe and the Cult of Risk (2011) and A Banquet of Consequence – Reloaded (2016 and 2021). His latest book is on ecotourism – Wild Quests: Journeys into Ecotourism and the Future for Animals (2024). This is an expanded version of a piece first published on 4 November 2025 in the New Indian Express print edition. AI is tracing the familiar, weary boom and bust trajectory identified in 1837 by Lord Overstone of quiescence, improvement, confidence, prosperity, excitement, overtrading, convulsion, pressure, stagnation, and distress. There are three primary concerns. First, there are doubts about the technology. Building on earlier technologies such as neural networks, rule-based expert systems, big data, pattern recognition and machine learning algorithms, GenAI (generative AI), the newest iteration, uses LLMs (large learning models) trained on massive data sets to create text and imagery. The holy grail is the ‘singularity’, a hypothetical point where machines surpass human intelligence. It would, in Silicon Valley speak, lead to ‘the merge’, when humans and machines come together potentially transforming creativity and technology. LLMs require enormous quantities of data. Existing firms in online search, sales platforms and social media platforms can exploit their own data troves. This is frequently supplemented by aggressive and unauthorised scraping of online data, sometimes confidential, leading to litigation around access, compensation and privacy. In practice, most AI models must rely on incomplete data which is difficult to clean to ensure accuracy. Despite massive scaling up of computing power, GenAI consistently fails in relatively simple factual tasks due to errors, biases and misinformation in datasets used. AI models are adept at interpolating answers between things within the data set but poor at extrapolation. Like any rote-learner, they struggle with novel problems. Their ability to act autonomously interacting within dynamic environments remains questionable. Cognitive scientists argue that simply scaling up LLMs based on sophisticated pattern-matching built to autocomplete rather than proper and robust world models will disappoint. Claimed progress is difficult to measure as benchmarks are vague and inconclusive. Cheerleaders miss that LLMs do not reason but are probabilistic prediction engines. A system which trawls existing data, even assuming that is correct, cannot create anything new. Once existing data sources are devoured, scaling produces diminishing returns. Rather than fully generalisable intelligence, generative models are regurgitation engines struggling with truth, hallucinations and reasoning. AI models can take over certain labour-intensive tasks like data driven research, journalism and writing, travel planning, computer coding, certain medical diagnostics, testing and routine administrative tasks like handling standard customer service queries. Its loftier aims may prove elusive. Predictions of medical breakthroughs have disappointed although pre- OpenAI machine learning models, pattern recognition engines and classifiers, used for years, continue to be useful. For the moment, GenAI, an ill-defined marketing rather than technical term, remains a costly parlour trick for some low-level applications, making memes and allowing scammers to deceive and defraud – the “unfathomable in pursuit of the indefinable”. Second, financial returns may prove elusive. Capital expenditure on AI is expected to total up to $5-7 trillion by 2030. AI startup valuations based on the latest round of funding were $2.30 trillion, up from $1.69 trillion in 2024, and up from $469 billion in 2020. But AI’s capacity to generate cash and returns on the investment remains questionable. Revenues would have to grow over 20 times from the current $15-20 billion per annum to just cover current annual investment in land, building, rapidly depreciating chips and power and water operating expenses. Revenues totalling more than $1 trillion may be required to earn an adequate return. Microsoft’s Windows and Office, among the world’s most used software, generates less than $100 billion in commercial and consumer revenue. Around 5 percent of its 800 million users currently pay to use ChatGPT. Microsoft’s CEO drew the ire of true believers when he argued that AI had yet to produce a profitable killer application to match the impact of email or Excel. The hope is AI will be paid for from higher productivity and corporate profits. But 95 percent of corporate GenAI pilot projects failed to raise revenue growth. After cutting hundreds of jobs and replacing them with AI, many firm were subsequently forced to reemploy staff when the technology proved deficient. Corporate interest is already showing sign of plateauing. Monetisation of AI faces other uncertainties. Several Chinese firms, such as DeepSeek, Moonshot as well as Bytedance and Alibaba, have developed cheaper models which cast doubts about the capital investment intensive approach of Western firms. China’s favoured open-source design would also undermine the revenues of firms which have invested heavily in proprietary technology. Required electricity and water supplies may prove to be constraints. In the meantime, AI firms remain a cash burning furnace. In the first half of 2025, OpenAI, owner of ChatGPT, generated $4.3 billion in revenue but spent $2 billion on sales and marketing and nearly $2.5 billion on stock-based equity compensation, posting an operating loss of $7.8 billion. Third, there are financial circularities seen during the dot com boom. CoreWeave, an equipment rental business trying to cash in the AI boom, purchases graphics processers in-demand for AI applications and rents them to users. Nvidia is an investor in the company, and the bulk of revenues is from a few customers. There is concern around CoreWeave’s accounting practices, especially the rate of depreciation of the chips, and its significant borrowings. In 2025, Nvidia, the backbone of the boom, agreed to invest $100 billion in OpenAI which in turn bought a similar dollar value of GPUs from it. Open AI proposed to invest in chipmakers AMD and Broadcom. There are side arrangements with Microsoft. Figure 1 sets out some of the complex interrelationships. Figure 1 AI Firm Inter-relationships and Cross-Investments This intricate web of linkages creates risks. They complicate ownership and create conflicts of interest. It was not clear how any of these commitments will work or be funded if they proceed. Open AI’s ability to finance these investments depends on continued access to new money from investors because it currently does not have the resources to meet many of these long-term obligations. These transactions distort financial performance. The firm selling capital goods reports sales and profits while the funding of the sale is treated as an investment. The buyer depreciates the cost over several years. Given that Nvidia seemingly upgrades its chip architecture regularly, depreciation periods of anywhere up to 5 years or longer seem optimistic. This means that dubious earnings boost share prices in a dizzying financial merry go round. The AI bubble, with its growing gap between expectations, investment and revenue potential, eerily resembles the 1990s. But it is much larger. Investment may be 17 times that of the 2000 dot com and four times the 2008 sub-prime housing bubble. AI’s acolytes deny any excess and argue that this time it is different because it is financed by equity capital. In fact, a large proportion is funded by debt with the amount tied to AI totalling around $1.2 trillion, 14 percent of all investment-grade debt. The funding pattern is intriguing. Hyperscalers, firms that build and operate large data centres providing on-demand cloud computing, storage, and networking services, such as Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet and Oracle, are providing much of funding alongside venture capital investors. These firms are currently spending around 60 percent of operating, not free, cash flow, on capital expenditure, the vast majority of which is to support AI projects. This is supplemented by borrowing, relying on their credit standings, to finance their investments. Increasingly, a significant proportion of the funding is being provided by private credit with. expected volumes as high as $800 billion over the next two years and $5.5 trillion through to 2035. Given the high return, high risk appetites of these lenders, the level of financial discipline applied to these loans remains uncertain. In effect, these large firm are now acting as financiers, borrowing money which is on-lent or invested in AI start-ups with unclear prospects. This exposure is troubling. Investor and lender assumptions that their exposure is to a strong firm is undermined where it is heavily invested in speculative AI ventures with unclear prospects. Microsoft’s share of Open AI’s losses is significant, over $4 billion in the latest quarter, representing around 12 percent of its pre-tax earnings. Oracle’s experience is salutary. The shares rose 25 percent when it announced a transaction to provide cloud computing facilities to OpenAI. The data centres do not currently exist and will have to be constructed. The transaction requires Oracle, which is significantly leveraged, to borrow funds to create these centres meaning that the firm is taking significant exposure to Open AI. As of December 2025, investor concern was palpable. Given its current net debt of over $100 billion which will need to increase substantially to finance the data centres, the cost of insuring against Oracle default rose sharply and presumably will flow through into the value of existing debt and the cost of future debt. A credit ratings downgrade from its current BBB, low investment grade, is possible, potentially to non-investment or junk grade. Its share price has fallen to levels around that before the announcement of the OpenAI transaction. While Microsoft, Meta and Amazon have stronger balance sheets, the risks are not dissimilar. The impact of the AI boom on the wider economy is material. AI companies account for 75-80 percent of US stock returns and earnings growth and 90 percent of capital expenditure growth. It has added around 40 percent or a full percentage point to 2025 US growth. Any retrenchment would affect the wider economy. It would also result in financial instability because of the direct and indirect exposure of banks and financial institutions to the AI sector. It is not inconceivable that some tech firms may require bailouts, such as that engineered for Intel, alongside familiar support for financiers, who will plead that without assistance the economy will collapse. Investors have convinced themselves that the greater risk is underinvesting not overinvesting. Amazon founder Jeff Bexos hails it a “good kind of bubble” arguing that the money spent will bring long-term returns and deliver gigantic benefits to society, the tech-bro’s persistent bromide. Investors should be cautious. In the 1990s telecoms and fibre optic cable bubble, investors drastically overestimated capacity required. The percentage of lit or used fibre-optic capacity today, much of it installed during the dot com boom, is around 50 per cent, and global average network utilisation is 26 percent. Investors believe that they have minimises risk by avoiding direct exposure to AI firms investing instead in firms like Nvidia, which provide the ‘picks and shovels’ of the revolution. The case of Cisco, for which the investment case during the halcyon days of the 1990 was similar, provides an interesting benchmark. It briefly became the world’s most valuable company on the largely correct assumption that its routers and other products would be crucial to the Internet. While the company’s financial performance has been generally steady, investors in Cisco lost out as its share price plummeted in 2000 only reaching the same level after 25 years. When the dot com boom ended, Microsoft, Apple, Oracle and Amazon fell 65, 80, 88 percent, and 94 percent respectively taking 16, 5, 14 and 7 years to recover their 2000 peaks. The economy slowed requiring government support and historically low interest rates, at the time, to sustain economy activity which set off the housing boom which resulted in the 2008 crisis. Consensual Tolkien-esque hallucinations notwithstanding, it would be surprising if the ending is different this time. © Satyajit Das 2025 All Right Reserved “…financiers, who will plead that without assistance the economy will collapse.” The other point to this claim is that, for an increasing percentage of the population, the economy has already collapsed. I really wonder if America can endure another round of financial bail-outs. The sheer scale of the malinvestment involved with this AI Bubble may make the governmental rescue of the financiers impossible this time. Is it possible to reach a point where the “socialization of the loses” leads to the demise of the society involved? We may finally discover the answer to the perennial question; “What came first, the goose or the golden egg?” via reverse financial engineering. Stay safe. Keep clipping those coupons. Apparently the riddle has been solved. Some particular kind of protein I believe was found in eggs that only exists in the chicken. Therefore the chicken had to come first in order to lay that egg, lol. I don’t know how politically either party survives a bailout of these foolish investments. All the little people get are cuts and pay more, and then you toss billions at companies that wasted all those resources? The feedback will be highly negative. I have been following the stock market valuation of Nvidia and Oracle to get a hint of when this mad bubble will burst as one makes the chips and the other the data centres (I have no money riding on those ponies, and this is not financial advice). Nvidia is currently down 10% from what looks like a peak in late October – early November and Oracle is down 40% from what looks like a peak in late September. Considering the amount of billions that need to be continously shovelled into this bubble I figure that when the line goes down enough the fear of losing will overtake the greed of “buying the dip” and the whole thing will come crashing down. But I could be wrong, I usually tend to err on the side of people should be able to see a bubble for what it is. I have been watching Nvidia too. Just to look. after so many people had drunk the AI kool-aid. My overwhelming cynicism prevents me from believing the hype. Last april when DEEPSEEK came out and Nvidia dropped to $94.. it seemed like reality was about to set in…. but then it climbed back up past the $188 mark…. a quick doubling of money…. damn.. Gold too… silver too.. Too bad I didn’t know the future, back then. .. the market really can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent. .. The first crack in the Tower of Number Go Up may have appeared. Oracle posted its quarterly results and not only did it bigly miss the expected earnings, it spent far more than anyone had forecast. Oracle downplayed it by pointing to the 68 billion dollar increase in its future receivables due to the signing of large contracts. They said Stargate was progressing as expected which is nonsense: 2 of the 11 buildings which need to built and operational by June(!) have been built. OpenAI still doesn’t have the money to pay Oracle (or anyone else for that matter) and Oracle doesn’t have the 40 billion to buy all the GPU’s they need to provide. I expect we’ll soon see a lot more urgent messaging about how America is losing the AI race and that the government is going to have to loosen the purse strings lest the foreign menace wins and enslaves the losers. I think there’s a good chance OpenAI dies this year when it hits the wall of its debt. Or maybe Microsoft yawns and swallows Altman and friends before returning to its slumber. As Yves et al are fond of saying, pass the popcorn. The lights are dimming and the show will soon start. Gigantic benefits (per Bexos, hehe) from data-driven research, journalism(!) and writing, travel planning, computer coding, certain medical diagnostics and some routine administrative tasks? Will I still have to prepare the spaghetti al pesto, drink water instead of data, and pooh-pooh the usual? Scam Altman said the other day that chatbots are now “essential” to raise children. To me a clear indication of the bubbly state of AI. A problem barely touched here is the use of resources (electricity, water, raw materials), not to mention the externalities of climate change. Yet, according to some studies AI would (somehow) help to curb carbon emissions more than offsetting AI functioning related emissions. The article linked is an exercise of wishful thinking authored by some partner of a consulting company based in London. It is not a scientific article and cannot be even considered as data driven research. It is an exercise of magical thinking in which, somehow, AI gets in charge of everything and problems are solved. Seems like a self-licking ice cream cone. short text, machine-translation from German: Ones and zeros Can Large Language Models develop consciousness? By Daniel H. Rapoport https://archive.is/R5MS8 “(…) To assess whether LLMs can develop consciousness, we would need a rough understanding of what consciousness is. Unfortunately, no one possesses this understanding yet, not even a rough one. No psychologist, no philosopher, no pastor, and no biologist could say for sure what consciousness really is. We know only—purely phenomenologically, from a kind of self-evidence—that consciousness has something to do with inner experience. But we have also learned—both from simple optical illusions and from the enigmatic world of quantum mechanics—that the world is often quite different from how it appears to us. The self-evidence of the capacity for experience need not be as true and fundamental as it seems to us. Even if consciousness were something like an optical illusion, we would still like to know how it manages to generate an “inner experience.” If only to assess whether the potential to produce such illusions also lies dormant in LLMs (Low Life Mechanisms). (…)” …Shouldn’t we deal with Natural Stupidity (NS) first? oaf Excellent point – and nice to see you commenting! Given the ongoing enshittification of the Internet, how can LLMs not have an ever-decreasing signal-to-noise ratio? I have no tech knowledge whatsoever, but it just seems to follow from the models at work. A lot of ink to write “Ponzi scheme”….. Patrick Boyle did a more comprehensive review a month ago: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbL7yZCF-6Q and is very thoroughly researched including the power issues, not primarily stock prices. I wonder if AI helped write this paper: Even Das should know that Deepseek is FREE not cheaper “Several Chinese firms, such as DeepSeek, Moonshot as well as Bytedance and Alibaba, have developed cheaper models which cast doubts about the capital investment intensive approach of Western firms.” There is no competition with free (!!!!) there is competition potential with cheaper, sounds like one of those “hallucinations.” I took ‘cheaper’ to be in reference to Deepseek’s inference costs, which are reportedly a fraction of Chat GPT’s. Good, concise roundup of problems in the AI world, which are well known but cannot be repeated too often in the current information environment. This is a good paragraph (my emphasis): Cheerleaders miss that LLMs do not reason but are probabilistic prediction engines. A system which trawls existing data, even assuming that is correct, cannot create anything new. … Rather than fully generalisable intelligence, generative models are regurgitation engines… The emphasized points here are impossible to argue with, yet they are the death knell of the whole technology. Almost every claim for AI assumes that its output will be beyond anything humans have been able to do to date, yet it’s output will, at best, consist of precisely what humans have been able to do to date. However the following paragraph goes off the rails in my opinion (my emphasis, once again): AI models can take over certain labour-intensive tasks like data driven research, journalism and writing, travel planning, computer coding, certain medical diagnostics, testing and routine administrative tasks like handling standard customer service queries. Its loftier aims may prove elusive. Das acknowledges that AI produces strictly rote material that is unreliable, and unfixable. This precludes using it for anything where mistakes are not tolerable, which obviously includes anything safety-critical like research, medical diagnostics and computer coding, but also anything requiring imagination or creativity, or even just getting better over time, like journalism and writing, travel planning, administration, and interfacing with customers. In fact, it’s actually quite difficult to think of any task that’s worth doing, but where mistakes are of no consequence whatsoever. Thanks for this article. I have been skeptical about AI from day one. There isn’t anything about this technology that can be sustained over the long term such as the financing, electricity demand, water use, etc. I watched an interview the other day of Ed Zitron by Newsweek. Ed pointed out that AI doesn’t do much. It isn’t reliable, accurate, or effective in many of the tasks it is asked to do. I also read about the executive order that trump signed about AI last week and there has been speculation that AI will be bailed out by the government. So putting two and two together and dawning the tin foil hat, I do wonder if the government won’t end up using AI as part of the massive surveillance state apparatus that already exists. Huge amounts of surveillance data is available on everybody and AI will have a field day predicting who will commit the next crime. If AI gets the facts wrong, good luck to you proving that you didn’t commit the crime you are accused of. Jury trials are going away in some cases in the UK. What better justification to keep America “safe”. I appreciate the fine summary of many points that have exposed gen AI as average as in mediocre. I’ve never prompted an LLM or image diffuser for the following reason: Intelligence can’t exist without goals. AI’s don’t have goals. Therefore I’d just be looking at algorithm generated words and pictures. I keep coming back to kaleidoscopes as an analogy. A marvelously large number of possible patterns generated almost magically but hardly worth investing in. Chatbots, with the emphasis on “chat”, have become a tech marketers’ ultimate dream product – pornography (artificial engagement) to meet all one’s social needs, not just the erotic ones. Sam Altman is a pied piper enjoying our children’s innocence while we hook up with a bot. Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment * Name * Email * SUBSCRIPTIONS

Title: Ad Tech Briefing: How the experts predict digital ad spend will pan out in 2026

This Ad Tech Briefing covers the latest in ad tech and platforms for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Tuesday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → U.S. advertising spending is now forecast to grow 6.6% next year — that’s not taking into account political ad spend that occurred in 2025 — down from an estimated 11% in the past 12 months, according to the latest analysis from Madison & Wall. The findings are reflected in a similar global forecast from media consultancy Ebiquity, which found that almost half (48%) of marketers expect to increase their media spend next year, with digital video and CTV likely to be the biggest beneficiaries. However, sources predict this moderate growth is most likely to be concentrated in a few hands, with the titans of Silicon Valley on course to benefit most from this trend. Per Madison & Wall’s revised assessment, programmatic spend follows stronger-than-expected performance in 2025 and reflects a moderation in growth rather than a downturn. For programmatic advertising, the forecast points to continued expansion in automated buying, concentrated in digital formats that deliver measurable performance, while much of the open internet — that includes independent ad tech — is under intense pressure to compete with the likes of Amazon and Google. The upgrade comes after another strong quarter. Advertising revenues grew 13% year over year in Q3 2025, excluding political spending, the fastest quarterly pace since early 2022 (see chart). Digital advertising increased 21%, raising digital’s share of total ad spend to 72%, with the forecast underscoring the continued dominance of channels with first-party data, closed-loop measurement, and AI-driven optimization. Looking ahead, Madison & Wall expects economic conditions to remain broadly supportive in 2026, despite rising policy and geopolitical risks. Consensus forecasts point to real GDP growth of roughly 1.8% and inflation near 2.8%, implying nominal GDP growth of about 4 to 5%. While the correlation between economic growth and advertising has weakened, the firm views nominal growth as a meaningful reference point for advertising demand. It expects advertising growth to slow gradually rather than correct sharply. Within that environment, programmatic advertising is expected to increase its share of open internet transactions. Madison & Wall forecasts programmatic revenues across the open internet to grow 4.4% in 2026, with programmatic accounting for 74% of open internet ad revenues. Growth is expected to be driven by programmatic connected TV, digital out-of-home, and digital audio, each projected to grow at double-digit rates as automation expands across newer digital formats. However, total open internet advertising revenues are expected to be roughly flat. Programmatic growth in 2026 is therefore driven primarily by a shift in buying methods rather than an expansion of overall spend. Programmatic revenues tied to digital platforms and publishers are expected to decline slightly, reflecting ongoing pricing pressure and uneven demand outside large-scale platforms. In his end-of-year assessment, W Media Research‘s Karsten Weide remarked how much of the ad tech ecosystem on the open internet was in open conflict, highlighting how the Q3 dispute of transaction IDs, or “TIDs,” between buy- and sell-side players is an open wound. “What once sounded like a technical dispute over wrappers and auction mechanics has escalated into a power struggle over who governs the open internet,” he noted. By contrast, closed digital platforms are expected to continue to capture a disproportionate share of incremental spending. Madison & Wall forecasts commerce media to grow 16% in 2026, social media 15%, and search 8%. The firm expects ad tech platforms to introduce additional AI-powered buying tools designed to replicate the automated, outcome-focused buying models already prevalent within walled gardens. Madison & Wall further noted how advertisers are placing greater emphasis on price and performance, often at the expense of transparency and control, with spend increasingly directed toward platforms that bundle creative, optimization, and measurement within the cost of inventory. Direct relationships between advertisers and large media owners continue to expand; this is a trend that reduces reliance on agency-managed buying systems, with Madison & Wall expecting AI to enhance this trend as more workflow tools are made available in the industry. Meanwhile, search and commerce advertising are expected to remain structurally resilient, while publishers across the open internet face greater pressure to adapt their business models. In that context, programmatic advertising continues to function as a core transaction layer — growing in importance, but operating within a more constrained overall market. “If I have the opportunity to leave, I’m leaving. Omnicom is NOT competitive in my eyes. Their benefits suck and they are moving away from creative driven [sic] work and focusing on data driven [sic] work and pumping out as much content as possible.” — An Omnicom staff member speaks truth to power on the gift that keeps on giving, i.e., the OmnicomIPGmerger subreddit, while others use other threads to estimate that the layoffs are not even halfway done. From the 2026 Integral Ad Science Industry Pulse Report: WPP estimates commerce media spending to overtake TV this year The company’s latest global ad spend forecasts predict that commerce media will account for 15.6% of global ad spend in 2025, compared with the 14.6% spent on linear and connected TV. The case against AI agents for programmatic ad buying Christopher Francia, director of product development and client performance at Attention Arc explains discusses whether or not AI agents be involved in programmatic ad buys. Plot spoiler: “We’re not trusting that to large language model-based agents.” Google tells advertisers it’ll bring ads to Gemini in 2026 Google has said to advertising clients in recent days that it plans to bring ads to its AI chatbot Gemini, according to agency buyers familiar with the conversations, according to Adweek’s Trishla Ostwal. AI brings MFA to social media… how advertisers can avoid it Zefr CEO Rich Raddon argues that generative AI has led to the re-emergence of an unwelcome visitor from the past for most advertisers. X shuts down EU’s ad account after first major DSA fine The European Commission issued a €120 million fine to X — its first fine issued under the Digital Services Act (DSA) following prior allegations. Following the fine and a public response from X CEO Elon Musk, X shut down the Commission’s ad account. Advertiser battles Google, alleges failure to disclose queries “Google prioritizes profit over integrity by using its Google Ads program to deceive its customers, primarily small businesses, out of their hard-earned money,” the advertiser argues in papers filed Thursday with U.S. District Court Judge Case Pitts in San Jose. “Since 2020, Google has accomplished this grift, by hiding a significant portion of its client charges inside an impenetrable ‘black box’ that not even Houdini could open.” OpenPath offers buyers a “cleaner” route to publishers, but some are concerned about lack of clarity over indirect costs. Over the past year, Roblox has become harder for brands to ignore — not because it has resolved the challenges of digital commerce, but because of the scale at which younger consumers already use it. Corporate development sources estimate the deal valuation to be above $300 million, claiming tvScientific’s gross revenue is approximately $100 million.

SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week Advances in tech and AI are producing android machine workers. What will that mean for humans? Humanoid robots that can obey commands, make decisions, and deftly perform manual tasks have long been a sci-fi fantasy. Now they are becoming reality. Artificial intelligence, coupled with advances in robotics, has the potential to give humanoid robots unprecedented power to analyze, “think,” and learn. Tech evangelists say these robots will have a transformative impact on workplaces and even in our homes, and not in distant decades but in the next few years. Elon Musk believes robots will be “the biggest product ever in history.” His Tesla robot Optimus can already climb stairs and carry 45-pound objects, and he says Tesla will deliver a million units a year by 2030. By 2035, Citigroup predicts, some 1.3 billion robots will be in operation, both in industrial settings and in households, nursing homes, and construction sites. “By the 2040s,” said Adam Dorr, research director at the analytics firm RethinkX, “there will be almost nothing a robot can’t do better and cheaper than a human.” China already has more than 2 million of them working in factories, and the U.S. is rushing to catch up. In workplaces across America, robots are lifting boxes, transporting goods, even flipping burgers. At a Spanx warehouse outside Atlanta, humanoid bots pluck baskets of clothes from wheeled bots and set them on conveyor belts. To unpack trucks in several facilities, the shipping company DHL uses wheeled Stretch robots from Boston Dynamics, which can lift 50-pound boxes using flexible arms covered in vacuum suction cups. Just one can unload nearly 600 cases per hour, nearly double what humans can do. BMW just finished a pilot program in Spartanburg, S.C., where robot tasks included loading sheet metal parts into a welder. Even small firms are getting in on the action. Greg LeFevre is CEO of Raymath, a metal-fabrication company in Troy, Ohio. His factory is using 13 robot arms, supervised by his human employees, and he says the machines can work around the clock and can execute tricky aluminum welds “anywhere from two to six times faster” than a person. But it’s the nation’s second-largest private employer, Amazon, that is taking the biggest leap. It has a million robots working in various capacities and says some 75% of its global deliveries are assisted by robotics. At its 3-million-square-foot “next generation” facility in Shreveport, La., some 1,000 robots of various shapes and sizes shuttle pallets across floors, pluck items from storage bins, and load packages onto carts. Citing internal documents, The New York Times reported last month that Amazon is on track to replace some 600,000 jobs with robots in the coming years, even with sales projected to double by 2033. Its transformation will be closely watched, said Daron Acemoglu, an MIT professor who studies automation. “Once they work out how to do this profitably, it will spread to others too.” Escape your echo chamber.

Robot enthusiasts say the next frontier after warehouses and factories will be homes. The California robotics firm 1X Technologies is taking $20,000 preorders for its Neo robots, with expected delivery next year. The 5-foot, 6-inch humanoids—which currently require remote human operators to joystick them around but will eventually be autonomous—will not just clean toilets and load dishwashers. They’ll also be able to share jokes and engage in “lively, natural conversations,” says the firm. CEO Bernt Bornich believes users will rely on them for both cleaning and companionship. “I don’t think it’s another person, and it’s not a pet,” he said. “It’s something else.” There’s no question robots will take away some jobs, but the net effect is a matter of debate. Tech CEOs are quick to say that in fact new higher-skilled jobs will be created—like the position of robot wrangler—and that robots will largely fill dull jobs that most people don’t want. The bots unloading DHS trucks, for example, do “the most hated job in a warehouse,” said Marc Theermann of Boston Dynamics. But some scientists say the robot revolution is still far off, because the machines still have significant physical limitations. Those who think android plumbers and cooks will soon proliferate should “reset expectations,” said Ken Goldberg, a roboticist at University of California, Berkeley. For one thing, it’s proved very hard to endow them with the dexterity to manipulate objects, such as “pick up a wine glass or change a light bulb,” he said. “No robot can do that.” Robot evangelists say yes. They say robots are learning so quickly that their advent will inevitably lead to labor-market upheaval. Kavin, a 27-year-old who helps train AI robots to fold clothes in India, says the humanoids aren’t perfect. “Sometimes the robot’s arms throw the clothes,” he says. “Sometimes it scatters the stack.” But he says they’re improving to the point where soon, “they’ll be able to do all the jobs, and there will be none left for us.” Anticipating pushback over mass layoffs, Amazon is reportedly developing plans to mitigate the fallout through community outreach, and other companies are commissioning studies on possible impacts. “We’re basically going to live in a world,” says Brett Adcock, CEO of Figure AI, “where any physical labor is a choice.” A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Feature A consummate history of capitalism and a memoir from the journalist who fell in love with RFK Jr. The Explainer The Trump administration is imposing new limits for federal student loans starting on July 1, 2026 TODAY’S BIG QUESTION Trump’s all-powerful gatekeeper is at the center of a MAGA firestorm that could shift the trajectory of the administration In the Spotlight Tariffs and cheaper rivals have displaced the innovative robot company Under the Radar Some say the machines help people mourn; others are skeptical Feature The tech mogul’s vision for virtual worlds inhabited by millions of users was clearly a flop Speed Read Kids under age 16 are now barred from platforms including YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat and Reddit Feature If you get a puzzling text message from a stranger, you may be the target of ‘pig butchering.’ The Week Recommends Advanced AI may have made slop videos harder to spot, but experts say it’s still possible to detect them Under the radar Pollution from Colossal looms over a small Southern town, potentially exacerbating health concerns feature Cloudflare was the latest in a string of outages The Week is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

The New York Mets’ ballpark in Queens. A Bronx golf course once operated by President Donald Trump ’s company. A slot parlor on a horse racing track near John F. Kennedy International Airport. The three disparate sites, located far from the tourist hub of Manhattan, will become the future homes of New York City’s first Las Vegas-style resort casinos. The state Gaming Commission on Monday awarded the three projects licenses to operate in the lucrative metropolitan-area market during a meeting at a riverside park in upper Manhattan. The panel approved the licenses with the condition that the companies each appoint an outside monitor that would report regularly to the commission to ensure they meet their financial and legal obligations, as well as the promised investments they made to local communities. Roomba maker iRobot has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, but says that it doesn’t expect any disruptions to devices as the more than 30-year-old company is taken private under a restructuring process. IRobot, which became well known for its robotic vacuums, has struggled of late, dealing with increased competition, layoffs and a declining stock price. In 2022 Amazon announced that it had agreed to buy iRobot for about $1.7 billion, but that deal was called off last year. Amazon blamed “undue and disproportionate regulatory hurdles” after the European Union signaled its objection to the transaction.

The sale of March of Giants comes less than two months after Amazon said it had decided to "halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development." When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Amazon's slow, shambolic withdrawal from mainstream videogame development continued apace with today's announcement that it has offloaded the free-to-play MOBA March of Giants, which is still in development, onto Ubisoft. The deal will also see Amazon Games Montreal, headed up by former Rainbow Six Siege creative director Xavier Marquis and Ubisoft Toronto managing director Alexandre Parizeau, join Ubisoft as part of its Montreal studio. "Returning to Ubisoft brings things full circle," said Marquis, the creative director on March of Giants. "We built some of our most meaningful work here, and we're excited to continue developing March of Giants from within Ubisoft. This game has enormous potential, and I know Ubisoft can help us take it to the next level." Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot shared similar sentiments, saying that March of Giants "has a real opportunity to bring something fresh and dynamic to players, and to help Ubisoft compete in one of gaming's biggest arenas." "We're looking forward to welcoming back Alexandre, Xavier, and many of the seasoned March of Giants team who have previously worked at Ubisoft, and the entire team's ambition, creativity and talent align perfectly with our desire to build bold new experiences for players," Guillemot said. "We look forward to supporting them as they shape the future of this promising new IP." Thrilled to have the March of Giants team join Ubisoft Montréal! These seasoned developers—many who built their careers here—are pushing boundaries with their competitive MOBA experience. Welcome! Full details here: https://t.co/XHree0iuqD pic.twitter.com/qN8HXWsEwnDecember 15, 2025 The MOBA genre can indeed be lucrative, if you happen to be the company that made League of Legends or Dota 2. For everyone else, it's more of a fistfight over the crumbs. Gigantic: Rampage Edition and Seekers of Skyveil both crashed out quickly after launch, and while Smite 2 continues to trundle along, Hi-Rez Studios has struggled badly with layoffs and game shutdowns over the past couple years. The only game with the potential to shake things up in the genre is Deadlock, almost entirely due to the fact it's being developed by Valve. The response to the March of Giants closed alpha in September might suggest that it's in for a similarly rough ride. Not that the reaction is overly negative, there just doesn't seem to be much of it at all: The "closed alpha recap" post, the most recent update, has drawn a total of six comments, and the game's Steam forum in general is largely devoid of activity; the March of Giants Discord seems similarly moribund. How likely it is that Ubisoft will be able to turn that around is anyone's guess, although the odds don't strike me as particularly great. But assuming it follows the LoL/Dota 2 pricing scheme, March of Giants does seem like it could be a good fit for Ubisoft's focus on live service games in the future. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Amazon, meanwhile, hasn't completely stepped back from the videogame business. It remains committed to publishing the two new Tomb Raider games announced at The Game Awards 2025, and it also seemingly sees big things in AI-fuelled garbage like Courtroom Chaos Featuring Snoop Dog. This may not be a great time for Ubisoft to try busting into the MOBA biz, but at least it's better than that. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Andy has been gaming on PCs from the very beginning, starting as a youngster with text adventures and primitive action games on a cassette-based TRS80.

Title: Former Meta integrity chief says new report reveals ‘disappointing’ ad fraud epidemic at the social-media giant
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/15/former-meta-integrity-chief-ad-fraud-epidemic-china-scams/
Time Published: 2025-12-15T20:08:17Z

A sweeping Reuters investigation has put a price tag on Meta’s tolerance for ad fraud: billions of dollars a year. For Rob Leathern, a former Meta executive who led the company’s business integrity operations until 2019, the findings expose a stark tension between revenue growth and consumer harm. The report, published Monday, found that Meta generated roughly $18 billion in advertising revenue from China in 2024, around 10% of its global revenue, even as internal documents showed that nearly one-fifth of that (about $3 billion) came from ads tied to scams, illegal gambling, pornography, and other prohibited activity. Meta internally labeled China its top “scam exporting nation,” accounting for 25% of all scam and banned-product ads globally, according to the report. Meta’s core social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp) are blocked in China, but the company still earns billions from Chinese advertisers targeting global users. The investigation, Leathern told Fortune, illuminates several issues with both Meta and the broader Chinese ad market. “It appears that a variety of business partners that Meta has are not conducting themselves in an ethical way and/or there are employees of those companies that are not doing what they’re supposed to be doing,” he said. “It’s quite telling that Meta took down its entire partner directory, which obviously means that they must be reviewing their partners, and there’s a lot of them.” A Meta spokesperson told Fortune in a statement: “Scams are spiking across the internet, driven by persistent criminals and sophisticated, organized crime syndicates constantly evolving their schemes to evade detection. We are focused on rooting them out by using advanced technical measures and new tools, disrupting criminal scam networks, working with industry partners and law enforcement, and raising awareness on our platforms about scam activity. And when we determine that bad actors have violated our rules prohibiting fraud and scams, we take action.” Meta communications chief Andy Stone, however, pushed back on the investigation, posting on Threads, “Once again, Reuters is misconstruing and misrepresenting the facts.” He argued that CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s “integrity strategy pivot”—which included instructing the China ads-enforcement team to reportedly “pause” its work—was to improve teams’ goals and “instruct them to redouble efforts to fight frauds and scams globally, not just from specific markets.” Stone also claimed that these teams have “doubled their fraud and scam reduction goal and over the last 15 months, user reports of scam ads have declined by well over 50%.” The revelations published by Reuters echo—but far exceed—the AI-driven deepfake scheme earlier this year involving Goldman Sachs during which scammers used AI-generated videos of investment strategist Abby Joseph Cohen to lure retail investors into fraudulent WhatsApp groups via Instagram ads. Reuters’ reporting suggests Meta’s China-linked scam problem is not an edge case or a blind spot, but an allegedly known and lucrative segment of its advertising business. According to internal estimates cited by Reuters, Meta served as many as 15 billion “high-risk” fraudulent ads per day, generating roughly $7 billion annually. The company required a 95% confidence threshold before banning fraudulent advertisers; those falling below it were often allowed to continue operating, sometimes at higher fees. Meta also established a 0.15% revenue “guardrail” (about $135 million) as the maximum revenue it was willing to forgo to crack down on suspicious ads, even as it earned $3.5 billion every six months from ads deemed to carry “higher legal risk.” Internal decision-making was explicit. When enforcement staff proposed shutting down fraudulent accounts, internal documents reviewed by Reuters showed that Meta sought assurance that growth teams would not object “given the revenue impact.” Asked whether Meta would penalize high-spending Chinese partners running scams, the answer was reportedly “No,” citing “high revenue impact.” Internal assessments reportedly noted that revenue from risky ads would “almost certainly exceed the cost of any regulatory settlement,” effectively treating fines as a cost of doing business. In late 2024, Meta reinstated 4,000 second-tier Chinese ad agencies that had previously been suspended, unlocking $240 million in annualized revenue—roughly half of it tied to ads violating Meta’s own safety policies, according to the investigation. More than 75% of harmful ad spending, Reuters found, came from accounts benefiting from Meta’s partner protections. The company also disbanded its China-focused anti-scam team. An external audit commissioned by Meta from the Propellerfish Group reached a blunt conclusion when investigating fraud and scams on the platform: Meta’s “own behavior and policies” were promoting systemic corruption in China’s advertising ecosystem. Reuters reported that the company largely ignored the findings and expanded operations anyway. Leathern, who reviewed the reporting and internal figures referenced in the report, told Fortune the scale of the problem was difficult to defend. “I was disappointed that the violation rates for the China-specific advertisers were as high as they were in the last year,” he said. “It’s disappointing, because there are ways to make it lower.” His critique goes to the heart of the failure. Platforms, he said, should hold intermediary agencies accountable for the quality of advertisers they bring in. “If you’re measuring violation rates coming from certain partners, and those rates are above a threshold every quarter or every year, you can just fire your worst-performing customers,” he said. “I think it’s important for us to have some sense of transparency into how policies are being enforced and what companies are doing in terms of reducing scams on their platforms,” Leathern added. Over the past 18 months, Meta has removed or rejected more than 46 million advertisements placed via so-called resellers, or large Chinese ad firms. And more than 99% of ad accounts associated with resellers found to be violating the company’s fraud policies were proactively detected and disabled. Aside from a need for transparency, Leathern warned that prioritizing short-term revenue over trust ultimately threatens the business itself. “If people don’t trust advertisers, advertising, it reduces the effectiveness of that channel for all advertisers,” he said. “There’s a lot of risk to their business, directly and indirectly, from not doing a good enough job on stopping scams.” The human cost is already visible. Reuters documented victims across North America and Asia, including U.S. and Canadian investors who lost life savings to fake stock and crypto ads, Taiwanese consumers misled into buying counterfeit health products, and a Canadian Air Force recruiter whose Facebook account was hijacked to run crypto scams. Meta’s own internal safety staff estimated the company’s platforms were “involved” in roughly one-third of all successful U.S. scams, linked to more than $50 billion in consumer losses. The problem is intensifying as generative AI lowers the barrier for scammers. “You can create something that looks plausible far more easily than ever before,” Leathern said. “The speed and adaptability of criminals and their use of AI tools just makes the environment far more tricky.” Yet Leathern said platforms like Meta have not been sufficiently transparent about how aggressively they are using those same tools to fight abuse. “We just don’t have a ton of insight into what they’re doing to reduce scams and fraud coming in through ads,” he said. For Leathern, the investigation should be a turning point. “I hope they see this as an opportunity to improve things for people,” he said.

Title: These Experts Have 6 Top Internet Stock Picks Lined Up for Next Year

Jefferies has some ideas about where tech investors should look after a tough stretch for the sector. Tech stocks took a hit last week, with cloud computing giant Oracle (ORCL) and chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) at the forefront after quarterly earnings that failed to impress investors amid growing skepticism around the AI trade. But Jefferies analysts told clients amid Thursday's selloff that they still see gains for some standouts in the sector, which they identified for their "peer-leading growth" and strong fundamentals. All but one of the stocks Jefferies highlighted have already seen big gains 2025, outperforming both the S&P 500 and industry peers. Here are the analysts' ideas. Worries about an AI bubble have rattled markets in recent months, weighing on the tech sector. Some tech stocks have fared better than others, leaving many investors wondering how to pick winners from a crowded field of stocks, many which have retreated from recent highs. One of Jefferies' top picks is adtech company AppLovin (APP). Though the stock's torrid rise was wracked by short-seller allegations of sketchy practices earlier this year, it has still more than doubled in value in 2025, reaching a fresh high near $725 last week. Jefferies said it sees more gains ahead, with AppLovin expected to make a change in the first half of 2026 that would dramatically expand its business by opening up access to its referral-based advertising platform to more customers. Even among Wall Street's biggest AppLovin bulls, few are quite as bullish as Jefferies, however, with a Street-high target of $860 suggesting nearly 30% upside from Friday's close. Reddit (RDDT), Spotify (SPOT) and Roku (ROKU), which have all added over a third of their value in 2025, were among Jefferies' top picks based on hopes that new features and user experience improvements could drive higher engagement and share prices. Jefferies has a $325 target for Reddit and $135 objective for Roku, suggesting gains of about 45% and 33%, respectively. The firm's $800 target for Spotify would point to a roughly 26% rise. All three levels exceed the consensus projections of analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha. Uber (UBER) and Zillow (Z) rounded out the group. Uber, which is up some 40% year-to-date, could climb another roughly 40%, to $120, said Jefferies, with gains from robotaxi partnerships, new delivery customers, and inroads with previously underrepresented demographic groups seen helping sustain its recent momentum. Zillow, which as of Friday was down some 17% from its September highs above $90 amid worries about ongoing legal challenges, competition, and a muted housing market, finished last week less than 1% higher from where it was when the year began—then fell further today. Jefferies said it sees a full recovery for the stock and more, with a $100 target as the real estate marketplace rolls out new tools and incentives for agents.

Title: After "gutting" its video game division, Amazon has sold one of its studios to Ubisoft

March of Giants rights also acquired. Following Amazon's decision to 'gut' its video game division in October as part of 14,000 job cuts across the company, Ubisoft has announced the acquisition of one of its studios - Amazon Games Montreal - which is currently working on MOBA March of Giants. As per Ubisoft's announcement, the acquisition includes the rights to March of Giants, and will see the Amazon Games Montreal team join the company. That includes former Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege creative director Xavier Marquis, who joined Amazon in 2021 after leaving Ubisoft two years prior. As to why Ubisoft wants March of Giants and its team, the company says the global MOBA games market is expected to "continue growing year over year for the rest of the decade, with total revenues roughly doubling by 2030" - and it believes its newly acquired title is "an innovative and differentiated project with the potential to offer something new to current MOBA fans, attract new audiences, and grow into a successful live competitive game." "March of Giants has a real opportunity to bring something fresh and dynamic to players, and to help Ubisoft compete in one of gaming's biggest arenas," Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot added in a statement. "We're looking forward to welcoming back Alexandre [Parizeau], Xavier, and many of the seasoned March of Giants team who have previously worked at Ubisoft, and the entire team's ambition, creativity and talent align perfectly with our desire to build bold new experiences for players. We look forward to supporting them as they shape the future of this promising new IP." Ubisoft notes the terms of its acquisition deal "are not being disclosed", but it does reveal the agreement includes Amazon's commitment to providing marketing support for March of Giants on Twitch. Amazon Games Montreal's sale follows radical changes to Amazon's video game strategy in October, when - according to Bloomberg - the company 'gutted' its games division as part of sweeping layoffs. At the time, Steven Boom (Amazon's vice president of Audio, Twitch, and Game) reportedly told employees the company had "made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work – specifically around MMOs", resulting in "significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team." In the aftermath of Amazon's announcement, it was confirmed ongoing work on its New World MMO would cease, and word emerged suggesting its Lord of the Rings MMO had also been canned.

By MICHELLE CHAPMAN, AP Business Writer Roomba maker iRobot has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, but says that it doesn’t expect any disruptions to devices as the more than 30-year-old company is taken private under a restructuring process. IRobot, which became well known for its robotic vacuums, has struggled of late, dealing with increased competition, layoffs and a declining stock price. In 2022 Amazon announced that it had agreed to buy iRobot for about $1.7 billion, but that deal was called off last year. Amazon blamed “undue and disproportionate regulatory hurdles” after the European Union signaled its objection to the transaction. Amazon said at the time that it would pay iRobot a previously agreed termination fee of $94 million and iRobot said that it would undergo a restructuring to help stabilize the company. iRobot said Sunday that it is now being acquired by Picea through a court-supervised process. Picea, or Shenzhen PICEA Robotics Co., Ltd., is iRobot’s primary contract manufacturer.. With facilities in China and Vietnam, Picea has built and sold more than 20 million robotic vacuum cleaners. “The transaction will strengthen our financial position and will help deliver continuity for our consumers, customers, and partners,” iRobot CEO Gary Cohen said in a statement. iRobot said it will continue to operate as normal during the Chapter 11 process and doesn’t expect any disruption to its app functionality, customer programs, global partners, supply chain relationships, or ongoing product support. The Bedford, Massachusetts-based anticipates completing the prepackaged chapter 11 process by February. In premarket trading, iRobot shares slid nearly 70% to $1.31.

Title: This Analyst Sees Nvidia at $8.5 Trillion Next Year. Is It Even Possible?

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © alengo / E+ via Getty Images Analyst price targets on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock were initially all over the place. The rally has continued for over 3 years, with both revenue still growing at breakneck speeds. Some analysts are now making bolder moves and are starting to coalesce near even more ambitious targets. The highest such recent price target projects NVDA stock at $352 next year. This implies a massive 101% leap from here and comes from Evercore ISI analyst Mark Lipacis. This analyst has an excellent history of making winning calls, with 69% of his ratings being successful, with an average return per rating of 28.3% over the past year. This is exceptionally good, and puts him at #32 out of over 10,000 tracked Wall Street analysts. Should you take this rating seriously? Let’s take a look. On November 20, Lipacis lifted his price target on NVDA stock from $261 to $352. He used the company’s inventory buildup “to support large orders” as his rationale for the price target increase. This may look counterintuitive at first, as a bigger inventory usually means products are not being sold. However, the rising inventory is viewed bullishly because Nvidia itself has said they’re building up to meet unprecedented AI compute demand, not excess supply. Their backlog for 2025 and 2026 is at $500 billion, with the company’s CFO saying that even this is tentative and could be an underestimate due to constant demand from hyperscalers. Lipacis believes revenue growth could accelerate to 79% by mid-2026. If this happens, Wall Street is likely to slap a higher premium on NVDA stock. The current forward price-earnings ratio of 23 times makes NVDA stock cheaper than Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) at 33 times and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) at 63 times. Nvidia’s competitors have failed to make ground. Many other AI chipmakers have cost-effective products, but they pale in comparison to what Nvidia has to offer. Nvidia essentially has the AI chip market locked inside its walled garden. It is very difficult and expensive for any major hyperscaler to switch from Nvidia’s CUDA ecosystem to another one. Nvidia has been making it even harder with the recent CUDA tiles update that will get developers even more hooked. Chinese AI startup DeepSeek tried training its upcoming model with Huawei’s AI chips but failed. It reportedly ended up reverting to Nvidia’s chips. This failure likely cost DeepSeek the momentum it built up earlier this year with its R1 model. Other AI companies are unlikely to start tinkering around with their AI chip suppliers at scale, since a failure that sets back a company just a few months could cost them dearly. All of this means that Nvidia is unlikely to give up its lead anytime soon. It’s going exceedingly well for Nvidia, but the rally won’t go on forever. Even if Nvidia has a large lead in the market, the ongoing “AI revolution” will dictate what happens to NVDA stock. If the buildout continues for years and years, Nvidia will climb along with it. That seems to be what Lipacis is betting on. At the same time, hyperscalers don’t have infinite cash to throw at AI chips. Companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are making headway with their own AI chips to use in-house and avoid the margins on Nvidia’s chips. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is not a hyperscaler, but the AI spending has already evaporated its net cash position, and it is now in net debt. Nvidia could either end up like IBM (NYSE:IBM) and trade sideways or Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), where it gives up almost all of its gains once this AI buildout ends. Only time will tell, so it’s still a good idea to keep around 10-15% of your portfolio in NVDA. If you are already at that level, I wouldn’t snap up more unless you get a bigger discount.

Title: Tomb Raider Devs Explain Why They’re Making Two Games At Once

Time Published: 2025-12-15T17:10:11Z
Full Content:
Tomb Raider CatalystTomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis At last weekâs Game Awards, Crystal Dynamics announced not one, but two Tomb Raider games. One is the next chapter in Lara Croftâs adventures, called Tomb Raider Catalyst; the other is a remake of the original game titled Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis. Both games are being published by Amazon Game Studios, the same company working on the Sophie Turner-led live-action series. All of this is in an effort to turn Lara into a multimedia superstar with multiple projects running under one roof. With Amazonâs known history of being terrible, fans are probably wondering how deeply its claws are stuck into the Tomb Raider series, and Crystal Dynamics has spoken a little bit about the partnership. In a group Q&A session that Kotaku was present for, Crystal Dynamics studio head Scot Amos and game director Will Kerslake spoke about Amazonâs role in both the upcoming Tomb Raider games and the show. Tomb Raider has been a cross-media franchise for decades, with the Angelina Jolie films being some of the earliest examples of a video game adaptation doing well at the box office, but now Amazon and Crystal Dynamics are trying to make something interconnected, though Crystal Dynamics wouldnât confirm if Catalyst would be tied to the upcoming series when it launches in 2027. âOur Amazon partners have been tremendous,â Amos said. âFrom the beginning, they’ve gotten the idea of this vision we have for this cross-media franchise that crossed both the live-action things during the series and the two games that we’re making right now, but we’re not here to talk about any details and anything else in the future about the TV series until later on.â As far as how deep this partnership goes, Amos said collaborating with Amazonâs own set of creative directors, narrative writers, and producers has been like speaking into a âmirrorâ as the two groups have worked together to pave the way for the future of the series as this multimedia franchise, and that the team is meeting with Amazon folks âdaily,â including on-site visits from Amazon to run through the latest development milestones. âOn the development side, we have partners across all the different disciplines that we work with directly,â Kerslake said. âSo as a member of the dev team, it’s been great to have collaborative partners focused on the quality of the game that trust the team to find the answers to those problems.â By the time Tomb Raider Catalyst launches in 2027, it will have been nine years since the last mainline Tomb Raider game. Shadow of the Tomb Raider launched in 2018 to good but not great reviews, though it did eventually go on to sell over 8.9 million copies. Since then, Tomb Raider has had a lot of re-releases of old games. Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis is coming out before Catalyst, and this isnât even the first time the original game has been remade, as Tomb Raider: Anniversary also brought that first adventure to modern audiences back in 2007. When asked if Catalyst might be taking longer to come out because Crystal Dynamics is putting more resources into the remake, Amos said “absolutely not,â that the remake had been planned for the franchiseâs 30th anniversary next year and is being handled by a different team than Catalyst. Shadow Warrior developer Flying Wild Hog is working on Legacy of Atlantis, but Amos says the team is still âconnectedâ to Crystal Dynamics and the broader Tomb Raider development team. âWe actually share technology, we share resources, we share assets, but we have one leadership team, a visionary team over top of that, that makes sure everything is on track, everything is within canon, everything makes sense in the various games and the storytelling,â Amos said. Amos said the partnership was made possible by the Fellowship Entertainment subsidiary of the Embracer Group, which is one of the many arms of the company that houses its too-goddamn-many IP like Tomb Raider and Lord of the Rings. Consolidation of media aside, Amos says this partnership has allowed both teams to fully dedicate their time to their respective games in parallel development without siphoning resources from one another. After years of Tomb Raider games looking back at Laraâs survivalist origins, Catalyst is finally moving the timeline forward, though the studio says it has designed Catalyst so players can jump in with “no homework required.” Dragon Age and Assassinâs Creed actor Alix Wilton Regan is voicing the treasure hunter now, and the way Crystal Dynamics describes the game makes it sound like itâs a new era for her and the series, so perhaps a new voice is another sign of that. However, Crystal Dynamics has also made clear that this isnât another reboot or a different timeline. This is the same Lara Croft fans have known and loved for decades, just in a âdifferent timeâ in her life. So perhaps itâs not a bad time to revisit the original game and its more traditional action-adventure roots before finally nudging Lara forward after a decade of survivalist prequels.Â Crystal Dynamics has been put through the wringer over the past few years ever since Square Enix sold it off to Embracer Group, with layoffs happening as recently as last month. Itâs a damn shame those affected workers wonât be around to bring Catalyst past the finish line, but hopefully the end result is able to shine through all that inner turmoil when it launches in 2027.

Title: Microsoft shares slide 5% in just two weeks, as Google leapfrogs the firm into third place by market cap — and yes, it's all to do with AI

Microsoft’s stumble is Google’s opening. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Microsoft's share price took a battering over the past couple of weeks, what's going on? Yesterday, someone linked me an AI-generated article alleging that Xbox's near-total absence from The Game Awards was to blame for a multi-billion decreases in its stock price. It was a cute idea, but simply not based in reality. Microsoft's share price has slid around 7% in the past month, although it's still up 5% for the year in total, and up over 120% across the past five years. One of the big success stories for CEO Satya Nadella has been a reignition of Microsoft's stock market performance, but the stock is behaving a little odd over the past few weeks. No, investors do not care that Xbox wasn't present at The Game Awards, especially not to the tune of over $170 billion in lost market capitalization — likely worth more than all of Xbox itself. Microsoft's share price has slid owing to a conflux of various AI-related reasons, both directly and indirectly, as investors get nervous about Microsoft's position. Microsoft's stock price slide is a combination of various factors, all directly and indirectly related to its position in artificial intelligence. AI is driving the stock market right now, with companies like NVIDIA, Meta, and Oracle all dominating the space. Microsoft's own position, partnered with OpenAI, helped drive the firm to second place for global market capitalization, behind only NVIDIA. NVIDIA's server tech is powering everything from cloud compute to AI workloads right now, and companies like Microsoft and Amazon are re-selling NVIDIA GPUs and other products so firms can build out their own AI aspirations. Microsoft isn't really an innovator in the AI space, relying on OpenAI's models to deliver its products. One big fear investors have lately revolves around whether the frenzy to deliver AI will actually produce a return on investment. Companies like Oracle and Broadcom have seen large stock market slides recently, after their earnings and forecasts thoroughly underwhelmed Wall Street. Broadcom dropped by 11% — driven by the disappointment over its purported "backlog" of $73 billion worth of compute orders. Broadcom, Oracle, OpenAI, and various other companies have been relying on "commitments to buy" lately, but have been unable to actually deliver compute owing to a variety of issues. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. There are huge and increasing demands for computing power from various AI companies, particularly those that rely on NVIDIA's stack. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently warned in an interview that he has GPUs sitting on the shelf because the electricity physically isn't available yet. The United States power grid literally can't meet demand for the hyperscalers, which is spooking investors into thinking we might have hit an upper limit in the near term for how fast server infrastructure brokers can grow. Companies like Microsoft and Google have been aggressively researching efficiency to offset some of these bottle necks. OpenAI has also increased the efficiency of its models in a universe where compute isn't scaling fast enough to meet demand, but investors seem concerned that the business models associated with AI might never produce a return on investment. Broadcom and Oracle both spooked investors with capital expenditure warnings, as firms race to meet the computational needs of companies like OpenAI and Anthropic. Oracle, which has become an AI-first company all up in recent years, missed both revenue and profit projections, and warned that its capex burn would be 2026 would be $15 billion higher than its prior projections. It also reported negative cash flow, as its AI business fails to actually generate tangible profits. Investors rewarded them with a sharp sell-off to the tune of around 11%. Microsoft's diversified business insulates it to some degree from these types of spikes, but not completely. Investors are increasing re-evaluating AI infrastructure spend, as valuations spiral out of control that seems incongruent with reality. For Microsoft in particular, the fact Google Gemini's latest Pro models beat OpenAI's in most, if not all benchmarks, increasingly paints Alphabet as a frontrunner. Google also controls more of the tech stack, with home-grown Tensor server infrastructure, eliminating some of the costs associated with working with companies like NVIDIA. Microsoft has also reportedly cut internal goals and forecasts, as consumers and companies alike seem unwilling to spend money on its AI products. There's other factors at play, too. State attorney generals in the United States sent Microsoft and other AI players a letter, warning them to fix "delusional" hallucinations and sycophancy, after a string of high-profile "AI psychosis" cases where the tech fed dangerous ideations to vulnerable people. Regulation protects people (at least in theory), but is often thought to harm profitability (oh no!). It's easy to clown on Microsoft Copilot. Its lacklustre features in Notepad, MS Paint, Microsoft Photos, and other Microsoft products just screams of haphazardry and poor execution. The firm doesn't seem to know what role AI could, or should play within Windows 11 consumer-grade features and products, despite desires to turn Windows 12 into an agentic AI-first OS (much to the annoyance of users). Where Copilot is winning seems to be within enterprise grade solutions. Creating regulatory-compliant AI solutions for law firms and financial service institutions seems to be forming a winning solution for Microsoft, where centralized and IT-monitored solutions shine for companies that are already embedded in Microsoft Azure. Github Copilot has also been something of a success story too, offering programmers a more accessible alternative to Anthropic's Claude. Increasingly, though, investors think Google might emerge as the front runner for the tech and its implementation. Slow out of the gate, Google's early AI efforts simply served to hurt its own search engine dominance and make a mockery out of itself with notorious summary hallucinations and errors. A couple of years later, Google Gemini Pro and Nano Banana image generation tools are now largely superior to OpenAI, evaporating Microsoft's early advantages in a single month. Google has now leapfrogged Microsoft in market capitalization value, as of writing, slipping up into third place, as Microsoft sinks to fourth. Apple has ironically strengthened its position by ditching its laughable home-grown AI attempts, and opting to leverage Google's instead for its own Siri "Copilot" assistant and other AI features. Microsoft's own solutions have effectively been squeezed out of phones, potentially forever. Microsoft, without a phone platform to call its own, is once again forced to rely entirely on Windows and enterprise to push its own AI products. Windows remains a dominant fixture in computing, but hate of Windows 11 has gone fully mainstream. More and more companies and even governments are embracing open source solutions, Linux, and other alternatives over Microsoft's own. Apple and Google have effectively locked Microsoft out of mobile computing entirely, flanked by CEO Satya Nadella's short-sighted decision to stop investing in Windows Phone. A ~5% slide isn't anything too shocking, but like Time Magazine's snub of Microsoft — it's symbolic of changing winds on the frontiers of AI. Microsoft dominated the conversation for the past two years, but once again, its old rival Google seems poised to take pole position.

Title: Reviewing My Wishes for 2026

Full Content:
Here we are at the far end of 2025 and everything is both better and worse than I expected. The Year was 2025… and I was not prepared On the bad side of the ledger… I cannot even start to sum up what a disaster 2025 has been for the US. This is some real “end of the Roman republic” shit and everybody in power is just grabbing stuff for themselves, with naked corruption on display and nobody cares. Absolutely unprecedented criminal activity in plain sight by Republicans, who have decided the law doesn’t apply to them. This stuff only ends in dictatorship and we’re not even going to get an Augustus at this point, having gone straight to Nero with dementia and everybody has to donate to his causes and give him fake awards to in order to conduct business in the US. And it is all going to get worse as he ages and the corruption becomes a huge drag on the economy. Then the AI bubble is going to collapse, and then the real problems will start when CEOs don’t get their bonuses and start laying off even more people. So there is all that. On the bright side, personally, I still have a job, healthcare, and a home. We’re not struggling. Day to day things are still “normal.” Granted, we’re not buying anything either as the price of everything, from beef to blueberries, is going up and dinner for two at even a modest restaurant goes past $100 if we order a cocktail. But that Costco whole roasted chicken is still a deal. Anyway, I knew it was going to be bad so rather than doing predictions at the start of the year, I altered my annual tradition, wherein I feel obligated to foresee how things might go bad, and chose to go with a hopeful set of wishes. For those interested in the history of this routine, I have links! Of course I do! Now here we are in the back half of the last month of the year and it is time to do the accounting, to credit the universe for the wishes it granted and grumble about those it denied. For purposes of measurement, wishes have the usual 10 point value, with partial credit available for partial fulfillment, unless otherwise indicated in the wish. Are we ready? Let’s do this. 1 – An End to Video Game Industry Consolidation and Mass Layoffs Hah hah hah… no. Phil Spencer won’t be sufficiently motivated unless he gets an obscene bonus, which meant laying people off at XBox and elsewhere. I don’t know what he’ll do when he runs out of staff to lay off, but we’re getting closer to finding out. Zero points. 2 – News about the next EverQuest title EG7/Daybreak threw the idea out there of a new EverQuest title back in late 2023… and I know some of us would like to hear a bit more about it. Hah hah hah… no. In fact, things seems to be going in the opposite direction for Daybreak and EG7. Capital management firms want more stock buybacks and more dividend payments. There will be no investment in the future. Zero points. 3 – Happy Annual Expansions at Daybreak Easy one here, a gimme for the universe. Just do the usual Q4 expansions for EQ, EQII, LOTRO, and whatever. Does Palia get an annual update now too? I don’t know. But just carry on. Okay, this was a gimme for 2025. I am not so sure it will be for 2026 though. 10 points. 4 – LOTRO to do Something to Improve Large Monitor Access Haha, I know. I fully expect this wish to go completely unfulfilled, this is me hoping against hope, but there it is. I didn’t even believe this back in January, so no surprises here with zero points. It is only disappointing because ArenaNet managed to do something for original Guild Wars. Hell, they added controller support. 5 – Commit To or Let Go Of H1Z1 I know they have talked about a new H1Z1 title. That was supposed to be in pre-production in the first half of 2024, which means we should have heard some new by now… and we haven’t. Again, wish denied. EG7 keeps hyping H1Z1 as an important first party title in its financials, but has done nothing with it. Zero points. 6 – Blizzard to not Mess Up WoW Housing We won’t actually GET housing in 2025. We know that from the roadmap. But they should be able to give us a substantial view into what they are planning. So that view plus “doesn’t obviously suck” is the bar here. I mean, we are technically getting housing in 2025. It showed up last week. But I couldn’t tell you if they messed it up. The previews got some shade from people with no investment in the game while the current fan boys have declared it to be everything anybody could ever want plus a bag of chips. Still, if the fans aren’t revolting, Works for the true believers even if the non-invested seem less than impressed, so I guess they didn’t mess up completely. Give me… erm, the universe… 6 points on this one while the jury is still out in the long term. 7 – WoW Classic Progression to Pick Up the Pace Hah hah hah… no. Blizz seems to be actively sabotaging WoW Classic at this point. Expansions running way too long, modern features being shoehorned into old content, and the heavy hands of monetization are all weighing on the experience. I am expecting somebody in Blizz leadership to revive the J. Allen Brack quote about thinking you want classic and declare that he was right all along… or announce a new version of vanilla with Dungeon Finder, achievements, WoW Tokens, and a cash shop. Anyway, zero points here. 8 – Blizz to use all that talent and all those resources to make something new Fuck no. That might impact Phil Spencer’s bonus. And I thought Bobby Kotick was bad, but he at least found space in the budget for some new titles. Zero points. 9 – Valheim to Exit Early Access Nope. Still three devs in a yurt grinding out code on stone tablets. Zero points. 10 – Light No Fire to go Early Access Now I am just going start getting angry. This isn’t even a real project. Zero points, though I feel like it should get negative points for being such a psych. 11 – No Man’s Sky to just keep on keeping on Sure, at least Sean Murray and crew are still working on that. Corvettes were awesome. 10 points. 12 – Dune Awakening to have Learned from Conan Exiles Not really. It will be a few years before it is playable and they figure out people don’t like to be ganked by ornothoptors or whatever all day long. Still, it runs. Maybe 4 points. 13 – GoG.com to Continue Thriving It seemed to do well for most of the year. Then Amazon decided to stop supporting third party platforms to favor their own Luna AI offerings. Still, for most of the year GoG.com was doing well. Call it 8 points. 14 – CCP to Finally Do What they Know They Need to do to Fix the New Eden Economy No. They either don’t know or cannot admit as much. Things are “better” but how much was them just cranking the dials at random until some metric went up? The price of PLEX is down 25% since its 2025 peak. Good for buyers, but bad for sellers. I’ll give the universe 4 points for at least the Mineral Price Index going down finally, though does that mean they fixed something or that there is some other problem? 15 – CCP to Succeed at Something Besides EVE Online Nope. Zero points. Next. 16 – CCP to Make a Co-op Space Survival Title Hah hah hah… no. They either want a late 90s FPS or a blockchain scam title. Nothing people will pay to play for fun. Zero points. 17 – CCP to make the New Eden Strategy Game I Want Wasted a wish on that as well. Zero points. 18 – Andrew Groen to get Empires of EVE vol. III Done I should just lay off New Eden. Burnout and ill health has put a damper on progress. Zero points. 19 – Some Actual War in New Eden Mein Gott, enough already. I mean, we did get a few minutes of war. PanFam did occasionally fight back as we rolled east and up to their boarder… then the core of the coalition, Pandemic Horde, collapsed and ran away and eventually folded into The Initiative, so we spent a few weeks blowing up structures unopposed, random hero structure gunners not forgotten. While that is an element of many wars in New Eden, that wasn’t the was we wanted. Call it 3 points, one for each Keepstar they at least tried to defend. 20 – Some Solid Guild Wars 3 News Yeah no… the money was on the original Guild Wars being remastered I guess. Who knew? Zero points. 21 – Enshrouded to Keep on their Roll Yes, this seems to be going well. It is a little rough at every major update, but it gets worked out, and there is a 1.0 target for next spring. 10 points. 22 – Keep Extending Stars Reach I want to be charitable and say yes, it did expand. But it still feels years away from any vision Raph was spinning back when he was going on about design pillars. I am sure the underlying code has improved, but the actual play tests feel like they did a year back, just with more restrictions. My fault for having expectations and expecting more from the universe when it grants wishes. Call it 5 points. 23 – Pokemon Go to level 60 Do I get triple points because it went to level 80? I am going to dissect the essence of this wish, which was for a 10 level raise in the level cap. And, sure enough, everybody who was level 50 went straight to level 70, leaving them 10 more levels to work on. It kind of worked out if you squint at it real hard. I am claiming 10 points for the universe on this one. 24 – That Pokemon Black & White Remake Nope. Zero points. 25 – Hope for the Hermit Kingdom Unchained I would like to see Unchained Entertainment… once City State Entertainment, but there was a name change due to unstated reasons… shit or get off the pot when it comes to Camelot Unchained. Mark Jacobs and his team have been running a propaganda mill about how wonderful things are and how much progress there has been for a decade now, to the point that I don’t think comparisons with the North Korean Central News Agency are unjust. The cut off date for wishes is December 15. Zero points. Hardly a surprise this failed to pan out given the Mark Jacobs track record for the last 20 years. 26 – Civilization VII to Not Be a Bloated Train Wreck It became a live service, game pass, drip updates, buy the new shiny of the month style of game to rival even the most annoying Paradox title. It made a splash for a month or two then disappeared from sight. 2 points for the effort. 27 – Grand Theft Auto VI Launch Hah, no! Zero points. See you next year! 28 – Fantastic Pixel Castle Early Access Reveal Nope, Fantastic Pixel Castle shut down revealed instead. Zero points. 29 – Wild Card Indie Success Wish For measuring this I will look at the indie bracket nominations of The Game Awards for 2025 and will consider this granted if at least one of the nominated studios was completely unknown to me and yet I recognize the game nominated and has some headlines about its amazing success or something. This was helped along by Fantasy Critic League for sure. Anyway, there are two, Hollow Knight: Silksong and Blue Prince that meet the criteria. So 10 points for that. 30 – Half-Life 3 Announced for Real What was I even thinking? Gabe isn’t buying mega yachts off of developing games, just on taxing developers selling games on his platform. This guy might be the least worst rich gaming CEO or executive, and he is still fucking miserable. Half Life 3 will never happen. Zero points. But what if he is just holding it back as a launch title for the GabeCube? Better draft it in FCL again this year, just in case! Summing Up So, if all wishes had been granted, it would have been worth 300 points, there being 30 wishes and 10 points a piece. Unless my ability to count is seriously impaired, three passes down the list all came up with 82 points scored. That gives the universe about a 27% wish fulfillment rate, counting partials. The universe is about on par with my average year’s ability to guess. So it goes. This was my 18th round of guesses over the life of the blog. Time to get ready for the 19th. For 2026 it will be all predictions. Then maybe I for the 20th can sum up how well I have done over the years in total, maybe pulling out my most unlikely guesses that came true… though that sounds like work. We’ll see. Anyway, look for the next round showing up at a January 1st 2026 near you! Gaming (or maybe just my relationship with it) was weird this year. On the one hand, I played a ton of games I really enjoyed, so I can’t fairly say it was a ‘bad’ year. On the other hand, I played mostly the same games this year that I did last year (League of Legends, TableTopSim for 40k, Rimworld), with some ‘new’ games like FFT:remaster in the mix. The list of truly new games released that I thought were awesome? Pretty short. LikeLike For the record, I think a better bet next year would be that Microsoft would pawn XBox off to some Private Equity Firm ™, which means that all of those game studios will implode within 4-5 years. Fallout, Elder Scrolls, and WoW won’t save Bethesda and Blizzard from a potential bad end, since the PE Firm will only want Call of Duty and mobile games. This was helped along by Fantasy Critic League for sure. Anyway, there are two, Hollow Knight: Silksong and Blue Prince that meet the criteria. So 10 points for that. Would Clair Obscure count as well? LikeLike Oh, but why sell it off when you could force AI into everything to help justify setting billions of dollars on fire on that front? Plenty of options on the table. And yes, I CO33 would count as well. I wrote most of this before the game awards so that wasn’t front and center in my mind having won all the awards. LikeLike I know it’s after the cut-off, but apparently LOTRO just announced that UI scaling is coming with its next patch. (Saw someone posting about it on Bluesky.) LikeLike I’ll be interested to see what they have. They acknowledged scaling as an issue back in 2016 and have talked about it off and on, but they have not delivered much on that front. LikeLike Regarding #12 – I can‘t comment on anything Conan Exiles related as I haven‘t played that, but Dune is very much „playable“ right now. Even if you‘re a lot quicker than I was to reach the deep desert you‘ll still have at least 50 hours of well designed, awesome (in my opinion, obviously) content ahead of you until there‘s even a chance of running into any griefing-related problems. Personally, I got over 200 very enjoyable hours out of the game. No sign of griefing during any of them, btw. LikeLike I will admit that I only read the patch notes at this point, and they read a lot like early Conan Exiles update, which at least confirmed my “they never learn” take. I plan to play at some point, but the group is currently off on another side adventure. LikeLike Whatever LoTRO has coming it’s already on the test server. According to Reddit, it works pretty well. That will teach you to give up on your wishes too soon! Maybe the game industry will correct itself and start treating their employees well in the next two weeks ;-) LikeLiked by 1 person Hey man, the rule is always December 15th or bust.

Investing Shares of Dollar General are up another $3.80 a share in premarket. All as it continues to gap higher on strong earnings and a dividend. Sending You to Google News in 3 © ESB Professional / Shutterstock.com Shares of Dollar General (NYSE: DG) are up another $3.80 a share in premarket. All as it continues to gap higher on strong earnings and a dividend. Not only did the company just declare a 59-cent dividend (payable on January 20 to shareholders of record as of January 6), it also just earned a profit of $1.28, up 44% year over year, and 35 cents better than expected. Sales of $10.65 billion, up 4.6% year over year, beat estimates by $50 million. For fiscal year 2025, DG expects to see net sales increase by 4.7% to 4.9%, which is up from an earlier range of 4.3% to 4.8%. That translates into sales of $42.52 billion to $42.6 billion, which is above estimates of $42.49 billion. Same store sales growth is now seen jumping 2.5% to 2.7%, which is up from 2.1% to 2.6%. Fueling upside, analysts at JPMorgan just upgraded the DG stock to an overweight rating with a price target of $66. The firm is bullish on store remodels, stocking, and chain improvements. Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) are up about $5 a share in premarket. That’s after tacking on $12.09 a share on Friday. According to analysts at Barclays, vehicle deliveries are losing importance, as noted by Teslarati.com. “Even CEO Elon Musk has implied at times that the automotive side, as a whole, will only make up a small percentage of Tesla’s total valuation, as Optimus and AI begin to shine with importance,” they added. In fact, according to a Musk note on X.com, “Almost all of Tesla’s value long-term will be from AI & robots, both vehicle & humanoid…” Barclays has an equal weight holding on TSLA with a price target of $350 a share. Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) took a massive hit late last week, falling $46.44 on Friday. All after management warned of margin pressures. However, this morning, the stock is slowly regaining lost ground, gaining $3 in premarket. Helping, analysts at Morgan Stanley still expect AVGO to see strong growth moving forward. With an overweight rating on AVGO, Morgan Stanley has a $462 price target on AVGO. They also believe the latest pullback is an overreaction. Analysts at Bank of America have a $500 price target with a buy rating. Goldman Sachs has a $450 price target with a buy rating. UBS has a $472 price target with a buy rating. And Bernstein has a $475 price target with an outperform rating. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Chaay_Tee / iStock via Getty Images Futures are trading higher on Monday as we head into the final trading weeks of 2025. All of the major indices were hit hard on Friday as investors began a big rotation last week out of the AI stocks that have led the market higher since ChatGPT was introduced over three years ago. The miss by Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL) seems like the final straw for many, as the Magnificent 7 have started to wobble in 2025, with only NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) beating the S&P 500 this year. The NASDAQ took the biggest hit on Friday, closing down a whopping 1.69% at 23,195. The Dow Jones Industrials, which had been having a solid week until Friday, closed at 48,458, down 0.51%, while the S&P 500 was last seen at 6827, down 1.07%. Investors can likely expect more volatility as we head to the end of the year, and trading volume starts to fade. Yields were mixed across the Treasury curve on Friday, with investors buying some of the shorter maturities while sellers were active in the mid-to long-dated bonds. Traders pointed to a steeper curve as the market reacted to the Fed’s rate cut decision and digested economic data signaling a strong labor market, pushing yields higher despite expectations of future rate cuts. The 30-year long bond closed trading on Friday at 4.85% while the benchmark 10-year note was last seen at 4.19%. Prices were lower across the energy complex on Friday, primarily due to ongoing concerns about a global oil and gas supply surplus, a broad market sell-off driven by anxiety over the artificial intelligence (AI) sector, and rising U.S. Treasury yields. Both major benchmarks were lower on the day, with Brent Crude falling 0.26% to finish at $61.12, while West Texas Intermediate closed at $57.44, down 0.28%. Despite yet another Canadian polar vortex dropping temperatures over much of the United States, Natural gas closed at $4.11 down 2.79% after recently trading as high as $5. Gold was once again the winner on Friday, closing at $4,298, continuing a run that has been one of the top stories for 2025. The bullion continued its strong move, primarily due to expectations of more U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cuts in 2026, which makes non-yielding gold more attractive. Add persistent geopolitical risks and a weaker dollar, even as the Fed’s rate-hiking cycle paused, amid data showing cooling labor markets. Traders are pricing in more rate cuts for 2026, and a dovish Fed outlook, alongside safe-haven demand, continues to support gold and silver prices. Cryptocurrency trading on Friday saw Bitcoin (BTC) bounce back above $92,000 after initial dips, influenced by the Federal Reserve’s rate cuts as traders absorbed the potential for a loosened monetary policy in 2026, while Ethereum (ETH) also posted gains. However, the market displayed mixed signals and indecision between bullish potential and lingering overhead resistance. The gains were surrendered over the weekend, and as of 8 am EST on Monday, Bitcoin was quoted at $89,530. Ethereum was trading at $3,141. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders.

Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. Lyme disease (LD) remains the most prevalent vector-borne disease in the Northern Hemisphere, with over 100,000 cases reported annually in Europe, and ~476,000 in the United States [1,2]. Although LD can be treated with antibiotics, if detected early, there is currently no licensed vaccine available for humans to prevent infection. One of the key challenges in developing an effective vaccine against LD stems from the complex biology of Borrelia outer surface proteins (Osps), whose expression is dynamically regulated in response to distinct environmental cues, in both the arthropod vector and vertebrate host (Fig 1). Among the predominant outer surface proteins, OspC expression is induced in ticks during Borrelia transmission, and is sustained during early mammalian host infection, while the expression of OspA is restricted only to the tick phase [3] and is no longer expressed in Borrelia once the infection is established in the mammalian host [4]. As a result, infected humans only rarely develop anti-OspA antibodies [5]. Yet, OspA has proven to be a highly effective vaccine antigen, as it induces antibodies that bind to Borrelia within attached ticks, preventing their transmission [6]. As a new human LD vaccine candidate targeting OspA (VLA15, see below) enters Phase 3 trials, a central challenge is not only achieving protection but also sustaining it, given that its effectiveness strongly depends on maintaining high antibody titres. Serology monitoring tools may thus become an integral component of the vaccination programme, not only to distinguish between infection- and vaccine-induced antibodies, but also to track protective antibody titres over time, thereby ensuring sustained vaccine-induced immunity. During tick feeding, Borrelia alters the expression of its outer surface proteins [4] in response to environmental cues. OspA (yellow) is highly expressed in the midgut of unfed ticks, where it is thought to mediate adherence to the midgut epithelium. As the tick begins feeding, OspA is downregulated, while OspC (orange) is upregulated to facilitate early mammalian invasion. During systemic infection in the vertebrate host, CspZ (blue) becomes expressed and promotes complement evasion through Factor H binding. Insets: Scheme of the Borrelia outer membrane showing lipoprotein anchoring via a triacylated N-terminal cysteine. The proteins depicted as stylised cartoons were derived from OspA: UniProt = P0CL66; Alphafold = AF-P0CL66-F1-v4; OspC (dimer): UniProt = Q07337; Alphafold = AF-Q07337-F1-v4; CspZ: UniProt = O50665; Alphafold = AF-O50665-F1-v4.

The vaccine OspA antigen sequence was derived from North American B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strains, offering limited coverage of the diverse Borrelia genospecies that cause LD in Europe (e.g., B. afzelii, B. garinii). The vaccine was later withdrawn from the market in 2002 due to public concerns and limited uptake, despite clinical validation of its safety and effectiveness [7]. These concerns arose mainly due to a potential autoimmune reaction: a segment of B. burgdorferi OspA shares sequence homology with human leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (hLFA-1) within the OspA C-terminus, raising a molecular mimicry hypothesis for treatment-resistant Lyme arthritis in people carrying the HLA-DR4 antigen [8]. The second-generation LD vaccine candidate (VLA15) directly addresses both issues: it provides a broad genospecies coverage and eliminates concerns about autoimmunity. VLA15, co-developed by Valneva and Pfizer, is a multivalent subunit vaccine candidate designed to provide broad protection against LD by targeting six OspA serotypes (serotypes 1–6). These serotypes represent the major Borrelia genospecies, causing human infection across North America and Europe [9]. To achieve broad serotype coverage, VLA15 incorporates three recombinant fusion proteins, each composed of the C-terminal OspA domains from two serotypes: serotypes 1 and 2, serotypes 3 and 4, and serotypes 5 and 6 (Fig 2). The domains within each fusion protein are connected by a 21-amino acid linker derived from two segments of the N-terminal region of OspA serotype 1 (Fig 2). Additionally, the OspA antigens in VLA15 have been optimised by introducing a single disulfide bond into every subunit to enhance structural stability. OspA proteins are natively lipidated at an N-terminal cysteine, tethering them to the plasma membrane of the spirochete [10]. In vaccine formulations, retaining this lipidation markedly enhanced immunogenicity and protective efficacy [11]. To enable this lipidation at the N-terminus of the mutant OspA C-terminal fragment heterodimers, a lipidation signal sequence derived from the Escherichia coli major outer membrane lipoprotein (Lpp) was introduced at their N-terminus and immediately followed C-terminally by a CSS peptide (patent publication number: WO2014006226A1). This provides the N-terminal cysteine for lipidation after signal peptide cleavage. Lastly, the hLFA-1-like fragment in OspA serotype 1 was replaced by the corresponding region from OspA serotype 2 (summarised in [12]). These designs create recombinant fusion proteins that are structurally distinct from native OspA yet retain immunological characteristics critical for vaccine effectiveness. The map (top panel) highlights the geographic distribution of the predominant Borrelia species associated with human Lyme disease across regions: B. burgdorferi sensu stricto in North America, and B. afzelii, B. garinii, B. bavariensis and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto in Europe and Asia. These species correspond to six predominant OspA serotypes (1–6), which underpin the multivalent OspA vaccine design and enable broad coverage across the dominant, geographically diverse Borrelia genospecies. The distribution map is based on the CDC’s Lyme Disease Case Map (June 2025) and LD surveillance data from Canada [32], overlayed on a base map sourced from naturalearthdata.com. The schematic (bottom panel) illustrates the VLA15 vaccine composition, which includes OspA C-terminal domains from serotypes 1–6 connected, via a 21-amino acid linker, which is derived by merging two loop regions of the N-terminal domain from serotype 1 (residues 65-GTSDKNNGSG-74 and 43-SKEKNKDGKYS-53, in which residue D53 has been mutated to S). Each subunit contains an introduced disulfide bond to increase stability. To avoid hLFA-1 mimicry, the serotype 1 hLFA-1-like epitope was replaced with the corresponding serotype 2 sequence. The map (top panel) highlights the geographic distribution of the predominant Borrelia species associated with human Lyme disease across regions: B. burgdorferi sensu stricto in North America, and B. afzelii, B. garinii, B. bavariensis and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto in Europe and Asia.

Vaccine-induced anti-OspA antibodies from the human host would then be drained by attached ticks, as part of their blood meal, would bind its cognate antigen, neutralising Borrelia during tick feeding, and ultimately block transmission of Borrelia to humans [13]. This comes with a principal limitation of lacking an anamnestic response, leaving host immunity almost entirely dependent on sustained antibody titres rather than memory responses. The fact is also that OspA is not essential during mammalian infection [14]. In order for the vaccine to be effective, it must thus act with near-perfect efficiency at high-titre levels to sustain its capacity to neutralise spirochetes during tick feeding. If spirochetes escape neutralisation in the tick and enter the vertebrate host, OspA is downregulated and is no longer displayed on the Borrelia surface, leaving vaccine-induced anti-OspA antibodies without a target and making protection unlikely at that stage. This property also precludes the vaccine’s use for post-exposure prophylaxis or therapeutic intervention. Based on the LYMErix Phase 3 trial, the CDC concluded that an anti-OspA (LA-2 antigen) antibody titre greater than 1,200 ELISA units/mL was correlated with 1-year protection against B. burgdorferi sensu stricto infection in the United States [15]. The breakthrough infections that occurred were mainly associated with individuals with lower titres, identifying antibody concentration as the principal correlate of vaccine efficacy. For the multivalent VLA15 vaccine (VALOR Phase 3, NCT05477524), which targets six OspA C-terminal domains, protective thresholds have not yet been defined. Because VLA15 covers multiple Borrelia species rather than a single U.S. strain covered by LYMErix, protective levels may need to be determined for each OspA serotype or at least for the dominant one. Notably, anti-OspA antibody levels after VLA15 vaccination decline substantially within months, particularly in elderly individuals, who often generate lower and shorter-lived titres [16,17]. In Europe, where Borrelia isolates causing breakthrough infections are rarely genotyped, such thresholds will require further refinement. Establishing serotype-specific minimal protective titres could improve serology-guided booster scheduling and support data-driven vaccine optimisation. The fact that VLA15 includes only the C-termini of OspA proteins, and that anti-OspA-antibodies are rare in sera as a response to LD infection [18], allows tracking levels of vaccine-induced antibodies. Even though the whole OspA protein is immunogenic and can, in rare cases, be exposed during infection to host immunity, hallmarking, e.g., prolonged arthritis [19], the presence of anti-OspA IgG antibodies in sera will be mostly indicative of vaccine-induced antibodies in vaccinated individuals. We recommend revising current diagnostic antigen sets, which typically contain full-length OspA (frequently derived from multiple Borrelia strains in Europe), to instead include distinct N- and C-terminal fragments of OspA (Fig 3). Such antigenic microchip, for example, would contain: (1) established antigens to flag past or present LD [20], (2) the N-terminus of OspA to detect the rare anti-OspA responses observed in prolonged episodes of LD (thereby identifying individuals for whom OspA-based vaccination should not be recommended), and (3) the C-terminus of OspA that would monitor the presence of vaccine-induced antibodies for people with negative N-terminus OspA immunodetection (Fig 3). For quantitative readouts, titration of OspA C-termini would allow tracking of post-vaccination levels of antibodies (Fig 3). Once validated correlates of protection are established, this approach could guide seasonal vaccine strategies and ensure protection during peak tick activity. A) During mammalian infection, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) expresses surface proteins that elicit a specific humoral immune response. Commonly targeted antigens include VlsE, OspC, and flagellin (p41), whereas antibodies against OspA are rarely detected (≤15% of cases). B) The VLA15 vaccine is composed only of the C-termini of OspA of 6 B. burgdorferi s.l. serotypes. C) The current standard two-tier testing for LD typically combines an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) using a mixture of selected antigens or a single-antigen (e.g., VlsE) with a confirmatory strip-blot assay detecting IgG and IgM antibodies against multiple Borrelia antigens. D) These strip blots often contain full-length OspA antigens, which will also detect antibodies in vaccinated individuals following VLA15 implementation. E) Diagnostic immunostrips can be multiplexed using microchip-based technologies, which can provide more targeted and detailed information by distinguishing infection-induced from vaccine-induced antibody responses. Provided a vaccinated person is sero-negative (grey) for acute (e.g., VlsE) or prolonged LD (N-terminal OspA) infection, such individual will be possibly eligible for VLA15 vaccination. These technologies can also enable quantitative, time-resolved tracking of vaccine-induced antibody levels (C-terminal OspA, yellow). Signal intensity will either indicate the anticipated protective level or significant waning of vaccine induced antibody titres, indicating a call for a vaccine booster. Inclusion of acute infection antigens (e.g., VlsE) in these multiplex immunoassays will also allow to detect breakthrough infections. The correlation between circulating antibody levels and the occurrence of LD infections will help define the precise threshold of protective immunity. A) During mammalian infection, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) expresses surface proteins that elicit a specific humoral immune response. Commonly targeted antigens include VlsE, OspC, and flagellin (p41), whereas antibodies against OspA are rarely detected (≤15% of cases). B) The VLA15 vaccine is composed only of the C-termini of OspA of 6 B. burgdorferi s.l. serotypes. C) The current standard two-tier testing for LD typically combines an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) using a mixture of selected antigens or a single-antigen (e.g., VlsE) with a confirmatory strip-blot assay detecting IgG and IgM antibodies against multiple Borrelia antigens. D) These strip blots often contain full-length OspA antigens, which will also detect antibodies in vaccinated individuals following VLA15 implementation. E) Diagnostic immunostrips can be multiplexed using microchip-based technologies, which can provide more targeted and detailed information by distinguishing infection-induced from vaccine-induced antibody responses. Provided a vaccinated person is sero-negative (grey) for acute (e.g., VlsE) or prolonged LD (N-terminal OspA) infection, such individual will be possibly eligible for VLA15 vaccination. These technologies can also enable quantitative, time-resolved tracking of vaccine-induced antibody levels (C-terminal OspA, yellow). Signal intensity will either indicate the anticipated protective level or significant waning of vaccine induced antibody titres, indicating a call for a vaccine booster. Inclusion of acute infection antigens (e.g., VlsE) in these multiplex immunoassays will also allow to detect breakthrough infections. The correlation between circulating antibody levels and the occurrence of LD infections will help define the precise threshold of protective immunity. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1013747.g003 This opportunity currently applies only to the VLA15 vaccine. The mRNA vaccines mRNA-1975 and mRNA-1982 developed by ModernaTX, Inc. (ClinicalTrials.gov: ID NCT05975099), code for full-length proteins (WO2024215721A1) that will prevent any potential opportunity for differentiation of vaccine-induced and rare infection-induced anti-OspA IgG antibodies in the sera. It is important to realise that with the introduction of the OspA-based VLA15 vaccine, modified two-tier testing (MTTT) currently using whole cell lysate [21] will also become susceptible to vaccine-induced seroreactivity in uninfected patients. Therefore, platforms with informative single-antigens [22] or single-epitopes [23,24] may offer a more practical tool, with detailed precision, for the diagnosis of infections and determination of vaccine titres. Many Borrelia infections in endemic regions remain subclinical and untreated, resulting in seropositive individuals without a documented history of LD. While there is currently no publicly available efficacy or safety data for VLA15 in individuals with a history of LD, it is reasonable to expect that future studies or post-licensure monitoring will address this gap. To minimise safety risks and ensure that immunogenicity data reflect naïve populations, phase 1 [16,25–27], phase 2 [16,26,27], and the ongoing phase 3 (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT05477524) clinical trials of the VLA15 vaccine have excluded participants with detectable anti-Borrelia antibodies, as well as individuals with autoimmune conditions or inflammatory arthritis. Although no vaccine-associated adverse effects have been reported in seronegative individuals enrolled in these trials, theoretical concerns remain regarding possible inflammatory responses in previously Lyme-exposed individuals. This is likely due to potential immune recognition of residual OspA antigen in immune-privileged sites, such as synovial tissue. Therefore, more data need to be collected on the vaccination of people with a history of LD, or pre-vaccination immune-screening, using conventional or emerging serological tools in future clinical practice to identify individuals with prior exposure. The inclusion of Borrelia antigens expressed during early human infection offers a promising avenue for the design of multi-antigen LD vaccines. Such strategies could synergistically combine OspA-based transmission-blocking components with antigens targeting transmitted Borrelia that breached anti-OspA protection. OspC emerges as a promising candidate due to its crucial role during the initial phase of mammalian infection [28]. OspC is markedly upregulated upon spirochete transmission to the vertebrate host, facilitating successful colonisation and eliciting a robust antibody response. However, its utility in vaccine development is complicated by significant antigenic variability, with numerous OspC serotypes circulating in endemic Borrelia populations. To address this diversity, “chimeritope” vaccines have already been successfully developed for canines. These fusion proteins incorporate immunogenic epitopes from multiple OspC variants into a single, mosaic antigen. The canine Lyme vaccine, VANGUARDcrLyme (Zoetis), exemplifies this approach by including a chimeric OspC antigen (Ch14), derived from segments of 14 distinct OspC types, alongside OspA. This strategy induces antibodies with broad reactivity, providing extensive protection [29]. Murine models have confirmed that OspC chimeritopes similarly generate cross-protective antibody responses, emphasising their potential translational relevance to human vaccines [29]. Critically, incorporating OspC, or other antigens expressed early during host infection into OspA-based vaccines, may enable a rapid anamnestic response to these antigens upon spirochete entry into the host. Another promising vaccine candidate is the complement regulator-acquiring surface protein 2 (also known as CRASP-2 or CspZ). Although CspZ is known to bind the complement regulator factor H (FH), it thus blocks activation of complement on the surface of the spirochete. CspZ-YA, a double mutant (two-point mutations) of CspZ from B. burgdorferi, has been engineered to lack its native FH-binding activity, thereby exposing epitopes that are otherwise shielded by FH. By further introducing protein-stabilising mutations into CspZ-YA, namely I183Y or C187S, a robust bactericidal antibody response is observed, which protects against infection in mouse models [30]. These results suggest that either CspZ-YAC187S or CspZ-YAI183Y would be promising components for inclusion into future multivalent LD vaccines. It should be noted that while these antigens (e.g., OspC, CspZ) show strong potential in preclinical studies, to date, no multi-antigen vaccines have entered human clinical trials; all clinical-stage candidates remain OspA-based. Lyme disease prevention is entering a transformative phase. The VLA15 vaccine represents the most advanced candidate to date, overcoming historical limitations by broadening genospecies coverage and resolving safety concerns. Yet, the effectiveness of OspA-based vaccines depends fundamentally on maintaining high antibody titres at the time of tick exposure. Emerging miniaturised high-throughput serological microarray platforms, designed to differentiate infection- and vaccine-induced antibodies, could not only enable robust multi-epitope LD diagnosis but also incorporate epitopes for monitoring vaccine-induced titres. Such data-based booster scheduling may help sustain protective immunity through each tick season [31], preventing breakthrough infections. However, defining human correlates of protection remains a key unmet need. With most technical limitations in vaccine design now resolved, the integration of data-guided, personalised serology may enhance the likelihood of success for the second generation of vaccine strategies capable of preventing Lyme disease in humans.

Sternal surgical site infections after cardiac surgery can lead to significant morbidity, mortality, and cost. The effects of negative pressure wound management and adding vancomycin as perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis are unknown. The PICS-PREVENA pilot/vanguard trial, a 2x2 factorial, open label, cluster-randomized crossover trial with 4 periods, was conducted at two major cardiac surgery hospitals in Ontario, Canada. Sites were randomized to one of eight sequences of the four study arms (Cefazolin or Cefazolin + Vancomycin (not analyzed) and standard wound dressing or a negative pressure 3M Prevena incision management system (Prevena). Only diabetic or obese patients were eligible for the latter comparison. This trial investigated feasability including adherence to protocol of each intervention (goal: > 90% each) and loss to follow-up (goal: < 10%). Among the 4107 included patients, 2230 were obese/diabetic (1208 standard wound dressing period, 1022 during Prevena period). Compliance to wound management and antimicrobial prophylaxis was 68.1% and 98.7%, respectively. Loss to follow-up was 3.6%. Deep/organ-space sternal surgical site infections occurred in 16 (1.6%) patients in the Prevena allocated periods and in 17 (1.4%) patients in the standard wound dressing allocated periods (OR= 1.11, 95% CI: 0.56–2.20). Other clinical outcomes did not suggest a difference and a post-hoc as-treated analysis showed similar results. This study showed challenges with introducing a novel technology as standard of care, with non-compliance mostly driven by one of the sites. No firm conclusions should be drawn regarding the effectiveness of Prevena, as this vanguard trial was not powered for clinical outcomes.

The prevalence of surgical site infections (SSI), one of the most common infections, varies between 0.6–9.5%, depending on the surgical procedure [1]. The occurrence of SSIs is associated with long-term harm, increased mortality, and cost [2–4]. In cardiac surgery, SSIs include local infections at the thoracic and sternal wounds (s-SSI) and infections at vein harvesting sites, which both are reported in about 2% of patients [5,6]. Obese patients or patients with diabetes mellitus are at increased risk for s-SSI after cardiac surgery [6–8]. The multiple interventions, which are recommended to prevent SSIs, can be divided into preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative interventions [9]. The use of incisional negative pressure wound dressing therapy, a postoperative measure, was found to be associated with a probable decrease in SSI compared to standard dressing in a Cochrane review of randomized controlled trials [10]. However, data regarding cardiac surgery, either for the sternal or vein harvest surgical site, is limited and the low quality of existing studies highlights the need for large, randomised trials [10,11]. The combination of cluster randomization, factorial- and crossover-designs can make large trials more feasible and efficient, provide data in real-world settings, investigate multiple interventions, and control cluster level confounding variables by having each cluster act as its own control [12–14]. The Prevention of Infections in Cardiac Surgery (PICS)-PREVENA Pilot/Vanguard study is a multicenter cluster-randomized 2x2 factorial crossover trial investigating antimicrobial prophylaxis (cefazolin and vancomycin prophylaxis vs cefazolin prophylaxis) and the impact of the negative pressure wound treatment (negative pressure Prevena dressing vs standard wound dressing) on the occurrence of SSIs in patients having cardiac surgery. Here we report the feasibility outcomes of adherence to protocol and loss to follow-up as well as the clinical endpoints comparing Prevena to standard wound dressing (S1 Appendix). Reporting of this trial followed the CONSORT checklist – extension for pilot and feasibility trials [15]. (S2 Appendix). PICS-Prevena is a 2x2 factorial, open label, cluster-randomized crossover trial (Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03402945) conducted at two major cardiac surgery hospitals in Ontario, Canada. Hospitals performing more than 300 cardiac surgeries a year were eligible. Clinical Trial Ontario (CTO) approved the study and waived the need for individual patient consent. The study design was adapted from the Prevention of Infections in Cardiac Surgery study, which is still underway [13] (Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02285140). The trial was funded by KCI Inc. USA. The industry sponsor had no role in conducting the trial other than supporting education on their product at the study site. The industry sponsor did provide input on the study design, but all final decisions were made by the academic investigators. The industry sponsor had no role in data collection, analysis and had no access to the raw data. The industry sponsor had the right to review and provide feedback on the manuscript before submission, but all final decisions were made by the academic investigators. The target sample size for the pilot/vanguard phase was 4,000 patients, with roughly 500 patients per each of the four treatment allocations within a 2x2 factorial design at each of the two participating sites resulting in 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the feasibility outcomes within a small margin of less than ± 1%. Such narrow confidence intervals for feasibility outcomes would not necessarily be needed. However, given that randomization was conducted at the cluster level, we needed to enroll at least two sites to gain the necessary insight into potential challenges with the feasibility of the study design for a potential full trial. All patients ≥18 years undergoing open-heart surgery with sternotomy, including minimally invasive sternotomies, during the study period were included. Patients were excluded if they were on systemic antibiotics or if they had an active bacterial infection at the time of surgery, were previously enrolled in this trial, were known to be colonized with MRSA, had a beta-lactam or vancomycin allergy precluding the use of cefazolin or vancomycin, or were participating in other studies that may interfere with this trial. Furthermore, patients with sensitivity to silver received a standard wound dressing in all study arms as Prevena is contraindicated in these patients. The hospitals were randomly assigned using computer-based randomization to one of eight potential sequences of the four treatment allocations. These four were: i) cefazolin prophylaxis plus Prevena, ii) cefazolin and vancomycin prophylaxis plus Prevena, iii) cefazolin prophylaxis plus standard wound dressing, and iv) cefazolin and vancomycin prophylaxis plus standard wound dressing (S1 Fig). The wound management and antibiotic prophylaxis strategy became standard of care for patients undergoing cardiac surgery during a respective study period. Based on the increased risk for s-SSI, the subgroup of patients who were obese (BMI>=30 kg/m2) or diabetic were eligible for Prevena, and as such the comparison of the wound dressing strategy is limited to this population. The hospital was informed about the next treatment allocation four weeks before the implementation. Before a new study arm was introduced, there was a wash-in phase of four weeks for the new antibiotic prophylaxis. For treatment allocations where Prevena was required, the use of Prevena was introduced in the last week of the wash-in period. The wash-in periods should allow for full-implementation of the interventions as new standard of care and participants undergoing surgery during this time will not be included. To guarantee patient safety, surgeons were allowed to deviate from the standard of care as determined by the treatment allocation whenever deemed necessary. Cefazolin was administered at a dose of 2g (3g if body weight >120 kg) within an hour of the surgery, four hours later or at wound closure (whatever came first), followed by two post-operative dose every 8 hours. Vancomycin was given at a dose of roughly 15 mg/kg and repeated once at 12 hours after the first dose. Prevena was applied to sternal sites and, in case of open saphenous vein harvest, the harvest sites of eligible patients at the end of the procedure. The device was used, as recommended by the manufacturer, for 7 days with a continuous negative pressure at −125 mmHg. User manuals were provided to the participants. Standard wound dressing referred to non-negative pressure wound dressing per standard of care at the hospital. Data was collected from health records and captured in an online research platform. To complete the 90-day follow-up after surgery, data was obtained through a phone call if no follow-up visit was scheduled. Surgical site infections were defined according to the criteria of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/ National Healthcare Safety Network definitions [16]. The outcomes to assess feasibility of this trial design were loss to follow-up (goal: < 10%), adherence to the wound management system (goal: > 90%), and antibiotic regimen as per protocol (goal: > 90%). The primary clinical outcome of the Prevena vs. standard wound dressing arm was a composite of deep incisional or organ/space s-SSI within 90-days. Key secondary clinical effectiveness outcomes were all s-SSI, SSI at the leg site (if open venous saphenous harvest), wound dehiscence, pain intensity at day 5, length of ICU and hospital stay, acute kidney injury and all-cause mortality and mortality in patients with active infection within 90 days. In addition, serious adverse device effects (SADEs) were collected during Prevena periods. Detailed information is provided in the statistical analysis plan (S3 Appendix). A blinded outcome adjudication committee reviewed all cases with potential signs or symptoms of an infection that could not be clearly attributed to an infectious focus other than the surgical site(s), and all patients with (suspected) s-SSI. We remain blinded to the results of the two antibiotic strategies as another study assessing the antibiotic strategies using a similar study design is underway [13]. The feasibility outcomes of the vanguard study were summarized by treatment groups as proportions. All patients undergoing cardiac surgery during the time of randomization to one of the study arms were included (intention-to-treat, ITT). The adherence to the antibiotic regimen was assessed by reviewing health records in a minimum of randomly selected 5% of eligible patients. Baseline data are reported by treatment group using count and percentage for categorical data and means and standard deviations for continuous data. Hierarchical modelling (generalized logistic mixed model) was used for the clinical outcomes in the intention-to-treat high-risk patient population with diabetes mellitus or obesity BMI > 30 kg/m2. Comparisons between the groups were reported as odds ratio with 95% confidence interval. Due to only two included sites in the vanguard study, the models included centers as random effects to account for the correlation within a center (ICC) and adjusted for the factorial allocation as a fixed effect. As a sensitivity analysis, we assessed the heterogeneity of the treatment effect between the two centers by examining the interaction between treatment and centers. In addition, given the lower-than-expected adherence to Prevena, we conducted a post-hoc as-treated analysis for the primary clinical outcome. The agreement between the outcome adjudication committee and the site diagnosis for deep/organ s-SSI or all s-SSI, respectively, was calculated using Cohens kappa (κ). The agreement within the 3-member adjudication committee was calculated as the proportion of infections with unanimous agreement among adjudicators out of all deep/organ or superficial s-SSI infections, respectively. During the study period from April 3, 2018, to December 13, 2022 (04/2018-10/2020 at site 1, and 04/2018-12/2022 at site 2), 4621 patients underwent surgery at the two study centers. A total of 4107/4621 (88.9%) were eligible (Fig 1). Of these, 2230/4107 (54%) were either obese or had diabetes and were eligible for the comparison of the two wound management strategies. A total of 1022/2230 (46%) underwent their cardiac surgery while Prevena was standard of care, and 1208/2230 (54.2%) during a standard wound dressing period (Fig 1). Two hospitals were randomly assigned to one of eight potential sequences of the four study arms. 2230 diabetic or obese (BMI > 30 kg/m2) underwent cardiac surgery while one of these arms was implemented. *For adherence to antibiotic a total of 245/4107 (6.0%) CRFs were assessed as defined in the statistical analysis plan (Supplementary). Two hospitals were randomly assigned to one of eight potential sequences of the four study arms. 2230 diabetic or obese (BMI > 30 kg/m2) underwent cardiac surgery while one of these arms was implemented. *For adherence to antibiotic a total of 245/4107 (6.0%) CRFs were assessed as defined in the statistical analysis plan (Supplementary). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0338300.g001 Of those eligible patients, the overall mean ±standard deviation (SD) age was 67.0 ± 10.7 years and 1025/4107 (25%) were female. Mean ±SD BMI was 29.6 ± 6.1 kg/m2. The most common type of surgery was coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) (n = 2451/4107, 60%) and surgical valve intervention (n = 645/4107, 16%) followed by combined CABG and valve intervention (n = 466/4107, 11%) and other, non-specified interventions (n = 545/4107, 13%). Open vein harvesting on the leg was performed in 1295/4107 (31%) patients. Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0338300.t001 The overall loss to follow-up rate at 90 days was 3.7% (153/4107; 95%CI 3.2–4.3%) and 3.6% (81/2230; 95%CI 2.9–4.4%) for the diabetic or obese population. The adherence to the use of Prevena in eligible patients during study periods when Prevena was considered standard of care was 68.1% (696/1022; 95%CI: 65.2–71.0%) overall, 42.8% (217/507; 95%CI: 38.5–47.1%) for Site A, and 93.0% (479/515; 95%CI: 90.8–95.2%) for site B. Baseline characteristics of non-adherent patients are shown in S1 Table. For compliance with the antibiotic regimen, 245 records of all 4107 (6.0%) randomized patients were evaluated. Documented non-adherence to preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis was rare with 1.2% (95%CI 0.00–2.6%), 0.4% (95%CI 0.00–1.2%), and 0%, respectively. The primary clinical outcome, the composite of deep or organ-space s-SSI, occurred in 33/2107 (1.5%) diabetic or obese patients, whereby 16/1022 infections (1.6%) were recorded in the Prevena and 17/1208 (1.4%) in the standard wound dressing group (OR: 1.11; 95% CI: 0.56–2.20) (Table 2). When including superficial infections, a total of 80/2107 (3.6%) s-SSIs were documented, 39/1022 (3.8%) in the Prevena and 41/1208 (3.4%) in the standard wound dressing group (OR:1.12; 95% CI: 0.71–1.75). Among patients who underwent an open venous saphenous harvest during their cardiac surgery, 5/1022 (1.5%) in the Prevena group and 4/1208 (1.1%) in the standard wound dressing period developed an SSI in their leg. The incidence of sternal wound dehiscence was 22/1022 (2.2%) in the Prevena group and 24/1208 (2.0%) in the standard dressing group (OR:1.09; 95% CI: 0.60–1.95). Pain on day 5, length of ICU and hospital stay, acute kidney injury and all-cause mortality in patients with active infection within 90 days were also similar in both groups. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0338300.t002 There was no evidence of interaction between treatment effect and centers (p = 0.905) in the sensitivity analysis. Similar odds ratios for the primary clinical outcome were obtained when excluding patients who did not receive Prevena due to protocol deviations (i.e., post-hoc per-protocol analysis) (deep/organ-space SSI: Prevena n = 11 (1.6%) vs standard dressing n = 17 (1.4%); OR: 1.17; 95% CI 0.54–2.53). A total of ten serious adverse device effects were reported, none of which was classified as device related (S2 Table). The agreement between the blinded outcome adjudication committee and the site was substantial for deep/organ s-SSI (κ: 0.7, 95% CI: 0.56–0.83) and all s-SSI (κ: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.55–0.71). Agreement for deep/organ s-SSI within the adjudication committee was 100% (33/33) and 47% (22/47) for superficial infections, whereby in 88% (22/25) of the disagreements one reviewer voted for no infection and in the remaining three cases more information was requested. The Prevention of Infections in Cardiac Surgery -PREVENA Vanguard study demonstrates the challenges of a 2x2 factorial crossover design investigating the implementation of new infection prevention interventions as standard of care for s-SSI prevention. Despite meeting the targeted feasibility thresholds for loss to follow up (<10%) and adherence to antimicrobial prophylaxis as per protocol (>90%), the compliance to use the negative pressure wound therapy system Prevena was 68.1%, only, and failed to reach our 90% target. We observed two contrasting patterns in adherence to the two interventions. Documented non-adherence to antibiotic intervention within the trial was low for each of the time periods and at both study sites. However, the adherence to initiate Prevena in 68.1% did not achieve our predefined target of 90%, highlighting the difficulty in introducing a novel intervention to existing, highly regimented workflows, as present in cardiac surgery. Non-adherence to Prevena was mainly driven by missing application of the wound dressing and not early discontinuation. The fact that one of the two sites showed a much better adherence (93.0% vs 42.8%), may be explained by the fact that this site had experience with using negative pressure wound dressing systems before the launch of the trial, whereas this was a new intervention at the other site. Another major complicating factor was that in contrast to the antibiotic regimen, only the subgroup of patients who were diabetic or obese qualified for the application of Prevena during the respective study period, which required a reliable process to identify those who qualify for Prevena pre-operatively. Again, one site was more successful in implementing this pre-identification process than the other site. Including a longer run-in period to expose sites prior to the change of study arm, might have led to increased adherence. Available comparisons of our adherence rates to similar trials in the literature are limited to gain further insights and adopt possible solutions. Recently published reviews that investigated negative pressure wound therapy did not report utilization of cluster RCTs [11,17,18]. Only one of the included individual-level RCTs – a pilot trial – provided adherence data, showing that 2/35 patients allocated to negative pressure wound dressing were switched to control due to the size of the incision [19]. The learning from the experience with this cluster cross-over pilot/vanguard was that subgrouping a population as part of the study design cannot be reliability implemented, that the protocol must be simple with the same intervention being applied to all patients undergoing the procedure during a given study period, and that for a complex intervention such as the use of a novel wound dressing technology longer phase-in periods may be required. Regardless of whether data collection dovetailed on the existing routine surveillance conducted by infection prevention and control professionals at one site or a research team at the other site, the trial demonstrated high follow up rates of >95% at the three-month mark. We used this study design to maximise generalizability in an area of clinical equipoise, to maintain feasibility despite assessing two interventions at the same time, and to reduce the costs of running a large trial with a small event rate. While following the standard of a cluster randomized trial [20], the research questions and study design meet all conditions proposed by the Council of Medical Sciences to obtain a waiver of informed consent [21], and therefore, the study was approved by the Provincial Ethics Board without the requirement for individual patient consent (Clinical Trials Ontario). This vanguard study was not powered to draw conclusions on clinical outcomes, and therefore, no statistically significant differences in clinical outcomes between the two wound dressing strategies were expected. Sensitivity analysess investigating heterogeneity of the treatment effect by site or only including on-treatment patients to account for the low rate of adherence to Prevena, did not show a statistically significant difference either. Generally, the assessment of SSI can be challenging, and correct interpretation of case vignettes varies [22,23]. Agreement among blinded adjudicators for deep and organ-space s-SSIs was previously shown to be high [24], and was successfully demonstrated in our vanguard study. Blinded adjudication may be important to overcome the risk of bias from subjective outcomes in unblinded trials [25]. In this pilot/vanguard, there was unanimous agreement on the primary outcome among the outcome adjudication committee members, and the agreement between sites and the adjudication committee was substantial and similar to previous reports for deep infection [24]. Disagreement within the adjudication committee was noticed for superficial infections, which supports the choice of deep/organ-space infections as a primary outcome given the higher level of subjectivity for superficial incisional infections. This vanguard trial has several limitations. First, the trial was stopped after the vanguard phase due to lack of additional funding, hence, it was not powered to draw conclusions on treatment effects. Second, even if most probable of negligible relevance, the trial was repeatedly paused during the COVID-19 pandemic at one site, prolonging the recruitment phase. Reasons for the interruption were lack of study staff or outstanding Prevena resupply during the pandemic and awaiting a protocol amendment to increase recruitment number at the site. In conclusion, conducting the study as planned with a 2x2 factorial cross-over design was feasible. However, adherence to one of the interventions, the Prevena negative wound management system, was lower than expected and suggested that an eventual full trial needs to be simplified with all patients regardless of their individual risk factors to be managed the same way in a given study period. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0338300.s001 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0338300.s002 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0338300.s003 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0338300.s004 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0338300.s005 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0338300.s006 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0338300.s007 (PDF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0338300.s008 (CSV) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0338300.s009 (TXT) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0338300.s010 (PDF)

Title: iRobot files for bankruptcy protection; will be private under restructuring

Roomba maker iRobot has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, but says that it doesn’t expect any disruptions to devices as the more than 30-year-old company is taken private under a restructuring process Roomba maker iRobot has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, but says that it doesn't expect any disruptions to devices as the more than 30-year-old company is taken private under a restructuring process. IRobot, which became well known for its robotic vacuums, has struggled of late, dealing with increased competition, layoffs and a declining stock price. In 2022 Amazon announced that it had agreed to buy iRobot for about $1.7 billion, but that deal was called off last year. Amazon blamed “undue and disproportionate regulatory hurdles” after the European Union signaled its objection to the transaction. Amazon said at the time that it would pay iRobot a previously agreed termination fee of $94 million and iRobot said that it would undergo a restructuring to help stabilize the company. iRobot said Sunday that it is now being acquired by Picea through a court-supervised process. Picea, or Shenzhen PICEA Robotics Co., Ltd., is iRobot's primary contract manufacturer.. With facilities in China and Vietnam, Picea has built and sold more than 20 million robotic vacuum cleaners. “The transaction will strengthen our financial position and will help deliver continuity for our consumers, customers, and partners," iRobot CEO Gary Cohen said in a statement. iRobot said it will continue to operate as normal during the Chapter 11 process and doesn't expect any disruption to its app functionality, customer programs, global partners, supply chain relationships, or ongoing product support. The Bedford, Massachusetts-based anticipates completing the prepackaged chapter 11 process by February. In premarket trading, iRobot shares slid nearly 70% to $1.31. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

There’s no bulletproof way to identify an investment bubble before it happens, or even while it’s happening. We can only pinpoint bubbles in hindsight, after they’ve already burst — and lost a lot of investors a lot of money. But when people look back on bubbles of the past, like the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s or the housing bubble of the mid 2000s, many recall a vague feeling that something was off. It’s no secret that many experts have that feeling right now about the current AI boom. Even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, the head of the world’s most prominent AI lab, has sounded the alarm. “Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes,” Altman said in an August interview with The Verge. Should you make investment decisions based on those kinds of feelings and opinions? I don’t know. I’m just a guy who writes personal finance articles. I don’t have any groundbreaking insights that conclusively prove that we are or aren’t in an AI bubble. But I did ask financial economists at more than a dozen universities across the United States about it, and their responses were striking: More than 75% of economists we spoke to think the current AI investment boom is, in fact, a bubble. Most of these economists, who hold positions at prominent universities, gave their answers on condition of anonymity, given the sensitive nature of the topic, but they cited a variety of evidence for their positions. Below, we’re breaking down the arguments for and against the theory that we’re in an AI bubble — and discussing how you can protect yourself if that theory turns out to be true. Brokerage firms I’ll start by looking at the “not a bubble” and “maybe a bubble” responses. These were far fewer in number than the “yes” responses from economists, but they brought up an important point: There is real money in AI, and several of the biggest tech stocks are proving that with their earnings and revenue. In its most recent quarterly earnings report, Nvidia (NVDA) reported a record $57 billion in revenue and $1.30 in earnings per share, giving it a price-to-earnings ratio (PE ratio) in the mid-40s range. Microsoft (MSFT) reported $77.7 billion in revenue and $3.72 in earnings per share in its most recent quarterly report, giving it a PE ratio in the mid-30s. Alphabet (GOOG) reported $102.3 billion in quarterly revenue and earnings per share of $2.87, giving it a PE ratio in the low 30s. These PE ratios are a little high — a “normal” PE ratio is typically somewhere in the 20s — but they’re not outrageous. All three stocks have actually seen decreases in PE ratio in recent years. Plus, there are plenty of non-AI stocks in much worse shape in terms of PE ratio. For example, CVS Health Corp. (CVS) has a PE ratio over 200. » See our list of the most undervalued stocks in the S&P 500 There are questions about many of the other big AI stocks. Tesla (TSLA) has a PE ratio over 300, and Palantir Technologies (PLTR) has a PE ratio over 400, for example. And there are also questions about whether Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet et al would still be able to rake in tens of billions of dollars in AI revenue in the event of a broad downturn in AI investment. But for the time being, it’s actually kind of hard to make an argument that the multi-trillion-dollar AI behemoths like Nvidia, Microsoft and Alphabet are severely overvalued. They have the earnings to back up their stock prices, to some extent. That said, 10 out of 13 economists surveyed by NerdWallet did ultimately say that we’re in a bubble. Here are some of the arguments they made for that position: Valuations are on the high end. The PE ratios of the biggest tech stocks, like Alphabet, Microsoft and Nvidia, might not be obscene, but they’re a little higher than what most would consider a typical PE ratio, and many other AI stocks have triple-digit PE ratios. Venture capital investment in AI startups is growing at a wild rate. It’s worth remembering that the stock market is not the only type of equity investment. Many economists noted that venture capitalists are throwing ever-growing amounts of seed money into just about any startup that claims to incorporate AI into its business model, and expressed doubts that that investment growth rate is sustainable or that it’ll produce real returns. Venture capital investments in AI companies surged 62% last year, according to Crunchbase. There are worries about “circular financing” between big AI companies. In recent years, a number of Big Tech firms have signed AI investment and hardware purchasing deals worth tens of billions of dollars… with each other. This raises the question of whether all of the AI revenue reported by the likes of Microsoft, Nvidia and Alphabet is organic, or whether much of it consists of money from other tech companies that have recently gotten flush with investment due to AI hype themselves. AI may have real value, but that doesn’t rule out a dot-com bubble scenario. Many of the “yes” responses did not doubt that AI as a technology has huge potential, but they cautioned that this doesn’t disprove the theory that we’re in a bubble — and that this line of anti-bubble argument is suspicious in and of itself. Some drew comparisons to the dot-com bubble of the 1990s and early 2000s: Back then, investors correctly recognized the transformative economic potential of the nascent internet, but they still got carried away with their investments in internet stocks, eventually leading to a big correction. If you’re a longtime reader of The Nerdy Investor, or of NerdWallet in general, you probably have an idea of what we’re going to say here. When we write about a potential downside risk in the market, we often come back to the refrain that investment diversification is the best defense, and that index funds and ETFs are the easiest way for most investors to ensure they’re well-diversified. Yeah, you could try to actively bet against potentially-overvalued AI companies by buying put options on them, short-selling them, or buying inverse ETFs that contain them, but these are risky moves that lose most people money. Here’s the thing, though… If we are in an AI bubble, this may be one situation where many popular index funds aren’t that safe, either. Back in August, I wrote about how Nvidia made up about 8% of the entire S&P 500 index (around 7% today) by market capitalization, and how the seven largest S&P 500 stocks, which are all tech companies with substantial AI interests, make up about a third of the index. The situation is even more dire for the Nasdaq 100, where Nvidia makes up more than 13% of the index, and the top 7 stocks (all AI-related tech names) make up well over half of it. However, there are still ways to diversify through other types of index funds, if you think outside the box a little bit. Here are a few ideas: The Dow Jones Industrial Average is one index that is tracked by several ETFs and mutual funds, and it isn’t disproportionately made up of Nvidia and other tech stocks, because it’s a stock price-weighted index rather than a market cap-weighted index. Nvidia makes up less than 2.5% of the Dow, and Big Tech in general accounts for less than 25% of it. (Check out our article on Dow Jones ETFs for more information). The Russell 2000, an index of small-cap stocks tracked by many ETFs and mutual funds, is even less tech-y than the Dow. Tech accounts for less than 14% of it; it mostly consists of companies in the industrial, health care and financial sectors. One caveat: Small-cap stocks can be volatile. Although the Russell 2000 has limited exposure to AI and tech, it may still swoon in an AI bubble-burst scenario if investors are spooked into selling risky stocks in general. (NerdWallet maintains a list of the best-performing small-cap ETFs). Equal-weight S&P 500 ETFs are one way to get exposure to the S&P 500 companies while solving the Nvidia/Big Tech concentration problem. As we wrote in this newsletter issue a few weeks ago, they’re less AI-exposed than regular market cap-weight S&P 500 funds, and often pay higher dividend yields, but they tend to have significantly higher fees as well, and have trailed normal S&P 500 ETFs in returns this year. International ETFs could also be worth a look. The Vanguard FTSE All-World Ex-US ETF (VEU), for example, is less than 14% tech stocks by market cap.

Title: How CEO Winnie Park is reshaping Five Below into 'Costco for kids'

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Christmas, it is often said, is a time for second chances. So it would seem for Five Below, which is celebrating a transformational year under the leadership of CEO Winnie Park. The stock is up about 85% this year so far — that's well more than the returns of most major retail stocks and AI chip darling Nvidia in the same period. To rewind, last year's holiday season wasn't looking like a very joyful one for the tween- and teen-focused retailer. The Philadelphia-based company was on its way to posting its fourth-straight quarter with negative or flat comparable sales, and that was coming off several prior years of underwhelming performance. While Five Below was managing to grow overall sales through the addition of new stores, existing stores weren't resonating with shoppers. It was also dealing with industry-wide challenges, including shoplifting and the rise of low-priced e-commerce players like Shein and Temu. With Five Below's stock languishing around a third of its 2023 peak, the company tapped Park, then-CEO of Forever 21, to take over as CEO in December 2024 during the holiday rush last year. "When she came in, she was sort of an unknown quantity," Mizuho retail analyst David Bellinger told Business Insider. "It was a question of how is she going to fix this business immediately." While Park may not have been the most widely known CEO on Wall Street, she did come equipped with decades of industry experience, including as CEO of Forever 21 and Paper Source, as well as executive roles at Duty Free Shoppers and Levi's, and a stint with McKinsey's retail team. "Her background allows her to really understand how all of these different aspects of the Five Below business work, because she's drawing on a very rich career," Global Data retail analyst Neil Saunders told Business Insider. "A lot of people come in sometimes as CEOs, and they don't have a tremendous background in retail, or they may have experience in merchandising, but not in supply chains," he added. "Winnie Park was almost like the complete package." Five Below did not respond to a request for comment on this story. Park wasted no time diving in with cofounder and executive chairman Tom Vellios and chief operating officer Ken Bull. The first order of business was refocusing the merchandise on what Five Below's core teen and tween customers want. Bellinger said this was a result of Park's major reset with the sourcing teams, guiding them to find hot items and buy with confidence, while steering away from items, like luggage, that were more adult-focused. "They loaded the store up with 'Lilo and Stitch' merchandise, SpongeBob, Hello Kitty — so when you do have these good, well-known brands, it sort of lifts the whole store," he said. The merchandising effort was also paired with a social media push that the company says has helped attract new shoppers. Park's other major area of focus was simplifying store operations for both employees and customers. With a bit of planning and an incremental investment in labor hours, Five Below says it has improved in-stock rates and customer support at its stores, helping to drive higher sales. "Winnie Park is the type of leader that has a very clear vision for the business," Saunders said. "She doesn't really overcomplicate things." In addition to getting Five Below back to some principles it may have lost touch with in recent years, Park is also showing a willingness to let go of at least one thing that may have been holding the company back: its $5 price point. The last few years of inflation haven't made it easy for retailers with dollar-denominated branding to stick to their original promises. Dollar Tree had to hike its base price to $1.25, and it's tough to run a 99 Cents Only store at a time when the US government is eliminating the penny. President Donald Trump's trade war this year hasn't been much help for import-heavy businesses, either. To manage these cost pressures, the company lumped more merchandise in a catch-all section of the store called Five Beyond, which it had set up years earlier. But that distinction brought unnecessary complexity without meaningful benefit, and the company recently ditched the plan in favor of grouping products by category instead of a price threshold. "It was a very disjointed merchandising set," Bellinger said. "Anything in that price threshold was in the back there." Now, he said, "the way they've assorted the store and spread these items out makes a lot more sense." Bellinger said the move shows that Park understands a critical lesson that successful retailers have had to reckon with in the last few years: value and price are not the same thing. "You could find value in that $30 item. It's all relative," he said. Taken together — exciting products, well-run stores, a focus on great value — Five Below is starting to look in some ways more like a warehouse club than a discount store. "Five Below is essentially the Costco for kids," Bellinger said. "Maybe you want to get some core birthday or party items, and then you wind up expanding your basket and buying all these things you didn't know were there. And then it leads you to your next visit, and you just keep coming back." The success of the past year will raise the expectations for next year's quarterly comparable sales numbers, but Five Below still has several levers it says it can pull to meet the moment. Bellinger said investors are keen to see whether the recent changes at Five Below have led to a structural shift that will drive long-term performance. The average Five Below store generates annual sales of around $2.1 million, but Bellinger said Park's initiatives could significantly boost that number: "Why can't that be a $3 million store now, or even higher?"

By Max Goldbart International TV Co-Editor EXCLUSIVE: Fremantle is closing Don’t Pick up the Phone maker Wag Entertainment’s production arm, with MD Steven Green exiting after 26 years. Fremantle acquired Wag last year when it bought owner Asacha Media Group and we understand the move comes as part of ongoing strategic planning related to Asacha. Wag Entertainment’s distribution arm, which is run by Janice Strangward, is staying put, and Wag’s IP remains with Fremantle. Green is leaving along with co-founder Eliya Arman, creative director Bridget Boseley, production boss Kate Gibbard and production manager Kelly Hood. Layoffs are in the single figures, we are told. Related Stories News Fremantle Bosses To Keynote Series Mania As 'Got Talent' Producer Turns 25 Cancellations and Renewals 'Hotel Costiera' Not Returning For Season 2 On Prime Video; Jesse Williams Series Shopped By Fremantle - The Dish Across nearly 30 years, Wag has been a prolific British documentary producer. Credits include Science Channel’s What On Earth?, Paramount+’s Don’t Date Brandon, Prime Video’s Murderer Behind the Mask and Netflix-Paramount+’s Don’t Pick up the Phone. The latter came via an innovative streaming model that saw Paramount+ take UK rights and Netflix rest of world. Upcoming, Wag’s Secrets of the Conclave airs on the BBC in a week’s time. Watch on Deadline Wag was acquired by Asacha in 2021, at which point founder Martin Durkin left and was replaced by Green. Fremantle has been strategizing over the future of Asacha since it bought the firm in 2024 and both Asacha founders have since exited. Green said the Wag team “leaves on a high” after making projects during the past year for Amazon, Paramount+ and a trio of British broadcasters. “Everyone at Wag is proud of what we’ve achieved, and this year’s success, as well as the success of the past two and half decades, is all down to the many talented people we’ve worked with,” he added. “So on behalf of Eliya, Bridget, Kate and Kelly, a heartfelt thank you to all the freelancers and staffers, past and present, for 26 brilliant years.” Fremantle UK CEO Amelia Brown said: “We would like to say a huge thank you to Steven and the team for their incredible work and achievements. Wag has made great contributions to Fremantle since its successful integration under Asacha Media Group last year. We wish all the team at WAG the very best in their future endeavours.” Asacha, and now Fremantle, owns the likes of Death in Paradise producer Red Planet Pictures, Magic of Disney’s Animal Kingdom maker Arrow and Oscar-nominated Les Misérables producer SRAB. Fremantle owner RTL previously said the super-indie spent more than €200M ($234M) on Asacha and 80% of Singapore’s Beach House Pictures in 2024.

Title: Nifty Mid Caps To Offer 22% Upside, Says CLSA's Laurence Balanco
URL: https://www.ndtvprofit.com/markets/nifty-midcaps-to-offer-22-upside-says-clsas-laurence-balanco
Time Published: 2025-12-15T01:29:22Z
Full Content:
After predicting Nifty to reach 28,800 levels in 2026, CLSA technical analyst Laurence Balanco believes Nifty mid-cap stocks stocks are offering a major buy signal and could deliver gains of up to 22%. In his latest Price Action note for CLSA, Balanco highlighted that the Nifty Midcap index has pulled back to a key confluence of support. This means the index is currently an attractive entry point for investors. Balanco adds that the Nifty Midcap index recently tested the 13,500–13,510 zone. This has been identified by Balanco as a key critical zone as it aligns with the 50-day moving average (DMA) and the upper boundary of the consolidation pattern seen throughout 2024 and 2025. Thursday’s intraday reversal at this level could signal selling exhaustion, which in turn means the correction in the index is likely over. This is what Balanco deduces from the recent price action. CLSA anticipates the index will now resume its breakout from a massive "cup-and-handle" formation. "Pattern continues to support an upside target of 16,800–16,820, implying a potential gain of roughly 22%," the note stated. While Nifty Midcaps could be in a position to offer attractive upside, CLSA is also bullish on the benchmark Nifty 50. Balanco himself had said earlier this month that the benchmark could reach 28,800 levels in 2026. For this week, Balanco observed that Nifty 50 has established a solid support base between 25,275 and 25,318 following a recent corrective phase. As long as the index holds above the broader support zone of 24,448–25,669, Balanco expects a breakout above the 2024 highs. The brokerage firm has set a Nifty target of 26,700–26,800, based on the consolidation pattern formed between July and October.

Title: Trump and the End of American Hegemony
URL: https://www.project-syndicate.org/magazine/trump-end-of-american-hegemony-by-joseph-e-stiglitz-2025-12
Time Published: 2025-12-15T00:05:00Z
Full Content:
In 2025, Donald Trump's erratic, unlawful policies upended the postwar era of globalization and set in motion a process that will culminate in America's loss of global primacy. Not only are the sources of US economic strength being destroyed, but all other countries are de-risking from America as fast as they can. NEW YORK – It has become almost routine to end each year with talk of the “polycrisis,” and to acknowledge the difficulty of anticipating a future that seems pregnant with the risk of new wars, pandemics, financial crises, and climate-driven devastation. Yet 2025 added a uniquely toxic ingredient to this mix: the return to the White House of Donald Trump, whose erratic, unlawful policies have already upended the postwar era of globalization. Faced with so much chaos and uncertainty, can we say anything with confidence about where the US and global economies are heading? One thing we can say is that the US economy is not doing as well as Trump, ever the con man, would have us believe. Job creation is almost at a standstill, which is no surprise, given that Trump has been sowing uncertainty and weakening the economy in unprecedented ways. On the supply side, his most pernicious policy has been the frontal attack on immigrant workers (and American workers with darker complexions more broadly). The administration’s mass deportations – carried out by masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents snatching people off the streets – have killed off the most important source of additional labor supply at a time when the domestic labor force is declining. This matters for everyone, because not only do Americans depend on immigrants in industries ranging from agriculture and construction to hospitality and care work, but these immigrants are also a source of demand. Yet now, many Americans of color, even US citizens, are afraid to leave their homes, lest they be abducted and brutalized by ICE. The negative effects of Trump’s indiscriminate cuts to government have also spread throughout the economy. There are multiplier effects to government contractions, just as there are to expansions, and in the current context, the costs have been amplified by the erratic nature of the process. The administration’s incompetent, blunderbuss approach has sown even deeper uncertainty and induced precautionary behavior on the part of businesses and consumers. Trump’s tariffs – whether levied or threatened – and other on-again, off-again policies should be recognized for what they are: a major supply-side shock to the economy. They have pointlessly added uncertainty to the costs of production and to the prices consumers pay when they shop, making it impossible for businesses to engage in any serious long-term planning. And these are just short-term effects. The US economy’s long-term prospects look even bleaker, all thanks to Trump. After all, America’s comparative advantage has always rested on technology and unfettered higher education. By attacking research and trying to starve universities of federal funds unless they kowtow to his demands, Trump is shooting America’s economy in the foot. As numerous Nobel laureates in economics have emphasized, the “wealth of nations” lies in institutions, not least the rule of law. But Trump is trampling on the rule of law and replacing it with an extortionary regime of deal-making (and self-dealing), where government favors (like export licenses for Nvidia or subsidies for Intel) are granted in exchange for stakes in the company’s future profits. Of course, over time, Trump’s targets for extortion will dwindle. Having recognized the danger of relying on the United States, many countries are already pursuing new trade arrangements. Why, then, is GDP still growing (though not as robustly as it did under President Joe Biden), with the stock market reaching new highs and inflation remaining below the levels critics had warned about? There are multiple explanations for this apparent strength. With respect to the stock market, the boom is actually very narrow, confined largely to a handful of tech giants: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla.

Subscribe Now And yet, these companies’ valuations reflect expectations of long-term monopoly profits that may never materialize. (This is especially true for Tesla, owing to Elon Musk’s embrace of Trump, which has alienated many consumers.) I am among the many commentators who see today’s valuations as the product of a bubble, one that has been sustaining not only the stock market but the entire economy. The massive capital expenditures on AI have been offsetting the weakness in the rest of the economy. But like all such bubbles, this one will eventually burst. Precisely when is anyone’s guess; but with so much of the economy riding on one sector, the collapse will inevitably be felt widely. Worse, if AI succeeds in the way its advocates anticipate, it would be a harbinger of other serious problems, because then the technology would likely displace many workers and cause even greater inequality. Add the downsizing of government demanded by Silicon Valley’s ersatz tech-libertarians, and one can only wonder what would sustain the US economy in the years ahead. As for inflation, there is a simple explanation for why it has not risen sharply yet. For starters, Trump’s tariffs generally have not been as high as he originally threatened (though the 50% punitive tariff imposed on India, a country the US had treated as a friend before Trump’s return, is shockingly brutal). Moreover, the effects of tariffs are often felt with long lags. Many firms refrained from raising prices until they saw what their competitors would do, and some won’t raise prices until the inventories of the goods they purchased before the tariffs are exhausted. But if Trump’s threatened tariffs against China were ever actually imposed, that would be a different matter. In fact, the unraveling of supply chains could unleash price increases greater than the tariffs themselves. That brings me to the critical question: What country would willingly subject itself to the whims of a mad king? It is not as if the US has a stranglehold on the supply of critical minerals or rare earths, without which the modern industrial age crumbles. It is not as if there aren’t markets elsewhere. The law of supply and demand works just as well without the US as with it. As Adam Smith and David Ricardo taught us, economic growth is about leveraging comparative advantages and economies of scale. But as Trump (and Russian President Vladimir Putin) has taught us, relying on unreliable trade partners can be enormously disadvantageous. Besides, the US is not as important as it used to be. It now accounts for under 10% of global exports. While some firms’ profits will suffer in a post-American global economy, others will benefit. While some workers will have to find alternative employment, others will find new demand for their skills. To be sure, the short run will not be easy. But in the new global economy that emerges over the longer term, America will have lost its hegemony. That is where we are heading as we head into the second year of living at the mercy of an unhinged president’s whims. The transition has already begun, and though global growth will suffer, the pain may be less than many fear. In Europe, for example, investments in rearmament – another byproduct of Trump’s self-destructive policies – will provide a major boost. Perhaps the defining moment will come with the 2026 US midterm elections in November. Elections that are not as free and fair as one would expect for a genuine democracy (as many fear) would mark a grim turning point. But if the growing dissatisfaction with Trump’s economic management and the country’s slide toward authoritarianism results in the Democrats recapturing at least one house of Congress, that will be a turning point in the other direction. Either way, the US and the world would still face at least another two years of economic incompetence and uncertainty. Nov 28, 2025 Janine R.

Title: Does Meta Need a Decade of Efficiency?
URL: https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/12/14/does-meta-need-a-decade-of-efficiency/
Time Published: 2025-12-14T22:33:15Z
Full Content:
Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © David Ramos / Getty Images Mark Zuckerberg declared 2023 the “year of efficiency” after Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) shed 21,000 employees and tightened spending. Operating margins expanded from 25% to 42%, and the stock tripled. But Meta guided capital expenditures to $70-72 billion for 2025, up from $30 billion in 2024. That’s an arms race. Third quarter revenue hit $51.24 billion, up 26% year-over-year. Operating income reached $20.54 billion at a 40% margin. Net income collapsed 83% to $2.71 billion due to a $15.93 billion one-time tax charge. Strip that out and adjusted earnings would be $18.64 billion. Capital spending surged 135% to $19.37 billion in a single quarter. Zuckerberg laid out the logic on the Q3 earnings call: It’s clear that there are a lot of new opportunities to use new AI advances to accelerate our core business that should have strong ROI over the next few years, so I think we should invest more there […] our AI investments continue to require serious infrastructure, and I expect to continue investing significantly there too. That’s the CEO explicitly saying “we should invest more,” not “we should maintain efficiency.” Meta is training Llama 4 on a cluster exceeding 100,000 H100 GPUs, larger than anything competitors have disclosed. CFO Susan Li warned of “significant acceleration in infrastructure expense growth” for 2026 as depreciation and operating costs from the expanded fleet hit the income statement. Meta’s 40% operating margin exceeds Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) at 30.5%. The company’s 82% gross margin provides cushion. Meta AI now has 500 million monthly active users, and AI-driven feed improvements drove an 8% increase in Facebook time spent and 6% on Instagram. Over one million advertisers used generative AI tools to create 15 million ads last month, with a 7% lift in conversions. But if infrastructure spending doubles while revenue growth holds at 26%, something has to give. Operating expenses are projected at $116-118 billion for 2025, up 22-24%. Reality Labs losses continue to widen. The company is adding costs everywhere AI touches. The market is pricing in a return to efficiency. Meta trades at 22x forward earnings, down from 29x trailing, implying analysts expect margin recovery. The consensus price target of $838 suggests 12% upside. But quarterly earnings growth just printed at negative 83%, even adjusted for the tax charge. Meta doesn’t need a decade of efficiency. It needs the AI buildout to pay off within three years, or margins will compress. Zuckerberg is betting the infrastructure spend creates a moat competitors can’t match. The alternative is he’s just spending more efficiently than before while still spending a lot more. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 Meta Platforms (Nasdaq: META) has faced criticism for investing too heavily in the Metaverse, but the company’s broader business has continued to perform well. During a recent episode of The AI Investor Podcast, 24/7 Analysts Eric Bleeker and Austin Smith discussed whether the announced cutbacks on the Metaverse could help generate even greater returns for Meta in 2026. The recent announcement that Meta will be acquiring the AI wearable company Limitless has signaled to many a strategic shift toward AI-focused opportunities. Some believe that if Meta executes well, shares could rise toward $900, potentially even $1,000 per share. “I really like that Zuckerberg is willing to make these big bets,” Smith explained. “That’s what you get with a founder, CEO, who is visionary in the way that he is. But you also gotta know when to fold them, right? And the Metaverse has just not been working out.” Bleeker added, “If you’re someone who owns Meta, this is objectively positive. If we can see this discipline from them, and if AI continues to boost their business results, there’s an opportunity for shares to trade closer to $900 per share this year. That would be a very bullish case. On the flip side, if they continue spending in ways Wall Street doesn’t like, you could see them trading as low as $500 per share, the low end of their baseline.” If the video embed isn’t working, you can access the full video at the following URL: https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/12/14/meta-meta-stock-pops-following-metaverse-cuts-announcement-could-it-hit-1000-in-2026 This conversation was from our most recent episode of The AI Investor Podcast. In the show we invest $500,000 portfolio filled with our top AI stock ideas. Meta is one of the stocks in the portfolio, but our biggest winners have seen returns like 418%, 289%, and 211% already (the portfolio only launched about a year ago!) Want to give it a listen?

If you’re a Meta investors, getting the full story on the biggest developments in AI is absolutely essential, so don’t delay! Austin Smith: Meta has had its own anchor. Now that’s weird to say for a company whose shares have performed as well as they have, and Meta’s a bigger company than the Metaverse. But when you think about the one big criticism that people have had of Meta in the last few years, it’s been why is Mark Zuckerberg flushing so much money down the metaverse drain? Nobody believes in it. The traction has been really low. So Meta has a lot more going for it than that, and that’s been enough to overwhelm that one core criticism. But that has been the biggest criticism I’ve heard, and frankly, it’s a criticism I share. I really like that Zuckerberg is willing to make these big bets. That’s what you get with a founder CEO who is visionary in the way that he is. But you also gotta know when to fold them, right? And the Metaverse has just not been working out. So Meta finally announcing that they’re cutting some of the revenue out of that division. Wall Street rewarded it. I think they should. That’s the right call. Anything you saw in this that’s interesting? Just cutting out from that tiny anchor and saying, “Hey, Metaverse, this capital has a higher return for the company and a shorter path to revenue: AI,” right? AI internally, AI externally, it’s clearly a better place to deploy that money. Eric Bleeker: Yeah. Well, if we are doing Glengarry Glen Ross, you know, what is it? The winner gets a car. The second place gets steak knives and last gets fired. If you looked at the Magnificent Seven this year, Google is the car, NVIDIA gets the steak knives. Google’s up 70%, NVIDIA’s up 35%. And then the laggards are some combination of Microsoft, Apple, Meta, and Amazon – up zero to 15% – all slightly underperforming the S&P. Meta has been disappointing, especially from where we purchased it. I have wanted to move out of the portfolio. The problem is, if you go back and look at Meta’s stock the past two years, it’s a very tight range. They’re trading between 20 and 30 times forward earnings. And right now, they’re at the bottom of that valuation. It’s because the market doesn’t believe in them specifically. They were sold off very harshly because of how high their operating costs are rising last quarter. We’ve got two sides to Meta. One is that AI has more potential to drive their business than any other company. I believe there’s a study that generative AI leads to 19% better click-through rates on ads, which is going to make their products better. They’re going to be able to create new products. We know the ROI. But if they’re spending so much in this rush for ASI and they’re behind in those efforts, investors aren’t going to believe in that narrative. So I’ve wanted to see them rise to higher, closer to that 30 times forward earnings multiple, like Google’s closer to right now, before I sell it off and redeploy that cash. This is a great step in that direction. They need to be cutting some costs. They need to show the market they have discipline. And we saw the day they announced this, they were up 4%. So if you’re someone who owns Meta, this is objectively positive. If we can see this discipline from them, and if AI continues to boost their business results, there’s an opportunity for shares to trade closer to $900 per share this year. That would be a very bullish case. On the flip side, if they continue spending in ways Wall Street doesn’t like, you could see them trading as low as $500 per share, the low end of their baseline. We’ll see where they trade, which depends a lot on how they handle this cost discipline throughout the year. Austin Smith: It’s interesting to talk about cost discipline in a world where Meta is also being punished for spending so much on AI. But this is what cost discipline is, right? If they believe in AI and the ROI on Metaverse isn’t there, they need to cut in one category and move that money to the other. And they’re doing that. Just yesterday, Meta announced they’re acquiring an AI wearable company, Limitless. It’s not a big acquisition in terms of total dollars, but it shows that they are reducing the thing that’s not working and putting more money in the thing that is working, which is AI. That is good financial discipline. Whether or not the AI bets pay off is the next Meta question that Wall Street has, but at least they are not sticking poorly with the Metaverse bet.

Title: Nvidia’s Biggest AI Bet Is Crashing Its ‘Secret Portfolio.’ Can It Recover?

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Shutterstock Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has assembled a strategic portfolio of public investments in AI-focused companies, including chip designers, data center operators, and infrastructure providers that not many investors are aware of. It consists of six holdings that at the end of the third quarter was valued at approximately $3.84 billion. The dominant position is in CoreWeave (NASDAQ:CRWV), the AI-specialized cloud provider that relies heavily on Nvidia GPUs and accounts for over 86% of the portfolio’s value. Nvidia invested $350 million in CoreWeave in two tranches before its March IPO. Having originally invested $100 million in April 2023, it invested another $250 million just before its public debut, giving it a total of approximately 24.2 million shares at $40 per share, securing a 7% stake for Nvidia. Following the IPO, CoreWeave surged to an all-time high of $187 per share in June, but has been on a fairly steady decline since. Despite almost doubling from the IPO price, the stock is down nearly 60% from that peak. On Friday, it suffered another 10% drop, bringing its market capitalization to around $39 billion — a sharp erosion from the nearly $80 billion it was worth at the end of June. Friday’s plunge followed an SEC Form 4 filing revealing that Chief Financial Officer Nitin Agrawal sold 66,467 shares on December 11 at an average price of $82.58, totaling approximately $5.49 million. While investors are often reminded to ignore insider sales because they can sell stock for any reason — or no reason at all — those made by CFOs should be noted because of their specialized knowledge of the company’s finances. However, Agrawal’s transaction stemmed from the vesting of restricted stock units, with the sale covering associated tax withholding obligations. Insider sales are common upon RSU vesting and often serve administrative purposes rather than signaling fundamental concerns. This was a non-event for CoreWeave, and Agrawal still owns over 203,000 shares after the sale. Yet, CoreWeave’s challenges reflect broader skepticism about the AI sector’s growth trajectory. Analysts and investors have highlighted potential “circular financing” dynamics, where Nvidia provides investments or capacity commitments to customers that purchase its hardware. CoreWeave’s arrangement with Nvidia includes a $6.3 billion agreement under which Nvidia commits to purchasing any unsold cloud computing capacity through April 2032, providing a revenue backstop but raising questions about true end-user demand. Across the industry, major technology companies are increasingly relying on debt to fund expansive AI infrastructure projects as operational cash flows prove insufficient. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) issued $30 billion in bonds in 2025 to support data center expansions, and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) just faced investor backlash after its Q3 earnings. Its stock dropped 15% on concerns over ballooning debt levels that exceed $100 billion and negative free cash flow tied to AI commitments. These developments have fueled debates about overinvestment risks, potential capacity gluts, and the long-term profitability of AI buildouts. For CoreWeave, despite reporting strong Q3 revenue of $1.36 billion (up significantly year-over-year) and a substantial backlog, the company posted ongoing net losses and relies heavily on debt financing, including a $2.6 billion convertible notes offering completed just this month, albeit at a low 1.75% interest rate. High capital expenditures for data center expansion — projected to be in the tens of billions of dollars over the coming years — are seen as straining its balance sheet. CoreWeave is the primary drag on Nvidia’s investment portfolio performance. Although five of the six holdings have declined since the end of Q3 — contributing to a significant overall drop in portfolio value — CoreWeave’s 42% decline has been roughly twice as severe as the next-largest loser, Nebius Group (NASDAQ:NBIS), which is down 22%. Only Applied Digital (NASDAQ:APLD) has recorded gains during this period. Analysts maintain a generally positive outlook on CoreWeave, though, citing its revenue growth, customer relationships, and backlog as supportive factors. However, a sustained recovery hinges on demonstrating profitable execution, managing leverage effectively, and proving that enduring AI demand exists in the face of financing and sustainability doubts. Until it can demonstrate this, I wouldn’t be buying into CoreWeave just yet. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later.

By The Knowledge Project Podcast ## Key takeaways - **Doorman Fallacy**: Management consultants replace a doorman costing $X with an automatic door, saving money short-term, but the hotel's reputation crashes because the doorman provided security, taxi hailing, guest recognition, and status—value not captured in 'open the door' metrics. [04:43], [05:29] - **Postman Brand Perception**: Royal Mail found brand affection uncorrelated with service reliability; it depended on liking the postman, who built trust through chats and favors, outweighing metrics like delivery speed. [07:26], [08:15] - **Cold Beer Transaction Utility**: Thaler’s experiment shows people pay more for identical cold beer from a boutique hotel than a shack due to transaction utility—how good the deal feels—independent of the beer's utility. [18:11], [19:30] - **Dyson Call Center Honor**: James Dyson halted efficiency metrics presentation, insisting calls be treated as an honor; staff solved problems helpfully, even free parts next day, building fanatical loyalty despite premium prices. [40:47], [41:20] - **Family Firms Outperform PLCs**: Privately-owned family firms like McCain, Yorkshire Tea, and Dyson dominate advertising effectiveness awards over PLCs, prioritizing long-term customer value over short-term shareholder transactions. [28:28], [32:23] - **Psychopath Detection Test**: Women arrive late on first dates as a test; psychopaths rage while normals say 'traffic was terrible,' revealing character since we evolved to judge trustworthiness over half a million years. [20:43], [22:04] I keep hearing people saying you will say to your AI find me a skiing holiday and it will provide you with a perfect skiing holiday and I keep saying people don't decide like that. When you allow tech bros too much power over decision-m along with their running dog lackey in kind of management consultancy you're optimizing for something which may be very very distant from what your real world customers really care about. >> What makes Dyson so effective at advertising? Actually, it's it's not advertising? Actually, it's it's not advertising. It's marketing and it's advertising. It's marketing and it's customer experience. >> What's the difference between marketing and advertising? >> Advertising is a subordinate part of marketing. And do you think we're marketing. And do you think we're looking for efficiency in the wrong place? >> We usually do. And so, you focus too heavily on cost reduction and too little on value creation. >> What are the rules of good copy? If I asked you to teach me how to write good copy, how would you do that? >> I think a large part of it comes down to So, we first we were talking about this in the elevator. It was nine years ago. She back when podcasting wasn't even a thing. >> We must be able to dig out the original content presumably. Yeah. content presumably. Yeah. >> What was it? It was your podcast number 47 or something, was it? >> Oh, no. I think it was like 16 or something. Really? It was really low. something. Really? It was really low. We'll have to dig out the number, but uh it's been a long time since then. >> Oh, fabulous. Yeah. >> And and podcasting has exploded. I've been following Farum Street devotedly. >> Appreciate that. Um and uh it's always always interesting very very interesting on and I mean the whole question of the decision sciences uh is I think at the moment completely critical and actually by the way it'll be very very interesting with AI because I keep hearing people saying you will say to your AI find me a skiing holiday and it will provide you with the perfect skiing holiday and I keep saying people don't decide like that at the very least you'll have to show them three or four or five skiing holidays from which they choose because we can't really choose in the absence of comparison. It's what do you see what I mean? It's a sort of freakish element of free market capitalism which is we can only like something if we choose it in preference to something else. >> That's interesting. How does that relate to like a travel agency which would do that inherently? Like if you said I'm that inherently? Like if you said I'm going to India to chat GPT and you're like plan it for me versus you go to a travel agency and you're like I'm going to India plan it for me. Well among real estate agents there's apparently a kind of little bit of a trick which is you always in before you show someone the house you want to sell them. You show them a less appropriate house, ideally that's slightly more expensive, say, so that when they see the house that you want to sell them, it's now clearcut because they can say, "Ooh, it's a bit cheaper than the other one and it's got a conservatory." a conservatory." >> There's contrast. >> So there's a kind of decoy effect, a bit like the famous economist experiment with a decoy effect. So, you know, well, you know, one of my interesting questions is, you know, what interface will AI deploy to help us make choices and will it make the mistake that you could very easily make? If you think about it, nobody clicked the I'm feeling lucky button on Google. I think it's still there, isn't it? It's been there for years and they've removed it and found that it slightly reduces the appeal, but the number of people who actually click it, i.e., I'm feeling lucky, take me straight to a single page, is vanishingly small. people want to choose between, you know, effectively above the fold options. And um so, you know, I'm just intrigued because it's very very easy, I think, for people with an economic or tech background to make assumptions about what people are trying to do and how they choose and that we're, you know, utility maximizers and all this kind of thing only really to be completely wrong. Do you think we're looking for wrong. Do you think we're looking for efficiency in the wrong place? We usually do uh in the sense that when you pursue efficiency there are quite a few problems. But when you pursue efficiency generally you start looking at numerical or mechanical factors and of course in the process you disregard psychological factors where the greater gains may be found and so you focus too heavily on cost reduction and too little on value creation. I mean, one of the greatest creation. I mean, one of the greatest forms of efficiency, by the way, is employing a human being who's really, really nice. Now, this is complete really nice. Now, this is complete anathema to people in tech who love to define business processes so as to make them susceptible to automation. You know, person X does this. We will take that function, we will replace it with algorithm Y. And it's a very beguiling message because it usually comes with cost savings attached. You might have heard savings attached. You might have heard of my thing, the Dorman fallacy. Did you >> remind >> I'll remind the viewers and listeners uh which is simply that you know you you have a hotel it's a five-star hotel it has a dormant someone who welcomes incoming guests you know a combination of say McKenzie or Accenture and a tech firm will come in and say your dorman currently costs you $X,000 a year we have defined his or her function as opening the door we will replace said dorman with automatic door opening mechanism and an infrared human detector and we'll save you 30 $40,000 a year and then they walk away. They take the credit for the costsaving and then two years later, you know, the hotel's a catastrophe. The rack rates fallen off a cliff because the dorman was doing multiple things, many of which were human and kind of tacit. Security would be one. You know, there are no vagrants to sleep in the doorway, hailing taxis, dealing with luggage, recognizing regular guests, providing status to the hotel. There are loads and loads of value creation components to that dorman which aren't captured in the open the door definition. >> Is that an example of where the costs are really visible, but the benefits are >> correct? Yeah. So you it's very very >> correct? Yeah. So you it's very very easy management consulting firms uh if you if you're in a business and and some management consultants come in go to the management and say are they on a gain share agreement. A gain share agreement share agreement. A gain share agreement is a management consulting scam where you claim uh a certain percentage of the cost savings you identify in year one. Now as Roger L. Martin, your fellow Canadian and my own personal Svengali says, "Any idiot can cut costs." Okay. What takes real skill is cutting cost in a way that doesn't destroy value. One of the things that I don't think is understood by tech nerds and if I'm being really cruel, you know, males in general in in many cases is the extent to which in evaluating any business or experience, the human component of it, the face-to-face component does really really heavy lifting. And I've got a lovely story to illustrate this which I think is fantastic. It's the absolute perfect example of misalignment of optimization through quantification bias. So wonderful man Alex Bachelor bias. So wonderful man Alex Bachelor used to be the marketing director of Royal Mail, but you know similar to what you have with Canada Post, right? USPS. >> Mhm. Sorry, not US. Yes, just USPS. And they couldn't make any sense of the fact that the brand perception of Royal Mail bore no relation to service levels. So there would be districts and areas where you know every single firstass letter arrived early the following day extraordinarily reliable levels of service and royal mail wasn't particularly held in affection or esteem. There were other areas where the esteem. There were other areas where the service was frankly a bit ropey and people seemed to love it. Now, this obviously upset them because they thought that all the billions or certainly hundreds of millions they'd invested in service quality improvement should translate into customer satisfaction and therefore, you know, some sort of brand voltage. And someone had a theory and they said, I think something else is going on. And the theory which was put to the test and proved absolutely right was that the major determinant of whether you liked royal male or not was whether you liked your postman or posty technically to be used the genderneutral term. >> So people who had a rather unreliable service but the postman did the odd favor for them left things in the porch had a chat with them. Okay, those people thought it was a brilliant organization regardless of the actual metrics that were being pursued. And I think that's very true in uh any service organization. You know, you may there's organization. You know, you may there's an electricity company, a gas company, a water company, a utility. You may interact with them online 95% of the time, but the one or two occasions where you interact by telephone or face to face disproportionately affect your your perception of the organization. And I've argued for quite a time if I were being completely honest, I've worked in advertising for 36 years. And if I were a wholly honest person, uh, without, you know, fear of annoying my colleagues, probably 50% of the time, I would advise to a client, take 10 to 20% of your marketing budget and spend it on upgrading the call center. Pay the people too much. Get the best practitioners. I think it's perfectly practitioners. I think it's perfectly legitimate. In some organizations, there legitimate. In some organizations, there should be the very best call center people should be on six figures because it makes if you're good and nice, that's how much difference it makes. In other words, it more or less makes. In other words, it more or less drowns out all your other stuff, all the other noise. If every time you have a other noise. If every time you have a personal experience, you have a good experience, then broadly speaking in the human brain, uh that's a good organization which I can trust. And when you think about it, I suddenly realize why this probably is. We don't really have much evolved experience in evaluating postal efficiency, do we? Okay, we have quart of a million half a million years of evolved experience in deciding who to like and trust because for most of our evolutionary, you know, existence, that was one of the most fi five most important questions to get right. You know, do I trust this person? right. You know, do I trust this person? You know, will they attack me? Are they an ally? Are they a foe? Uh if I pay them money, will they deliver? And so consequently, I think what we do in our brains is we use our human judgment as a proxy. >> Now, a story to back up that, you probably remember this, okay? It's in my book, Alchemy, which is imagine you're turning up to buy a secondhand car and you turn up at the house, nondescript house, and the car is parked outside the house and you have a look at the car and you judge the, you know, whether the pedals are worn and the condition of the body work, and you have a look around the car. and you decide you're interested in paying, let's say, $5,000 for this car. So, you go and ring on the doorbell of the vendor and the door is answered in one situation by, for example, a female vicar. Okay? Could be Catholic. Well, they can't be Catholic, but you know, Episcopalian, doesn't really matter. Okay? Female vicar. And it's a tidy clean house. At that point, you probably upweight what you're prepared to pay by 20% or so. In in a parallel universe, the door so. In in a parallel universe, the door is answered by a guy in his underpants. In other words, someone with no shame. >> In that instance, you devalue the car, I suspect, by about $1,000 or more. In fact, you may not even buy it at all. And what we're doing here is we're effectively saying, what I'm going to do is a standin for the question, do I buy the car, which I don't have the technical knowledge to answer. I'm going to ask a supplementary heruristic question which is do I trust the person who's selling the car to me? >> And it's an interesting question. You my mother didn't know anything about cars, knew a lot about people. I think she would very reliably go around buying cars just through her assessment of the seller. And similarly, I think she might do better than someone with an engineering qualification who ignored who the seller was and their personality and character. Now, as a bit of evidence of this, I discovered because I've been investigating this, uh, various real estate agents have said to me that every estate agent does their utmost to make sure that until things are signed and sealed, the vendor never meets the buyer and vice versa. And the reason for that is if one of them doesn't like the other, they won't buy or sell. Now, when you think about it, that's completely unless the person's moving next door. Obviously, if you're buying a next door. Obviously, if you're buying a house from someone who's planning to move next door and they turn out to be a psycho, that's relevant information. But it seems to be the case that if you meet the the vendor and you basically don't trust them or think they're a bit shifty, it doesn't matter what the price is. It doesn't matter the condition of is. It doesn't matter the condition of the house. Suddenly, you revise your the house. Suddenly, you revise your valuation of the house downwards if you don't like the person selling it to you. And so that's one of the reasons why apparently uh real estate agents will leave any kind of contact between the two uh until after at least a survey has been done and enough commitments taken place. I once by the way I once didn't place. I once by the way I once didn't buy a house basically because the guy was being an about the fridge. Now the fridge was only worth uh you know I think 0.2% 2% uh of the value of the house or 0.02% of the value of the house. I can't quite remember. But because he was being a remember. But because he was being a dick about the fridge, I no longer trusted him about the house. >> Yeah. >> Weirdly, it turned out my instinct was right because then a friend of ours went to buy the same house. They got some separate land registry search done and found out that a chunk of the garden actually belonged to Network Rail, not to the house. It effectively filed a large part of the garden. So does that mean I just want to garden. So does that mean I just want to go back to the the real estate thing for a second. Does that mean a second. Does that mean pretty or attractive real estate agents would be more successful than >> It's a really interesting question which is I think we you know I think we ought to study these things much more because the assumption of an economist is that you need to disintermediate >> you don't need estate agents we just go on willow Zillow sorry or right move in the UK or whatever it is what's the Canadian equivalent >> I don't even know >> cababins.com or whatever okay.com Yeah, we go. Exactly. You go on one of those things. You choose the house you those things. You choose the house you want. You look at it. You then look at want. You look at it. You then look at the house, get a survey done, buy the house. We assume that there is, you house. We assume that there is, you know, this is a purely transactional exchange. Maybe in a rational world, that's exactly what it would be. >> But for one thing, actually, someone who's invested 15 years in doing up a house probably cares about what the person buying it is going to do to the house. So, my parents-in-law, for example, are fanatical gardeners. Uh, don't get into fanatical gardeners. Uh, don't get into this. Seriously, get into something like this. Seriously, get into something like crack. >> We have no worry that I'm going to >> No worry you're going to become an enthusiastic. >> Can barely keep a plant alive. >> Good, good, good. Okay. Um, but I guarantee if you went and looked around their house and placed an offer while being an expert in botany and generally quoting people like Gertude Jel and, you know, prominent garden designers and Sissinghurst and Da uh you could you could buy their house for 200,000 less than if you turned up and said, "Brilliant, we can knock down that tree and put in a helipad." Yeah. >> You know, I think if you said, "We can knock down that tree and put in a carting track." Right. I don't think carting track." Right. I don't think they'd sell it to you at any price. >> If you're a founder, you know naming your startup takes forever.

Richard Thaylor did I think his most interesting work of all is actually on the concept of transaction utility which you may remember do you remember this >> a little bit >> yeah it's in I think it's in nudge and the famous thought experiment is this which I find fascinating and I think it's a really insightful thought experiment so the idea is you and your best friend are lying on a beach somewhere and it's hot and you're very thirsty and about quarter of a mile down the beach there's a place that sells ice cold beer And your friend says to you, and he asks people to imagine this, your friend says to you, "I'm off to blank to buy a beer. Tell me what the maximum amount you're happy to pay for a beer is. And if the price they quote falls is. And if the price they quote falls below that threshold, okay, I will buy the beer. And if not, I won't." And he the beer. And if not, I won't." And he asked people to imagine what the threshold would be of what they'd pay for a beer on a hot day when they were parched on a beach for a cold beer. the beer is going to be consumed back where they're sitting. So the ambiance or you know the the clientele of the establishment selling the beer is irrelevant because you're not going to consume it there. And the interesting thing is in one situation he says there is a boutique hotel selling chilled beer >> and in the other situation he says there's a shack selling cold beer >> and your price changes >> and your your your readiness to pay changes partly in accordance to what you imagine to be the overheads of the establishment selling the good. Even though the >> even though the the utility of the beer as distinct from the how good the transaction feels >> the actual utility of the cold beer is identical in both cases. I think that's a I think that's Richard Thaylor and I think it's extraordinarily interesting because I think we can make you car car salesmen will know this you know make the transaction feel good make them feel good when they drive out of the place that was uh segini right you you know people are more likely to buy from you if they like you they're more likely to uh like you if they trust you and you have something in common with them and and you can use all of these things to manipulate people unfortunately It's not manipulation. Be careful on that because No, no, no. We got to be really care. I think we got to be really careful here. One, one thing might be that a genuine cold-blooded psychopath would intentionally might find it difficult. This is a Jeffrey Miller theory that if you're on a first date, there's an element where apparently, it's a long time. I've been married for 30 something time. I've been married for 30 something years, but women on a first date will turn up a bit late or do something a little bit annoying. And Miller's theory is that it's a psychopath detection test. So that if you >> Interesting. So, you know, one of the >> Interesting. So, you know, one of the worst things that can happen to women is to get into a relationship with someone who's, you know, psychopathic because you end up with an empty bank account and a, you know, and, you know, your sister's pregnant by her everything go, you know, everything goes hopelessly wrong. Someone who's written very wrong. Someone who's written very interestingly about this, by the way, is fabulous woman who writes about education and absolutely brilliant. I I'll remember her name in a second, but she's written quite about this having a psychopath in the family. Likewise, Kevin Dutton um has also written about this about his own father. There are certain things which you can do which make it very likely that psychopaths will out themselves. So the perfect test might be you bribe the waiter to tip soup on them. >> Oh, interesting. >> And they'll lose it. >> Or you turn up late and someone like assuming you're not a psycho because you're Canadian. So you know that's you're Canadian. So you know that's probably >> by default we're not >> relatively low. We're too polite. >> You're too polite. Exactly. Yes. It'd be too tiring to be a psychopath in Canada, wouldn't it? >> Soup on me. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been sitting here. >> It's I shouldn't have been here. My fault. I got in the way of your soup. Uh the psychopath will lose lose his rag. >> Um uh and can't control this. And likewise, if you turn up late, there's a chance they'll go, "Look, I've been sitting on my own like an idiot for 15 minutes." Whereas you and I would go, minutes." Whereas you and I would go, "Oh, I know. I only just got here myself. The traffic's terrible." myself. The traffic's terrible." >> Yeah. We don't fully know, you see, the value of what is going on in using a personal quality as a proxy for a decision which is simply too complicated to legalize or to reduce to numbers. Also, it is I'll completely agree in economic terms, it's suboptimal, but if it leads to downside variance reduction, which is what we're really trying to do. We're not trying to optimize. We're trying to reduce the optimize. We're trying to reduce the risk of downsize. Yeah. Downside variance, you know, and that's true in all sorts of things, investment strategy, etc. You know, the barbell approach, you know, first of all, make sure you don't don't do anything disastrous. Then after that, try and get disastrous. Then after that, try and get lucky. >> You you say it like it's a conscious thing, but I think it's an unconscious because because if it is conscious, it's probably a reverse signal that you're actually a bit uh offkilter. if you're consciously doing that. >> In fairness, if if you study social science matters, you've probably but I agree with you that the I mean my wife occasionally gets a bit annoyed with me because I'll get you know I will literally apply TALB logic to decisions. Just to give an example, I always argue that over 36 years holidays where I've rented a car are better than holidays where I haven't. And my argument is you have more optionality. See? >> Oh, interesting. So if you've rented a car and you find the hotel's a bit meh or the hotel's not in a great area, you can just get in the car and go and find a beach somewhere else and go there every day. You know, in other words, you every day. You know, in other words, you know, so I deploy occasionally we'll deploy these kind of taleb lines and I, you know, I'll also say let's fly from so and so because you know it's the satisfices. You you're the one who I remember this you said you should always fly from the smallest airport that's convenient for you. Is that it? you. Is that it? >> Oh, I'm I'm a big small airport thing person. Okay. person. Okay. >> Yeah. Yeah. Actually, it's it's kind of interesting because airports are schizophrenic in a way because the clientele of an airport is roughly speaking a 50/50 mix between people who fly a hell of a lot and just want to get through the damn thing as quickly as they can. And people who only fly once a they can. And people who only fly once a year who regard the trip to the airport as part of the holiday and they love going through a shopping center and looking at Hermes outlets or whatever. And so airports are effectively catering for two totally disperate groups of traveler. >> And you can separate these people in the security line effectively. >> You can absolutely you can separate them. And that's why you know um in a them. And that's why you know um in a weird kind of way I think you notice sometimes that the queue for the priority lane in security is longer than the queue for the amateur lane. But frequent business travelers will still join the priority lane on the assumption that the people in front of them are more competent. I mean there's a George more competent. I mean there's a George Clooney up in the air gag about that right and so it is very interesting because is it is it irrational if it's a very reliable mechanism so all right one example would be I don't think it I don't think it works very well nowadays because there are enough posh spivs around but in the you know in the 19th century if you were a posh and respected real estate agent you had a lot of reputational skin in the game in the local community both commercially in people, you know, so you were highly vulnerable to reputational damage both commercially and also socially >> because you know a small town or a you know would have been to a large extent a prestige economy >> and therefore you know dealing with the posh local estate agent rather than some guy who claims to be cheap is not irrational. you know then that you know irrational. you know then that you know the commission may be higher whatever it may be but in terms of reputational skin in the game as insurance against being you know treated appallingly but and you know I think there's a kind of weird thing going on which is that uh you know the the job of the real estate agent is to some extent to be the person who stays behind in the place where the house is sold to suffer the reputational consequences of you know of anything outrageous because the vendor of the house isn't really reputationally vulnerable if they're moving 300 miles away. >> Mhm. >> And so, you know, some of the role of these intermediaries is just highly complicated. >> But when I say that, you know, we fundamentally seem to attach very very high waiting to, for example, a call center experience versus website design. I'm not suggesting for a second website design isn't really important. It's it's almost like there's some experiences that are sort of additive or subtractive and then there's some that are multiplicative >> like you can multiply by zero or you can multiply by 10 like a difference in that one particular factor. There's a there's a really interesting organization I can't remember what they're called online they call this a brand quake. >> A brand quake is where you do something. It could be resolving a problem really well. That would be a very good well. That would be a very good opportunity for a brandquake. The person has a problem. you put quite a lot of effort and intelligence into solving it very effectively for them. Um and then you ring them back to check that the problem has indeed been solved. Now that would be an example of something I'll give you the per okay I'll give you the perfect story of this. My father uh who is you know half Scottish and um without stereotyping anybody was quite parimonious with what he bought generally. I mean I'm not I'm not saying generally. I mean I'm not I'm not saying it's genetic by the way. just culturally he was descended from long lines of Highland Scots who didn't get where they were today by you know splashing out and he had a I think three um when he died he had three or four Dyson devices which he'd bought from new in his home he had one on each floor to save from carrying them upstairs. Now these are by any them upstairs. Now these are by any objective measure pretty expensive vacuum cleaners. Mhm. vacuum cleaners. Mhm. >> One of the reasons he was so fanatically loyal was that Dyson, now interestingly, I'm going to make a point here, which is a privately owned company. >> Mhm. >> And that and do not do not underestimate the importance of this. PLC's or um uh or or companies on the NASDAQ or the New York Stock Exchange are incentivized to behave like psychopaths because they're optimized around short-term transactional value, not long-term relationship building. I think maybe the the generalization is that like if they're private companies led by a founder, then they're not run by the finance department. It's so interesting. I think about this a lot where you you have these short-term optimization and long-term effectiveness are two completely different. >> Short-term money off versus long-term value on. >> Yeah. Yeah. And so you can there's always somebody making more money than you, but you maybe they're cutting corners, maybe they're doing things that are unsustainable. And like you said, are unsustainable. And like you said, you can always save money in the short term, but do you damage your brand in life? >> By the way, my theory is the primary reason for the success of these private companies. It the secondary reason is companies. It the secondary reason is they look after their consumers better because they're effectively uh unwittingly their practitioners in the customer value movement, not the shareholder value movement. Well, Buffett had this saying where his directive, his letter I guess to all of his CEOs after he acquired the company was the only expectation I have for you is to treat this company as if you and your family have 100% of your money in it for 100 years and you can't take it out. >> Exactly that. Yeah. >> And and I think that that approach enables even in a public company that enables people to take long-term do the thing that's optimal. actually they do something they do something they look after their customers and there is an interesting exception to this probably which is for example Costco which and actually enterprise rental car is familyowned isn't it enterprise is familyowned >> in the and I've told everybody this in the IPA advertising effectiveness awards in the UK my argument is that with the exception of PNG Dagio unilver marketing le companies I don't think that plc's what do you call them in you know publicly traded I don't think they can actually do marketing very well >> because the requirement for short-term self-justification and numbers effectively overrides the real purpose of marketing which is investment in long-term customer value. >> I think this is why generalizing a little bit but this is why founders outperform even when they lead public corporations. They have the same corporations. They have the same pressures, the same analysts, the same but they also are considering posterity aren't they? What is my legacy? I mean, aren't they? What is my legacy? I mean, it's interesting actually the German car industry, although their public companies are sort of familyrun. Aldi famously, which owns Trader Joe's, is basically owned by actually two German families. They had a huge feud, but some families. They had a huge feud, but some things going on there. One of the things they do is they look after their staff better. And I think when you look after better. And I think when you look after your staff better, the customer notices. >> Well, this is part of the Costco thing. So, I mean, >> Costco. Exactly. But that comes from the >> Costco. Exactly. But that comes from the Saul Price line of thinking which when he started FedMart he sort of outlined the obligation of our business is we have a fidiciary relationship with a customer. Yeah. customer. Yeah. >> And Jim Sagal who founded Costco was a student of Saul Price and later on they would merge the companies. >> Of course they did, didn't they? Yes, you're absolutely right. Yeah. >> Yeah. And I I think that's interesting right where you treat your employees better. Uh nice story from Dyson which better. Uh nice story from Dyson which is familyowned. In fact, I think is familyowned. In fact, I think familyrun companies, this would include people like um SC Johnson. I think they should wear a badge. Do you see what I mean? Just as you have a kite mark on mean? Just as you have a kite mark on British >> Well, Lob Laws is familyowned, isn't it? For example, in Canada, family, >> family control McCain family control. Mhm. >> So what I was saying about the advertising effectiveness awards, four out of the five gold winners, it's only every two years this award and it's very very rigorously judged. Four out of the five winners, namely McCain, your >> Canadian uh heroes. Um McCain, Yorkshire Tea, Specs Savers, and Laithweights, a wine company. Four out of the five wine company. Four out of the five winners, the fifth one was Guinness, which is sort of a family company in a sense, although it's owned by a Dio. And so my point is that I, you know, we should actually have a kite mark that allows consumers to prefer to buy from companies which aren't listed on some stock exchange somewhere and hence aren't controlled by the finance function because they're more trustworthy. >> That's an interesting I don't know if I agree with that, but u it's interesting to think. >> Well, is Rogers what's is Rogers still family controlled? I mean, Canada's family controlled? I mean, Canada's absolutely packed full of Canadian tier. What about that? Increasingly you get family controlled but not economically controlled. So you have like a dual controlled. So you have like a dual class. >> So the western family would control lob laws to some extent even though they're not majority shareholder. >> Well I think if you if you have a corporation that's hundreds of billions and you control 10 or 15% of it. You effectively have control over the company. >> Of course. Yeah. Ford Motor Company falls into that definition. I think the f you know the family or some there's a particular class of shares. >> A lot of dual class coming. But hold on, I want to go back to Dyson for a sec. What makes Dyson so effective at advertising? >> Actually, it's it's not advertising, it's marketing and it's customer experience. >> What's the difference between marketing and advertising? >> Advertising is a subordinate part of marketing. And uh in many cases, even marketing. And uh in many cases, even though I've worked in advertising for 36 years, I I I want to think of myself probably unsuccessfully, but I still aspire to be a marketer, okay? not an advertising person because advertising is a useful toolkit available to the marketer and by the way generally is pretty effective but Peter Ducker the purpose of business is to find and keep a customer profitably uh that's the purpose of marketing it's to you know to you know to either create or find uh customers with whom over time you can engage in mutually advantageous relationships to mutual profit that's it >> so what makes Dyson so good at marketing? >> Well, the story I heard from someone who worked at Dyson for 12 years is that he was sitting in a presentation, James Dyson presiding and they were presenting the call center sort of efficiency statistics. By the way, I'm absolutely fanatical about call centers because I'm terrified that in an AI age, people will try and effectively automate them. Uh I think what you should do instead is make them slightly smaller but a lot better >> because I don't think you can substitute for the human in cases of unusual problems, special circumstances, empathy generally. Don't get me wrong, I think generally. Don't get me wrong, I think you can get AI empathy. I'm not suggesting that AI is going to be completely unempathic, but at some point it's rather like the equivalent of I want to speak to the manager. There will be situations where you want to speak to a person who can understand your specific situation and has the power to intervene to override the normal rules and regulations to solve your problem because it is common sensical to do so. Even if you know our what service level agreement doesn't normally allow us to send out a replacement part. In this case, since your part is faulty, >> somebody who has the power to do the right thing Got it. Exactly. And I think you know I Got it. Exactly. And I think you know I I think that will ultimately you'll have to have the human as the last port of call on that. Also your call center is the only way you can find out the problems that people can't solve anywhere else. Do you see what I mean? anywhere else. Do you see what I mean? So there was a very smart person I met at Microsoft who when they uh when they took over some fairly niche Microsoft product they put the call center in the middle of the development team. I mean, I would argue that the call center of British Airways should be on the same floor as the boardroom because it's where you find out where you're going wrong with your existing customers who are the most important people. You know, people talk a lot about product market fit, sales tactics, or pricing strategy. But the truth is, pricing strategy. But the truth is, success in selling often comes down to something much simpler, the system behind the sale. That's why I use and love Shopay because nobody does selling better than Shopify.

So often the businesses are run by the map which is like the spreadsheets, the volumes, the wait times, the whatever, but the territory is the customer calling in and the problem. >> That's cool, isn't it? >> The map is not the territory. >> Yeah. That they're experiencing. And so if you're not touching reality, you can get distorted by the map. But I want to go back. You've said by the way exactly go back. You've said by the way exactly the same thing Dan Davis did which is one huge advantage of being a customer value company not a shareholder value company is that customers live in the real world and therefore you are actually rooted in reality whereas shareholders by the way not share owners but the shareholders are principally interested in justifying their own existence to their investors and therefore they're dealing with a highly artificial construct in terms of defining the value of a customer But I think what's best for the shareholders is what's best for the customer. It's just the timeline mismatch that people have. So if your timeline for well it's have. So if your timeline for well it's incoherent by the way the shareholder value movement is totally incoherent because over what time frame which shareholder is what are you optimizing for? It's a completely incoherent for? It's a completely incoherent nonsense which is very very friendly to stock market analysts who want a ready supply of quarterly data so they can their way out of things. How valuable it is to people with pensions is a completely separate matter because one of the things it does is it prevents companies from innovating effectively and it prevents them from investing properly in customer relationships. >> Okay. Come back to Dyson. You were telling me this story. Somebody had worked there for 12 years. >> So they were going blah blah blah average call time blah blah blah average wait time and it was the standard kind of call center metrics about effectively how quickly can we get these people off the phone. I mean it's a bit more the phone. I mean it's a bit more sophisticated than that. You know, I'm sure there's some measure of satisfaction, but it was kind of evaluating the call center on an operational efficiency standpoint. And Dyson basically said, "Stop right now. You've got this all wrong. The way we should look at this is we should treat it as an honor if one of our customers chooses to get in touch with us, and we should therefore respond to them accordingly, as if we're flattered by the contact, not as if we're bothered by the interruption or words to that effect. I'm I'm putting words in his effect. I'm I'm putting words in his mouth, but this is roughly speaking what the person said happened in the meeting. >> That makes a lot of sense. I mean, >> and by the way, that's why my father had four Dyson. Stingy man though he was. I four Dyson. Stingy man though he was. I hope he won't mind me saying this, my late father. But every time he rang them late father. But every time he rang them up, which might have been only once every year. >> Yeah. >> They did something astonishing and they were really, really helpful and they solved the problem and the part arrived the next day. Sometimes they didn't even charge for the replacement part and therefore he completely trusted those people and therefore was willing to pay an enormous premium really over other vacuum cleaners which might have had the same notional you know effectiveness precisely because of that trust. There's so much opportunity here, right? If you think of you competing in a world where we're moving to AIdriven call centers, uh if I took the exact opposite approach, which is by the way, you should do both. >> A really, really good service organization allows for very streamlined efficient service for people who know exactly what they want and extremely emp empathetic service for people who are undecided, uncertain or find themselves in an unusual situation. And so you need to do both. And that's that's where I think the tech bros have got it all wrong because they see the opportunity of tech as being a one-way street towards ever greater efficiency, streamlining. And let's face it, tech streamlining. And let's face it, tech bros are not neurotypical in terms of what they want from things. When you allow tech bros too much power over decision-making along with their running dog lackey in kind of management consultancy, you're optimizing for something which may be very very distant from what your real world customers really care about. >> You're using tech crows as like a >> No, no, no, no. It's perfectly reasonable to say that the people who work in this field and not representative of the whole human population. That's a reasonable population. That's a reasonable assertion. >> What is it you're representing when you say tech bro though? Um, anybody in a tech industry, just as anybody in advertising, myself included, is overweighted towards a belief in the ability of advertising to solve all problems. And I will truly admit that I am guilty as charged. Um, however, ad people don't get that much opportunity to convince other people of the rightness of their argument. What has happened is that in marketing for example the tech companies the consulting firms that sell stacks and I owe a lot of this to a guy called Adel Bori very interesting self-taught Libyan marketing writer former boxer Annel Bori and I coined the phrase technopplasmosis by analogy with toxopplasmosis which is tech people and consultants have taken over the finance department >> so that the marketing metrics the finance department has faith in and demands from marketing are not those metrics which are most conducive to building brand and customer value over time. They're the metrics which are most time. They're the metrics which are most conducive to selling tech solutions to the companies. >> What are the metrics that are most >> well it's all about short-term transactional uh bottom of the funnel um clickth through you know how can you shovel money to meta in a slightly more efficient way. It's not about long-term efficient way. It's not about long-term value creation at all right now. Now, don't get me wrong. All that bottom of the funnel short-term transactional stuff is very important to get right. I'm not I'm not disparaging it, but it's only a third of the game, >> right? >> And they're not interested in the other two/irds of the game because they don't make money if someone spends money on their call center or, you know, upgrades their call center staff or allows the call center staff to call out. >> It's sort of like cyber security. It's seen as a cost. It's a cost. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, Bonnie Blue would do really well in this because she's all about the numbers, not about the quality of the relationship. You know, funny enough, she did work in NHS finance procurement. Ironically, or no, finance recruitment actually. She recruited people for N for National Health Service finance. So, her approach to sex is merely an extrapolation of what she learned, I think, recruiting finance people for the National Health Service. All all about the quantity, not Service. All all about the quantity, not about the value creation, the the relationship. I like this quantification relationship. I like this quantification bias thinking I mean Buffett okay you're quite rightly your hero um is he was obsessed with the quality of the management of companies with whom he invested wasn't he >> well I mean I'm obsessed with personal factors I've read a lot in I think I'm going to give a nuanced answer here I don't know the answer so I'll preface that with that I did read a lot about what he used to do in the 60s and he used to hire like private investigators And what he was trying to determine, I don't think it was anything about the person other than does what they say line up with who they are. >> And if the answer's yes, I can deal with that because I know what to expect. And if the answer's no, if they're they can't go to work and, you know, claim to be a penny pincher, because if they go to work and say they're going to cut costs, but they're driving around with a Ferrari or whatever, like this is a thing that it doesn't line up. And so I I feel like he was always just trying to assess the predictability of people if that makes sense. >> In other words, by looking at their consistency >> consistency did the management >> do what they said they were going to do. the balance sheet changes over you know like he was a very he had a different emphasis on things than people I think realize and I think with a lot of his investments I mean my personal take is he was looking for predictability and it wasn't about massive disruption it was never about things being turned around he got out of that in the late60s with diversified refilling was the last real turnaround situation they sort of got themselves into they exited quickly and when They got burned. Did they quite Well, they didn't really get burned, but I was talking to Munger about this over dinner one day and he's like, "We just realized that we made a mistake. Uh, we were never going to make a lot of money in this business and it was highly competitive and we had no edge and so they got out as quickly as they could." Uh, and I think that the predictability of what he buys, at least his long-term holdings, like if you look at that, I think it's really interesting because it's like you can kind of see it. The railroad, people are going to be using the railroad in 50 years. That's a great example. So, it will be unbelievably example. So, it will be unbelievably difficult to build a competing one, >> but you can also you can leverage it if it's predictable. And leverage is is it's predictable. And leverage is is this interesting thing where he says they don't do a lot. And they don't when you look at the whole company, but on the railroad, for instance, they'll a decent amount of debt in the railroad because they know what the earnings it's very predictable the same as the energy where they're putting a lot of capital they put a lot of debt in and I talked to this guy in um Nova Scotia John Bragg and he sort of did the same thing and so he c he created Oxford frozen foods he's this incredible story he's this billionaire from this small town of 1100 people he started >> I've been to Nova Scotia what's it called Oxford Nova >> it's called Oxford Nova Scotia and started not one, not two, but three multi-billion dollar companies from this small town of,00 people. >> Is he still there? >> He's still there. Yeah. They're like that. >> Such a great guy, too. And it was fascinating to talk to him because he basically was like, "Look, you know, he owns North America's largest private telecommunications company." And he telecommunications company." And he said, "I wasn't afraid of debt at all." No. >> And we levered up massively. We went all in multiple times acquiring more assets, acquiring, >> but if there's something more volatile, he gets very nervous about the debt. >> So, he wouldn't do it if there was volatility. But he also had this thing volatility. But he also had this thing where it was so counterintuitive to what you hear on Wall Street, which is is like, I don't mind paying more, you know? I don't mind paying the most. Uh, know? I don't mind paying the most. Uh, and I was like, really, that surprises me. And he's like, well, a lot of these me. And he's like, well, a lot of these things only come up once. I don't get another shot at it. And if I'm a private company, I don't have public company shareholders, uh, and it takes me, you know, 5 years versus 3 years to get my money back out of the deal, why do I care? I'm never going to be offered this care? I'm never going to be offered this again, and they're not going to build another one. >> No. >> So, when it comes to fiber optic in the ground, he's like, it's getting harder and harder to do. >> What is this company, the Canadian company in telecoms? >> Uh, it's East Link Cable Communications. >> I've heard that. Yeah. And so, but they not only do they deliver cable to a large portion of Canada, but they own a lot of infrastructure that people aren't aware of. And he's like, well, what aware of. And he's like, well, what difference does it make? And I've been chewing on that nugget ever since. And you know, you can apply this from a marketing perspective as well, right? If you if you have a client or go back to real estate for a sec. I have a client who's looking at a lakehouse or a cabin or a cottage or whatever you call them in in the UK or in the United States and you get a property and you say my budget is I don't know say 500,000 and you find a property that's seven and is it worth splurging on the $700,000 property or whatever it is and the answer is is this like a once in a generation property that I'm never going to have the shot at again and if you can frame frame things >> is also much more likely to be scarce >> the rarer you get generally >> and then overpaying you make overpaying seem rational and in a way it kind of is rational where it's like well this is only going to come up once so like I I have a friend actually going through this now they're looking at buying a family cottage and I'm like how do you think about these things he's like I saw this one it was perfect but it was a little more money than I brought this up having a cottage on a lake on which yours is the only cottage is the kind of gold standard for Canadian property. >> That would be the dream. Have a lot of lakes. Yes. But I'd always heard that as lakes. Yes. But I'd always heard that as a kind of >> but it's sort of like what what do you want? If you want a second property, you want? If you want a second property, you want proximity so it's easy to get to. You want privacy. Uh so there's not a lot of things around it. And these things just don't come up very often as many lakes as we have. I mean the the prime properties come up maybe once every five or six years per lake. And >> and as Kaden said, in the long term, we're all dead. >> And we're all dead. So anyway, an interesting aside here, but when we sat down, we were talking about high trust versus low trust societies and introducing friction. Yeah. I'm introducing friction. Yeah. I'm wondering, spend a beat on that for a second. >> Well, I met um someone you must interview, by the way, called Philip K. Howard, who's written various books called Life Without Lawyers. He's just written a book which is coming out right now called um uh I think it's uh can do which is restoring the spirit of American can do and he argues that a large part of economic decline and social malaise has come from the overintrusion of law and regulation into practices which should properly be left to subjective human judgment. that we've created a culture where people are so afraid of making a subjective decision that they fall back on often totally inappropriate rules and regulations. And there are a whole bunch of people who are employed not always by the government just as much by the private sector who are much more interested in adherence to uh approved procedure than they are in quality of outcome. >> Because you can't get fired for >> you can't get fired for following the rules. >> You can't get me in trouble. Well, you told me to follow this proced and common sense would be to opt out at some point in certain situations and use your brain and judgment and uh but if I do that if I have if I do very little parapet there's no upside uh and there's considerable uh reputational risk and and career risk >> from doing something slightly perverse and different. But there are a whole and different. But there are a whole bunch of arguments. First of all, an awful lot of quality human decision-making of necessity has to be tacit and instinctive, not regulatory. There are various people I think it might be Michael Palani who says most of life is like a kaleidoscope. We never completely encounter the same situation twice. Mhm. twice. Mhm. >> And therefore regulating for the universal when in fact the great evolutionary gift of the human brain is adapting to context is inherently lawyers love it of course because they make money out of this. You know, arguably uh the legal system, particularly in the United States, has strayed into all kinds of areas which were once settled by two humans amicably discussing something and possibly finding a creative resolution to to the trade-off that's replaced by effectively we will take this to a legal decision and that starts to infect um particularly because there's no tor law reform in the US and that's partly Because I was told yesterday trial lawyers are among the largest donors to the Democratic Party because they resist any kind of tort law reform. M >> this has led to things that should be solved through our evolved human talent for conflict resolution being solved through totally inappropriate application of of uh legal structures to a situation which is uh in many cases not really adequately captured by law or where a legal decision is made which makes perfect sense within one setting but which sets a precedent which leads to ludicrous second order consequences. Yeah. So for example, if you accept the fact that a I think has happened in one of uh Philip K. Howard's cases, someone demanded that trees were dropped down in their street because one of their grandchildren was allergic to the nut that came off the tree. The argument would be that if you accept that, which may seem kind-hearted and uh you know and and generous within that particular frame of reference, ultimately you've opened up the path to widespread deforestation because nobody can grow a tree anywhere to which anybody could claim to be allergic. There's an interesting case um allergic. There's an interesting case um in England where someone broke into a theme park or some park of some kind and then while drunk dove into a pond which wasn't really deep and hurt themselves and then sued in the lower courts they said there should have been a notice warning of the shallow water because you could reasonably anticipate this problem and then it went up to the high whatever whoever it was the lawlords at the time and they said if you took if you took this ruling to its uh uh you know natural consequences you would have no lakes you know you would have no swimming you would have no swings you'd have no playgrounds because everything would have to be ge around with warnings about every possible anticipated negative consequence that could arise from this part of the environment and so what what happens is that uh you've created a kind of idea I suppose where the legal solution has become the default >> uh when it should in fact be the last resort. >> What happened to common sense? >> Well, this is this is the argument being that that your fellow countrymen, what's his name? Um Rston Saul, John Rston his name? Um Rston Saul, John Rston Saul. Have you come across him? Saul. Have you come across him? >> No. >> You Canadians totally underrate yourselves. You know, you produce yourselves. You know, you produce wonderful people and you're always trying to import people like me from the UK or people from the US. John Rolston saw wrote this book which I think is called Voltater's Bastards >> and he argues that human brains have evolved with a variety of mental capabilities only one of which is the capacity for reason. >> There's also the capacity for imagination, creativity, common sense, you know, etc. We have a whole variety of different mental mechanisms at our disposal gifted to us by, you know, a few million years of evolution as a social species. And yet we've made social species. And yet we've made rationality the gold standard. This is what's weird about working in advertising, by the way. And I think it's probably similar way. And I think it's probably similar to theoretical physics and it's probably similar to entrepreneurialism. Okay, which is what's unusual about those fields is that rationality is the bronze standard >> in advertising. If someone says, you know, uh this is the problem and you come up with a completely rational solution, um people don't go, right, that's perfect. let's go and do it as that's perfect. let's go and do it as they would do in a finance setting or a compliance setting. Okay? In most of compliance setting. Okay? In most of decision- making in institutions, rationality, i.e. quality of rationality, i.e. quality of argumentation is the gold standard. In advertising, if you came up with a rational ad, people go, "Yeah, it's all right, but can you do a bit better?" You know, is there an ad that says the same thing, but in a more emotionally engaging way? Is there an ad that says engaging way? Is there an ad that says the same thing in a way that's funny? Is there an ad that says this in a way people will remember or will act on? So what is funny about being an advertising creative and you know I spent 20 years of my life either in or managing those departments is you know the rational solution is where you start >> you use it as a springboard to something better. There's a famous quote, you better. There's a famous quote, you know, fascinatingly from Neil Spore who said, "You're not thinking, you are merely being logical." Isn't it? I think you'll know that >> he was an interesting guy, wasn't he? In terms of his because he also was the person who said the opposite of a good idea, you know, in boring physics, the opposite of a good idea is wrong, but in high level physics, the opposite of a good idea might be another good idea. >> Mhm. >> Yeah. What can we learn from marketing from the madmen era that's still true today? Uh today? Uh >> I think there was an understanding then and the remuneration of agencies respected this because you were paid on commission. So if you had a big idea and commission. So if you had a big idea and you came up with a campaign and the client spent millions running the campaign, you made money from that campaign for years after you'd conceived it. So it was rather like having it. So it was rather like having royalties on a book. >> Oh, okay. >> We didn't realize that at the time. Then media independence came along and so we had to be paid by the hour like lawyers and management consultants and we've never recovered because it's a catastrophic way to be paid and the reason it's a catastrophic way to be paid my argument is that marketing is actually fat tailed so is innovation R&D pharmaceutical research science okay in other words 5 to 10% of what you do delivers perhaps 110% of the value and therefore paying people by the power and demanding that every quantum of effort has to be matched to a quantum of value creation in some neat proportion. This is so the way market never mind advertising that okay right let's look at the whole of marketing as a discipline within an organization of which advertising is not a not necessarily very important part you know for a lot of organizations it may be you know relatively trivial what they actually spend on bought communication on the other hand uh you know how you design your reception or you know whatever you know that's still affected the application of psychology to value creation let's say you have a brilliant idea and the value of that idea last goes on for 10 years. And I've seen this happen all the time. The agency, let's say an agency had the idea. It may well have been the client who had that idea. They are held responsible for every single unit of cost they incur >> year by year by year by year. You cannot offset any of those costs against the value you created in 2023 by having a huge idea. Let me give you an example. huge idea. Let me give you an example. There's an enormous idea for a very large enormous American, let's say, fastmoving consumer goods company. There's an idea conceived by Oglev Australia. It has made that company in Australia. It has made that company in excess of a billion dollars in the last 10 years. It's still running. It runs in 10 years. It's still running. It runs in something like a hundred markets. Still useful today. For that idea, the agency in Australia got paid $350,000 Australian dollars. Or rather, that's Australian dollars. Or rather, that's what they made from it. So in other words, you have a billion dollar idea, you get to buy a small flat in a crap part of Sydney. Now what I'm saying is that this is not me bleing about the advertising industry. It's saying that advertising industry. It's saying that anything like R&D or marketing which is fat tailed, in other words, a small percentage of what you do, it's Jeff Bezos's point about in business, you know, in baseball you can only score four, in business you can score a thousand. In marketing thousand. In marketing when you score a thousand which and the purpose half the purpose of marketing is not operational gradual incremental improvement it's finding another way to hit the ball out of the park and score 100. If you cannot claim the credit for 100. If you cannot claim the credit for that except to the extent that it delivers value in the quarter in which you had the idea or the financial year in which you had the idea you are underfunding your marketing effort. So, it's like saying to imagine if you went to JK Rowling and said, "Yep, you can have the royalties on the Harry Potter books, but only on the first edition." And consequently, long-term marketing ideas when you're paid by the hour or when you're evaluated by the quarter as marketers would be. Now, you wouldn't go into a pharmaceutical research company and said, "You invent a blockbuster drug this week." No. Or you're all fired. You this week." No. Or you're all fired. You accept the fact that you spend a load of money effectively. Okay, this is the money effectively. Okay, this is the brutal truth. Okay, you don't you don't brutal truth. Okay, you don't you don't find entrepreneurs in chess clubs. You find entrepreneurs in casinos. They're playing poker. They're playing bat gam. You know, they're playing games of chance with an occasional very high payoff. And a lot of life is exactly payoff. And a lot of life is exactly like that, but you don't know where the huge payoff's going to come in advance. The people who are running these organizations for the benefit of financial predictability are trying to make it chess. They're trying to turn it into a reductionist game where the most you can score is one for a win. >> They're trying to put a ceiling on. >> They're trying effectively to to to pretend it's a high variance mechanis low sorry a low variance mechanistic predictable process. >> 50 50% of your effort in life once you've ensured the fact that you're not going to starve to death, die, etc. You know, you've looked after your children should be attempts to get lucky. In other words, what Nim would say, I love this phrase, uh, increasing your surface area exposure to posit to positive upside optionality. You know, finding upside optionality. You know, finding opportunity. But hold on for one sec. I opportunity. But hold on for one sec. I want to go back to this. I want to think about this out loud here. And maybe I'm wrong. With a book, it's great. I write wrong. With a book, it's great. I write a book once, I can sell it for the next hundred years, assuming I've earned it on my road. >> Yeah. If you have a great marketing idea which continues to add value for the next 15 years, the difference some of that credit should be offset against your current marketing costs. Fair. The difference is marketing also can go the other way and and like Jaguar perhaps or Cracker Barrel, I don't know if you followed the So you can create negative value. It's not like the baseline is value. It's not like the baseline is zero and there's only upside and the upside is like one to 1 million. You can actually destroy a company through marketing. >> The case is okay. >> And advertising. >> Uh some of those I'm going to defend the companies. >> Oh, please do. Yeah. Yeah. >> Because in the case of Bud Light, >> are you defending Bud Light? I want to hear this. >> Yeah. No, no, no. They could not have necessarily anticipated that because it was confected outrage. Look, I'm politically on the right. Okay. I get just as angry from confected outrage on the on the right, which is, "Oh, they've gone woke when, you know, you're merely showing, you know, a mix of ethnic groups you're advertising or something. This is bull, right?" And and the right do it and the right?" And and the right do it and the left do it. Uh there's confected outrage on the left, I would argue, about um American Eagle, and it's confected outrage on the right. It's done for signaling purposes by a very narrow group of people. Do those cases actually damage the business? I don't know the figures. Gillette did. There was an figures. Gillette did. There was an extremely Now, this wasn't confected outrage because Gillette ran an advertisement. They realized they had to advertisement. They realized they had to move on perhaps from the best a man can get despite the fact obviously that their customer base is overwhelmingly male for fairly obvious reasons. And they produced an ad which I would argue and even my wife would argue was needlessly um insulting towards men in that it conflated the me too movement with barbecuing. Okay. In other words, it seemed to take a definition of toxic masculinity which went which went the whole spectrum from things which all rightinking men would quite rightly condemn to things which for example two boys having a you know a small scrap on a patch of grass which all primates play fight. It's not, you know, don't get me wrong, sorry. If, you know, there's a kid wailing on another kid with a plank of wood, uh, you know, I'll be quick to condemn it, but I'm not totally, you know, the odd play fighting thing, barbecuing, I don't think is particularly objectionable. And that was particularly objectionable. And that was a case where it was almost a kind of act of deliberate affronttery to your core target audience. The Bud Light thing, to target audience. The Bud Light thing, to put it in context, was a influencer marketing campaign of which most people in the company were probably unaware where they sent personalized caners of Bud Light to a variety of different uh influencers, one of whom was Dylan Mulvaney. Um, now I've got to confess Mulvaney. Um, now I've got to confess about this as a Brit, you're Canadian. >> Mhm. >> The gender thing isn't quite the flash point in the UK or Canada as it is in the United States. Did you know for example um that when it came out I found this quite interesting in Britain we've had pantomime for 200 years you know men dressing up as women you know women dressing up as attractive women dressing up as young boys Shakespeare you know crossdressing some like it hot was a highly controversial film with all the studios in the United States when it came out because it involved men dressing up as women now in the UK my grandmother went to see it she was a sort of conservative woman in a Welsh provincial It would not have occurred to her literally that there was anything controversial about this at all. It was simply funny. >> I think what maybe has changed is the meaning we ascribed to it. >> Well, in this case, my argument was okay. All it was they hadn't made Dylan okay. All it was they hadn't made Dylan Mulvaney the face of Bud Light, >> right? >> You know, and I think creating these cultural flash points through confected outrage is something to be disparaged when the rights do it and when the left do it. I don't I I think it's equally I do it. I don't I I think it's equally I think it's equally absurd because you have in any communication you have to understand context and the intention of the person producing the communication. Now in the case of Jaguar they wanted it to look unlike a I would argue I mean I was talking to Rick Rubin who was in Hawaii and he'd heard about the Jaguar ad the it wasn't an ad by the way. Do you know that don't you? It way. Do you know that don't you? It never ran as an advertisement. It was a brand film they showed at the launch of the car. And then I had a right-wing the car. And then I had a right-wing podcast uh in the UK going, you know, it utters the most out, you know, um outrageous anti-conservative sentiment, which is copy nothing. Copy nothing was the exhortation of Sir William Lions who founded Jaguar. You know, I I I think he founded Jaguar. You know, I I I think he said it in 1932. He was the original founder of the car company. You've also got to understand their position. What are they trying to do? So, so I'm just explaining this just in wider in wider context, which is >> they fundamentally made a mistake. I can't blame them for doing it because we all do this. We all benchmark against our most obvious competitor. >> Don't benchmark against your most obvious competitor. All you'll do is obvious competitor. All you'll do is make make yourself a copy of them. And Jaguar was always trying to compete head-to-head with BMW, Mercedes, and Audi. Mhm. Audi. Mhm. >> And bluntly put, because of the scale of those entities, it was always going to lose. Because if you're the kind of lose. Because if you're the kind of person who's happy to buy a BMW, an Audi, or a Mercedes, and you're also happy to buy a Jaguar, you'll probably end up buying an Audi, a Mercedes, or a BMW simply to, you know, because of scale, winner takes all effects, all manner of other things. So, if Jaguar needs to survive in the electric car age, making its cars in the UK, which as a Jaguar lover, I ideally want them to continue to do, they've got to find a different kind of target audience rather than benchmarking themselves against uh, you know, companies which have gains to scale and a whole load of advantages they can't replicate. And so going for what you might call the car of choice of the wealthy younger creative class. Reasonable bet. >> It's a reasonable bet. Okay. I work in advertising. Okay. I'm I'm massive car advertising. Okay. I'm I'm massive car lover. I really really like for example lover. I really really like for example the Chris Bangal era BMWs I thought were magnificent. I really really like those magnificent. I really really like those because can't buy one. And the reason is because part of my shtick, okay, is being a bit left field. And if I drive around in an Audi, it kind of screams I work in financial services, >> right? >> Okay. You know, I aspire to managerial roles. Do you see what I mean? roles. Do you see what I mean? >> Yeah. >> And so, you know, I've always bought slightly weird cars there. I don't know. I've been fed to there. I don't know. I've been fed to know what you have. What What do you have back in Canada? I got to ask. >> Uh, I have a Tesla. >> Oh, fine. You see that? You know, did you do you have a sticker on it that says I bought this before Elon went mad or anything like that so that Canadians don't key your car? It's >> been keyed three times. >> It's been keyed by and uh run into by uh somebody I can only assume intentionally uh in the past. >> Ota. >> Oh yeah. In the past. >> Well, Otawa is this like hot bed of Elon haters. Is it? haters. Is it? >> It's interesting because my mom got me one of those stickers and I I was like, I don't have a problem with Elon. like I don't I don't understand this. I'm not going to put that on my car. And you I want to relate this to sort of evolution. >> I agree. It's a little like um biting the hand that feeds you, isn't it? >> Well, it's also like going back to the Jaguar butt. We can tie these two things Jaguar butt. We can tie these two things together, right? And I think we need together, right? And I think we need >> a variation in approaches. And the the point of this is like we need more people like Elon, not fewer in the world. Whether you agree with him or world. Whether you agree with him or not, this is how society progresses. We need differences. We have an environment and people thrive or don't thrive in that environment. Ideally, we have some that environment. Ideally, we have some sort of social safety net uh to catch people um if they don't succeed. >> But not ideally, that's essentially in any civilized society. >> And and so Jaguar the same thing. They're they're taking a bat as a company. They're being different. They company. They're being different. They occupy an environment and manage. >> If you think about it, they survive as Land Rover, Range Rover because they have effectively created the category they dominate, >> right? So I want more variety. >> right? So I want more variety. >> No. Oh right. This is this is where your wonderful compatriate Rodri Martin, praise be upon him, okay, makes this point that um economists have this fantasy of the world of companies in direct competition driving down price and increasing efficiency while supplying the same thing which is based on a false premise that people know what they want to begin with. Now I would argue when you don't create differentiation, everybody suffers. Now let me explain everybody suffers. Now let me explain because if you have a differentiated car market, it makes the car market more valuable overall to investors because uh you know there is more variety within the market. It benefits the companies the market. It benefits the companies because they can achieve a reasonable profit on what they do because it has some degree of scarcity or uniqueness and it benefits the consumer because the consumer ends up with more choice. What often happens is you have something like a regulated telecoms market or you have a regulated insurance market and everybody is forced to compete along the same dimension and what you end up with is just red red ocean competition and nobody wins. >> But where I was going with all of this is that going back to the Madman era and how you can create a billion dollar uh profit for the company and only get paid like 300k. >> You need to watch that. Yeah. And I think I've never actually watched MMA, but I think the the point that I was getting at is you can also create negative value and like how do you ascribe for the negative value? >> I can speak for Gillette where the evidence was that it was and by the way the research showed it was deeply problematic with a large swave of people. Has a American Eagle suffered? I people. Has a American Eagle suffered? I doubt it. In some ways you could argue it's an ingenious marketing strategy which is that you press the hot buttons of 1% of the population. So they then repeat your message accompanied by their own signaling outrage. Meanwhile, you get free media coverage practically everywhere. >> But maybe I'm naive. >> I mean, the media budget for that Jaguar film you realize was zero. >> Maybe I'm naive. Like the Sydney Sweeney American Eagle thing, I think we're just going back to normal, aren't we? and like we've we've sort of deviated in the last few years and and that seems more maybe it's akin to my time and my frame and like when I was brought up, but like nothing about that struck me as rage or um on either side. Like when I looked at that, I was like, "Oh, great." It's just like an advertisement. It's a pup. >> Yeah. Like it just I didn't even think more I didn't think there was more to it. I just saw, oh, this is great. it. I just saw, oh, this is great. Right. There there's a kind of weird sensitivity signaling which generally has nothing to do with the groups you are trying to protect which is just it's sometimes called a purity spiral where you effectively signal your moral or political purity by signaling extraordinary heightened sensitivity to anything that might conceivably offend someone else. even if the group on whose someone else. even if the group on whose behalf you claim to be campaigning is completely unconcerned by it. >> But like the opposite of her, whatever that would be, it would not cause rage in me either. It would just I wouldn't I wouldn't even think about the brand, you know? It would just be like another know? It would just be like another thing that flies by. I don't understand why we're so hair triggered at that this moment in time unlike maybe never before. way you have to really watch it before. way you have to really watch it in um and I've I've noticed this in certain people on the right which is I think it's fundamentally dangerous to invest too much of your own identity in a political standpoint to the point where I I've seen it in people both sides become effectively deranged. Now, you could say that's deranged. Now, you could say that's that's the effect of the people who attack them and that uh the derangement wouldn't happen and wouldn't be necessary in a different kind of media environment. What's different about environment. What's different about today? Why is everybody on such a hair today? Why is everybody on such a hair trigger? Why do we identify so strongly trigger? Why do we identify so strongly with extremes? I'm going to say actually with extremes? I'm going to say actually that everybody always blames social media. I would argue that the mainstream media, it is always in your interest, and this is a problem in journalism. It's always in your interest to provoke a fight because then you have something to cover. Nobody's interested in reading cover. Nobody's interested in reading about peace and harmony. They're interested in reading about discord and argument and dispute. By the way, that's an evolutionary tendency. If we're sitting here and we hear we heard a fight break out across the street, we'd be there with our noses pressed up against the glass. Okay? If if we heard, you know, people amicably discussing the weather, we wouldn't pay it the slightest attention. you know, where slightest attention. you know, where where we we've fundamentally evolved to pay attention to uh conflict >> and so the only difference is the tools available to us >> and the extent to which social media provide the mainstream media with the tool. I mean in 1975 if you wanted to tool. I mean in 1975 if you wanted to find someone who was outraged by the the Sydney Sweeney advertisement, you'd actually have to do some leg work, wouldn't you? I don't think you now now wouldn't you? I don't think you now now it's one search on X or uh you know blue sky or whatever it may be. Uh willful misunderstanding is another thing that you know is another technique which is deployed. It's perfectly obvious. I mean deployed. It's perfectly obvious. I mean I you know it's perfectly obvious that that had is not intended to mean Sydney Sweeney is the flower of Aryan womanhood. Okay, it's not you know it's womanhood. Okay, it's not you know it's not that. Now in a perfect world had not that. Now in a perfect world had they had more budget maybe they would have had three celebrities of different different ethnicities or genders or whatever it may be um but nonetheless this business where you effectively effect to be outraged by things well I'll give you a lovely story about this I always forget which is I don't think phrases like uncomfortable or offended or inappropriate you know you know you that you get these things where you know your presence here people would find it you know would feel unsafe triggering okay they don't really belong in the public sphere >> you know they're matters which for you know a few hundred thousand years we simply sorted out amongst ourselves we didn't have we didn't make recourse to the university dean or the supreme court in cases where we were bothered by things because you accepted that's just part of life and we were allowed then creatively to find ways to get along without recourse to some sort of speurious rule book. Consequently, you know, I don't I don't think those phrases like in I mean, this is one of the worst things that happens. You say, you know, was accused someone is described in the newspaper as being accused of inappropriate behavior. Now, I now have no idea. I mean, I've literally had to book people for speaking engagements. You go on their speaking engagements. You go on their Wikipedia page and it says accused of inappropriate behavior. Now, I have no inappropriate behavior. Now, I have no idea whether they're the next Epstein, right? or whether they told a knockk right? or whether they told a knockk knockock joke that two people found unpleasant. Do you have them in Canada? unpleasant. Do you have them in Canada? Knock knock. At least I'm not being complet because otherwise I could have been misunderstood there. You see, but you I I now have no idea. Literally no idea whether the person's guilty of some utterly trivial infraction which would only have offended 0.01% of the population >> or they're not guilty at all. somebody just made up an accusation and the accusation became the framing and the framing became the narrative. >> So it strikes me as highly problematic in the UK. I'm not one of these people, by the way. I'm not, you know, I'm not JD Vance. I don't believe that free JD Vance. I don't believe that free speech is completely dead in the UK. But there are worrying signs where people who make a complaint on the basis that they found something disturbing can then call in the that's not a police matter unless it involves a direct threat of physical action. >> Yeah. I mean simply being disqued by something can't be. >> But we we've gotten to this point and you know to varying degrees in varying different countries where you know the we don't tolerate people who have different ideas than us and we saw this last week play out in the US with the assassination of Charlie Kirk. And so whether you agree or disagree with him and his views, >> I have to confess I was only dimly aware of his existence beforehand perhaps because I'm a Brit. Uh I mean I I I'd heard the name and I knew he >> we see the same thing in Canada with sort of our politics, right? I imagine you see in the US too where media is definitely uh intolerable of one position and more favorable of the other. You can analyze this. You can study it. You could do a PhD on this. It exists. And it seems like we're just not capable of having to think for ourselves. And we're not capable of having reason discussion on things and and being friends with people. It used to be back in the the 30s, the 40s, the the Churchill era, both sides of the the house or would talk to each other. They would have dinner together. They would find common ground. How many of these people who are hypers sensitized on one side or the other, how many of them really exist? By the way, don't include really exist? By the way, don't include things like one of the things I find really disturbing is the practice of the media describing people who say oppose uncontrolled immigration and describe them as a far-right group. >> Oh, and well, because that is that you know you normal people are described as far right now. So, so in other words, if if you literally take an opinion which may may be held, by the way, from my own personal standpoint, I'm pretty benignely disposed to immigration uh within reason. However, I also believe within reason. However, I also believe in democracy and if a significant proportion of the population disagrees with me, I owe it to them to hear them out because their circumstances are different to my own. You know, I might be beneficially, you know, one of the slightly annoying things is people who are very rich people who are pro- immigration because they say their Polish housekeeper is wonderful. Well, that is an experience of immigration which is not shared perhaps by any means by the other 98% of people. I'm conscious of the fact that depending on where you are, you see the world differently. That's inevitable. And the differently. That's inevitable. And the job of a democracy is to accept uh the majority opinion even when it goes against your own. And so describing and vilifying an opinion which is held by a fairly large weight of the population regardless by the way the rights and wrongs of the whole thing. I'm not even getting into this now. Um it's deeply dangerous because people go well if that makes me far right it looks like I'm far right. I mean, insulting, calling people right. I mean, insulting, calling people deplorables is a terrible, terrible way of getting deplorables to gang up against you and then people don't speak up. They tell their opinions and then up. They tell their opinions and then you lose debate and you lose and then you lose perspective because you don't hear the other side of it. So, you think there is no other side and anybody who believes that might be an idiot like >> give an example on this debate which changed my mind a bit. a very very good Oxford economist called Paul Collier wrote this economically balanced assessment of general migration and made some you know pointed out that on both sides of what you might call the balance sheet it was immeasurably more complicated for example if Nigeria trains doctors who then immediately hoof it to the United States how how is that possibly a good thing overall in that a poor country trains doctors who move to a rich country which arguably has enough doctors from a country which doesn't have enough. That's not you know you have to >> depends on how you frame it right because another way to look at that and I'm not arguing for this by any stretch is that they come here they make a lot of money and they send that money home to their families. >> I agree all Collier said is look this is inordinately more complicated. >> Yeah. Um it is >> one of the things he said is the right for example of recent immigrants to family reunification is a bit dubious because you're giving someone a right which the native population do not have. So I can't pick five Canadians and get them British citizenship. You see >> I I've yet to meet somebody who totally disagrees with all immigration. It's a matter of what reasonable immigration looks like >> and also assimilation. It should be decided by someone other than human rights lawyers. Oh yeah, definitely. rights lawyers. Oh yeah, definitely. >> I would probably agree because you know fundamentally as a as a branch of the law that is not a partial >> entity because human rights lawyers it isn't you you know that great phrase of is it Sinclair Lewis or someone which is uh it is difficult to get someone to disbelieve something when their salary is dependent on believing it. And just as management consultants have a huge incentive to sell in digital transformation programs to their clients and therefore we have a culture in business which more or less doesn't assumes that any money spent on tech is money well spent. They don't look at the opportunity cost. Should we have a opportunity cost. Should we have a better call sector? Buffett and Mer had a good way to sum this up which is never ask your barber if you need haircut. Yeah. And it's the same thing a human rights lawyer. It is in their interests rights lawyer. It is in their interests for human rights to capture a greater and greater part of public discourse at the expense of democratic bodies. And consequently, it's, you know, you're not really in the you're not really in the dispensation of justice. You're in the amplification of grievance business. It's very different. >> I want to switch gears a little bit. My kids had a question for you. >> Oh, good. Okay. Go on. A few years ago, we were in Italy on vacation and we walked into a Louis Vuitton store and they saw a purse and they were asking me what makes somebody spend I think it was I don't know 20 or 30,000 euros on a purse and I had gave them an answer but they wanted me to ask you some of those things by the way weirdly you can resell them for more than the purchase price because in some cases the Kelly bag for example they won't sell it to you until you've been a fairly reliable customer of theirs for some time and therefore the price on eBay is higher than the price they charge in the store. Um uh so so by the way it's not it it's not in it's complicated but they're vellin goods effectively a large proportion of goods depend for their value on being perceived to be expensive. >> So what goes into that though because they were we're all we're all guilty of it to a degree. No, but they were talking about the store and the service and the lighting. >> My wife just came back from, you know, somewhere where there was quite a nice night dress in Harrods, I think it was in London, which was £1,800. >> Okay. >> Now, you have to remember that there are quite a lot of goods where the purpose of the good emotionally is to say, well, let's take the endline. I often think there's a lot of hidden truth in advertising endlines. The L'Oreal advertising endlines. The L'Oreal endline because I'm worth it. Some part of that is the person advertising to themsself. So, you know, when you drive around in your brand new blinged up Tesla, albeit slightly keyed, okay, you're not actually doing it to pick up chicks, I imagine. I mean, maybe I have no idea what you do in your private time. Okay, but if you let's say private time. Okay, but if you let's say you bought a bright red sports car, yes, one purpose of it in a in a particular group would probably be, you know, I visibly have resources to spare. But quite a large part of this stuff is actually signaling to ourselves, which is, you know, uh because I'm worth it. I deserve this. I'm the kind of it. I deserve this. I'm the kind of person who drives this. Uh it provides me with a kind of ego boost, a sense of reassurance, whatever it may be. And so consequently, if you think about part of the reason why bags became very expensive is that very high-end clothing can only be worn in quite specific situations. Mhm. situations. Mhm. >> On the other hand, a bag like a man's watch can be worn every day. So, one of the reasons why those things are expensive is to use a very interesting measure, cost per entertainment hour. I wear a Casio G-Shock. I think it was 130 quid because I' actually decided as a gross rationalist that the best watch is one that's cheap enough to wear in the shower so you don't have to take the thing off every day. But Paul Dolan, Professor Paul Dolan, who's the behavioral scientist at London School of Economics, I met him when I first met him. I said, "I'm intrigued because you've worked with Daniel Carnean on happiness and I noticed you wear a Rolex." >> Mhm. And he said, "No, no." He said, "It's extremely good value for money because it makes me feel good every single day when I put it on and in 20 years time I'll give it to my son." 21 years time, I don't know how old his son was, I'll pass it on to my son who can enjoy exactly the same thing. So, as a repository of meaning. >> Oh, interesting. >> Now, cost per entertainment hour is quite interesting because it was used to explain the fact that relatively poor young people will spend 90 $100 on a computer game, which seems like a lot of money until you realize that they might play that game for >> Oh, yeah. >> 80 90 100 hours. >> Yeah. >> Or more. >> Super cheap. >> So, it's super cheap. I mean, compared to going to the cinema where it's $10 per entertainment hour, more if you buy popcorn. So, it's quite an interesting popcorn. So, it's quite an interesting metric. I mean, one of the things that metric. I mean, one of the things that used to make me really annoyed in Britain was when people, rich people got really snarky about poor people having large televisions. And I said, "Look, large televisions. And I said, "Look, you if you haven't got much money, TV is a source of long-term entertainment is spectacularly cheap." Okay? So having a spectacularly cheap." Okay? So having a really good television on which to enjoy it because you're not going to go Porsche racing at the weekend, you know, you're not you're not going to be there, you know, effectively going to Glindborn or popping up to the bloody, you know, Metropolitan Opera. Therefore, having a Metropolitan Opera. Therefore, having a really large television is a perfectly rational decision. >> Go deeper on this truth and endline signaling to ourselves when we purchase something. Jeffrey Miller is something. Jeffrey Miller is fundamentally right that a lot of what we're doing is to advertise ourselves to other people and the mating mind and spent two books I think you really should read because they're extremely good that a lot of a third book by my compatriate will store the status game which you must know you read it fantastic I've heard of it >> and I have to admit I'm going to the only caveat I give to reading these books a bit like reading uh the selfish gene is when you read them, you are at, you know, if you're someone of any kind of sensitivity, you are at risk of experiencing depressive episodes after reading them because not because they're not true, but because they are. And you go, God, am, you know, am I really that shallow? You know, I do things because I shallow? You know, I do things because I they feel good. I explain why I do them, but deep down the evolutionary and emotional reason I'm doing these things is really to show off or to establish, you know, some sort of oneupmanship or status. It's kind of complicated. Do I status. It's kind of complicated. Do I buy one piece of conspicuous consumption as is argued by various people like Lord Leard in the UK? Do I make my neighbors less happy if I buy a newer, better car? because what I've done is I've changed their comparative frame and therefore my pleasure comes at the expense of theirs. >> Now, that's not I don't think that's totally simple. I think if you were a totally simple. I think if you were a real car obsessive and your next door neighbor bought a Ferrari, you'd actually be delighted because you could go out and talk about torque vectoring and an adaptive air suspension or whatever it may be, okay? or the, you know, the normally aspirated V12 and you'd probably be made happier by that purchase. So, I don't think I don't purchase. So, I don't think I don't think it's absolutely simple. I think Jay Leno and Jay Leno's garage makes him one of the world's great philanthropists because he goes and spends a fortune on extremely rare cars and then shares his passion with an audience of millions. If you are a car enthusiast, you know, it's an extraordinary case, by the way, of translating money into something which is both a selfish pleasure and a generous pleasure. It's complicated. But when you read these books and you you realize that status is effectively a kind of thing within us which we can't turn off. >> The currencies will change. The status currencies change with fashion and time and everything else. Um, you know, there was a time where having a digital watch was the, you know, the the highest status thing. In my school, if you were status thing. In my school, if you were the first kid with an LED digital watch, people were in awe of you. So, these things change, but nonetheless, it's probably innate. Would it be nice if we probably innate. Would it be nice if we had the power to completely disregard the opinions of others? Well, yes and no. I mean, I think such a society might no. I mean, I think such a society might be better in some respects. I also think it would be kind of atrocious because people would kind of go shopping naked. You know, is shame necessary? It was book by Jennifer Jackwood actually, you know. I mean, as a social species, know. I mean, as a social species, patently at some level, we're massively calibrated to care about the, you know, the repute of others. And that's why some things need to be expensive because then it's a costly signal. It's peacock's tail. It's a so the guy who rescued the British sparkling wine industry effectively did so by improving quality by 10% 20% and then putting up price by about 150%. >> Cuz price is the same >> because in the sparkling in the champagne business it doesn't matter how good the drink is if people think you've bought it for $8.95 it's not doing the job it's supposed to do which is to signal generosity to signal hospitality or to mark a special occasion you know. Oh, I see you've taken out the good stuff because it's my birthday. And that's pot I mean, you're a Canadian, right? Pot latch was, I think, a right? Pot latch was, I think, a practice by the the tribes of the Pacific Northwest. Was that right? Where Pacific Northwest. Was that right? Where they destroyed possessions. >> You know more of a Canadian history than I do. >> I I think I think it was tribes in the Northwest who practiced this pot latch thing where you destroyed things of value as kind of uh you know, a signaling mechanism. >> That that is like ultimate signal. It's like the rappers burning money on videos or something. >> Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Signaling things that they're probably not intending to signal. >> There is a serious question here, which is can we take a an innate and immutable human instinct and harness it for good rather than for ill. And Jeffrey Miller's example here is let's imagine two parallel tribes. Bluntly put, in one tribe, the men folk signal their desiraability as mates uh by uh fighting each other with axes. >> That's a negative sum game. In the neighboring tribe, they signal their desiraability of mates by going hunting and trying to bring home meat which they then share with the rest of the tribe. That's a positive sum game. So there is this really complicated question which is undoubtedly human pursuit of status has both positive and negative externalities depending on the currency you choose to signal and also it's not totally it's not totally easy to say whether it's negative or positive. I mean, >> it probably drives a lot of human behavior which drives ambition, which drives progress, which drives >> I mean, if we genuinely didn't care, okay, if we had no shame, uh, you're absolutely right. I mean, no one, you absolutely right. I mean, no one, you know, I'm sure, by the way, I think also a lot of valuable goods are affordable now by everybody because they started as luxury goods. >> Yes. >> So, I always mention this because it's such a silly boast. My grandparents were the fourth family in Wales to own a dishwasher and it cost about hundred and something pounds at a time when their house which was a very nice house cost them £4,000. >> That dishwasher probably works better than a modern one too by the way. >> It's still working. They bought it in 195961 something like that. >> Why are they 4hour cycles now? >> And it's like yeah ready Tuesday week. Come on. You know >> I have one of these It's interesting just as a funny aside. I have one of these dryers from the 80s in my house. >> It came with the house and the >> It dries the clothes in the back. >> The repair man is like, "It's going to be just as expensive to fix this as it would be to buy a new one. I'll just assume." I was like, "No, no, fix this one." And he's like, "Why?" I was like, one." And he's like, "Why?" I was like, "Tries the clothes in 30 minutes." >> I'm going to make an unusual foray into environmental responsibility here. Uh folks, everybody listening, do if if there's a do simple thing you can do, two things. put on your appliances at two things. put on your appliances at times when there is an abundance of clean electricity. You don't have to clean electricity. You don't have to change what you do. You just have to change when you do it. Secondly, if you've got a dryer that doesn't have a heat pump, get a dryer with a heat pump. >> Yeah. >> Because Yep. It's slow. I'm going to acknowledge that. It's not as fast as an acknowledge that. It's not as fast as an oldfashioned dryer. However, the energy oldfashioned dryer. However, the energy efficiency of a dryer with a heat pump. Or better still, Americans, if you live in Arizona, dry your clothes outside. Because this is something that's slightly beusing because in Britain we didn't have the social stigma of hanging clothes up to dry to the same extent. Now we do now. Nobody would hold hang clothes up. But that's just a social clothes up. But that's just a social stigma. Now in Britain, fairness, we got stigma. Now in Britain, fairness, we got a fairly climate. You're Canadian. Okay. There plenty of times of the year where your underpants can be hanging there for three months and they wouldn't not they might freeze but they wouldn't noticeably dry. But I do find it noticeably dry. But I do find it slightly weird in the US where if you're somewhere like Arizona, you could literally hang them up for I I was in Fa Ventura in an island in the Canaries. And well, the amusing thing was you literally they had a washing machine but no dryer. You put it up on the line no dryer. You put it up on the line about 40 minutes later it was ready to wear. >> So how would you market that to people? How would you change the >> change the behavior so that it's not necessary? Now I understand that people necessary? Now I understand that people don't want to put their underpants, you know, private things. I suspect that a lot of it is those weird housing associations already have rules that say you can't do it and then bit by bit the social norm spreads. >> Those American housing associations basically like living in a Nazi regime, isn't it? As far as I can see, you know, isn't it? As far as I can see, you know, it's like those co-op apartments in New York which are you I mean in London we never tolerate that degree of kind of uh intrusion before we're allowed to move into a property. The interesting thing about the co-op apartments in particular, from what I understand, I don't understand everything, so I may be speaking a bit about something I don't know, is the degree to which all people play it. >> Yes. >> Whether you're uh sort of like a student just graduating or you're a billionaire, you're all sort of like playing this this game uh in the co-op housing. But >> no, no, it is completely a game. And apparently they can demand information which the IRS can't demand. I mean, it is, you know, it is absolutely bizarre. you have a co-op board which will uh you know in occasion kick people out as well. But what probably happens is that well. But what probably happens is that once this is very similar by the way with the necessity of children playing outside which is once the behavior drops below a certain threshold you have an inflection point. Mhm. >> So my my parents couldn't believe this when I when I was 20 25 and I told them that when I was 11 I used to cycle 11 miles to the nearest town to see my grandmother on my own at the age of 11 and then when I told them which they did know I used to at the age of sort of 11 climb up onto the apex of the roof and just wander around on the roof 30t up. >> Yes. >> My parents were a gasast that they'd ever allowed it to happen. But if most people did that >> at the time it was normal. >> It was completely normal. Yeah, >> you'll be locked up today. My parents would have been locked up for sever, you know, several of the things which I was allowed to do uh when I was young. Now, what happens, I think, is that you reach a a threshold or a tipping point where in my childhood, let's say someone had abducted me or I'd been hit by a car, okay? And I'll I'll give the exact year okay? And I'll I'll give the exact year 1974,75,76, that kind of era. If I'd been hit by a car cycling to Mammoth or I'd been abducted by a pedophile, uh, okay, my parents would have been described as unlucky. >> You get past a threshold where that behavior becomes weird and now my parents will be held as irresponsible and would be blamed. >> Yeah, >> I don't think it occurred to them. I was, funnily enough, hit by a car. It was my fault, be honest. I failed to signal before maneuvering. I was hit by a car. Nobody suggested it was my a car. Nobody suggested it was my parents fault for allowing me to cycle around the place. that was just a normal thing you did and then you get these weird I've got a few theories um for example what are the things that are products of social norms where you can suddenly hit a threshold tattoos among the middle class would have been an interesting thing in Britain is this true in Canada as well so perfectly middle-class people now have body art and it's normalized it would have been deeply weird in any middle class millier to see someone with a to uh in the 1970s or 1960s. >> It's just normal. I mean, like everybody >> No, no, no. I know. But I mean, this you you got to be you got to be 59 to notice this stuff. A lot of it happens over this stuff. A lot of it happens over quite a long time. Fresh. >> It's been a slow. >> I've got a theory that all British men would wear shorts all the time if it weren't for social pressure. >> I also think for example, okay, here's an interesting one. I don't know if you're into paranal sunning. Are you? >> What is this? It's a Buddhist practice where you basically expose your paranneeium to direct sunlight. Um I think that a fairly large proportion of the population are naturists to an extent by which I don't mean wandering around the streets with their schlongs out. But I mean that on a beach in a field in sunny weather in you know in some sort of privacy they would like to wander around with no clothes on because it's good for you. It exposes your whole body to sunlight. You get a lot of vitamin D. You know, it's generally healthful. And my argument generally healthful. And my argument about sunbathing is well, you know, evolution made it pretty enjoyable, maybe it's not all bad. And there are some schools of thought in dermatology which made a case that actually weirdly although it in enhances the risk of skin cancer, it improves cardiovascular health. So there was a study actually health. So there was a study actually among Swedes where there was a higher instance of skin cancer among Swedish sunbed addicts but they actually had a higher life expectancy which they didn't expect. >> So quite often you see what we do is we measure the narrow effect of a behavior but not the broader effect. Quite interesting in terms of >> you know how we might get things wrong. By the way, I wouldn't do it on a beach as there were children present and then you know, but if you go to if you go to parts of the of Europe, particularly Germans will just wander around naked. Now, I think at some level if they're no children. Now, in the United States, children. Now, in the United States, that would be perceived in a completely different way. So, quite a lot of these different way. So, quite a lot of these things are arbitrary. They're just in other words, you know, if doing something makes you weird, there is a point at which you reach a threshold, vegetarianism, veganism, etc., where it where it goes from being weird to mainstream. So, it's what I'm saying is mainstream. So, it's what I'm saying is it's not an even process, >> right? >> And sometimes you never get to the threshold. >> I I see what you're saying. I know we're coming up to time here. I want to get to a couple questions. What are the rules of good copy? If I asked you to teach me how to write good copy, how would you do that? I think a large part of it comes that? I think a large part of it comes down to, you know, Michael Pollani and his idea of a tacit skill, which is we know more than we can tell. There are some generally good rules, which is write conversationally, much more conversationally than people think they should write because everybody thinks they have to write a a and actually I'll give you two examples of this. David Oglevie, all his books are incredibly readable because I think he was a copywriter first and an author second. His pro style is very good and he also adopts a clever trick which I've stolen and which uh a few other people is that he writes extremely plainly for the most part but will throw in the odd cescoilian long word just to remind the reader that he you know you're not an idiot. You know it's almost there to idiot. You know it's almost there to flatter the reader as much as it is to flatter the writer. Conan Doyle, I was talking to Rick Rubin about this. He and I both grew up on those Sherlock Holmes short stories which are not only models of thinking and deduction and uh you know and a fantastic lesson for uh mental gymnastics. I think they're also mental gymnastics. I think they're also the Kingsley Amos believed this that he's one of the greatest pros writers in the English language because bear in mind a lot of that stuff's written in 1880. You read a lot of stuff that's 1880. You read a lot of stuff that's written in 1880 does that what's that mean? Oh god, hold on. I'll have to go back to page 27 to work out how who on earth Mr. Homer Angel is or uh Miss Miss Mary missed something sudden, doesn't there, Marlin? At no point in reading a Sherlock Holmes short story have I ever had to go back a page to work out how who somebody is. Yeah. >> In terms of just absolutely brilliant clarity, uh those are astonishing. But in terms of persuasion, uh there are various things. So you use generally verbs of movement. You you use verbs in preference to adjectives and adjectives in preference to adverbs. I think you tend to use Anglo-Saxon words rather than the romance words for the most part without being silly about it. You convert a feature into a benefit. There's also an element where sometimes all you need to do is tell people a fact. Now I don't know any evidence fact. Now I don't know any evidence about this and I'd like to know it and I asked this question which is of the people who are antiaxers during co was there a difference between the people who are basically happy with the idea of a vaccine and the people who weren't partly driven by whether you knew that vaccination dated back to the 18th century and smallox. In other words it was a 250y old medical practice >> or whether you thought it was some weird new fangle thing that you couldn't possibly trust. I don't know. But possibly trust. I don't know. But sometimes, do you ever watch Press Telw Walker on YouTube? You know those mathematical puzzles, geometry puzzles? I really recommend them because weirdly I find myself on YouTube watching people solve mathematical equations for fun, which I never thought I'd do. But Fresh Telw Walker and I can't remember what it's called something like something decision or something. Anyway, um it's great great little YouTube channel. It's not that little. a huge following and sometimes there's a geometry puzzle which looks completely impossible to solve until you just draw one extra line at which point the solution becomes obvious. And so sometimes in marketing obvious. And so sometimes in marketing all you've got to do is tell people a fact. It's not always about persuasion. fact. It's not always about persuasion. It's not always about getting people it's simply putting people in a you know state of knowledge or belief or conviction that this thing can make a difference to their lives. And by the way, you're not you're almost always up against a problem, which is that the two human default modes of do what everybody else does and do what I've done before for obvious reasons. You know, what you've done before and what everybody else always does is not necessarily optimal, but it's much less likely to be catastrophic than trying something new that nobody else ever does. You know, so we're kind of herd species and we're kind of habitual species. So in the marketing of something which is genuinely new you know your the Tesla the the electric car there is a degree of extreme anxiety which you don't encounter when you repeat buy or when you buy the brand leader >> there's like a resistance you have to overcome >> you have to yeah you have to overcome it because just as a camera has a default mode the human default mode is do what I did before do what everybody else does I feel comfortable doing that very very rational default mode there's Nothing silly about that in terms of if you think about it our evolutionary um brain architecture those two things make a lot of sense but um it does mean and something I only realized about a year ago 35 years after I started working in the business is that as a consequence of that big innovative new ideas don't require less marketing they require more because you're asking people to at the initial stages you're asking someone to do something that nobody else has done >> and you're asking them to do something they haven't done before both of which create a kind of disqu and so providing people with conviction and reassurance quite often I suspect by the way in the early stages of a technology that happens one to one that you know it was my brother who's he's an astrophysicist so he knows all the bloody maths about kilowatt hours and stuff so my brother provided me with the reassurance to buy my first electric car I don't think if he hadn't bought an electric car I've now had Three, would I have bought an electric car? No, >> probably not. >> Probably not. >> Yeah. >> Uh, it will be my brother who persuades me to get solar panels or a heat pump or something of that kind. But big ideas don't require the the classic geek idea is our idea is so good it will sell itself. >> A re since your fellow Canadian Stuart Butterfield, isn't it? Who founded um Slack? Yeah. Is that right? Slack? Yeah. Is that right? >> Yeah. Uh he says the only real measure of innovation is behavioral change. that the only real measure of whether an innovation is significant is whether it h it both in first order and second order ways changes the way people behave. Now an interesting question is behave. Now an interesting question is is AI at that point yet? And my second question is the lesson of all tech is that loads and loads of geeks compete through for technological numerical superiority by some measure or other. And then someone else comes along with a cute user interface and makes all the money. It's basically Steve Jobs. money. It's basically Steve Jobs. >> Yeah. >> Nobody's done that yet for AI. Now maybe this weird thing that Johnny Iv is concocting which is some sort of weird pendant which talks to your mobile phone. Maybe that's what it is. phone. Maybe that's what it is. >> There was this thing that sort of relates to that which was Bill Gates had this saying. He's like the best and you this saying. He's like the best and you know I have friends living this now. The best technology doesn't win. >> That's a very engineering point of view because you're judging technology by its um engineering qualities rather than its uh human appeal. >> Oh that's an interesting reframing. >> So uh there are there are people in every field like in the camera world there are people called measure baiters. They're they're denigrated as measure baiters because they're obsessed with the numerical qualities of the camera. >> Yeah. >> You know, you focal lengths and all that stuff and they don't take very good photographs. >> Yes. >> And um saying that the best I mean undoubtedly by the way I mean you know Betamax is the famous example where they failed to capture network effects and in a world where there are network effects. Yeah. By the way, the best technology probably often doesn't win. I think that's probably fair. Everybody was competing to make a slightly faster IBM compatible PC, but they were all gray and beige. Now, nobody in the tech world and beige. Now, nobody in the tech world would go, "The slight problem with this PC isn't the fact that the clock speed or the processing power or the RAM is insufficient. The problem is if I put insufficient. The problem is if I put this device in any room of my house, it turns that room into an office." >> Yeah. If you put an IBM PC, a gray IBM PC in any room in your house, including the you might as well put a photocopier and a bloody filing cabinet in the room, right? Whereas when Jolly IV comes along and has that lickable, the iMac, >> the you can actually put that in any room of the house and it it it actually enhances passion statement. >> It's fantastic. It's, you know, it's an adornment. And so their failure to understand the wider context within which they were operating which is the job of marketing is exactly the reason nerds hate marketing because they think in a perfect world nerd metrics win out. But the consumer is much more bothered by the fact that when you get to the bottom of the iPhone scroll, it gives the little bounce, you know, and we you could, if we're to be absolutely honest, you could ridicule um uh you know, Ives and Jobs over their obsession with uh you know, bezels and chfers and things like that. But of course, multiply that like that. But of course, multiply that by a billion owners using the thing a 100 times a day. Okay, that's a 100red billion encounters and that probably matters a lot more in fact than you know by the way I mean I lost faith in Apple when they canled the car. How interesting. >> Because I thought you they had the brand power to create for places like New York and London a form of microtransport which was really really cool, really really efficient. You know the brand really efficient. You know the brand power you have, you see, you know, if you're Apple or Ford or whatever, people will buy a weird product from you much more readily than they will from Alfa Romeo, >> right? >> Because they go, well, if Ford's doing it, it, you know, it must be okay. So, one of the gifts of having a strong brand is your power to really disrupt and create new categories, you know, new categories of transit, for example, which we need. You know, don't get me wrong, I'm going to, you know, I'm going to off 600 horsepower electric car, but when I go into London, I want a Microlino or an itty bitty little thing because that's appropriate to the task. And my argument is that they could have done something there. They could have used their power to do something and and you know, the finance people killed it really. It was what was it called? project something or other it called? project something or other never remember but but no now they're just changing the shape of things and making the camera a bit better come on guys produce by the way do you want a good tip okay I tend to buy and this will actually apply to electric cars as well always good reason to buy Korean stuff do you know why >> because they're going to do that anyway the Koreans are going to make fantastic tech and fantastic cars regardless of the profit motive do you know why to wind up the Japanese so they've got two motivations Okay. Other people are just trying to make money. Deep down. Do you know do you money. Deep down. Do you know do you know why the largest Episcopalian church in the world is in Soul? >> No. >> Right. This is really fascinating. I'm going to Soul for the first time. I've never been. But the last four presidents of Korea have been variously like Catholic Presbyterian. Now before um before the Japanese invasion, Christianity was a tiny niche missionary religion in Korea. Uh when the Japanese invaded um uh the tiny Christian population refused to acknowledge the divinity of the emperor and some of them were martyed for refusing to effectively uh pay due respect to the divinity of the Japanese emperor and therefore it became the patriotic religion because it was seen as a deeply patriotic entity. So I've got a hunch that you you know deep down you know if you go buy a Hyundai or a Genesis or something like that there's a dual motivation here. Let's make a bit of money and uh but that's that's purely so similarly if you want to look for anthropological reasons to buy um an awful lot of German businesses are driven by sibling rivalry. >> So Puma versus Adidas Aldi North versus Aldi South. There's a whole weird family Aldi South. There's a whole weird family rift in the German car industry which is too complicated for me to understand about Porsche and the family who own Pinchit. There are a whole load of Pinchit. There are a whole load of families which are kind of weird waring families and sometimes the family business has a motivation which actually >> the consumer is the winner. >> But the consumer is the is exactly the winner in in all this. Um but but going back to that family business thing that you know undoubtedly if you can harness other motivations alongside the profit motives most people working for a company unless you've bought them off with massive stock options because they're in the senior management most people don't get up in the morning to enrich the share owners. No, >> you know I don't get up you I don't get up every morning I don't know what a big shareholder is of my company. It's probably like the state of Wisconsin DMV pension fund. Well, for the best wish pension fund. Well, for the best wish will I don't wish them any ill will. Of course, I don't get up in the morning cuz I go, "Oh, I really worry about those DMV people's pensions in Wisconsin." I can worry about customers. Wisconsin." I can worry about customers. I can worry about colleagues. That's a natural human motivation to serve those people. We always end with the same people. We always end with the same question, which is what is success for you? >> Just expanding the adjacent possible. That's a very pretentious article, but push the pebble a bit further. That that's it. I mean, you know, one of the reasons I do a lot of this stickick stuff is because the feedback I got was every now and then someone comes up to me and says, "I made a different decision because of something you said. Someone said to me, I bought my house because of you." I thought they might be about to hit me. We still hear from people about our first podcast every two or three months. Somebody emails me and and says, you know, because of that, oh, I love this. I never heard of this person. looked them up. And one thing I'm really clear on and I we've made this mistake. All creative people have made this mistake which is to go no that rationality is silly. What you need is creativity. No, silly. What you need is creativity. No, no. What you need is two strings to your bow. Okay. This is a complimentary mode bow. Okay. This is a complimentary mode of problem solving. It works best in parallel with some rational or quantitative or datadriven measures. But the quantitative and datadriven measures should not be allowed to crowd it out. And so when I say the reason someone bought a house because of me is I said when you're looking for a house don't optimize because everybody will want that house. Instead find something the house has which most people won't like but you don't care about next to a pub. Now I'm not saying next to a rough pub. I don't want to have fights outside my house. But most people particularly older people would hate the idea of being next to a pub because they crap on about noise and the beer garden and all that stuff. I personally the noise of a pub a stuff. I personally the noise of a pub a good happy pub is music to me. I don't get a sleep before midnight anyway so it's not going to keep me awake. Railway line personally it to me it's a bonus to most people it's negative. Go and look for those things where you can arbitrage >> uh what's possible. That would be my attitude. Now similarly if you've got a attitude. Now similarly if you've got a problem to solve >> don't purely define the problem in psychologyfree terminology. Just as in psychologyfree terminology. Just as in America you have a temperature and you have a feels like temperature which is by the way very very intelligent thing because what makes us feel hot is not just the ambient temperature. It's a combination ambient temperature. It's a combination of temperature, humidity, breeze and I think there's one other factor when they do the feels like temperature there's something like temperature so many feet above the ground that they factor in. Um now when I'm going outside I'm not going to do chemical experiments. I don't need to know what the ambient temperature is. I need to know will I feel hot and in the same way I think there's something really important here which is that do not define an objective which is designed to serve human beings without considering psychological factors because you might be able to solve your problem very very cheaply and efficiently by changing the psychology not by changing the technology >> and provided people are looking at both with a reasonable amount of imagination I'm not I'm not angry with a well bit. I'm I'm only angry with accountants and lawyers and economists, not because they do what they do, but because they have too much power doing it and they've achieved a kind of monopoly over decision-m which I don't think they have a reasonable claim to. >> That's a brilliant place to end this. >> It is not a bad place to end though. Fantastic. >> Thank you very much. We're not going to wait nine years before nine years before we get back together. How often are you in London? >> Uh once or twice a year. Mhm. >> Yeah. >> Oh, we must meet up then. That would be fantastic. >> Definitely. Loading video analysis...

Full Content:
By The Knowledge Project Podcast ## Key takeaways - **Doorman Fallacy**: Management consultants replace a doorman costing $X with an automatic door, saving money short-term, but the hotel's reputation crashes because the doorman provided security, taxi hailing, guest recognition, and status—value not captured in 'open the door' metrics. [04:43], [05:29] - **Postman Brand Perception**: Royal Mail found brand affection uncorrelated with service reliability; it depended on liking the postman, who built trust through chats and favors, outweighing metrics like delivery speed. [07:26], [08:15] - **Cold Beer Transaction Utility**: Thaler’s experiment shows people pay more for identical cold beer from a boutique hotel than a shack due to transaction utility—how good the deal feels—independent of the beer's utility. [18:11], [19:30] - **Dyson Call Center Honor**: James Dyson halted efficiency metrics presentation, insisting calls be treated as an honor; staff solved problems helpfully, even free parts next day, building fanatical loyalty despite premium prices. [40:47], [41:20] - **Family Firms Outperform PLCs**: Privately-owned family firms like McCain, Yorkshire Tea, and Dyson dominate advertising effectiveness awards over PLCs, prioritizing long-term customer value over short-term shareholder transactions. [28:28], [32:23] - **Psychopath Detection Test**: Women arrive late on first dates as a test; psychopaths rage while normals say 'traffic was terrible,' revealing character since we evolved to judge trustworthiness over half a million years. [20:43], [22:04] I keep hearing people saying you will say to your AI find me a skiing holiday and it will provide you with a perfect skiing holiday and I keep saying people don't decide like that. When you allow tech bros too much power over decision-m along with their running dog lackey in kind of management consultancy you're optimizing for something which may be very very distant from what your real world customers really care about. >> What makes Dyson so effective at advertising? Actually, it's it's not advertising? Actually, it's it's not advertising. It's marketing and it's advertising. It's marketing and it's customer experience. >> What's the difference between marketing and advertising? >> Advertising is a subordinate part of marketing. And do you think we're marketing. And do you think we're looking for efficiency in the wrong place? >> We usually do. And so, you focus too heavily on cost reduction and too little on value creation. >> What are the rules of good copy? If I asked you to teach me how to write good copy, how would you do that? >> I think a large part of it comes down to So, we first we were talking about this in the elevator. It was nine years ago. She back when podcasting wasn't even a thing. >> We must be able to dig out the original content presumably. Yeah. content presumably. Yeah. >> What was it? It was your podcast number 47 or something, was it? >> Oh, no. I think it was like 16 or something. Really? It was really low. something. Really? It was really low. We'll have to dig out the number, but uh it's been a long time since then. >> Oh, fabulous. Yeah. >> And and podcasting has exploded. I've been following Farum Street devotedly. >> Appreciate that. Um and uh it's always always interesting very very interesting on and I mean the whole question of the decision sciences uh is I think at the moment completely critical and actually by the way it'll be very very interesting with AI because I keep hearing people saying you will say to your AI find me a skiing holiday and it will provide you with the perfect skiing holiday and I keep saying people don't decide like that at the very least you'll have to show them three or four or five skiing holidays from which they choose because we can't really choose in the absence of comparison. It's what do you see what I mean? It's a sort of freakish element of free market capitalism which is we can only like something if we choose it in preference to something else. >> That's interesting. How does that relate to like a travel agency which would do that inherently? Like if you said I'm that inherently? Like if you said I'm going to India to chat GPT and you're like plan it for me versus you go to a travel agency and you're like I'm going to India plan it for me. Well among real estate agents there's apparently a kind of little bit of a trick which is you always in before you show someone the house you want to sell them. You show them a less appropriate house, ideally that's slightly more expensive, say, so that when they see the house that you want to sell them, it's now clearcut because they can say, "Ooh, it's a bit cheaper than the other one and it's got a conservatory." a conservatory." >> There's contrast. >> So there's a kind of decoy effect, a bit like the famous economist experiment with a decoy effect. So, you know, well, you know, one of my interesting questions is, you know, what interface will AI deploy to help us make choices and will it make the mistake that you could very easily make? If you think about it, nobody clicked the I'm feeling lucky button on Google. I think it's still there, isn't it? It's been there for years and they've removed it and found that it slightly reduces the appeal, but the number of people who actually click it, i.e., I'm feeling lucky, take me straight to a single page, is vanishingly small. people want to choose between, you know, effectively above the fold options. And um so, you know, I'm just intrigued because it's very very easy, I think, for people with an economic or tech background to make assumptions about what people are trying to do and how they choose and that we're, you know, utility maximizers and all this kind of thing only really to be completely wrong. Do you think we're looking for wrong. Do you think we're looking for efficiency in the wrong place? We usually do uh in the sense that when you pursue efficiency there are quite a few problems. But when you pursue efficiency generally you start looking at numerical or mechanical factors and of course in the process you disregard psychological factors where the greater gains may be found and so you focus too heavily on cost reduction and too little on value creation. I mean, one of the greatest creation. I mean, one of the greatest forms of efficiency, by the way, is employing a human being who's really, really nice. Now, this is complete really nice. Now, this is complete anathema to people in tech who love to define business processes so as to make them susceptible to automation. You know, person X does this. We will take that function, we will replace it with algorithm Y. And it's a very beguiling message because it usually comes with cost savings attached. You might have heard savings attached. You might have heard of my thing, the Dorman fallacy. Did you >> remind >> I'll remind the viewers and listeners uh which is simply that you know you you have a hotel it's a five-star hotel it has a dormant someone who welcomes incoming guests you know a combination of say McKenzie or Accenture and a tech firm will come in and say your dorman currently costs you $X,000 a year we have defined his or her function as opening the door we will replace said dorman with automatic door opening mechanism and an infrared human detector and we'll save you 30 $40,000 a year and then they walk away. They take the credit for the costsaving and then two years later, you know, the hotel's a catastrophe. The rack rates fallen off a cliff because the dorman was doing multiple things, many of which were human and kind of tacit. Security would be one. You know, there are no vagrants to sleep in the doorway, hailing taxis, dealing with luggage, recognizing regular guests, providing status to the hotel. There are loads and loads of value creation components to that dorman which aren't captured in the open the door definition. >> Is that an example of where the costs are really visible, but the benefits are >> correct? Yeah. So you it's very very >> correct? Yeah. So you it's very very easy management consulting firms uh if you if you're in a business and and some management consultants come in go to the management and say are they on a gain share agreement. A gain share agreement share agreement. A gain share agreement is a management consulting scam where you claim uh a certain percentage of the cost savings you identify in year one. Now as Roger L. Martin, your fellow Canadian and my own personal Svengali says, "Any idiot can cut costs." Okay. What takes real skill is cutting cost in a way that doesn't destroy value. One of the things that I don't think is understood by tech nerds and if I'm being really cruel, you know, males in general in in many cases is the extent to which in evaluating any business or experience, the human component of it, the face-to-face component does really really heavy lifting. And I've got a lovely story to illustrate this which I think is fantastic. It's the absolute perfect example of misalignment of optimization through quantification bias. So wonderful man Alex Bachelor bias. So wonderful man Alex Bachelor used to be the marketing director of Royal Mail, but you know similar to what you have with Canada Post, right? USPS. >> Mhm. Sorry, not US. Yes, just USPS. And they couldn't make any sense of the fact that the brand perception of Royal Mail bore no relation to service levels. So there would be districts and areas where you know every single firstass letter arrived early the following day extraordinarily reliable levels of service and royal mail wasn't particularly held in affection or esteem. There were other areas where the esteem. There were other areas where the service was frankly a bit ropey and people seemed to love it. Now, this obviously upset them because they thought that all the billions or certainly hundreds of millions they'd invested in service quality improvement should translate into customer satisfaction and therefore, you know, some sort of brand voltage. And someone had a theory and they said, I think something else is going on. And the theory which was put to the test and proved absolutely right was that the major determinant of whether you liked royal male or not was whether you liked your postman or posty technically to be used the genderneutral term. >> So people who had a rather unreliable service but the postman did the odd favor for them left things in the porch had a chat with them. Okay, those people thought it was a brilliant organization regardless of the actual metrics that were being pursued. And I think that's very true in uh any service organization. You know, you may there's organization. You know, you may there's an electricity company, a gas company, a water company, a utility. You may interact with them online 95% of the time, but the one or two occasions where you interact by telephone or face to face disproportionately affect your your perception of the organization. And I've argued for quite a time if I were being completely honest, I've worked in advertising for 36 years. And if I were a wholly honest person, uh, without, you know, fear of annoying my colleagues, probably 50% of the time, I would advise to a client, take 10 to 20% of your marketing budget and spend it on upgrading the call center. Pay the people too much. Get the best practitioners. I think it's perfectly practitioners. I think it's perfectly legitimate. In some organizations, there legitimate. In some organizations, there should be the very best call center people should be on six figures because it makes if you're good and nice, that's how much difference it makes. In other words, it more or less makes. In other words, it more or less drowns out all your other stuff, all the other noise. If every time you have a other noise. If every time you have a personal experience, you have a good experience, then broadly speaking in the human brain, uh that's a good organization which I can trust. And when you think about it, I suddenly realize why this probably is. We don't really have much evolved experience in evaluating postal efficiency, do we? Okay, we have quart of a million half a million years of evolved experience in deciding who to like and trust because for most of our evolutionary, you know, existence, that was one of the most fi five most important questions to get right. You know, do I trust this person? right. You know, do I trust this person? You know, will they attack me? Are they an ally? Are they a foe? Uh if I pay them money, will they deliver? And so consequently, I think what we do in our brains is we use our human judgment as a proxy. >> Now, a story to back up that, you probably remember this, okay? It's in my book, Alchemy, which is imagine you're turning up to buy a secondhand car and you turn up at the house, nondescript house, and the car is parked outside the house and you have a look at the car and you judge the, you know, whether the pedals are worn and the condition of the body work, and you have a look around the car. and you decide you're interested in paying, let's say, $5,000 for this car. So, you go and ring on the doorbell of the vendor and the door is answered in one situation by, for example, a female vicar. Okay? Could be Catholic. Well, they can't be Catholic, but you know, Episcopalian, doesn't really matter. Okay? Female vicar. And it's a tidy clean house. At that point, you probably upweight what you're prepared to pay by 20% or so. In in a parallel universe, the door so. In in a parallel universe, the door is answered by a guy in his underpants. In other words, someone with no shame. >> In that instance, you devalue the car, I suspect, by about $1,000 or more. In fact, you may not even buy it at all. And what we're doing here is we're effectively saying, what I'm going to do is a standin for the question, do I buy the car, which I don't have the technical knowledge to answer. I'm going to ask a supplementary heruristic question which is do I trust the person who's selling the car to me? >> And it's an interesting question. You my mother didn't know anything about cars, knew a lot about people. I think she would very reliably go around buying cars just through her assessment of the seller. And similarly, I think she might do better than someone with an engineering qualification who ignored who the seller was and their personality and character. Now, as a bit of evidence of this, I discovered because I've been investigating this, uh, various real estate agents have said to me that every estate agent does their utmost to make sure that until things are signed and sealed, the vendor never meets the buyer and vice versa. And the reason for that is if one of them doesn't like the other, they won't buy or sell. Now, when you think about it, that's completely unless the person's moving next door. Obviously, if you're buying a next door. Obviously, if you're buying a house from someone who's planning to move next door and they turn out to be a psycho, that's relevant information. But it seems to be the case that if you meet the the vendor and you basically don't trust them or think they're a bit shifty, it doesn't matter what the price is. It doesn't matter the condition of is. It doesn't matter the condition of the house. Suddenly, you revise your the house. Suddenly, you revise your valuation of the house downwards if you don't like the person selling it to you. And so that's one of the reasons why apparently uh real estate agents will leave any kind of contact between the two uh until after at least a survey has been done and enough commitments taken place. I once by the way I once didn't place. I once by the way I once didn't buy a house basically because the guy was being an about the fridge. Now the fridge was only worth uh you know I think 0.2% 2% uh of the value of the house or 0.02% of the value of the house. I can't quite remember. But because he was being a remember. But because he was being a dick about the fridge, I no longer trusted him about the house. >> Yeah. >> Weirdly, it turned out my instinct was right because then a friend of ours went to buy the same house. They got some separate land registry search done and found out that a chunk of the garden actually belonged to Network Rail, not to the house. It effectively filed a large part of the garden. So does that mean I just want to garden. So does that mean I just want to go back to the the real estate thing for a second. Does that mean a second. Does that mean pretty or attractive real estate agents would be more successful than >> It's a really interesting question which is I think we you know I think we ought to study these things much more because the assumption of an economist is that you need to disintermediate >> you don't need estate agents we just go on willow Zillow sorry or right move in the UK or whatever it is what's the Canadian equivalent >> I don't even know >> cababins.com or whatever okay.com Yeah, we go. Exactly. You go on one of those things. You choose the house you those things. You choose the house you want. You look at it. You then look at want. You look at it. You then look at the house, get a survey done, buy the house. We assume that there is, you house. We assume that there is, you know, this is a purely transactional exchange. Maybe in a rational world, that's exactly what it would be. >> But for one thing, actually, someone who's invested 15 years in doing up a house probably cares about what the person buying it is going to do to the house. So, my parents-in-law, for example, are fanatical gardeners. Uh, don't get into fanatical gardeners. Uh, don't get into this. Seriously, get into something like this. Seriously, get into something like crack. >> We have no worry that I'm going to >> No worry you're going to become an enthusiastic. >> Can barely keep a plant alive. >> Good, good, good. Okay. Um, but I guarantee if you went and looked around their house and placed an offer while being an expert in botany and generally quoting people like Gertude Jel and, you know, prominent garden designers and Sissinghurst and Da uh you could you could buy their house for 200,000 less than if you turned up and said, "Brilliant, we can knock down that tree and put in a helipad." Yeah. >> You know, I think if you said, "We can knock down that tree and put in a carting track." Right. I don't think carting track." Right. I don't think they'd sell it to you at any price. >> If you're a founder, you know naming your startup takes forever. You finally land on the perfect name only to find out that Peter from Delaware got to the first. So, you're stuck with two bad first. So, you're stuck with two bad options.

Richard Thaylor did I think his most interesting work of all is actually on the concept of transaction utility which you may remember do you remember this >> a little bit >> yeah it's in I think it's in nudge and the famous thought experiment is this which I find fascinating and I think it's a really insightful thought experiment so the idea is you and your best friend are lying on a beach somewhere and it's hot and you're very thirsty and about quarter of a mile down the beach there's a place that sells ice cold beer And your friend says to you, and he asks people to imagine this, your friend says to you, "I'm off to blank to buy a beer. Tell me what the maximum amount you're happy to pay for a beer is. And if the price they quote falls is. And if the price they quote falls below that threshold, okay, I will buy the beer. And if not, I won't." And he the beer. And if not, I won't." And he asked people to imagine what the threshold would be of what they'd pay for a beer on a hot day when they were parched on a beach for a cold beer. the beer is going to be consumed back where they're sitting. So the ambiance or you know the the clientele of the establishment selling the beer is irrelevant because you're not going to consume it there. And the interesting thing is in one situation he says there is a boutique hotel selling chilled beer >> and in the other situation he says there's a shack selling cold beer >> and your price changes >> and your your your readiness to pay changes partly in accordance to what you imagine to be the overheads of the establishment selling the good. Even though the >> even though the the utility of the beer as distinct from the how good the transaction feels >> the actual utility of the cold beer is identical in both cases. I think that's a I think that's Richard Thaylor and I think it's extraordinarily interesting because I think we can make you car car salesmen will know this you know make the transaction feel good make them feel good when they drive out of the place that was uh segini right you you know people are more likely to buy from you if they like you they're more likely to uh like you if they trust you and you have something in common with them and and you can use all of these things to manipulate people unfortunately It's not manipulation. Be careful on that because No, no, no. We got to be really care. I think we got to be really careful here. One, one thing might be that a genuine cold-blooded psychopath would intentionally might find it difficult. This is a Jeffrey Miller theory that if you're on a first date, there's an element where apparently, it's a long time. I've been married for 30 something time. I've been married for 30 something years, but women on a first date will turn up a bit late or do something a little bit annoying. And Miller's theory is that it's a psychopath detection test. So that if you >> Interesting. So, you know, one of the >> Interesting. So, you know, one of the worst things that can happen to women is to get into a relationship with someone who's, you know, psychopathic because you end up with an empty bank account and a, you know, and, you know, your sister's pregnant by her everything go, you know, everything goes hopelessly wrong. Someone who's written very wrong. Someone who's written very interestingly about this, by the way, is fabulous woman who writes about education and absolutely brilliant. I I'll remember her name in a second, but she's written quite about this having a psychopath in the family. Likewise, Kevin Dutton um has also written about this about his own father. There are certain things which you can do which make it very likely that psychopaths will out themselves. So the perfect test might be you bribe the waiter to tip soup on them. >> Oh, interesting. >> And they'll lose it. >> Or you turn up late and someone like assuming you're not a psycho because you're Canadian. So you know that's you're Canadian. So you know that's probably >> by default we're not >> relatively low. We're too polite. >> You're too polite. Exactly. Yes. It'd be too tiring to be a psychopath in Canada, wouldn't it? >> Soup on me. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been sitting here. >> It's I shouldn't have been here. My fault. I got in the way of your soup. Uh the psychopath will lose lose his rag. >> Um uh and can't control this. And likewise, if you turn up late, there's a chance they'll go, "Look, I've been sitting on my own like an idiot for 15 minutes." Whereas you and I would go, minutes." Whereas you and I would go, "Oh, I know. I only just got here myself. The traffic's terrible." myself. The traffic's terrible." >> Yeah. We don't fully know, you see, the value of what is going on in using a personal quality as a proxy for a decision which is simply too complicated to legalize or to reduce to numbers. Also, it is I'll completely agree in economic terms, it's suboptimal, but if it leads to downside variance reduction, which is what we're really trying to do. We're not trying to optimize. We're trying to reduce the optimize. We're trying to reduce the risk of downsize. Yeah. Downside variance, you know, and that's true in all sorts of things, investment strategy, etc. You know, the barbell approach, you know, first of all, make sure you don't don't do anything disastrous. Then after that, try and get disastrous. Then after that, try and get lucky. >> You you say it like it's a conscious thing, but I think it's an unconscious because because if it is conscious, it's probably a reverse signal that you're actually a bit uh offkilter. if you're consciously doing that. >> In fairness, if if you study social science matters, you've probably but I agree with you that the I mean my wife occasionally gets a bit annoyed with me because I'll get you know I will literally apply TALB logic to decisions. Just to give an example, I always argue that over 36 years holidays where I've rented a car are better than holidays where I haven't. And my argument is you have more optionality. See? >> Oh, interesting. So if you've rented a car and you find the hotel's a bit meh or the hotel's not in a great area, you can just get in the car and go and find a beach somewhere else and go there every day. You know, in other words, you every day. You know, in other words, you know, so I deploy occasionally we'll deploy these kind of taleb lines and I, you know, I'll also say let's fly from so and so because you know it's the satisfices. You you're the one who I remember this you said you should always fly from the smallest airport that's convenient for you. Is that it? you. Is that it? >> Oh, I'm I'm a big small airport thing person. Okay. person. Okay. >> Yeah. Yeah. Actually, it's it's kind of interesting because airports are schizophrenic in a way because the clientele of an airport is roughly speaking a 50/50 mix between people who fly a hell of a lot and just want to get through the damn thing as quickly as they can. And people who only fly once a they can. And people who only fly once a year who regard the trip to the airport as part of the holiday and they love going through a shopping center and looking at Hermes outlets or whatever. And so airports are effectively catering for two totally disperate groups of traveler. >> And you can separate these people in the security line effectively. >> You can absolutely you can separate them. And that's why you know um in a them. And that's why you know um in a weird kind of way I think you notice sometimes that the queue for the priority lane in security is longer than the queue for the amateur lane. But frequent business travelers will still join the priority lane on the assumption that the people in front of them are more competent. I mean there's a George more competent. I mean there's a George Clooney up in the air gag about that right and so it is very interesting because is it is it irrational if it's a very reliable mechanism so all right one example would be I don't think it I don't think it works very well nowadays because there are enough posh spivs around but in the you know in the 19th century if you were a posh and respected real estate agent you had a lot of reputational skin in the game in the local community both commercially in people, you know, so you were highly vulnerable to reputational damage both commercially and also socially >> because you know a small town or a you know would have been to a large extent a prestige economy >> and therefore you know dealing with the posh local estate agent rather than some guy who claims to be cheap is not irrational. you know then that you know irrational. you know then that you know the commission may be higher whatever it may be but in terms of reputational skin in the game as insurance against being you know treated appallingly but and you know I think there's a kind of weird thing going on which is that uh you know the the job of the real estate agent is to some extent to be the person who stays behind in the place where the house is sold to suffer the reputational consequences of you know of anything outrageous because the vendor of the house isn't really reputationally vulnerable if they're moving 300 miles away. >> Mhm. >> And so, you know, some of the role of these intermediaries is just highly complicated. >> But when I say that, you know, we fundamentally seem to attach very very high waiting to, for example, a call center experience versus website design. I'm not suggesting for a second website design isn't really important. It's it's almost like there's some experiences that are sort of additive or subtractive and then there's some that are multiplicative >> like you can multiply by zero or you can multiply by 10 like a difference in that one particular factor. There's a there's a really interesting organization I can't remember what they're called online they call this a brand quake. >> A brand quake is where you do something. It could be resolving a problem really well. That would be a very good well. That would be a very good opportunity for a brandquake. The person has a problem. you put quite a lot of effort and intelligence into solving it very effectively for them. Um and then you ring them back to check that the problem has indeed been solved. Now that would be an example of something I'll give you the per okay I'll give you the perfect story of this. My father uh who is you know half Scottish and um without stereotyping anybody was quite parimonious with what he bought generally. I mean I'm not I'm not saying generally. I mean I'm not I'm not saying it's genetic by the way. just culturally he was descended from long lines of Highland Scots who didn't get where they were today by you know splashing out and he had a I think three um when he died he had three or four Dyson devices which he'd bought from new in his home he had one on each floor to save from carrying them upstairs. Now these are by any them upstairs. Now these are by any objective measure pretty expensive vacuum cleaners. Mhm. vacuum cleaners. Mhm. >> One of the reasons he was so fanatically loyal was that Dyson, now interestingly, I'm going to make a point here, which is a privately owned company. >> Mhm. >> And that and do not do not underestimate the importance of this. PLC's or um uh or or companies on the NASDAQ or the New York Stock Exchange are incentivized to behave like psychopaths because they're optimized around short-term transactional value, not long-term relationship building. I think maybe the the generalization is that like if they're private companies led by a founder, then they're not run by the finance department. It's so interesting. I think about this a lot where you you have these short-term optimization and long-term effectiveness are two completely different. >> Short-term money off versus long-term value on. >> Yeah. Yeah. And so you can there's always somebody making more money than you, but you maybe they're cutting corners, maybe they're doing things that are unsustainable. And like you said, are unsustainable. And like you said, you can always save money in the short term, but do you damage your brand in life? >> By the way, my theory is the primary reason for the success of these private companies. It the secondary reason is companies. It the secondary reason is they look after their consumers better because they're effectively uh unwittingly their practitioners in the customer value movement, not the shareholder value movement. Well, Buffett had this saying where his directive, his letter I guess to all of his CEOs after he acquired the company was the only expectation I have for you is to treat this company as if you and your family have 100% of your money in it for 100 years and you can't take it out. >> Exactly that. Yeah. >> And and I think that that approach enables even in a public company that enables people to take long-term do the thing that's optimal. actually they do something they do something they look after their customers and there is an interesting exception to this probably which is for example Costco which and actually enterprise rental car is familyowned isn't it enterprise is familyowned >> in the and I've told everybody this in the IPA advertising effectiveness awards in the UK my argument is that with the exception of PNG Dagio unilver marketing le companies I don't think that plc's what do you call them in you know publicly traded I don't think they can actually do marketing very well >> because the requirement for short-term self-justification and numbers effectively overrides the real purpose of marketing which is investment in long-term customer value. >> I think this is why generalizing a little bit but this is why founders outperform even when they lead public corporations. They have the same corporations. They have the same pressures, the same analysts, the same but they also are considering posterity aren't they? What is my legacy? I mean, aren't they? What is my legacy? I mean, it's interesting actually the German car industry, although their public companies are sort of familyrun. Aldi famously, which owns Trader Joe's, is basically owned by actually two German families. They had a huge feud, but some families. They had a huge feud, but some things going on there. One of the things they do is they look after their staff better. And I think when you look after better. And I think when you look after your staff better, the customer notices. >> Well, this is part of the Costco thing. So, I mean, >> Costco. Exactly. But that comes from the >> Costco. Exactly. But that comes from the Saul Price line of thinking which when he started FedMart he sort of outlined the obligation of our business is we have a fidiciary relationship with a customer. Yeah. customer. Yeah. >> And Jim Sagal who founded Costco was a student of Saul Price and later on they would merge the companies. >> Of course they did, didn't they? Yes, you're absolutely right. Yeah. >> Yeah. And I I think that's interesting right where you treat your employees better. Uh nice story from Dyson which better. Uh nice story from Dyson which is familyowned. In fact, I think is familyowned. In fact, I think familyrun companies, this would include people like um SC Johnson. I think they should wear a badge. Do you see what I mean? Just as you have a kite mark on mean? Just as you have a kite mark on British >> Well, Lob Laws is familyowned, isn't it? For example, in Canada, family, >> family control McCain family control. Mhm. >> So what I was saying about the advertising effectiveness awards, four out of the five gold winners, it's only every two years this award and it's very very rigorously judged. Four out of the five winners, namely McCain, your >> Canadian uh heroes. Um McCain, Yorkshire Tea, Specs Savers, and Laithweights, a wine company. Four out of the five wine company. Four out of the five winners, the fifth one was Guinness, which is sort of a family company in a sense, although it's owned by a Dio. And so my point is that I, you know, we should actually have a kite mark that allows consumers to prefer to buy from companies which aren't listed on some stock exchange somewhere and hence aren't controlled by the finance function because they're more trustworthy. >> That's an interesting I don't know if I agree with that, but u it's interesting to think. >> Well, is Rogers what's is Rogers still family controlled? I mean, Canada's family controlled? I mean, Canada's absolutely packed full of Canadian tier. What about that? Increasingly you get family controlled but not economically controlled. So you have like a dual controlled. So you have like a dual class. >> So the western family would control lob laws to some extent even though they're not majority shareholder. >> Well I think if you if you have a corporation that's hundreds of billions and you control 10 or 15% of it. You effectively have control over the company. >> Of course. Yeah. Ford Motor Company falls into that definition. I think the f you know the family or some there's a particular class of shares. >> A lot of dual class coming. But hold on, I want to go back to Dyson for a sec. What makes Dyson so effective at advertising? >> Actually, it's it's not advertising, it's marketing and it's customer experience. >> What's the difference between marketing and advertising? >> Advertising is a subordinate part of marketing. And uh in many cases, even marketing. And uh in many cases, even though I've worked in advertising for 36 years, I I I want to think of myself probably unsuccessfully, but I still aspire to be a marketer, okay? not an advertising person because advertising is a useful toolkit available to the marketer and by the way generally is pretty effective but Peter Ducker the purpose of business is to find and keep a customer profitably uh that's the purpose of marketing it's to you know to you know to either create or find uh customers with whom over time you can engage in mutually advantageous relationships to mutual profit that's it >> so what makes Dyson so good at marketing? >> Well, the story I heard from someone who worked at Dyson for 12 years is that he was sitting in a presentation, James Dyson presiding and they were presenting the call center sort of efficiency statistics. By the way, I'm absolutely fanatical about call centers because I'm terrified that in an AI age, people will try and effectively automate them. Uh I think what you should do instead is make them slightly smaller but a lot better >> because I don't think you can substitute for the human in cases of unusual problems, special circumstances, empathy generally. Don't get me wrong, I think generally. Don't get me wrong, I think you can get AI empathy. I'm not suggesting that AI is going to be completely unempathic, but at some point it's rather like the equivalent of I want to speak to the manager. There will be situations where you want to speak to a person who can understand your specific situation and has the power to intervene to override the normal rules and regulations to solve your problem because it is common sensical to do so. Even if you know our what service level agreement doesn't normally allow us to send out a replacement part. In this case, since your part is faulty, >> somebody who has the power to do the right thing Got it. Exactly. And I think you know I Got it. Exactly. And I think you know I I think that will ultimately you'll have to have the human as the last port of call on that. Also your call center is the only way you can find out the problems that people can't solve anywhere else. Do you see what I mean? anywhere else. Do you see what I mean? So there was a very smart person I met at Microsoft who when they uh when they took over some fairly niche Microsoft product they put the call center in the middle of the development team. I mean, I would argue that the call center of British Airways should be on the same floor as the boardroom because it's where you find out where you're going wrong with your existing customers who are the most important people. You know, people talk a lot about product market fit, sales tactics, or pricing strategy. But the truth is, pricing strategy. But the truth is, success in selling often comes down to something much simpler, the system behind the sale. That's why I use and love Shopay because nobody does selling better than Shopify.

So often the businesses are run by the map which is like the spreadsheets, the volumes, the wait times, the whatever, but the territory is the customer calling in and the problem. >> That's cool, isn't it? >> The map is not the territory. >> Yeah. That they're experiencing. And so if you're not touching reality, you can get distorted by the map. But I want to go back. You've said by the way exactly go back. You've said by the way exactly the same thing Dan Davis did which is one huge advantage of being a customer value company not a shareholder value company is that customers live in the real world and therefore you are actually rooted in reality whereas shareholders by the way not share owners but the shareholders are principally interested in justifying their own existence to their investors and therefore they're dealing with a highly artificial construct in terms of defining the value of a customer But I think what's best for the shareholders is what's best for the customer. It's just the timeline mismatch that people have. So if your timeline for well it's have. So if your timeline for well it's incoherent by the way the shareholder value movement is totally incoherent because over what time frame which shareholder is what are you optimizing for? It's a completely incoherent for? It's a completely incoherent nonsense which is very very friendly to stock market analysts who want a ready supply of quarterly data so they can their way out of things. How valuable it is to people with pensions is a completely separate matter because one of the things it does is it prevents companies from innovating effectively and it prevents them from investing properly in customer relationships. >> Okay. Come back to Dyson. You were telling me this story. Somebody had worked there for 12 years. >> So they were going blah blah blah average call time blah blah blah average wait time and it was the standard kind of call center metrics about effectively how quickly can we get these people off the phone. I mean it's a bit more the phone. I mean it's a bit more sophisticated than that. You know, I'm sure there's some measure of satisfaction, but it was kind of evaluating the call center on an operational efficiency standpoint. And Dyson basically said, "Stop right now. You've got this all wrong. The way we should look at this is we should treat it as an honor if one of our customers chooses to get in touch with us, and we should therefore respond to them accordingly, as if we're flattered by the contact, not as if we're bothered by the interruption or words to that effect. I'm I'm putting words in his effect. I'm I'm putting words in his mouth, but this is roughly speaking what the person said happened in the meeting. >> That makes a lot of sense. I mean, >> and by the way, that's why my father had four Dyson. Stingy man though he was. I four Dyson. Stingy man though he was. I hope he won't mind me saying this, my late father. But every time he rang them late father. But every time he rang them up, which might have been only once every year. >> Yeah. >> They did something astonishing and they were really, really helpful and they solved the problem and the part arrived the next day. Sometimes they didn't even charge for the replacement part and therefore he completely trusted those people and therefore was willing to pay an enormous premium really over other vacuum cleaners which might have had the same notional you know effectiveness precisely because of that trust. There's so much opportunity here, right? If you think of you competing in a world where we're moving to AIdriven call centers, uh if I took the exact opposite approach, which is by the way, you should do both. >> A really, really good service organization allows for very streamlined efficient service for people who know exactly what they want and extremely emp empathetic service for people who are undecided, uncertain or find themselves in an unusual situation. And so you need to do both. And that's that's where I think the tech bros have got it all wrong because they see the opportunity of tech as being a one-way street towards ever greater efficiency, streamlining. And let's face it, tech streamlining. And let's face it, tech bros are not neurotypical in terms of what they want from things. When you allow tech bros too much power over decision-making along with their running dog lackey in kind of management consultancy, you're optimizing for something which may be very very distant from what your real world customers really care about. >> You're using tech crows as like a >> No, no, no, no. It's perfectly reasonable to say that the people who work in this field and not representative of the whole human population. That's a reasonable population. That's a reasonable assertion. >> What is it you're representing when you say tech bro though? Um, anybody in a tech industry, just as anybody in advertising, myself included, is overweighted towards a belief in the ability of advertising to solve all problems. And I will truly admit that I am guilty as charged. Um, however, ad people don't get that much opportunity to convince other people of the rightness of their argument. What has happened is that in marketing for example the tech companies the consulting firms that sell stacks and I owe a lot of this to a guy called Adel Bori very interesting self-taught Libyan marketing writer former boxer Annel Bori and I coined the phrase technopplasmosis by analogy with toxopplasmosis which is tech people and consultants have taken over the finance department >> so that the marketing metrics the finance department has faith in and demands from marketing are not those metrics which are most conducive to building brand and customer value over time. They're the metrics which are most time. They're the metrics which are most conducive to selling tech solutions to the companies. >> What are the metrics that are most >> well it's all about short-term transactional uh bottom of the funnel um clickth through you know how can you shovel money to meta in a slightly more efficient way. It's not about long-term efficient way. It's not about long-term value creation at all right now. Now, don't get me wrong. All that bottom of the funnel short-term transactional stuff is very important to get right. I'm not I'm not disparaging it, but it's only a third of the game, >> right? >> And they're not interested in the other two/irds of the game because they don't make money if someone spends money on their call center or, you know, upgrades their call center staff or allows the call center staff to call out. >> It's sort of like cyber security. It's seen as a cost. It's a cost. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, Bonnie Blue would do really well in this because she's all about the numbers, not about the quality of the relationship. You know, funny enough, she did work in NHS finance procurement. Ironically, or no, finance recruitment actually. She recruited people for N for National Health Service finance. So, her approach to sex is merely an extrapolation of what she learned, I think, recruiting finance people for the National Health Service. All all about the quantity, not Service. All all about the quantity, not about the value creation, the the relationship. I like this quantification relationship. I like this quantification bias thinking I mean Buffett okay you're quite rightly your hero um is he was obsessed with the quality of the management of companies with whom he invested wasn't he >> well I mean I'm obsessed with personal factors I've read a lot in I think I'm going to give a nuanced answer here I don't know the answer so I'll preface that with that I did read a lot about what he used to do in the 60s and he used to hire like private investigators And what he was trying to determine, I don't think it was anything about the person other than does what they say line up with who they are. >> And if the answer's yes, I can deal with that because I know what to expect. And if the answer's no, if they're they can't go to work and, you know, claim to be a penny pincher, because if they go to work and say they're going to cut costs, but they're driving around with a Ferrari or whatever, like this is a thing that it doesn't line up. And so I I feel like he was always just trying to assess the predictability of people if that makes sense. >> In other words, by looking at their consistency >> consistency did the management >> do what they said they were going to do. the balance sheet changes over you know like he was a very he had a different emphasis on things than people I think realize and I think with a lot of his investments I mean my personal take is he was looking for predictability and it wasn't about massive disruption it was never about things being turned around he got out of that in the late60s with diversified refilling was the last real turnaround situation they sort of got themselves into they exited quickly and when They got burned. Did they quite Well, they didn't really get burned, but I was talking to Munger about this over dinner one day and he's like, "We just realized that we made a mistake. Uh, we were never going to make a lot of money in this business and it was highly competitive and we had no edge and so they got out as quickly as they could." Uh, and I think that the predictability of what he buys, at least his long-term holdings, like if you look at that, I think it's really interesting because it's like you can kind of see it. The railroad, people are going to be using the railroad in 50 years. That's a great example. So, it will be unbelievably example. So, it will be unbelievably difficult to build a competing one, >> but you can also you can leverage it if it's predictable. And leverage is is it's predictable. And leverage is is this interesting thing where he says they don't do a lot. And they don't when you look at the whole company, but on the railroad, for instance, they'll a decent amount of debt in the railroad because they know what the earnings it's very predictable the same as the energy where they're putting a lot of capital they put a lot of debt in and I talked to this guy in um Nova Scotia John Bragg and he sort of did the same thing and so he c he created Oxford frozen foods he's this incredible story he's this billionaire from this small town of 1100 people he started >> I've been to Nova Scotia what's it called Oxford Nova >> it's called Oxford Nova Scotia and started not one, not two, but three multi-billion dollar companies from this small town of,00 people. >> Is he still there? >> He's still there. Yeah. They're like that. >> Such a great guy, too. And it was fascinating to talk to him because he basically was like, "Look, you know, he owns North America's largest private telecommunications company." And he telecommunications company." And he said, "I wasn't afraid of debt at all." No. >> And we levered up massively. We went all in multiple times acquiring more assets, acquiring, >> but if there's something more volatile, he gets very nervous about the debt. >> So, he wouldn't do it if there was volatility. But he also had this thing volatility. But he also had this thing where it was so counterintuitive to what you hear on Wall Street, which is is like, I don't mind paying more, you know? I don't mind paying the most. Uh, know? I don't mind paying the most. Uh, and I was like, really, that surprises me. And he's like, well, a lot of these me. And he's like, well, a lot of these things only come up once. I don't get another shot at it. And if I'm a private company, I don't have public company shareholders, uh, and it takes me, you know, 5 years versus 3 years to get my money back out of the deal, why do I care? I'm never going to be offered this care? I'm never going to be offered this again, and they're not going to build another one. >> No. >> So, when it comes to fiber optic in the ground, he's like, it's getting harder and harder to do. >> What is this company, the Canadian company in telecoms? >> Uh, it's East Link Cable Communications. >> I've heard that. Yeah. And so, but they not only do they deliver cable to a large portion of Canada, but they own a lot of infrastructure that people aren't aware of. And he's like, well, what aware of. And he's like, well, what difference does it make? And I've been chewing on that nugget ever since. And you know, you can apply this from a marketing perspective as well, right? If you if you have a client or go back to real estate for a sec. I have a client who's looking at a lakehouse or a cabin or a cottage or whatever you call them in in the UK or in the United States and you get a property and you say my budget is I don't know say 500,000 and you find a property that's seven and is it worth splurging on the $700,000 property or whatever it is and the answer is is this like a once in a generation property that I'm never going to have the shot at again and if you can frame frame things >> is also much more likely to be scarce >> the rarer you get generally >> and then overpaying you make overpaying seem rational and in a way it kind of is rational where it's like well this is only going to come up once so like I I have a friend actually going through this now they're looking at buying a family cottage and I'm like how do you think about these things he's like I saw this one it was perfect but it was a little more money than I brought this up having a cottage on a lake on which yours is the only cottage is the kind of gold standard for Canadian property. >> That would be the dream. Have a lot of lakes. Yes. But I'd always heard that as lakes. Yes. But I'd always heard that as a kind of >> but it's sort of like what what do you want? If you want a second property, you want? If you want a second property, you want proximity so it's easy to get to. You want privacy. Uh so there's not a lot of things around it. And these things just don't come up very often as many lakes as we have. I mean the the prime properties come up maybe once every five or six years per lake. And >> and as Kaden said, in the long term, we're all dead. >> And we're all dead. So anyway, an interesting aside here, but when we sat down, we were talking about high trust versus low trust societies and introducing friction. Yeah. I'm introducing friction. Yeah. I'm wondering, spend a beat on that for a second. >> Well, I met um someone you must interview, by the way, called Philip K. Howard, who's written various books called Life Without Lawyers. He's just written a book which is coming out right now called um uh I think it's uh can do which is restoring the spirit of American can do and he argues that a large part of economic decline and social malaise has come from the overintrusion of law and regulation into practices which should properly be left to subjective human judgment. that we've created a culture where people are so afraid of making a subjective decision that they fall back on often totally inappropriate rules and regulations. And there are a whole bunch of people who are employed not always by the government just as much by the private sector who are much more interested in adherence to uh approved procedure than they are in quality of outcome. >> Because you can't get fired for >> you can't get fired for following the rules. >> You can't get me in trouble. Well, you told me to follow this proced and common sense would be to opt out at some point in certain situations and use your brain and judgment and uh but if I do that if I have if I do very little parapet there's no upside uh and there's considerable uh reputational risk and and career risk >> from doing something slightly perverse and different. But there are a whole and different. But there are a whole bunch of arguments. First of all, an awful lot of quality human decision-making of necessity has to be tacit and instinctive, not regulatory. There are various people I think it might be Michael Palani who says most of life is like a kaleidoscope. We never completely encounter the same situation twice. Mhm. twice. Mhm. >> And therefore regulating for the universal when in fact the great evolutionary gift of the human brain is adapting to context is inherently lawyers love it of course because they make money out of this. You know, arguably uh the legal system, particularly in the United States, has strayed into all kinds of areas which were once settled by two humans amicably discussing something and possibly finding a creative resolution to to the trade-off that's replaced by effectively we will take this to a legal decision and that starts to infect um particularly because there's no tor law reform in the US and that's partly Because I was told yesterday trial lawyers are among the largest donors to the Democratic Party because they resist any kind of tort law reform. M >> this has led to things that should be solved through our evolved human talent for conflict resolution being solved through totally inappropriate application of of uh legal structures to a situation which is uh in many cases not really adequately captured by law or where a legal decision is made which makes perfect sense within one setting but which sets a precedent which leads to ludicrous second order consequences. Yeah. So for example, if you accept the fact that a I think has happened in one of uh Philip K. Howard's cases, someone demanded that trees were dropped down in their street because one of their grandchildren was allergic to the nut that came off the tree. The argument would be that if you accept that, which may seem kind-hearted and uh you know and and generous within that particular frame of reference, ultimately you've opened up the path to widespread deforestation because nobody can grow a tree anywhere to which anybody could claim to be allergic. There's an interesting case um allergic. There's an interesting case um in England where someone broke into a theme park or some park of some kind and then while drunk dove into a pond which wasn't really deep and hurt themselves and then sued in the lower courts they said there should have been a notice warning of the shallow water because you could reasonably anticipate this problem and then it went up to the high whatever whoever it was the lawlords at the time and they said if you took if you took this ruling to its uh uh you know natural consequences you would have no lakes you know you would have no swimming you would have no swings you'd have no playgrounds because everything would have to be ge around with warnings about every possible anticipated negative consequence that could arise from this part of the environment and so what what happens is that uh you've created a kind of idea I suppose where the legal solution has become the default >> uh when it should in fact be the last resort. >> What happened to common sense? >> Well, this is this is the argument being that that your fellow countrymen, what's his name? Um Rston Saul, John Rston his name? Um Rston Saul, John Rston Saul. Have you come across him? Saul. Have you come across him? >> No. >> You Canadians totally underrate yourselves. You know, you produce yourselves. You know, you produce wonderful people and you're always trying to import people like me from the UK or people from the US. John Rolston saw wrote this book which I think is called Voltater's Bastards >> and he argues that human brains have evolved with a variety of mental capabilities only one of which is the capacity for reason. >> There's also the capacity for imagination, creativity, common sense, you know, etc. We have a whole variety of different mental mechanisms at our disposal gifted to us by, you know, a few million years of evolution as a social species. And yet we've made social species. And yet we've made rationality the gold standard. This is what's weird about working in advertising, by the way. And I think it's probably similar way. And I think it's probably similar to theoretical physics and it's probably similar to entrepreneurialism. Okay, which is what's unusual about those fields is that rationality is the bronze standard >> in advertising. If someone says, you know, uh this is the problem and you come up with a completely rational solution, um people don't go, right, that's perfect. let's go and do it as that's perfect. let's go and do it as they would do in a finance setting or a compliance setting. Okay? In most of compliance setting. Okay? In most of decision- making in institutions, rationality, i.e. quality of rationality, i.e. quality of argumentation is the gold standard. In advertising, if you came up with a rational ad, people go, "Yeah, it's all right, but can you do a bit better?" You know, is there an ad that says the same thing, but in a more emotionally engaging way? Is there an ad that says engaging way? Is there an ad that says the same thing in a way that's funny? Is there an ad that says this in a way people will remember or will act on? So what is funny about being an advertising creative and you know I spent 20 years of my life either in or managing those departments is you know the rational solution is where you start >> you use it as a springboard to something better. There's a famous quote, you better. There's a famous quote, you know, fascinatingly from Neil Spore who said, "You're not thinking, you are merely being logical." Isn't it? I think you'll know that >> he was an interesting guy, wasn't he? In terms of his because he also was the person who said the opposite of a good idea, you know, in boring physics, the opposite of a good idea is wrong, but in high level physics, the opposite of a good idea might be another good idea. >> Mhm. >> Yeah. What can we learn from marketing from the madmen era that's still true today? Uh today? Uh >> I think there was an understanding then and the remuneration of agencies respected this because you were paid on commission. So if you had a big idea and commission. So if you had a big idea and you came up with a campaign and the client spent millions running the campaign, you made money from that campaign for years after you'd conceived it. So it was rather like having it. So it was rather like having royalties on a book. >> Oh, okay. >> We didn't realize that at the time. Then media independence came along and so we had to be paid by the hour like lawyers and management consultants and we've never recovered because it's a catastrophic way to be paid and the reason it's a catastrophic way to be paid my argument is that marketing is actually fat tailed so is innovation R&D pharmaceutical research science okay in other words 5 to 10% of what you do delivers perhaps 110% of the value and therefore paying people by the power and demanding that every quantum of effort has to be matched to a quantum of value creation in some neat proportion. This is so the way market never mind advertising that okay right let's look at the whole of marketing as a discipline within an organization of which advertising is not a not necessarily very important part you know for a lot of organizations it may be you know relatively trivial what they actually spend on bought communication on the other hand uh you know how you design your reception or you know whatever you know that's still affected the application of psychology to value creation let's say you have a brilliant idea and the value of that idea last goes on for 10 years. And I've seen this happen all the time. The agency, let's say an agency had the idea. It may well have been the client who had that idea. They are held responsible for every single unit of cost they incur >> year by year by year by year. You cannot offset any of those costs against the value you created in 2023 by having a huge idea. Let me give you an example. huge idea. Let me give you an example. There's an enormous idea for a very large enormous American, let's say, fastmoving consumer goods company. There's an idea conceived by Oglev Australia. It has made that company in Australia. It has made that company in excess of a billion dollars in the last 10 years. It's still running. It runs in 10 years. It's still running. It runs in something like a hundred markets. Still useful today. For that idea, the agency in Australia got paid $350,000 Australian dollars. Or rather, that's Australian dollars. Or rather, that's what they made from it. So in other words, you have a billion dollar idea, you get to buy a small flat in a crap part of Sydney. Now what I'm saying is that this is not me bleing about the advertising industry. It's saying that advertising industry. It's saying that anything like R&D or marketing which is fat tailed, in other words, a small percentage of what you do, it's Jeff Bezos's point about in business, you know, in baseball you can only score four, in business you can score a thousand. In marketing thousand. In marketing when you score a thousand which and the purpose half the purpose of marketing is not operational gradual incremental improvement it's finding another way to hit the ball out of the park and score 100. If you cannot claim the credit for 100. If you cannot claim the credit for that except to the extent that it delivers value in the quarter in which you had the idea or the financial year in which you had the idea you are underfunding your marketing effort. So, it's like saying to imagine if you went to JK Rowling and said, "Yep, you can have the royalties on the Harry Potter books, but only on the first edition." And consequently, long-term marketing ideas when you're paid by the hour or when you're evaluated by the quarter as marketers would be. Now, you wouldn't go into a pharmaceutical research company and said, "You invent a blockbuster drug this week." No. Or you're all fired. You this week." No. Or you're all fired. You accept the fact that you spend a load of money effectively. Okay, this is the money effectively. Okay, this is the brutal truth. Okay, you don't you don't brutal truth. Okay, you don't you don't find entrepreneurs in chess clubs. You find entrepreneurs in casinos. They're playing poker. They're playing bat gam. You know, they're playing games of chance with an occasional very high payoff. And a lot of life is exactly payoff. And a lot of life is exactly like that, but you don't know where the huge payoff's going to come in advance. The people who are running these organizations for the benefit of financial predictability are trying to make it chess. They're trying to turn it into a reductionist game where the most you can score is one for a win. >> They're trying to put a ceiling on. >> They're trying effectively to to to pretend it's a high variance mechanis low sorry a low variance mechanistic predictable process. >> 50 50% of your effort in life once you've ensured the fact that you're not going to starve to death, die, etc. You know, you've looked after your children should be attempts to get lucky. In other words, what Nim would say, I love this phrase, uh, increasing your surface area exposure to posit to positive upside optionality. You know, finding upside optionality. You know, finding opportunity. But hold on for one sec. I opportunity. But hold on for one sec. I want to go back to this. I want to think about this out loud here. And maybe I'm wrong. With a book, it's great. I write wrong. With a book, it's great. I write a book once, I can sell it for the next hundred years, assuming I've earned it on my road. >> Yeah. If you have a great marketing idea which continues to add value for the next 15 years, the difference some of that credit should be offset against your current marketing costs. Fair. The difference is marketing also can go the other way and and like Jaguar perhaps or Cracker Barrel, I don't know if you followed the So you can create negative value. It's not like the baseline is value. It's not like the baseline is zero and there's only upside and the upside is like one to 1 million. You can actually destroy a company through marketing. >> The case is okay. >> And advertising. >> Uh some of those I'm going to defend the companies. >> Oh, please do. Yeah. Yeah. >> Because in the case of Bud Light, >> are you defending Bud Light? I want to hear this. >> Yeah. No, no, no. They could not have necessarily anticipated that because it was confected outrage. Look, I'm politically on the right. Okay. I get just as angry from confected outrage on the on the right, which is, "Oh, they've gone woke when, you know, you're merely showing, you know, a mix of ethnic groups you're advertising or something. This is bull, right?" And and the right do it and the right?" And and the right do it and the left do it. Uh there's confected outrage on the left, I would argue, about um American Eagle, and it's confected outrage on the right. It's done for signaling purposes by a very narrow group of people. Do those cases actually damage the business? I don't know the figures. Gillette did. There was an figures. Gillette did. There was an extremely Now, this wasn't confected outrage because Gillette ran an advertisement. They realized they had to advertisement. They realized they had to move on perhaps from the best a man can get despite the fact obviously that their customer base is overwhelmingly male for fairly obvious reasons. And they produced an ad which I would argue and even my wife would argue was needlessly um insulting towards men in that it conflated the me too movement with barbecuing. Okay. In other words, it seemed to take a definition of toxic masculinity which went which went the whole spectrum from things which all rightinking men would quite rightly condemn to things which for example two boys having a you know a small scrap on a patch of grass which all primates play fight. It's not, you know, don't get me wrong, sorry. If, you know, there's a kid wailing on another kid with a plank of wood, uh, you know, I'll be quick to condemn it, but I'm not totally, you know, the odd play fighting thing, barbecuing, I don't think is particularly objectionable. And that was particularly objectionable. And that was a case where it was almost a kind of act of deliberate affronttery to your core target audience. The Bud Light thing, to target audience. The Bud Light thing, to put it in context, was a influencer marketing campaign of which most people in the company were probably unaware where they sent personalized caners of Bud Light to a variety of different uh influencers, one of whom was Dylan Mulvaney. Um, now I've got to confess Mulvaney. Um, now I've got to confess about this as a Brit, you're Canadian. >> Mhm. >> The gender thing isn't quite the flash point in the UK or Canada as it is in the United States. Did you know for example um that when it came out I found this quite interesting in Britain we've had pantomime for 200 years you know men dressing up as women you know women dressing up as attractive women dressing up as young boys Shakespeare you know crossdressing some like it hot was a highly controversial film with all the studios in the United States when it came out because it involved men dressing up as women now in the UK my grandmother went to see it she was a sort of conservative woman in a Welsh provincial It would not have occurred to her literally that there was anything controversial about this at all. It was simply funny. >> I think what maybe has changed is the meaning we ascribed to it. >> Well, in this case, my argument was okay. All it was they hadn't made Dylan okay. All it was they hadn't made Dylan Mulvaney the face of Bud Light, >> right? >> You know, and I think creating these cultural flash points through confected outrage is something to be disparaged when the rights do it and when the left do it. I don't I I think it's equally I do it. I don't I I think it's equally I think it's equally absurd because you have in any communication you have to understand context and the intention of the person producing the communication. Now in the case of Jaguar they wanted it to look unlike a I would argue I mean I was talking to Rick Rubin who was in Hawaii and he'd heard about the Jaguar ad the it wasn't an ad by the way. Do you know that don't you? It way. Do you know that don't you? It never ran as an advertisement. It was a brand film they showed at the launch of the car. And then I had a right-wing the car. And then I had a right-wing podcast uh in the UK going, you know, it utters the most out, you know, um outrageous anti-conservative sentiment, which is copy nothing. Copy nothing was the exhortation of Sir William Lions who founded Jaguar. You know, I I I think he founded Jaguar. You know, I I I think he said it in 1932. He was the original founder of the car company. You've also got to understand their position. What are they trying to do? So, so I'm just explaining this just in wider in wider context, which is >> they fundamentally made a mistake. I can't blame them for doing it because we all do this. We all benchmark against our most obvious competitor. >> Don't benchmark against your most obvious competitor. All you'll do is obvious competitor. All you'll do is make make yourself a copy of them. And Jaguar was always trying to compete head-to-head with BMW, Mercedes, and Audi. Mhm. Audi. Mhm. >> And bluntly put, because of the scale of those entities, it was always going to lose. Because if you're the kind of lose. Because if you're the kind of person who's happy to buy a BMW, an Audi, or a Mercedes, and you're also happy to buy a Jaguar, you'll probably end up buying an Audi, a Mercedes, or a BMW simply to, you know, because of scale, winner takes all effects, all manner of other things. So, if Jaguar needs to survive in the electric car age, making its cars in the UK, which as a Jaguar lover, I ideally want them to continue to do, they've got to find a different kind of target audience rather than benchmarking themselves against uh, you know, companies which have gains to scale and a whole load of advantages they can't replicate. And so going for what you might call the car of choice of the wealthy younger creative class. Reasonable bet. >> It's a reasonable bet. Okay. I work in advertising. Okay. I'm I'm massive car advertising. Okay. I'm I'm massive car lover. I really really like for example lover. I really really like for example the Chris Bangal era BMWs I thought were magnificent. I really really like those magnificent. I really really like those because can't buy one. And the reason is because part of my shtick, okay, is being a bit left field. And if I drive around in an Audi, it kind of screams I work in financial services, >> right? >> Okay. You know, I aspire to managerial roles. Do you see what I mean? roles. Do you see what I mean? >> Yeah. >> And so, you know, I've always bought slightly weird cars there. I don't know. I've been fed to there. I don't know. I've been fed to know what you have. What What do you have back in Canada? I got to ask. >> Uh, I have a Tesla. >> Oh, fine. You see that? You know, did you do you have a sticker on it that says I bought this before Elon went mad or anything like that so that Canadians don't key your car? It's >> been keyed three times. >> It's been keyed by and uh run into by uh somebody I can only assume intentionally uh in the past. >> Ota. >> Oh yeah. In the past. >> Well, Otawa is this like hot bed of Elon haters. Is it? haters. Is it? >> It's interesting because my mom got me one of those stickers and I I was like, I don't have a problem with Elon. like I don't I don't understand this. I'm not going to put that on my car. And you I want to relate this to sort of evolution. >> I agree. It's a little like um biting the hand that feeds you, isn't it? >> Well, it's also like going back to the Jaguar butt. We can tie these two things Jaguar butt. We can tie these two things together, right? And I think we need together, right? And I think we need >> a variation in approaches. And the the point of this is like we need more people like Elon, not fewer in the world. Whether you agree with him or world. Whether you agree with him or not, this is how society progresses. We need differences. We have an environment and people thrive or don't thrive in that environment. Ideally, we have some that environment. Ideally, we have some sort of social safety net uh to catch people um if they don't succeed. >> But not ideally, that's essentially in any civilized society. >> And and so Jaguar the same thing. They're they're taking a bat as a company. They're being different. They company. They're being different. They occupy an environment and manage. >> If you think about it, they survive as Land Rover, Range Rover because they have effectively created the category they dominate, >> right? So I want more variety. >> right? So I want more variety. >> No. Oh right. This is this is where your wonderful compatriate Rodri Martin, praise be upon him, okay, makes this point that um economists have this fantasy of the world of companies in direct competition driving down price and increasing efficiency while supplying the same thing which is based on a false premise that people know what they want to begin with. Now I would argue when you don't create differentiation, everybody suffers. Now let me explain everybody suffers. Now let me explain because if you have a differentiated car market, it makes the car market more valuable overall to investors because uh you know there is more variety within the market. It benefits the companies the market. It benefits the companies because they can achieve a reasonable profit on what they do because it has some degree of scarcity or uniqueness and it benefits the consumer because the consumer ends up with more choice. What often happens is you have something like a regulated telecoms market or you have a regulated insurance market and everybody is forced to compete along the same dimension and what you end up with is just red red ocean competition and nobody wins. >> But where I was going with all of this is that going back to the Madman era and how you can create a billion dollar uh profit for the company and only get paid like 300k. >> You need to watch that. Yeah. And I think I've never actually watched MMA, but I think the the point that I was getting at is you can also create negative value and like how do you ascribe for the negative value? >> I can speak for Gillette where the evidence was that it was and by the way the research showed it was deeply problematic with a large swave of people. Has a American Eagle suffered? I people. Has a American Eagle suffered? I doubt it. In some ways you could argue it's an ingenious marketing strategy which is that you press the hot buttons of 1% of the population. So they then repeat your message accompanied by their own signaling outrage. Meanwhile, you get free media coverage practically everywhere. >> But maybe I'm naive. >> I mean, the media budget for that Jaguar film you realize was zero. >> Maybe I'm naive. Like the Sydney Sweeney American Eagle thing, I think we're just going back to normal, aren't we? and like we've we've sort of deviated in the last few years and and that seems more maybe it's akin to my time and my frame and like when I was brought up, but like nothing about that struck me as rage or um on either side. Like when I looked at that, I was like, "Oh, great." It's just like an advertisement. It's a pup. >> Yeah. Like it just I didn't even think more I didn't think there was more to it. I just saw, oh, this is great. it. I just saw, oh, this is great. Right. There there's a kind of weird sensitivity signaling which generally has nothing to do with the groups you are trying to protect which is just it's sometimes called a purity spiral where you effectively signal your moral or political purity by signaling extraordinary heightened sensitivity to anything that might conceivably offend someone else. even if the group on whose someone else. even if the group on whose behalf you claim to be campaigning is completely unconcerned by it. >> But like the opposite of her, whatever that would be, it would not cause rage in me either. It would just I wouldn't I wouldn't even think about the brand, you know? It would just be like another know? It would just be like another thing that flies by. I don't understand why we're so hair triggered at that this moment in time unlike maybe never before. way you have to really watch it before. way you have to really watch it in um and I've I've noticed this in certain people on the right which is I think it's fundamentally dangerous to invest too much of your own identity in a political standpoint to the point where I I've seen it in people both sides become effectively deranged. Now, you could say that's deranged. Now, you could say that's that's the effect of the people who attack them and that uh the derangement wouldn't happen and wouldn't be necessary in a different kind of media environment. What's different about environment. What's different about today? Why is everybody on such a hair today? Why is everybody on such a hair trigger? Why do we identify so strongly trigger? Why do we identify so strongly with extremes? I'm going to say actually with extremes? I'm going to say actually that everybody always blames social media. I would argue that the mainstream media, it is always in your interest, and this is a problem in journalism. It's always in your interest to provoke a fight because then you have something to cover. Nobody's interested in reading cover. Nobody's interested in reading about peace and harmony. They're interested in reading about discord and argument and dispute. By the way, that's an evolutionary tendency. If we're sitting here and we hear we heard a fight break out across the street, we'd be there with our noses pressed up against the glass. Okay? If if we heard, you know, people amicably discussing the weather, we wouldn't pay it the slightest attention. you know, where slightest attention. you know, where where we we've fundamentally evolved to pay attention to uh conflict >> and so the only difference is the tools available to us >> and the extent to which social media provide the mainstream media with the tool. I mean in 1975 if you wanted to tool. I mean in 1975 if you wanted to find someone who was outraged by the the Sydney Sweeney advertisement, you'd actually have to do some leg work, wouldn't you? I don't think you now now wouldn't you? I don't think you now now it's one search on X or uh you know blue sky or whatever it may be. Uh willful misunderstanding is another thing that you know is another technique which is deployed. It's perfectly obvious. I mean deployed. It's perfectly obvious. I mean I you know it's perfectly obvious that that had is not intended to mean Sydney Sweeney is the flower of Aryan womanhood. Okay, it's not you know it's womanhood. Okay, it's not you know it's not that. Now in a perfect world had not that. Now in a perfect world had they had more budget maybe they would have had three celebrities of different different ethnicities or genders or whatever it may be um but nonetheless this business where you effectively effect to be outraged by things well I'll give you a lovely story about this I always forget which is I don't think phrases like uncomfortable or offended or inappropriate you know you know you that you get these things where you know your presence here people would find it you know would feel unsafe triggering okay they don't really belong in the public sphere >> you know they're matters which for you know a few hundred thousand years we simply sorted out amongst ourselves we didn't have we didn't make recourse to the university dean or the supreme court in cases where we were bothered by things because you accepted that's just part of life and we were allowed then creatively to find ways to get along without recourse to some sort of speurious rule book. Consequently, you know, I don't I don't think those phrases like in I mean, this is one of the worst things that happens. You say, you know, was accused someone is described in the newspaper as being accused of inappropriate behavior. Now, I now have no idea. I mean, I've literally had to book people for speaking engagements. You go on their speaking engagements. You go on their Wikipedia page and it says accused of inappropriate behavior. Now, I have no inappropriate behavior. Now, I have no idea whether they're the next Epstein, right? or whether they told a knockk right? or whether they told a knockk knockock joke that two people found unpleasant. Do you have them in Canada? unpleasant. Do you have them in Canada? Knock knock. At least I'm not being complet because otherwise I could have been misunderstood there. You see, but you I I now have no idea. Literally no idea whether the person's guilty of some utterly trivial infraction which would only have offended 0.01% of the population >> or they're not guilty at all. somebody just made up an accusation and the accusation became the framing and the framing became the narrative. >> So it strikes me as highly problematic in the UK. I'm not one of these people, by the way. I'm not, you know, I'm not JD Vance. I don't believe that free JD Vance. I don't believe that free speech is completely dead in the UK. But there are worrying signs where people who make a complaint on the basis that they found something disturbing can then call in the that's not a police matter unless it involves a direct threat of physical action. >> Yeah. I mean simply being disqued by something can't be. >> But we we've gotten to this point and you know to varying degrees in varying different countries where you know the we don't tolerate people who have different ideas than us and we saw this last week play out in the US with the assassination of Charlie Kirk. And so whether you agree or disagree with him and his views, >> I have to confess I was only dimly aware of his existence beforehand perhaps because I'm a Brit. Uh I mean I I I'd heard the name and I knew he >> we see the same thing in Canada with sort of our politics, right? I imagine you see in the US too where media is definitely uh intolerable of one position and more favorable of the other. You can analyze this. You can study it. You could do a PhD on this. It exists. And it seems like we're just not capable of having to think for ourselves. And we're not capable of having reason discussion on things and and being friends with people. It used to be back in the the 30s, the 40s, the the Churchill era, both sides of the the house or would talk to each other. They would have dinner together. They would find common ground. How many of these people who are hypers sensitized on one side or the other, how many of them really exist? By the way, don't include really exist? By the way, don't include things like one of the things I find really disturbing is the practice of the media describing people who say oppose uncontrolled immigration and describe them as a far-right group. >> Oh, and well, because that is that you know you normal people are described as far right now. So, so in other words, if if you literally take an opinion which may may be held, by the way, from my own personal standpoint, I'm pretty benignely disposed to immigration uh within reason. However, I also believe within reason. However, I also believe in democracy and if a significant proportion of the population disagrees with me, I owe it to them to hear them out because their circumstances are different to my own. You know, I might be beneficially, you know, one of the slightly annoying things is people who are very rich people who are pro- immigration because they say their Polish housekeeper is wonderful. Well, that is an experience of immigration which is not shared perhaps by any means by the other 98% of people. I'm conscious of the fact that depending on where you are, you see the world differently. That's inevitable. And the differently. That's inevitable. And the job of a democracy is to accept uh the majority opinion even when it goes against your own. And so describing and vilifying an opinion which is held by a fairly large weight of the population regardless by the way the rights and wrongs of the whole thing. I'm not even getting into this now. Um it's deeply dangerous because people go well if that makes me far right it looks like I'm far right. I mean, insulting, calling people right. I mean, insulting, calling people deplorables is a terrible, terrible way of getting deplorables to gang up against you and then people don't speak up. They tell their opinions and then up. They tell their opinions and then you lose debate and you lose and then you lose perspective because you don't hear the other side of it. So, you think there is no other side and anybody who believes that might be an idiot like >> give an example on this debate which changed my mind a bit. a very very good Oxford economist called Paul Collier wrote this economically balanced assessment of general migration and made some you know pointed out that on both sides of what you might call the balance sheet it was immeasurably more complicated for example if Nigeria trains doctors who then immediately hoof it to the United States how how is that possibly a good thing overall in that a poor country trains doctors who move to a rich country which arguably has enough doctors from a country which doesn't have enough. That's not you know you have to >> depends on how you frame it right because another way to look at that and I'm not arguing for this by any stretch is that they come here they make a lot of money and they send that money home to their families. >> I agree all Collier said is look this is inordinately more complicated. >> Yeah. Um it is >> one of the things he said is the right for example of recent immigrants to family reunification is a bit dubious because you're giving someone a right which the native population do not have. So I can't pick five Canadians and get them British citizenship. You see >> I I've yet to meet somebody who totally disagrees with all immigration. It's a matter of what reasonable immigration looks like >> and also assimilation. It should be decided by someone other than human rights lawyers. Oh yeah, definitely. rights lawyers. Oh yeah, definitely. >> I would probably agree because you know fundamentally as a as a branch of the law that is not a partial >> entity because human rights lawyers it isn't you you know that great phrase of is it Sinclair Lewis or someone which is uh it is difficult to get someone to disbelieve something when their salary is dependent on believing it. And just as management consultants have a huge incentive to sell in digital transformation programs to their clients and therefore we have a culture in business which more or less doesn't assumes that any money spent on tech is money well spent. They don't look at the opportunity cost. Should we have a opportunity cost. Should we have a better call sector? Buffett and Mer had a good way to sum this up which is never ask your barber if you need haircut. Yeah. And it's the same thing a human rights lawyer. It is in their interests rights lawyer. It is in their interests for human rights to capture a greater and greater part of public discourse at the expense of democratic bodies. And consequently, it's, you know, you're not really in the you're not really in the dispensation of justice. You're in the amplification of grievance business. It's very different. >> I want to switch gears a little bit. My kids had a question for you. >> Oh, good. Okay. Go on. A few years ago, we were in Italy on vacation and we walked into a Louis Vuitton store and they saw a purse and they were asking me what makes somebody spend I think it was I don't know 20 or 30,000 euros on a purse and I had gave them an answer but they wanted me to ask you some of those things by the way weirdly you can resell them for more than the purchase price because in some cases the Kelly bag for example they won't sell it to you until you've been a fairly reliable customer of theirs for some time and therefore the price on eBay is higher than the price they charge in the store. Um uh so so by the way it's not it it's not in it's complicated but they're vellin goods effectively a large proportion of goods depend for their value on being perceived to be expensive. >> So what goes into that though because they were we're all we're all guilty of it to a degree. No, but they were talking about the store and the service and the lighting. >> My wife just came back from, you know, somewhere where there was quite a nice night dress in Harrods, I think it was in London, which was £1,800. >> Okay. >> Now, you have to remember that there are quite a lot of goods where the purpose of the good emotionally is to say, well, let's take the endline. I often think there's a lot of hidden truth in advertising endlines. The L'Oreal advertising endlines. The L'Oreal endline because I'm worth it. Some part of that is the person advertising to themsself. So, you know, when you drive around in your brand new blinged up Tesla, albeit slightly keyed, okay, you're not actually doing it to pick up chicks, I imagine. I mean, maybe I have no idea what you do in your private time. Okay, but if you let's say private time. Okay, but if you let's say you bought a bright red sports car, yes, one purpose of it in a in a particular group would probably be, you know, I visibly have resources to spare. But quite a large part of this stuff is actually signaling to ourselves, which is, you know, uh because I'm worth it. I deserve this. I'm the kind of it. I deserve this. I'm the kind of person who drives this. Uh it provides me with a kind of ego boost, a sense of reassurance, whatever it may be. And so consequently, if you think about part of the reason why bags became very expensive is that very high-end clothing can only be worn in quite specific situations. Mhm. situations. Mhm. >> On the other hand, a bag like a man's watch can be worn every day. So, one of the reasons why those things are expensive is to use a very interesting measure, cost per entertainment hour. I wear a Casio G-Shock. I think it was 130 quid because I' actually decided as a gross rationalist that the best watch is one that's cheap enough to wear in the shower so you don't have to take the thing off every day. But Paul Dolan, Professor Paul Dolan, who's the behavioral scientist at London School of Economics, I met him when I first met him. I said, "I'm intrigued because you've worked with Daniel Carnean on happiness and I noticed you wear a Rolex." >> Mhm. And he said, "No, no." He said, "It's extremely good value for money because it makes me feel good every single day when I put it on and in 20 years time I'll give it to my son." 21 years time, I don't know how old his son was, I'll pass it on to my son who can enjoy exactly the same thing. So, as a repository of meaning. >> Oh, interesting. >> Now, cost per entertainment hour is quite interesting because it was used to explain the fact that relatively poor young people will spend 90 $100 on a computer game, which seems like a lot of money until you realize that they might play that game for >> Oh, yeah. >> 80 90 100 hours. >> Yeah. >> Or more. >> Super cheap. >> So, it's super cheap. I mean, compared to going to the cinema where it's $10 per entertainment hour, more if you buy popcorn. So, it's quite an interesting popcorn. So, it's quite an interesting metric. I mean, one of the things that metric. I mean, one of the things that used to make me really annoyed in Britain was when people, rich people got really snarky about poor people having large televisions. And I said, "Look, large televisions. And I said, "Look, you if you haven't got much money, TV is a source of long-term entertainment is spectacularly cheap." Okay? So having a spectacularly cheap." Okay? So having a really good television on which to enjoy it because you're not going to go Porsche racing at the weekend, you know, you're not you're not going to be there, you know, effectively going to Glindborn or popping up to the bloody, you know, Metropolitan Opera. Therefore, having a Metropolitan Opera. Therefore, having a really large television is a perfectly rational decision. >> Go deeper on this truth and endline signaling to ourselves when we purchase something. Jeffrey Miller is something. Jeffrey Miller is fundamentally right that a lot of what we're doing is to advertise ourselves to other people and the mating mind and spent two books I think you really should read because they're extremely good that a lot of a third book by my compatriate will store the status game which you must know you read it fantastic I've heard of it >> and I have to admit I'm going to the only caveat I give to reading these books a bit like reading uh the selfish gene is when you read them, you are at, you know, if you're someone of any kind of sensitivity, you are at risk of experiencing depressive episodes after reading them because not because they're not true, but because they are. And you go, God, am, you know, am I really that shallow? You know, I do things because I shallow? You know, I do things because I they feel good. I explain why I do them, but deep down the evolutionary and emotional reason I'm doing these things is really to show off or to establish, you know, some sort of oneupmanship or status. It's kind of complicated. Do I status. It's kind of complicated. Do I buy one piece of conspicuous consumption as is argued by various people like Lord Leard in the UK? Do I make my neighbors less happy if I buy a newer, better car? because what I've done is I've changed their comparative frame and therefore my pleasure comes at the expense of theirs. >> Now, that's not I don't think that's totally simple. I think if you were a totally simple. I think if you were a real car obsessive and your next door neighbor bought a Ferrari, you'd actually be delighted because you could go out and talk about torque vectoring and an adaptive air suspension or whatever it may be, okay? or the, you know, the normally aspirated V12 and you'd probably be made happier by that purchase. So, I don't think I don't purchase. So, I don't think I don't think it's absolutely simple. I think Jay Leno and Jay Leno's garage makes him one of the world's great philanthropists because he goes and spends a fortune on extremely rare cars and then shares his passion with an audience of millions. If you are a car enthusiast, you know, it's an extraordinary case, by the way, of translating money into something which is both a selfish pleasure and a generous pleasure. It's complicated. But when you read these books and you you realize that status is effectively a kind of thing within us which we can't turn off. >> The currencies will change. The status currencies change with fashion and time and everything else. Um, you know, there was a time where having a digital watch was the, you know, the the highest status thing. In my school, if you were status thing. In my school, if you were the first kid with an LED digital watch, people were in awe of you. So, these things change, but nonetheless, it's probably innate. Would it be nice if we probably innate. Would it be nice if we had the power to completely disregard the opinions of others? Well, yes and no. I mean, I think such a society might no. I mean, I think such a society might be better in some respects. I also think it would be kind of atrocious because people would kind of go shopping naked. You know, is shame necessary? It was book by Jennifer Jackwood actually, you know. I mean, as a social species, know. I mean, as a social species, patently at some level, we're massively calibrated to care about the, you know, the repute of others. And that's why some things need to be expensive because then it's a costly signal. It's peacock's tail. It's a so the guy who rescued the British sparkling wine industry effectively did so by improving quality by 10% 20% and then putting up price by about 150%. >> Cuz price is the same >> because in the sparkling in the champagne business it doesn't matter how good the drink is if people think you've bought it for $8.95 it's not doing the job it's supposed to do which is to signal generosity to signal hospitality or to mark a special occasion you know. Oh, I see you've taken out the good stuff because it's my birthday. And that's pot I mean, you're a Canadian, right? Pot latch was, I think, a right? Pot latch was, I think, a practice by the the tribes of the Pacific Northwest. Was that right? Where Pacific Northwest. Was that right? Where they destroyed possessions. >> You know more of a Canadian history than I do. >> I I think I think it was tribes in the Northwest who practiced this pot latch thing where you destroyed things of value as kind of uh you know, a signaling mechanism. >> That that is like ultimate signal. It's like the rappers burning money on videos or something. >> Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Signaling things that they're probably not intending to signal. >> There is a serious question here, which is can we take a an innate and immutable human instinct and harness it for good rather than for ill. And Jeffrey Miller's example here is let's imagine two parallel tribes. Bluntly put, in one tribe, the men folk signal their desiraability as mates uh by uh fighting each other with axes. >> That's a negative sum game. In the neighboring tribe, they signal their desiraability of mates by going hunting and trying to bring home meat which they then share with the rest of the tribe. That's a positive sum game. So there is this really complicated question which is undoubtedly human pursuit of status has both positive and negative externalities depending on the currency you choose to signal and also it's not totally it's not totally easy to say whether it's negative or positive. I mean, >> it probably drives a lot of human behavior which drives ambition, which drives progress, which drives >> I mean, if we genuinely didn't care, okay, if we had no shame, uh, you're absolutely right. I mean, no one, you absolutely right. I mean, no one, you know, I'm sure, by the way, I think also a lot of valuable goods are affordable now by everybody because they started as luxury goods. >> Yes. >> So, I always mention this because it's such a silly boast. My grandparents were the fourth family in Wales to own a dishwasher and it cost about hundred and something pounds at a time when their house which was a very nice house cost them £4,000. >> That dishwasher probably works better than a modern one too by the way. >> It's still working. They bought it in 195961 something like that. >> Why are they 4hour cycles now? >> And it's like yeah ready Tuesday week. Come on. You know >> I have one of these It's interesting just as a funny aside. I have one of these dryers from the 80s in my house. >> It came with the house and the >> It dries the clothes in the back. >> The repair man is like, "It's going to be just as expensive to fix this as it would be to buy a new one. I'll just assume." I was like, "No, no, fix this one." And he's like, "Why?" I was like, one." And he's like, "Why?" I was like, "Tries the clothes in 30 minutes." >> I'm going to make an unusual foray into environmental responsibility here. Uh folks, everybody listening, do if if there's a do simple thing you can do, two things. put on your appliances at two things. put on your appliances at times when there is an abundance of clean electricity. You don't have to clean electricity. You don't have to change what you do. You just have to change when you do it. Secondly, if you've got a dryer that doesn't have a heat pump, get a dryer with a heat pump. >> Yeah. >> Because Yep. It's slow. I'm going to acknowledge that. It's not as fast as an acknowledge that. It's not as fast as an oldfashioned dryer. However, the energy oldfashioned dryer. However, the energy efficiency of a dryer with a heat pump. Or better still, Americans, if you live in Arizona, dry your clothes outside. Because this is something that's slightly beusing because in Britain we didn't have the social stigma of hanging clothes up to dry to the same extent. Now we do now. Nobody would hold hang clothes up. But that's just a social clothes up. But that's just a social stigma. Now in Britain, fairness, we got stigma. Now in Britain, fairness, we got a fairly climate. You're Canadian. Okay. There plenty of times of the year where your underpants can be hanging there for three months and they wouldn't not they might freeze but they wouldn't noticeably dry. But I do find it noticeably dry. But I do find it slightly weird in the US where if you're somewhere like Arizona, you could literally hang them up for I I was in Fa Ventura in an island in the Canaries. And well, the amusing thing was you literally they had a washing machine but no dryer. You put it up on the line no dryer. You put it up on the line about 40 minutes later it was ready to wear. >> So how would you market that to people? How would you change the >> change the behavior so that it's not necessary? Now I understand that people necessary? Now I understand that people don't want to put their underpants, you know, private things. I suspect that a lot of it is those weird housing associations already have rules that say you can't do it and then bit by bit the social norm spreads. >> Those American housing associations basically like living in a Nazi regime, isn't it? As far as I can see, you know, isn't it? As far as I can see, you know, it's like those co-op apartments in New York which are you I mean in London we never tolerate that degree of kind of uh intrusion before we're allowed to move into a property. The interesting thing about the co-op apartments in particular, from what I understand, I don't understand everything, so I may be speaking a bit about something I don't know, is the degree to which all people play it. >> Yes. >> Whether you're uh sort of like a student just graduating or you're a billionaire, you're all sort of like playing this this game uh in the co-op housing. But >> no, no, it is completely a game. And apparently they can demand information which the IRS can't demand. I mean, it is, you know, it is absolutely bizarre. you have a co-op board which will uh you know in occasion kick people out as well. But what probably happens is that well. But what probably happens is that once this is very similar by the way with the necessity of children playing outside which is once the behavior drops below a certain threshold you have an inflection point. Mhm. >> So my my parents couldn't believe this when I when I was 20 25 and I told them that when I was 11 I used to cycle 11 miles to the nearest town to see my grandmother on my own at the age of 11 and then when I told them which they did know I used to at the age of sort of 11 climb up onto the apex of the roof and just wander around on the roof 30t up. >> Yes. >> My parents were a gasast that they'd ever allowed it to happen. But if most people did that >> at the time it was normal. >> It was completely normal. Yeah, >> you'll be locked up today. My parents would have been locked up for sever, you know, several of the things which I was allowed to do uh when I was young. Now, what happens, I think, is that you reach a a threshold or a tipping point where in my childhood, let's say someone had abducted me or I'd been hit by a car, okay? And I'll I'll give the exact year okay? And I'll I'll give the exact year 1974,75,76, that kind of era. If I'd been hit by a car cycling to Mammoth or I'd been abducted by a pedophile, uh, okay, my parents would have been described as unlucky. >> You get past a threshold where that behavior becomes weird and now my parents will be held as irresponsible and would be blamed. >> Yeah, >> I don't think it occurred to them. I was, funnily enough, hit by a car. It was my fault, be honest. I failed to signal before maneuvering. I was hit by a car. Nobody suggested it was my a car. Nobody suggested it was my parents fault for allowing me to cycle around the place. that was just a normal thing you did and then you get these weird I've got a few theories um for example what are the things that are products of social norms where you can suddenly hit a threshold tattoos among the middle class would have been an interesting thing in Britain is this true in Canada as well so perfectly middle-class people now have body art and it's normalized it would have been deeply weird in any middle class millier to see someone with a to uh in the 1970s or 1960s. >> It's just normal. I mean, like everybody >> No, no, no. I know. But I mean, this you you got to be you got to be 59 to notice this stuff. A lot of it happens over this stuff. A lot of it happens over quite a long time. Fresh. >> It's been a slow. >> I've got a theory that all British men would wear shorts all the time if it weren't for social pressure. >> I also think for example, okay, here's an interesting one. I don't know if you're into paranal sunning. Are you? >> What is this? It's a Buddhist practice where you basically expose your paranneeium to direct sunlight. Um I think that a fairly large proportion of the population are naturists to an extent by which I don't mean wandering around the streets with their schlongs out. But I mean that on a beach in a field in sunny weather in you know in some sort of privacy they would like to wander around with no clothes on because it's good for you. It exposes your whole body to sunlight. You get a lot of vitamin D. You know, it's generally healthful. And my argument generally healthful. And my argument about sunbathing is well, you know, evolution made it pretty enjoyable, maybe it's not all bad. And there are some schools of thought in dermatology which made a case that actually weirdly although it in enhances the risk of skin cancer, it improves cardiovascular health. So there was a study actually health. So there was a study actually among Swedes where there was a higher instance of skin cancer among Swedish sunbed addicts but they actually had a higher life expectancy which they didn't expect. >> So quite often you see what we do is we measure the narrow effect of a behavior but not the broader effect. Quite interesting in terms of >> you know how we might get things wrong. By the way, I wouldn't do it on a beach as there were children present and then you know, but if you go to if you go to parts of the of Europe, particularly Germans will just wander around naked. Now, I think at some level if they're no children. Now, in the United States, children. Now, in the United States, that would be perceived in a completely different way. So, quite a lot of these different way. So, quite a lot of these things are arbitrary. They're just in other words, you know, if doing something makes you weird, there is a point at which you reach a threshold, vegetarianism, veganism, etc., where it where it goes from being weird to mainstream. So, it's what I'm saying is mainstream. So, it's what I'm saying is it's not an even process, >> right? >> And sometimes you never get to the threshold. >> I I see what you're saying. I know we're coming up to time here. I want to get to a couple questions. What are the rules of good copy? If I asked you to teach me how to write good copy, how would you do that? I think a large part of it comes that? I think a large part of it comes down to, you know, Michael Pollani and his idea of a tacit skill, which is we know more than we can tell. There are some generally good rules, which is write conversationally, much more conversationally than people think they should write because everybody thinks they have to write a a and actually I'll give you two examples of this. David Oglevie, all his books are incredibly readable because I think he was a copywriter first and an author second. His pro style is very good and he also adopts a clever trick which I've stolen and which uh a few other people is that he writes extremely plainly for the most part but will throw in the odd cescoilian long word just to remind the reader that he you know you're not an idiot. You know it's almost there to idiot. You know it's almost there to flatter the reader as much as it is to flatter the writer. Conan Doyle, I was talking to Rick Rubin about this. He and I both grew up on those Sherlock Holmes short stories which are not only models of thinking and deduction and uh you know and a fantastic lesson for uh mental gymnastics. I think they're also mental gymnastics. I think they're also the Kingsley Amos believed this that he's one of the greatest pros writers in the English language because bear in mind a lot of that stuff's written in 1880. You read a lot of stuff that's 1880. You read a lot of stuff that's written in 1880 does that what's that mean? Oh god, hold on. I'll have to go back to page 27 to work out how who on earth Mr. Homer Angel is or uh Miss Miss Mary missed something sudden, doesn't there, Marlin? At no point in reading a Sherlock Holmes short story have I ever had to go back a page to work out how who somebody is. Yeah. >> In terms of just absolutely brilliant clarity, uh those are astonishing. But in terms of persuasion, uh there are various things. So you use generally verbs of movement. You you use verbs in preference to adjectives and adjectives in preference to adverbs. I think you tend to use Anglo-Saxon words rather than the romance words for the most part without being silly about it. You convert a feature into a benefit. There's also an element where sometimes all you need to do is tell people a fact. Now I don't know any evidence fact. Now I don't know any evidence about this and I'd like to know it and I asked this question which is of the people who are antiaxers during co was there a difference between the people who are basically happy with the idea of a vaccine and the people who weren't partly driven by whether you knew that vaccination dated back to the 18th century and smallox. In other words it was a 250y old medical practice >> or whether you thought it was some weird new fangle thing that you couldn't possibly trust. I don't know. But possibly trust. I don't know. But sometimes, do you ever watch Press Telw Walker on YouTube? You know those mathematical puzzles, geometry puzzles? I really recommend them because weirdly I find myself on YouTube watching people solve mathematical equations for fun, which I never thought I'd do. But Fresh Telw Walker and I can't remember what it's called something like something decision or something. Anyway, um it's great great little YouTube channel. It's not that little. a huge following and sometimes there's a geometry puzzle which looks completely impossible to solve until you just draw one extra line at which point the solution becomes obvious. And so sometimes in marketing obvious. And so sometimes in marketing all you've got to do is tell people a fact. It's not always about persuasion. fact. It's not always about persuasion. It's not always about getting people it's simply putting people in a you know state of knowledge or belief or conviction that this thing can make a difference to their lives. And by the way, you're not you're almost always up against a problem, which is that the two human default modes of do what everybody else does and do what I've done before for obvious reasons. You know, what you've done before and what everybody else always does is not necessarily optimal, but it's much less likely to be catastrophic than trying something new that nobody else ever does. You know, so we're kind of herd species and we're kind of habitual species. So in the marketing of something which is genuinely new you know your the Tesla the the electric car there is a degree of extreme anxiety which you don't encounter when you repeat buy or when you buy the brand leader >> there's like a resistance you have to overcome >> you have to yeah you have to overcome it because just as a camera has a default mode the human default mode is do what I did before do what everybody else does I feel comfortable doing that very very rational default mode there's Nothing silly about that in terms of if you think about it our evolutionary um brain architecture those two things make a lot of sense but um it does mean and something I only realized about a year ago 35 years after I started working in the business is that as a consequence of that big innovative new ideas don't require less marketing they require more because you're asking people to at the initial stages you're asking someone to do something that nobody else has done >> and you're asking them to do something they haven't done before both of which create a kind of disqu and so providing people with conviction and reassurance quite often I suspect by the way in the early stages of a technology that happens one to one that you know it was my brother who's he's an astrophysicist so he knows all the bloody maths about kilowatt hours and stuff so my brother provided me with the reassurance to buy my first electric car I don't think if he hadn't bought an electric car I've now had Three, would I have bought an electric car? No, >> probably not. >> Probably not. >> Yeah. >> Uh, it will be my brother who persuades me to get solar panels or a heat pump or something of that kind. But big ideas don't require the the classic geek idea is our idea is so good it will sell itself. >> A re since your fellow Canadian Stuart Butterfield, isn't it? Who founded um Slack? Yeah. Is that right? Slack? Yeah. Is that right? >> Yeah. Uh he says the only real measure of innovation is behavioral change. that the only real measure of whether an innovation is significant is whether it h it both in first order and second order ways changes the way people behave. Now an interesting question is behave. Now an interesting question is is AI at that point yet? And my second question is the lesson of all tech is that loads and loads of geeks compete through for technological numerical superiority by some measure or other. And then someone else comes along with a cute user interface and makes all the money. It's basically Steve Jobs. money. It's basically Steve Jobs. >> Yeah. >> Nobody's done that yet for AI. Now maybe this weird thing that Johnny Iv is concocting which is some sort of weird pendant which talks to your mobile phone. Maybe that's what it is. phone. Maybe that's what it is. >> There was this thing that sort of relates to that which was Bill Gates had this saying. He's like the best and you this saying. He's like the best and you know I have friends living this now. The best technology doesn't win. >> That's a very engineering point of view because you're judging technology by its um engineering qualities rather than its uh human appeal. >> Oh that's an interesting reframing. >> So uh there are there are people in every field like in the camera world there are people called measure baiters. They're they're denigrated as measure baiters because they're obsessed with the numerical qualities of the camera. >> Yeah. >> You know, you focal lengths and all that stuff and they don't take very good photographs. >> Yes. >> And um saying that the best I mean undoubtedly by the way I mean you know Betamax is the famous example where they failed to capture network effects and in a world where there are network effects. Yeah. By the way, the best technology probably often doesn't win. I think that's probably fair. Everybody was competing to make a slightly faster IBM compatible PC, but they were all gray and beige. Now, nobody in the tech world and beige. Now, nobody in the tech world would go, "The slight problem with this PC isn't the fact that the clock speed or the processing power or the RAM is insufficient. The problem is if I put insufficient. The problem is if I put this device in any room of my house, it turns that room into an office." >> Yeah. If you put an IBM PC, a gray IBM PC in any room in your house, including the you might as well put a photocopier and a bloody filing cabinet in the room, right? Whereas when Jolly IV comes along and has that lickable, the iMac, >> the you can actually put that in any room of the house and it it it actually enhances passion statement. >> It's fantastic. It's, you know, it's an adornment. And so their failure to understand the wider context within which they were operating which is the job of marketing is exactly the reason nerds hate marketing because they think in a perfect world nerd metrics win out. But the consumer is much more bothered by the fact that when you get to the bottom of the iPhone scroll, it gives the little bounce, you know, and we you could, if we're to be absolutely honest, you could ridicule um uh you know, Ives and Jobs over their obsession with uh you know, bezels and chfers and things like that. But of course, multiply that like that. But of course, multiply that by a billion owners using the thing a 100 times a day. Okay, that's a 100red billion encounters and that probably matters a lot more in fact than you know by the way I mean I lost faith in Apple when they canled the car. How interesting. >> Because I thought you they had the brand power to create for places like New York and London a form of microtransport which was really really cool, really really efficient. You know the brand really efficient. You know the brand power you have, you see, you know, if you're Apple or Ford or whatever, people will buy a weird product from you much more readily than they will from Alfa Romeo, >> right? >> Because they go, well, if Ford's doing it, it, you know, it must be okay. So, one of the gifts of having a strong brand is your power to really disrupt and create new categories, you know, new categories of transit, for example, which we need. You know, don't get me wrong, I'm going to, you know, I'm going to off 600 horsepower electric car, but when I go into London, I want a Microlino or an itty bitty little thing because that's appropriate to the task. And my argument is that they could have done something there. They could have used their power to do something and and you know, the finance people killed it really. It was what was it called? project something or other it called? project something or other never remember but but no now they're just changing the shape of things and making the camera a bit better come on guys produce by the way do you want a good tip okay I tend to buy and this will actually apply to electric cars as well always good reason to buy Korean stuff do you know why >> because they're going to do that anyway the Koreans are going to make fantastic tech and fantastic cars regardless of the profit motive do you know why to wind up the Japanese so they've got two motivations Okay. Other people are just trying to make money. Deep down. Do you know do you money. Deep down. Do you know do you know why the largest Episcopalian church in the world is in Soul? >> No. >> Right. This is really fascinating. I'm going to Soul for the first time. I've never been. But the last four presidents of Korea have been variously like Catholic Presbyterian. Now before um before the Japanese invasion, Christianity was a tiny niche missionary religion in Korea. Uh when the Japanese invaded um uh the tiny Christian population refused to acknowledge the divinity of the emperor and some of them were martyed for refusing to effectively uh pay due respect to the divinity of the Japanese emperor and therefore it became the patriotic religion because it was seen as a deeply patriotic entity. So I've got a hunch that you you know deep down you know if you go buy a Hyundai or a Genesis or something like that there's a dual motivation here. Let's make a bit of money and uh but that's that's purely so similarly if you want to look for anthropological reasons to buy um an awful lot of German businesses are driven by sibling rivalry. >> So Puma versus Adidas Aldi North versus Aldi South. There's a whole weird family Aldi South. There's a whole weird family rift in the German car industry which is too complicated for me to understand about Porsche and the family who own Pinchit. There are a whole load of Pinchit. There are a whole load of families which are kind of weird waring families and sometimes the family business has a motivation which actually >> the consumer is the winner. >> But the consumer is the is exactly the winner in in all this. Um but but going back to that family business thing that you know undoubtedly if you can harness other motivations alongside the profit motives most people working for a company unless you've bought them off with massive stock options because they're in the senior management most people don't get up in the morning to enrich the share owners. No, >> you know I don't get up you I don't get up every morning I don't know what a big shareholder is of my company. It's probably like the state of Wisconsin DMV pension fund. Well, for the best wish pension fund. Well, for the best wish will I don't wish them any ill will. Of course, I don't get up in the morning cuz I go, "Oh, I really worry about those DMV people's pensions in Wisconsin." I can worry about customers. Wisconsin." I can worry about customers. I can worry about colleagues. That's a natural human motivation to serve those people. We always end with the same people. We always end with the same question, which is what is success for you? >> Just expanding the adjacent possible. That's a very pretentious article, but push the pebble a bit further. That that's it. I mean, you know, one of the reasons I do a lot of this stickick stuff is because the feedback I got was every now and then someone comes up to me and says, "I made a different decision because of something you said. Someone said to me, I bought my house because of you." I thought they might be about to hit me. We still hear from people about our first podcast every two or three months. Somebody emails me and and says, you know, because of that, oh, I love this. I never heard of this person. looked them up. And one thing I'm really clear on and I we've made this mistake. All creative people have made this mistake which is to go no that rationality is silly. What you need is creativity. No, silly. What you need is creativity. No, no. What you need is two strings to your bow. Okay. This is a complimentary mode bow. Okay. This is a complimentary mode of problem solving. It works best in parallel with some rational or quantitative or datadriven measures. But the quantitative and datadriven measures should not be allowed to crowd it out. And so when I say the reason someone bought a house because of me is I said when you're looking for a house don't optimize because everybody will want that house. Instead find something the house has which most people won't like but you don't care about next to a pub. Now I'm not saying next to a rough pub. I don't want to have fights outside my house. But most people particularly older people would hate the idea of being next to a pub because they crap on about noise and the beer garden and all that stuff. I personally the noise of a pub a stuff. I personally the noise of a pub a good happy pub is music to me. I don't get a sleep before midnight anyway so it's not going to keep me awake. Railway line personally it to me it's a bonus to most people it's negative. Go and look for those things where you can arbitrage >> uh what's possible. That would be my attitude. Now similarly if you've got a attitude. Now similarly if you've got a problem to solve >> don't purely define the problem in psychologyfree terminology. Just as in psychologyfree terminology. Just as in America you have a temperature and you have a feels like temperature which is by the way very very intelligent thing because what makes us feel hot is not just the ambient temperature. It's a combination ambient temperature. It's a combination of temperature, humidity, breeze and I think there's one other factor when they do the feels like temperature there's something like temperature so many feet above the ground that they factor in. Um now when I'm going outside I'm not going to do chemical experiments. I don't need to know what the ambient temperature is. I need to know will I feel hot and in the same way I think there's something really important here which is that do not define an objective which is designed to serve human beings without considering psychological factors because you might be able to solve your problem very very cheaply and efficiently by changing the psychology not by changing the technology >> and provided people are looking at both with a reasonable amount of imagination I'm not I'm not angry with a well bit. I'm I'm only angry with accountants and lawyers and economists, not because they do what they do, but because they have too much power doing it and they've achieved a kind of monopoly over decision-m which I don't think they have a reasonable claim to. >> That's a brilliant place to end this. >> It is not a bad place to end though. Fantastic. >> Thank you very much. We're not going to wait nine years before nine years before we get back together. How often are you in London? >> Uh once or twice a year. Mhm. >> Yeah. >> Oh, we must meet up then. That would be fantastic. >> Definitely. Loading video analysis...

Title: Gaskin: End of DOGE marks missed AI opportunity
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/12/14/gaskin-end-of-doge-marks-missed-ai-opportunity/
Time Published: 2025-12-14T08:02:31Z
Full Content:
In late November, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) quietly disbanded months ahead of schedule, with senior officials confirming that the agency “no longer exists” in any centralized form. Its end marks not only the collapse of a widely publicized initiative but one of the greatest missed opportunities of the Trump administration. At a moment when artificial intelligence was transforming nearly every major industry, the federal government had a rare chance to reinvent itself. Instead, it stepped backward. When DOGE launched in January 2025, President Donald Trump appointed Elon Musk — a global technology figure — as the program’s celebrity face. With its rhetoric of trillion-dollar savings and sweeping modernization, DOGE could have become the most ambitious public-sector innovation project in American history. Yet instead of using Musk’s technological expertise — and especially artificial intelligence — to modernize federal operations, streamline public services, and build a new digital foundation for government, DOGE quickly devolved into old-school mass layoffs and headline-friendly cuts. Estimates from McKinsey, Goldman Sachs, and the OECD suggest that 40% to 60% of all jobs could be reshaped by AI, but the administration traded a once-in-a-generation modernization opportunity for a chainsaw. DOGE’s most dramatic action was the firing of an estimated 280,000 federal employees in a matter of months. This created the impression of sudden efficiency, but it reflected a deeper strategic failure: DOGE chose subtraction over transformation. Programs that were ripe for AI augmentation — veterans’ claims processing, Social Security workflows, IRS casework, public-health analytics, fraud detection, and regulatory review — were not redesigned or modernized. They were simply downsized, often in ways that made the remaining work slower, more expensive, and less secure. Agencies were forced to rehire many of the same workers as contractors. Anti-fraud programs that recovered more money than they cost were shut down entirely. And when DOGE abruptly ended FDA and EPA user-fee programs, Congress had to pass emergency appropriations to keep essential operations running. The most significant loss, however, was not financial — it was the opportunity to use AI to rebuild government for the next generation. Rather than accelerating federal performance, DOGE slowed it down as agencies confronted aging systems, soaring service demands, and rapidly escalating cybersecurity threats. Entire cybersecurity teams were dismantled just as AI-powered attacks were multiplying worldwide. Public disputes between Musk and senior officials — often amplified across social media — further undermined morale and trust. The disruption was damaging, but the deeper tragedy was the transformation that never even began. This failure is especially stark when contrasted with an earlier and far more successful modernization effort. From 1993 to 2000, Vice President Al Gore led the National Partnership for Reinventing Government (NPR), the largest and most effective government reform initiative of the modern era. NPR delivered verified, inflation-adjusted savings of roughly $300 billion, but its true success lay in how those savings were achieved. Gore’s approach was methodical rather than theatrical. NPR modernized processes, digitized operations, reduced administrative layers, strengthened customer service, and embedded reforms through bipartisan legislation such as the Government Performance and Results Act. Workforce changes were handled through attrition, early retirements, and voluntary buyouts — not mass firings — allowing reforms to be stable, sustainable, and non-polarizing. NPR built capacity. DOGE dismantled it. DOGE could have used its mandate to invite the world’s leading AI organizations — OpenAI, DeepMind, Anthropic, Meta AI, Google Research, Microsoft AI, Amazon AWS AI, Apple AI, xAI, Mistral, Nvidia, and Cohere — to compete to solve the government’s hardest operational challenges. Such a competition could have produced multilingual digital assistants for the American public, AI copilots for federal workers, advanced fraud-detection engines capable of saving billions, AI-accelerated code modernization tools, stronger cybersecurity, and dramatically reduced backlogs across veterans’ services, Social Security, and tax processing. These tools could have been interoperable, reusable, and transferable across both the public and private sectors. DOGE could have launched the first AI-powered reinvention of the federal government — and instead, it chose elimination over innovation. By the time DOGE dissolved, the opportunity was gone. The United States was left with a federal workforce that was not more modern, not more efficient, and in critical areas, significantly weaker. The death of DOGE is not fundamentally about missed cost savings. It is the story of a historic opportunity squandered. Modernizing government does not require chainsaws, celebrity feuds, or ideological crusades. It requires vision, collaboration, technological expertise, and respect for the institutional knowledge necessary to implement change responsibly. Above all, it requires a commitment to building. Had DOGE embraced an AI-first strategy, the United States might today be leading the world in digital governance, offering faster services, safer systems, and more transparent operations. Instead, DOGE stands as a cautionary tale — a reminder that spectacular claims are no substitute for serious reform. As policymakers consider the next chapter of government modernization, they would do well to study Al Gore’s quiet, durable NPR — and imagine what might be possible if today’s most advanced AI labs were finally invited to help build the future of American government.

December 13, 2025 23:19 ET | Source: Rocket Lab Corporation Rocket Lab Corporation Long Beach, CA Long Beach, CA MAHIA, New Zealand, Dec. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today successfully launched its first dedicated mission for the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) – a pivotal marker of Electron’s global importance for regular, reliable, and dedicated access to space. The “RAISE And Shine” mission lifted off from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand on December 14, 2025 at 03:09 UTC / 16:09 NZDT to successfully deploy the agency’s RApid Innovative payload demonstration SatellitE-4 (RAISE-4) spacecraft: a demonstration of eight technologies developed by private companies, universities, and research institutions throughout Japan. The mission was the first of two dedicated missions for JAXA’s Innovative Satellite Technology Demonstration Program, an initiative by the agency to demonstrate new and innovative capabilities and technologies developed by Japan’s space economy. Rocket Lab’s successful launch for JAXA reflects the growing integration of commercial companies into national space programs both domestically and internationally. As the established small launch leader in the United States, Electron is also the preferred choice for reliable small launch globally, with its second upcoming mission for JAXA scheduled for launch in Q1 2026. A dedicated Electron launch for the European Space Agency (ESA) is also planned for launch in the new year, further highlighting Electron’s international demand. Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, said: “This dedicated mission delivered precision and reliability for one of the world’s most respected space agencies, and we couldn’t be prouder of supporting JAXA with the dedicated access to space needed to support the growth of Japan’s aerospace economy. We’re proud to continue delivering the responsiveness and performance that Japan’s satellite operators have come to rely on.” “RAISE And Shine” was Rocket Lab’s 19th launch of the year: an extension of the Company’s new Electron annual launch record established just last month with two back-to-back missions launched in 48 hours. Rocket Lab’s next launch of 2025 is scheduled to take place from Launch Complex 2 this month and will be announced in the coming days. “RAISE And Shine” launch images: Flight 77 | RAISE & Shine | Flickr “RAISE And Shine” launch webcast: Rocket Lab - 'RAISE and Shine' Launch for JAXA - YouTube Rocket Lab Media Contact Murielle Bakermedia@rocketlabusa.com About Rocket LabAbout Rocket Lab Rocket Lab is a leading space company that provides launch services, spacecraft, payloads and satellite components serving commercial, government, and national security markets.
