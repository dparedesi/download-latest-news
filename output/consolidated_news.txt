I’ve been banging on about the lack of proper French restaurants in Dublin for years. Loudly. And, until recently, to absolutely no avail. If dining trends are cyclical, the 2015 closure of Racine in London – where I once dined on Henry Harris’s famed tête de veau with sauce ravigote, minus the calf’s brain (something to do with supply, I was told, though it didn’t stop the obvious jokes) – marked the end of bourgeois cooking and the dominance of new Nordic cuisine and its small plates. Now, London has gone full bouchon (Lyonnaise style restaurant). Harris is back, rattling pans at Bouchon Racine (good luck getting a booking), and bouchon-inspired spots are springing up faster than champignons after a downpour: Josephine Bouchon, Henri, Café Francois, Marceline – proof, if it were needed, that the Gallic revival is in full swing. And Dublin? Rien du tout. Until now. John and Sandy Wyer got wind that the space above O’Brien’s pub, conveniently next door to their fine dining spot, Forest Avenue, on Sussex Terrace, had become available. Formerly The Sussex, the room came pre-loaded with bistro charm: Victorian flourishes, casual wooden tables, and banquettes you can sink into. A few tweaks later, et voilà – a proper bistro, at last. They’ve named it Forêt, staying true to their woodland theme (see also: Little Forest in Blackrock). The menu is a celebration of French cooking at its most confident. Petites Assiettes (snacks) include house-made saucisson, leek vinaigrette, Bayonne ham and oysters mignonette (€3 each), a bright and briny opener. From the tempting Les Entrées, comes the terrine de campagne (€16). This rustic staple, straight from the bouchon playbook, is robust, slightly coarse, and made with Oxford Sandy and Black suckling pig from Dermot Allen’s Winetavern Farm in Wicklow. It’s crowned with an amber gelée, lightly laced with sherry (if I’m not mistaken), delivering a rich, savoury depth when spread onto the toasted sourdough. The violet mustard on the side is sharp enough to jolt you awake, while the cornichons add just the right tangy crunch to balance the richness. For our other starter, a salad of green beans (€12) mingles with rocket, lettuce, hazelnuts and potato in a velvety dressing that pools on the plate, topped with grated mimolette, the nutty Edam-style cheese from Lille. It’s simple but beautifully executed. [ Ballyfin restaurant review: ‘Downright dazzling, one of the most delicious things I’ve eaten this year’Opens in new window ] The French wine list is a salute to tradition, carefully chosen without falling into populist clichés and favouring low volume producers. There are eight wines by the glass (which are also available as half bottles), and the Forest Avenue house wine, a very good Burgundian Chardonnay (€48), carries us happily through the meal. The fish, halibut Grenobloise with artichoke purée (€28), is stunning. The skin is gloriously crisp, and the pearlescent flakes of fish are so perfectly cooked they practically glow. Capers and chives bring a bright, salty punch, while pickled celery adds crunch and a vinegary bite. A creamy, lemon-spiked sauce ties everything together, while the artichoke purée sits quietly on the side, offering an earthy counterpoint to the fish, fondant potato and sauce. It’s the dish of the evening, without question. Across the table, my daughter Belle has the chicken au vin jaune (€26) which is also very tasty. The bronzed, crackling skin hides succulent free-range breast meat, while the sauce – enriched with Jura’s famed Savagnin wine, aged under flor for six years – delivers nutty, rounded depth. It’s paired with kale, finely chopped morel mushrooms, and riz à la paysanne: buttery rice laced with tarragon and dotted with tender nuggets of chicken. Desserts walk the line between indulgence and restraint. The crème brûlée is tempting, but there’s only room to share, so croissant pudding (€8) it is. Croissants from the Wyers’ Una Bakery are transformed into a luxurious bread-and-butter pudding: crispy on top, custardy in the middle, and swimming in Cointreau caramel and custard. The vanilla ice-cream, with an intriguing touch of buckwheat, is bold yet balanced. [ Parrilla restaurant review: With happy diners and cocktail shaker at full throttle, Tuesday is the new Friday at this new Mexican spotOpens in new window ] Forêt is a masterclass in why the classics endure. Why butter, cream and meticulously sourced produce remain the holy trinity of good taste – and why a perfect croissant is never just a croissant. It’s a love letter to the French bistro, where every dish is cooked with precision, seasoned with authority, and served with an unwavering respect for tradition. The attention to detail goes beyond the plate, from the well-considered wine list to the understated ambiance, making it more than just a meal. It’s an experience. And with prices so thoughtfully pitched, it’s poised to become a firm favourite. Dinner for two with a bottle of wine and water was €148. The Verdict: It’s Lyonnaise bouchon in spirit and pure joy on the plate. Food provenance: Glenmar, Kingsbury Wagyu, Winetavern Farm, McNally Farm, and Castleruddery Farm. Vegetarian options: Leek vinaigrette, egg mayonnaise with celeriac rémoulade, onion velouté, green bean salad and vegetarian pithivier for main course. Wheelchair access: No accessible room or toilet. Music: French classics, from Georges Brassen to Gillian Hills.

Title: Bitcoin Prices Reach $95,000 For The First Time In History

Bitcoin broke through $95,000 this evening. (Photo illustration by Chesnot/Getty Images) Bitcoin prices attained their latest all-time high this evening when they climbed to $95,000 for the first time ever. The world’s most prominent digital currency, which has been enjoying some very compelling upside in recent weeks, rose to $95,000.20, according to Coinbase data from TradingView. The cryptocurrency has notched a series of fresh records recently as it benefits from very strong momentum and a wide range of bullish factors. Several analysts commented on the digital asset’s strength as of late, as well as developments that have helped fuel its aggressive gains. “It seems that almost every day Bitcoin makes a new all time high!” the TikTok influencer who goes by Wendy O said via emailed comments. “There are rumors circulating that Bitcoins latest push could be due to 1) Bitcoin ETFs recording over $1 billion inflows in 48 hours with ARKS ARKB leading the way with $267.3 million in inflows and 2)BlackRock Bitcoin ETF options launching with $1.9 Billion dollars traded on it’s first day!” she stated in reference to today’s upward movement. The market observer emphasized the strong inflows enjoyed by bitcoin exchange-traded funds and the significant interest in options contracts based on BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, which trades under the ticker symbol IBIT. Interestingly enough, the total bitcoin held by U.S. bitcoin ETFs recently surpassed 1 million units, according to figures that CryptoQuant analyst Julio Moreno supplied via Telegram chat. The chart below illustrates this milestone: U.S. bitcoin ETFs' total bitcoin holdings recently passed 1 million units. One analyst emphasized how intense demand for bitcoin is right now as the digital currency benefits from a very compelling combination of bullish factors. “Bitcoin’s climb to $95,000 feels like humanity finally boarding a lifeboat while the legacy financial system’s Titanic takes on water,” Cory Klippsten, CEO of Swan Bitcoin, said via emailed comments. “Persistent inflation, fiat instability, and a lack of trust in central banks are driving both individuals and institutions toward Bitcoin as the ultimate store of value,” he added. “Today’s surge likely stems from a perfect storm: rising demand, a supply crunch, and unwavering conviction from long-term holders.” One market observer spoke to just how bright bitcoin’s future seems to be. George Kailas, CEO of Prospero.ai, spoke to the digital currency’s current situation, emphasizing that “Typically you have at least some reasonable Bull and Bear case on anything.” “For example we have followed COIN through BTC to profit heavily off the ‘Trump trade’ the other stock we targeted before the election was Tesla,” he noted. “We said it would move around full self driving and sure enough it did around positive news this week. But you see things like this questioning the viability of FSD.” “There is some Bear case that is being made,” stressed Kailas. “I don't see a Bear case over the next 4 years right now for BTC so that is invariably going to create an environment where more and more major players jump on that bandwagon because it is glaring them in the face.” Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether, EOS and SOL.

Title: Bitcoin breaks $95,000 for first time on optimism over Trump crypto plans

By Tom Westbrook, Samuel Indyk and Suzanne McGee SINGAPORE/LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) -Bitcoin came within a whisker of closing above $100,000 for the first time on Thursday as the election of Republican Donald Trump as U.S. president spurred expectations that his administration will create a friendly regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies. The world's largest cryptocurrency was trading between $98,000 and $99,000 in late afternoon trading in the U.S. on Thursday, after briefly touching $99,073. Bitcoin has more than doubled in value this year and is up about 40% in the two weeks since Trump was voted in as the next U.S. president and a slew of pro-crypto lawmakers were elected to Congress. Trump embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the "crypto capital of the planet" and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin. Crypto investors see an end to increased scrutiny under U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, whom Trump has said he will replace. Trump also unveiled a new crypto business, World Liberty Financial, in September. Although details about the business have been scarce, investors have taken his personal interest in the sector as a bullish signal. Billionaire Elon Musk, a major Trump ally, is also a proponent of cryptocurrencies. Over 16 years after its creation, bitcoin appears on the cusp of mainstream acceptance. "Everyone who’s bought bitcoin at any point in history is currently in profit," Alicia Kao, managing director of crypto exchange KuCoin, said. "But those who bought it early, when there were significant obstacles to doing so and there was the might of the world’s financial and governmental forces intent on crushing it, are the real winners. Not because they’re rich, but because they’re right.” Bitcoin's rebound from a slide below $16,000 in late 2022 has been rapid, boosted by the approval of U.S.-listed bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January this year. The Securities and Exchange Commission had long attempted to block ETFs from investing in bitcoin, citing investor protection concerns, but the products have allowed more investors, including institutional investors, to gain exposure to bitcoin. CRYPTO RUSH More than $4 billion has streamed into U.S.-listed bitcoin exchange-traded funds since the election. This week, there was a strong debut for options on BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s ETF, with call options - bets on the price going up - more popular than puts. "There is a persistent bid in the market," said Joe McCann, CEO and founder of Asymmetric, a digital assets hedge fund in Miami. "$100,000 is a foregone conclusion." Crypto-related stocks have soared along with the bitcoin price and shares in bitcoin miner MARA Holdings were up nearly 2.3% on Thursday. “Once you break out to new highs, you attract a lot of new capital," John LaForge, head of real asset strategy at Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute, said. "It's like gold in the 1970s, where this new high is in a price discovery mode. You don't know how high it's going to go," he said. Yet the rise is not without critics. Two years ago, the industry was wracked by scandal with the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange and the jailing of its founder Sam Bankman-Fried. The cryptocurrency industry also has been criticized for its energy usage, with miners under scrutiny over their potential impact on power grids and greenhouse gas emissions due to their energy-intensive operations. Crypto crime also remains a concern, with an analysis by crypto researchers Chainalysis finding that at least $24.2 billion worth of crypto was sent to illicit wallet addresses last year, including addresses identified as sanctioned or linked to terrorist financing and scams.

Title: Snowflake’s shares surge higher on blowout earnings, a promising acquisition and new AI partnership
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2024/11/20/snowflakes-shares-surge-higher-blowout-earnings-promising-acquisition-new-ai-partnership/
Time Published: 2024-11-21T01:17:32Z

UPDATED 20:17 EST / NOVEMBER 20 2024 by Mike Wheatley Shares of the cloud data warehouse company Snowflake Inc. jumped more than 30% in trading Thursday, with the bullish sentiment driven by a crushing earnings and revenue beat and increased guidance for the fiscal year. The company also announced a key partnership with the artificial intelligence firm Anthropic PBC and said it’s going to acquire the data integration startup Datavolo Inc., further boosting investor optimism. Snowflake reported third-quarter earnings before certain costs such as stock compensation of 20 cents per share in the quarter, easily beating Wall Street’s consensus estimate of 15 cents. Revenue for the period rose 28% from a year ago, to $942 million, cruising past the Street’s target of $897 million. However, the strong numbers didn’t prevent Snowflake’s loss from widening. It reported a net loss of $324.3 million in the quarter, up from a loss of $214.3 million one year earlier. The company said product revenue accounted for 96% of its total sales. The company uses product revenue as its main guidance indicator, and it said it sees a total of $3.43 billion in fiscal 2025, which would imply growth of 29%. That’s up quite a bit from its previous product revenue forecast of $3.36 billion, issued three months ago. In addition, Snowflake said it’s now anticipating an adjusted operating margin of 5%, up from 3% earlier. In a conference call with analysts, Snowflake Chief Executive Sridhar Ramaswamy (pictured) said the company intends to focus now on saving money with a view to increasing its profitability in the quarters ahead. “We’ve been creating centralized, more efficient teams for some areas and removing redundant management layers, which enables us to make decisions faster,” Ramaswamy said. However, the company’s chief financial officer Mike Scarpelli butted in to say that the company is not planning any layoffs in the foreseeable future, despite that reorganization. The company reported 10,618 paying customers at the end of October, up 369 from three months ago and above the Street’s target of 10,601 customers. One of those customers is the U.S. government, which generates only a very small fraction of its revenue at present. But Scarpelli told analysts that he sees significant room for growth. “We feel good about what we’re doing, and we think there’s a lot of upside in the federal space over the next couple of years,” he said. No doubt part of that potential stems from Snowflake’s recent acquisition of a company called Night Shift Development Inc., a data analytics startup focused on the U.S. public sector. That acquisition was announced in September, when Snowflake said it will complement its ongoing investment in enabling more informed decision-making across government agencies. Snowflake’s cloud data warehouse offerings have become more relevant to enterprises thanks to the ongoing shift from traditional on-premises servers to the cloud. In recent months they have been further boosted by the growing demand for data to power artificial intelligence workloads. For years, the company has been viewed as a rival to public cloud computing providers like Amazon Web Services Inc. and Microsoft Corp., but at the same time, those companies are also key partners, providing it with its underlying infrastructure. Ramaswamy indicated that those partnerships are now taking on even more significance. “Through our collaboration with AWS, we have booked over $3.9 billion over the past four quarters,” he told analysts on the call. Third Bridge analyst Jordan Berger said the company’s strong revenue growth signals a return of strength and a subsidence of cost optimization headwinds that had held it back in recent quarters. “As an additional positive indication, after a period of sequential deceleration, its net revenue retention remained stable quarter-over-quarter at 127%,” the analyst said. Holger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc. praised Snowflake for its strong revenue growth, driven by enterprise’s hunger for data-driven insights, but said investors may be worried at its worsening profitability. “Snowflake’s growth is coming at an increased cost, with the company loosing $1 for every $3 it grabs in revenue,” the analyst pointed out. “On the plus side, its research and development costs have overtaken sales and marketing expenses, which suggests the company is accelerating innovation for AI-powered analytics and insights. But in the long run, investors will want to see Ramaswamy and his team find a way to put costs and revenue growth in sync, so they can work on boosting that bottom line.” The acquisition of Datavolo also looks to be an important move. Snowflake didn’t reveal how much it paid to acquire the startup, which had raised $25 million in funding and sells tools for building multimodal data pipelines for AI models. Ramaswamy said the acquisition will enable Snowflake to create more versatile data pipelines for its own customers. For instance, using Datavolo’s tools, a customer might be able to replace single-use data connectors with more flexible pipelines that facilitate the movement of information from the cloud, to on-premises servers, and then to Snowflake’s data warehouse. “By bringing Datavolo into the Snowflake fold, we are expanding how much of the data lifecycle Snowflake captures — unlocking both simplicity and cost savings for our customers, without any sacrifice to data extensibility,” Ramaswamy explained. As for the multiyear partnership with Anthropic, which is a rival to OpenAI, this is all about strengthening Snowflake’s hand in generative AI. The alliance means Anthropic’s most powerful Claude 3.5 models will be made accessible via Snowflake Cortex AI, which is a fully managed service for AI development that runs on AWS. Also, Snowflake’s AI agents, such as Snowflake Intelligence and Cortex Analyst, will be able to leverage Claude. According to Snowflake’s executive vice president of product, Christian Kleinerman, Anthropic’s Claude models will help improve the ability of Snowflake’s AI agents to analyze data, run ad-hoc data analytics, create visualizations based on that information, and perform other multistep tasks. In addition, another benefit of the partnership is that Claude users will be able to leverage Snowflake’s Horizon Catalog service, which provides enterprise-grade compliance, security and privacy for Cortex AI. In other words, it means Claude can be secured with granular access controls and safety guardrails, ensuring more secure and trustworthy AI, Snowflake said. “Our partnership with Anthropic represents a massive leap forward in expanding on our promise to provide thousands of global customers with easy, efficient and trusted AI for a holistic set of enterprise use cases,” Kleinerman insisted. Despite the impressive after-hours gains, Snowflake’s stock is still down 35% in the year to date, compared with a gain of 24% in the broader S&P 500 index.

Title: Bitcoin Gains VanEck’s Official Support As Strategic Reserve

The firstborn cryptocurrency has found another ally in the traditional financial sector after a respected global investment company affirmed its support for making Bitcoin a strategic reserve. The backing of VanEck, a respected name in the investment sector, in Bitcoin shows the coin’s growing appeal even to traditional financial players, a remarkable milestone that could benefit the whole crypto space. Well-known asset manager VanEck announced that it is throwing its support to Bitcoin, saying that it will advocate for the plan of US President-elect Donald Trump to turn the crypto into a national strategic reserve. Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, made the official announcement of the investment firm’s stance on the idea, committing himself to champion Trump’s proposal. FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: VanEck Endorses Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. No need for ‘sources’—we’ll just tell you ourselves. https://t.co/ZO28dqiBqC — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) November 19, 2024 VanEck will join fellow international asset manager BlackRock in the growing supporters of the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, another positive development on the intensifying discussion of the role of digital assets in American economic policy. It can be recalled that in 2017, the global asset management company was the pioneer in pushing for a future-based BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the country. As of writing, VanEck holds over 13,000 BTC with an estimated value of over $1.2 billion. In a campaign last July, Trump unveiled his vision of making the US the most successful nation in the cryptocurrency sector, announcing his plan to establish a “strategic national Bitcoin stockpile” in the country. Trump said that he plans to make it a policy to keep all of the Bitcoin the US government “currently holds or acquires into the future”, adding that this BTC stockpile will become the core of the strategic national crypto reserve. During his campaign, Trump promised cryptocurrency players and investors that he would champion the sector and advocate for its deregulation. The entire crypto space is now counting on the incoming President to deliver on this commitment during his administration. Earlier this week, Satoshi Action Fund (SAF) co-founder and CEO Dennis Porter confirmed that premier asset manager BlackRock will back the strategic Bitcoin reserve concept. Porter believes that Trump’s government would push for the crafting of an executive order that would establish the BTC reserve, providing an optimistic outlook on the future of the alpha crypto. He added that the first step to making this reserve a reality is appointing a “pro-Bitcoin Treasury Secretary” who can initiate the creation of the strategic reserve. Moreover, Wyoming Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis introduced proposed legislation that would be key to the strategic Bitcoin reserve concept. Lummis urged the US Congress to pass the Boost Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide (BITCOIN) Act. If Lummis’ bill is enacted, all the Bitcoin owned by the American government is to be preserved and not sold. Current estimates showed that the US government holds 69,370 BTC with a value of $6.4 billion. Featured image from Reddit, chart from TradingView For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Emerging AI Stocks You Should Keep on Your Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Kingsoft Cloud Holdings Limited (NASDAQ:KC) stands against the other AI stocks you should keep on your radar. As reported by CNBC on November 13, OpenAI’s "blueprint for U.S. AI infrastructure" outlines plans for AI economic zones, utilizing the U.S. Navy's nuclear expertise, and attracting private investment in government projects. The proposal includes a North American AI alliance to compete with China and a National Transmission Highway Act to modernize the grid. OpenAI views AI as a transformative technology, driving job creation, economic growth, and advancements in energy and chip manufacturing.

CNBC recently discussed the future of AI with Kunle Olukotun, co-founder and chief technologist at SambaNova Systems. The discussion centered on the growing demand for AI in 2025, with major tech companies continuing to invest heavily in infrastructure. While these companies are shifting from AI experimentation to deployment, there’s a significant focus on the transition from training models to using them in real-world applications. This change is leading to more complex AI systems, which integrate multiple models for business automation. Kunle Olukotun expects that in 2025, businesses will move beyond pilot phases, widely adopting AI systems that involve more complex reasoning and interactions, rather than simple chatbots. The key to this shift will be rapid inference capabilities.

Title: Nvidia Says Its Blackwell Chip Is Fine, Nothing to See Here
URL: https://www.wired.com/story/nvidia-earnings-blackwell-chips-overheating/
Time Published: 2024-11-21T00:15:14Z
Full Content:
Chip giant Nvidia reported its third-quarter earnings earlier today, and all ears—and presumably some watch parties—were tuned in to try to determine what the company’s performance might mean for the near future of the artificial intelligence industry as a whole. The fate of the company’s newest AI chip, Blackwell, was a major focus after production issues caused shipments to be delayed for several months earlier this year. On Sunday, The Information also reported that Blackwell chips were overheating when connected together in Nvidia’s customized server racks, prompting the company to make design changes. But Nvidia cofounder and CEO Jensen Huang told analysts and investors on its earnings call today that Blackwell production now “is in full steam.” “We will deliver this quarter more Blackwells than we had previously estimated,” Huang said. Some of Nvidia’s most important customers, like Microsoft and OpenAI, have already received the new chips, and Blackwell sales could end up generating several billion dollars in revenue for the company next quarter, executives said. Some industry analysts reported earlier that problems with the new chips had been fixed. Dylan Patel, chief analyst at the research firm SemiAnalysis, told Business insider that the Blackwell overheating issues “have been present for months and have largely been addressed.” Patrick Moorhead, founder and chief analyst of Moor Insights & Strategy, told WIRED that his manufacturing contacts were unaware of any major overheating issues. But it's not unusual, he said, for there to be tension between design, engineering, and production when bringing a new chip design to market. “It’s a debate as old as semiconductors: Is it a design issue? Is it a production issue?” Moorhead said. “People are going to look for any type of smoke that can get in the way of the thesis of [Nvidia’s] dramatic growth.” Nvidia generated $35.1 billion in revenue for the quarter, beating estimates of $33.2 billion. Its revenue rose 94 percent compared to last year. That’s a relatively small increase compared to a few of its recent quarters, when revenue rose as much as 265 percent on an annual basis—but Nvidia isn’t going out of business anytime soon. The results indicate that the AI market is continuing to boom as companies pour billions of dollars into buying advanced chips and other equipment, albeit at a slightly slower pace. A large portion of Nvidia’s growth this quarter was driven by data center revenue, totaling $30.8 billion for the quarter, which was up 112 percent from last year. The company’s gross profit margin was 74.5 percent, essentially flat from a year ago. But analysts expect that Nvidia’s margins could shrink as the company shifts to producing more Blackwell chips, which cost more to make than their less advanced predecessors. Nvidia’s earnings reports are seen as an important bellwether for the AI industry. The chip architect’s advanced GPUs, which power complex neural network processing, are what made the current generative AI boom possible. As Silicon Valley giants raced to build new chatbots and image-generation tools over the past few years, Nvidia’s revenue exploded, allowing it to surpass Apple as the most valuable public company in the world. Since the launch of ChatGPT in November of 2022, Nvidia’s stock price has increased nearly tenfold. Almost every major tech company working on AI, even those building their own processing units, rely heavily on Nvidia GPUs to train their AI models. Meta, for example, has said that it is building its latest AI technology on a cluster of more than 100,000 Nvidia H100s. Smaller AI startups, meanwhile, have been left without enough AI compute power as Nvidia struggled to keep up with demand. Blackwell, Nvidia’s newest GPU, is made up of two pieces of silicon each equivalent to the size of its previous chip, Hopper, which are combined together into a single component. This design has resulted in a chip that’s supposedly four times faster and with more than double the number of transistors as its predecessor. But the launch of Blackwell hasn’t been all smooth sailing. Originally slated to ship in the second quarter, the new chip hit a production snag, reportedly delaying the rollout by a few months. Huang took responsibility for the problem, calling it a “design flaw” that “caused the yield to be low.” Huang told Reuters in August that Nvidia’s longtime chipmaking partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, helped Nvidia correct the issue. Moorhead told WIRED he remains bullish on Nvidia and is confident that the generative AI market will continue to grow for at least the next 12 to 18 months, despite some recent reports suggesting AI progress is starting to plateau. “I think the only way shareholders would have a mutiny is if they were concerned about the capital expenditures or the profitability of the hyperscalers,” Moorhead said, referring to big tech companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta that are heavily invested in AI cloud services. “But I think they’re just going to keep buying up Nvidia until that day actually comes.” Enterprise AI is still an area of growth for Nvidia as well, he added. On today’s earnings call, Nvidia chief financial officer Colette Kress said Nvidia’s enterprise AI tools are in “full throttle,” including an operating platform that lets other businesses build their own copilots and AI agents. Customers include Salesforce, SAP, and ServiceNow, she said. Huang echoed the same thing later in the call: “We’re starting to see enterprise adoption of agentic AI,” he said. “It’s really the latest rage.”

Title: Is Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. (SQM) the Best Fertilizer Stock to Buy?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Fertilizer Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. (NYSE:SQM) stands against the other fertilizer stocks. The fertilizer industry is a crucial sector in agriculture that focuses on the production and distribution of substances that enhance plant growth. By supplying necessary nutrients, fertilizers help improve crop yields and quality, which are essential for feeding the growing global population. The industry has evolved significantly over time, with modern practices relying heavily on chemically manufactured fertilizers to support large-scale farming and meet the global demand for food. According to Mordor Intelligence, the global fertilizer market is estimated to have reached a value of $381.7 billion in 2024. Looking forward, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.99% during 2024-2030 to reach $541.2 billion by ​the end of the forecast period. READ ALSO: 10 Undervalued Chemical Stocks to Invest In and 7 Best Agriculture Stocks to Buy Right Now. There is a strong sense of optimism within the industry. The Fertilizer Institute’s 2023 Industry Trends Survey highlighted a positive outlook within the fertilizer sector, with many respondents expressing confidence in future growth. About 40% of those surveyed believe that market conditions have improved over the past five years, despite challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain disruptions. Companies attribute their resilience to strategic practices such as precommitment purchases and careful planning. Nearly 80% of participants are optimistic about their businesses being equally or more profitable in the next five years. The fertilizer industry is currently experiencing several key trends that are shaping its future. Advances in technology are transforming how fertilizers are produced and applied. Innovations such as precision agriculture, which uses data analytics and sensors, help farmers optimize fertilizer usage based on specific soil conditions and crop needs. Additionally, there is a growing demand for fertilizers that offer more nutrients while reducing their environmental impact. The emphasis on maximizing the efficiency of fertilizer application to promote sustainable farming practices is increasing, which is driving the development of new and innovative solutions. On August 13, CNBC reported that Windfall Bio, a California-based startup, is addressing methane emissions using "mems," or methane-eating microbes. These microbes naturally consume methane and convert it into fertilizer. This innovative approach helps reduce harmful methane from sources like agriculture, landfills, and oil production. Farmers can use the fertilizer produced, while companies generating waste methane can sell it back to Windfall, creating a new revenue stream. These trends indicate a dynamic shift in the fertilizer industry, balancing the need for increased food production with environmental sustainability and innovation. Methodology To compile our list of the 8 best fertilizer stocks to buy now, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the largest fertilizer companies. We also reviewed our own rankings and consulted various online resources to compile a list of the best fertilizer stocks.

Title: What Is AI-Fi In Crypto And Why You Should Care

Abstract graphics processing unit (GPU) - a part of the AI value chain. Artificial Intelligence has been reshaping our world at breakneck speed, with ChatGPT hitting 100 million users in just two months and Nvidia hitting revenue of $32.8 billion solely in the third quarter of 2024. AI is no longer a sci-fi concept but a business necessity and an integral part of our economy. Yet despite this explosive growth, participating in the economic layer of AI remains challenging for many. Here's where AI Finance stands a chance to change the rules of the game. AiFi is a new financial framework bridging the AI economy with decentralized finance, that democratizes access to AI-related assets such as GPUs or data, creating new value streams. At the same time, it’s powering DeFi with agents and AI-enhanced applications. Over the years, the decentralized finance community has built the foundations that made it possible for AiFi to emerge. The way DeFi and its primitives - like onchain lending - evolved enabled the industry to have an adaptable infrastructure for all kinds of assets, both crypto-native and not. Tokenization, as a process of bringing off-chain assets onto the blockchain, paved a way for non-crypto assets to boom back in 2023. Tokenized real-world assets, especially money market funds, exemplify how the integration of non-crypto assets has found a product market fit in an onchain economy. The biggest asset manager in the world, BlackRock, has dominated the crypto market at a 22% market share with its tokenized money market fund, BUIDL token, marking yet another milestone for RWA adoption within TradFi. Using DeFi infrastructure for tokenized assets has already made waves, passing over 10 billion TVL. But it’s only the beginning. The numbers tell a compelling story. With the global artificial intelligence industry revenue expected to be around $1.8 trillion by 2030, the AI economy stands as a strategic sector for tokenization. However, staggering projections often mask significant barriers to entry. Substantial capital investment and technical expertise are required to participate in the AI market, leaving smaller organizations on the sidelines with a lack of resources for funding further expansion. In addition, the nascent stage of this technology and the lack of global AI markets lead to limited access for various user segments, particularly retail, and hinder the potential revenue growth of AI companies. This is where blockchain technology and tokenization enter the picture. By bringing AI-related assets onchain, AiFi creates liquid markets for previously illiquid or inaccessible resources: Blockchain-based tokenization is the key to making assets tradeable, programmable, or composable - features impossible within traditional finance. The blockchain itself should be viewed as financial rails for these new markets, enabling: Numbers don't lie. The growth of AI has created an unprecedented opportunity for many to participate in. Estimations show a bullish perspective for various elements of the AI value chain, with the example of data centers where their demand is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12% to 15% between now and 2030. These metrics paint a picture of a sector that will display competitive revenue streams. With that, AiFi, as a new framework aims to financialize the AI economy by bringing it onchain for individuals to get exposure to it. And on the other hand, for SMEs and organizations to monetize their datasets and models, or have an alternative way to fundraise capital for expansion. Creating new AiFi-oriented markets makes both AI developers and investors participate in the tokenized AI economy. And now that the vision of Agentic Web has already taken root in Web3, the AiFi narrative gains even more credibility. Where Is AiFi Heading AI-Fi is a blend of two powerful technologies, with AI posing as an overpowering industry and blockchain serving as its financial layer. Tokenization makes it possible for real-world yield via high-quality cash flows into the DeFi ecosystem. It also makes monetizing AI services, such as machine learning models transparent and programmable. Even though the AiFi paradigm of making the AI economy more accessible is at an early stage, it leverages already established DeFi infrastructure and best RWA tokenization practices, all while addressing the AI sector's barriers.

Title: Jim Cramer Says He’s A ‘Kaching Kaching’ When It Comes To Cameco Corporation (CCJ)

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Lightning Round: 8 Stocks to Watch. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Cameco Corporation (NYSE:CCJ) stands against Jim Cramer's other stocks. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently shared his insights on several key topics. He discussed the recent turmoil in the pharmaceutical sector, which followed the news that President-elect Trump is considering Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for the position of Secretary of Health and Human Services. Cramer pointed out that the pharmaceutical industry took a significant hit after the announcement, but he believes this may present solid buying opportunities. Cramer acknowledged that RFK Jr., whom he humorously referred to as "Bobby Jr. for some Sopranos flavor," has a strong anti-big pharma stance, which could be a concern for the sector. However, Cramer emphasized: “... There's a whole federal bureaucracy at HHS and frankly, I don't think Trump will let him wreck a pretty important sector of the stock market.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer Is Focused on These 15 Stocks This Week and Jim Cramer Talked About These 11 Stocks Recently Cramer further addressed the potential confirmation of RFK Jr. as Secretary of Health and Human Services. He suggested that while there is a debate about whether the Senate will provide confirmation for him, he believes RFK Jr. will likely be approved. However, Cramer remained less concerned about RFK Jr. causing significant damage to the pharmaceutical industry, noting that he doesn't expect him to have much success in pushing his anti-vaccine or anti-pharma agenda. Moving on to broader market trends, Cramer commented: “After the initial Trump rally euphoria in the wake of the election, we quickly transitioned to a Trump rally hangover last week with the averages getting clobbered.” He highlighted that semiconductor stocks were among the hardest hit, partially due to the typical tech sector sell-off when bond yields rise, as they did last week. Cramer also expressed concern, saying: “With the election results from earlier this month and the second Trump administration coming in about two months, I am very worried about companies that are hostage to the Chinese economy.” Finally, Cramer turned his attention to autonomous vehicles, suggesting that while the Trump administration’s plans for self-driving cars may sound ambitious, they could be more difficult to execute in practice. He pointed out that a variety of state and local governments would need to align on new regulations, and the notion that the federal government could allow self-driving cars nationwide with a simple executive order seemed "just plain fanciful." Despite this, Cramer advocated for owning TSLA, not because of any regulatory changes under Trump, but because he believes in the vision and leadership of the company’s CEO, Elon Musk. Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 8 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on November 18 and listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close up of the reactor core, highlighting the complexity of the uranium power process. Cramer mentioned that Cameco Corporation (NYSE:CCJ) is expensive and said: “Look, all the uranium players are up. I think that they're going to amount to very little in the end. This is not an expensive stock. I understand why you want to be in it, not versus the others, but it is an incredibly expensive stock versus the rest of the market. That's what I care about. I am a kaching kaching when it comes to Cameco.” Cameco (NYSE:CCJ) supplies uranium for electricity generation and offers nuclear fuel processing, reactor technology, and related services to commercial utilities and government agencies worldwide. As per CNBC, on November 20, according to Goldman Sachs, the company is well-positioned for growth, particularly in light of the increasing demand for nuclear power in the United States. The company is expected to benefit from uranium prices, which are projected to rise due to a widening gap between supply and demand. Goldman Sachs raised its 12-month price target for the stock to $64 per share, highlighting the company's potential as uranium prices climb. The stock has risen by approximately 33% so far this year. Analyst Neil Mehta highlighted the company’s integrated business model across the nuclear fuel cycle, emphasizing its strengths in uranium mining, conversion, fabrication, and nuclear services through its stake in Westinghouse. Mehta also noted that Cameco is an appealing partner for Western utilities due to its limited geopolitical risks, with operations primarily based in Canada and the U.S., alongside a single site in Kazakhstan. According to the firm, Cameco’s (NYSE:CCJ) contracts are supported by favorable uranium pricing, with current contracts seeing prices ranging from $70 to $130 per pound, with the midpoint around $100, which is higher than the current spot price of approximately $80 per pound. Additionally, Cameco’s 49% stake in Westinghouse, which is poised to play a key role in the construction of new power plants with its AP1000 reactor, presents further growth potential, as noted by Goldman Sachs. Overall CCJ ranks 6th on Jim Cramer's list of stocks to watch. While we acknowledge the potential of CCJ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CCJ but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers. Cramer reiterated his “own it, don’t trade it” philosophy for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) but also pointed out that the bears are out to get it these days. “Apple, own it don't trade it. If I had no stock, would I buy it right here? I would wait for a dip because the bears are all over it, every minute of the day. Keep that in mind and then pull the trigger.” Although Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) remains a dominant force in the smartphone market, recent years have presented challenges for the company. On November 15, according to TipRanks, Jefferies pointed out that the company was granted an exemption from import tariffs during the final years of the Trump administration, and since then, the company has actively worked to diversify its production outside of China. However, currently, only around 10% of iPhone production occurs outside China. While it is possible that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) could receive another exemption, Jefferies' analysis suggests that without it, gross margins could face a potential decline of 3% to 6.7%, and the company's value could drop by roughly 5% to 10%, assuming no changes in average selling price or volume. Jefferies has maintained a Hold rating on the company stock. It ought to be noted that the company is always at the forefront of innovation. Its incorporation of advanced AI tools into its flagship devices (and others) comes at a time when there is growing enthusiasm around the potential of this technology. The company is only beginning its journey in this area as CEO Tim Cook remarked that it is “just the start of what we believe generative AI can achieve” during the fourth-quarter earnings call. Overall AAPL ranks 8th on Jim Cramer's list of stocks to watch. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Despite the strong performance, shares dipped more than 2% in after-hours trading, reflecting investor caution over valuation and tempered guidance. The chipmaker posted revenue of $35.08 billion for the quarter ended October 27, a 94% increase year-on-year and beating analysts’ consensus estimate of $33.28 billion. Nvidia’s non-GAAP earnings-per-share came in at $0.81, surpassing consensus estimates of $0.75 EPS. Revenue from the Data Center segment, Nvidia’s key growth driver, reached a record $30.8 billion, up 112% from the same period last year. Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s founder and CEO, called the quarter a reflection of “AI in full steam” as enterprises adopt Nvidia’s Hopper GPUs and anticipate the launch of its next-generation Blackwell platform. The tech giant has been riding high this year following an explosion of investor interest in AI-related firms and businesses. That has helped drive the Nasdaq to record heights amid prospects of a return to cheaper borrowing should the U.S. Federal Reserve continue to slash its benchmark rate. Despite strong results, Nvidia’s stock fell 0.76% during regular trading and dropped another 2.39% in after-hours, closing at $142.40. Analysts attributed the decline to profit-taking after Nvidia's year-long rally, along with cautious reactions to the company’s Q4 guidance. Nvidia expects revenue of $37.5 billion for the next quarter, representing a 7% sequential increase and aligning with analyst forecasts. Nvidia’s gaming segment also saw steady growth, reporting $3.3 billion in revenue, up 14% sequentially and 15% year-on-year. However, smaller segments like Automotive and Professional Visualization, while growing, contributed modestly to overall revenue. While results underscore Nvidia's dominance in the AI and accelerated computing space, concerns over the company’s soaring valuation and supply constraints for its GPUs could weigh on the stock in the short term. Nvidia will hold a conference call with analysts later Wednesday to provide further insights into its outlook.

Nvidia’s (NVDA+0.59%) fiscal third quarter revenues beat Wall Street’s expectations for another straight quarter at a record $35.1 billion — up 94% from a year ago. The chipmaker’s revenues for the quarter ended in October are up 17% from the previous quarter’s revenues of $30 billion. Nvidia reported net income of $19.3 billion, and earnings per share, or EPS, of $0.78. “The age of AI is in full steam, propelling a global shift to NVIDIA computing,” Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said in a statement. “Demand for Hopper and anticipation for Blackwell — in full production — are incredible as foundation model makers scale pretraining, post-training and inference.” Nvidia was expected to report revenues of $33 billion for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS+2.46%). Net income was expected to be $17.4 billion and EPS was expected at $0.75. Shares of the chipmaker were down 0.76% at the market close on Wednesday. Nvidia’s shares are up 202.86% so far this year. The company’s data center quarterly revenue was $30.8 billion, up 17% from the previous quarter, and up 112% year over year. Nvidia set its fiscal fourth quarter revenue guidance at $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%. The company was expected to set fiscal fourth quarter guidance at $37.09 billion, according to FactSet estimates. “To support the stock on earnings day,” Nvidia would have to report fiscal fourth quarter guidance of at least $38 billion, John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, said in comments shared with Quartz ahead of earnings. On an earnings call with analysts, the company said that it shipped thirteen thousand Blackwell samples in the fiscal third quarter, and that the artificial intelligence platform is in full production. In response to an analyst’s questions about reports of Blackwell overheating and Nvidia’s roadmap to produce AI chips on a one year cycle, Huang said that the company plans to deliver more Blackwells in the current quarter than previously estimated, and that “as you see from all the systems that are being stood up, Blackwell is in great shape.” “We’re expecting to continue to execute on our annual road map,” Huang said. “Everything is on track as far as I know. Nvidia’s shares were down 3.47% during after-hours trading on Wednesday after it released its earnings results. The shares remained down by 1.2% later in the evening. The chipmaker’s shares fell 6.9% in after-hours trading after it reported fiscal second quarter earnings in August. Nvidia had set fiscal fourth quarter revenue guidance at $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2% — slightly above the average analysts were expecting, but below top end estimates.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks recovered from steep losses Wednesday ahead of Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings, a crucial litmus test for the artificial intelligence trade that could set the direction of markets for days to come. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) finished the day up about 0.3%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) closed flat. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped about 0.1%. All three major indexes had been deep in the red at some point in the day, with the Nasdaq down over 1% in morning trading. After the bell, Nvidia reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.81 on revenue of $35.1 billion. Analysts were anticipating EPS of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion but shares slipped early in after-hours trading. The $3.61 trillion chipmaker, now the world's most valuable company, had seen its stock surge 200% this year so far, hitting record highs after the US presidential election. Elsewhere in corporates, Target (TGT) muted its outlook for holiday-season sales and profit after posting a big quarterly profit miss and slashing its full-year guidance. The retail giant's shares sank more than 21% after the earnings. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices were up more than 3% to hit a fresh record near $94,500 per token before paring back some gains and falling below $94,000. Optimism for a crypto-friendly Trump White House has spurred the digital currency's recent rally. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Nvidia (NVDA) stock slipped about 1% in after-hours trade after the company reported quarterly results that surpassed Wall Street's expectations for both earnings per share and revenue. For the third quarter, Nvidia reported earnings per share of $0.81 on revenue of $35.1 billion. Wall Street had expected earnings per share of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Nvidia shares had been up nearly 200% heading into the print. Target (TGT) stock fell more than 21% on Wednesday after the retail giant slashed its full-year guidance and missed Wall Street's estimates for both earnings per share and revenue in its third quarter. The Wednesday tumble marked the stock's worst one-day performance since May 2022. Read more about Target's quarter here. Homebuilder stocks are losing steam. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) has fallen nearly 5% in the past month. DR Horton (DHI), the biggest US homebuilder, along with Lennar (LEN) and PulteGroup (PHM), have seen declines of more than 12%, 6%, and 11% in the past month, respectively. “It's not surprising and not really alarming that the group is giving some of its [gains] back,” Wedbush analyst Jay McCanless told Yahoo Finance. “When you look at what mortgage rates have done in the past month, basically since the beginning of the calendar 4Q, these stocks tend to trade in an inverse fashion of what mortgage rates are doing.” Rates on the 30-year mortgages have been hovering around 6.7%, according to Freddie Mac, up from around 6% in September. Meanwhile, lumber prices have been climbing, with the framing lumber composite price rising 1.4% for the week ending Nov. 15, reaching the highest level since August 2023, according to the National Association of Home Builders. “It just may be a little more expensive from a lumber perspective for the builders than what they were paying this time last year," McCanless said. Nvidia's highly anticipated earnings report is set for release after the closing bell. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley breaks down the key numbers and themes to watch: Nvidia is expected to report Q3 earnings per share (EPS) of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That works out to an 83% year-over-year increase on both the top and bottom lines compared to the same period last year when Nvidia saw EPS of $0.40 on revenue of $22.1 billion. Nvidia’s Data Center segment, its largest business, is set to bring in $29 billion for the quarter. That’s a 100% rise on the $14.5 billion reported in Q3 last year. Gaming revenue is expected to top out at $3 billion, up 7% from last year, when the segment brought in $2.8 billion. Analysts are anticipating gross margins to hit 75%. Investors will be on the lookout for not only whether Nvidia beats on the top and bottom lines for Q3 but also whether it raises its outlook for Q4. Analysts are expecting Nvidia to give guidance of $37 billion in revenue in the quarter. Read more of the preview here. Shares of the chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) dropped 6.6% following its investor day, which focused on how the company will diversify revenue just as its business with Apple (AAPL) falls into jeopardy. Qualcomm discussed further diversifying revenue beyond its smartphone chips to chips for personal computers, autos, and a range of advanced systems from machinery in factories to surveillance technology (dubbed its "Internet of Things" segment). Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman reports that the company expects to generate $22 billion in sales of those semiconductors by 2029. Currently about 10% of Qualcomm's revenue comes from sales of its modem chips to Apple for the iPhone, but that business has come under pressure as Apple increasingly develops its own custom chips for the devices. Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon spoke with Yahoo Finance about what's ahead for the company Tuesday afternoon. Read more here. Nvidia (NVDA) is set to report earnings after the bell and give investors another look at the state of AI spending. The stock is already up nearly 200% this year, and more than 2,600% in the past five years as the company's revenues have run wild amid a surge in demand for its AI chips. In a media roundtable on Wednesday, Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin made the case that it may be time for investors to look elsewhere to benefit from the AI boom. Nvidia's liftoff was "phase one" of the AI trade, Kostin said. The "AI infrastructure" trade, companies that will help power the AI boom and are spending on AI chips to operate new servers, has already taken off too, in some cases beyond their projected earnings growth, per Kostin. But the prices of stocks in Goldman's "AI enabled revenue" group haven't seen the same reaction. This group, Kostin said, could benefit from not having to spend as much on expensive AI hardware but still reap the potential benefits from AI as a whole. The group includes stocks like Uber (UBER), Adobe (ADBE), Mastercard (MA), Salesforce (CRM), and more. "We at companies in the AI enabled revenue group of stocks where their performance of the shares have basically matched their earnings growth," Kostin said. "And so our analysis is there's a potential for multiple expansion in those stocks." Williams-Sonoma (WSM) shares soared roughly 30% after the company reported third quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street's expectations and boosted its outlook for the full year. The high-end retailer — which owns Pottery Barn and West Elm in addition to its namesake, Williams-Sonoma — also said it's prepared to deal with potential upcoming tariffs under president-elect Donald Trump. CFO Jeffrey Howie said, "We've significantly reduced our China-sourced goods from 50% to 25% over the last few years. So our exposure is significantly less than the last time in 2018 that we saw this activity." "The US is already a major manufacturing hub for Williams-Sonoma, Inc.," he added. "Much of our upholstery is manufactured domestically in our facilities in North Carolina and Mississippi." Howie continued, "We're prepared to reduce our exports to China further if tariffs increase. We've mapped out a category-by-category plan to reduce China sourcing if conditions warrant, and we're currently evaluating and quantifying the impact from additional tariffs. We have a wide range of mitigation options." Owning a home is becoming increasingly more expensive than renting one. Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports: Exact cost estimates vary, but recently the premium for homeownership has been at least 35% over renting, a level that’s near historical highs and is likely to persist. “We’re well, well beyond what the typical historical difference is if you were to buy an entry-level home versus rent a starter home,” said Rick Palacios Jr., director of research at John Burns Research and Consulting. “I think that’s a big part of why you see the resale market in a recession.” Palacios’s firm has found factors like rising homeowners insurance premiums explain much of the growing gap. Higher mortgage rates don’t help either. Leaving other factors constant, it would take mortgage rates to be at 3.5% for the buying versus renting math to return to historical averages.

On Wednesday, Federal Reserve governor Michelle Bowman expressed concern that the Fed’s progress toward 2% inflation has “stalled” and the central bank should proceed "cautiously" when lowering interest rates. Bowman was the lone official to dissent when the Fed slashed the rate by half a percentage point, saying then that the Fed should've cut interest rates by 25 basis points instead of 50. On Wednesday, she argued there are "greater risks to the price stability side of our mandate, especially while the labor market remains near full employment." "We have seen considerable progress in lowering inflation since early 2023, but progress seems to have stalled in recent months," Bowman said in a speech at the Forum Club of the Palm Beaches. To Bowman's point, last week the "core" Consumer Price Index (CPI), which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, showed prices increased 3.3% annually for the third consecutive month during October. Recent data has increased debate over whether or not the Fed will cut rates in December. As of Wednesday afternoon, markets are pricing in a roughly 56% chance the Fed cuts rates in December, down from a more than 82% chance seen last week, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has soared about 40% since Donald Trump won the presidential election to trade above $94,000 per coin for the first time on Wednesday. On Wednesday, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz told Yahoo Finance why the market has been betting the new administration will be more pro cryptocurrency. "All the guys around the table like our space," Novogratz said. "They believe in the digital asset world. They believe in blockchains and bitcoin. And so the whole energy of this administration is going to be so different than the Elizabeth Warren, Gary Gensler era." Novogratz added that he expects an administration that's more supportive of crypto will help US crypto business operate without the "fear of litigation." And for company's like Novogratz's it could help cut down on costs too. "Our audit at Galaxy cost three times what it would if we were a non-crypto company," Novogratz said. "So we're spending $9 million a year on an audit for a medium-sized company. That's insane. So the tax on crypto has been brutal. That is going to come way down. People aren't going to fear ... they're constantly getting a Wells notice." Brutal day for Target (TGT) after earnings. Here are three problems I saw in the quarter. I wasn't the only one spotting these things, of course. The Citi research team swooping in with a midday downgrade on Target (a late one at that). "We are downgrading Target from buy to neutral. Though 3Q may have had some unique challenges, we believe very poor results at Target in 3Q (and an uninspiring outlook for 4Q) show Target is likely losing share to Walmart (WMT). With Walmart's market share gains coming largely from higher income consumers (as they called out yesterday), Target seems to be the one most at risk of losing additional share. We believe Target is likely to need to be more promotional to drive traffic/sales, which we believe makes fiscal year 2025 much more uncertain, especially because in 3Q Target did not show an ability to adjust SG&A to offset the sales/gross margin weakness," said Citi analyst Paul Lejuez. Bottom line: It's going to take Target several quarters to regain investor trust. It could begin to do that by delivering on its severely lowered holiday quarter guidance. Walmart (WMT) and Lowe's (LOW) are the latest American retailers to warn that product costs could rise if President-elect Donald Trump makes good on his tariff promises — which include 10% to 20% tariffs across the board and a 60% tariff on goods from China. Walmart CFO John David Rainey hinted in an interview with Yahoo Finance’s Brian Sozzi on Tuesday that Trump’s tariff promises would prompt the retailer to hike costs, pointing to the impact of higher tariffs enacted during the president-elect's first term under his “America First” agenda. “If we look back historically when tariffs were enacted seven years ago, it did result in higher prices for customers,” Rainey said. Lowe's echoed the sentiment. “Roughly 40% of our cost of goods sold are sourced outside of the US, and that includes both direct imports and national brands through our vendor partners,” said CFO Brandon Sink in a call with investors on Tuesday. “And as we look at potential impact, certainly would add product costs, but timing and details remain uncertain at this point.” Read the full story here. Nvidia (NVDA) is set to report earnings on Wednesday after the bell. Expectations — as they have been for more than a year now — are monstrous. Nvidia is expected to report Q3 earnings per share of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Both metrics would mark a more than 80% increase compared to the same quarter a year ago. Nvidia has been consistently surpassing analyst estimates every quarter since OpenAI launched ChatGPT in November 2022. The AI chip leader's stock reaction has been more mixed in the day following earnings announcements as expectations have grown lofty, but it hasn't fallen two quarters in a row on the day following its earnings release since the middle of 2021. That could change during Thursday's trading day if Nvidia has a repeat of last quarter when the company's upbeat outlook wasn't enough to impress investors and the stock fell more than 6%. "The company hasn’t had a negative price reaction in back to back post earnings release days since [the first quarter of 2021], when GenAI wasn’t a phrase in investors’ dictionary," Julian Emanuel, who leads the equity, derivatives, and quantitative strategy team at Evercore ISI, wrote in a note to clients on Sunday. "A positive reaction following the 11/20 release, following the negative move last quarter, could help cushion the S&P 500’s decline somewhat near term but is more likely to refocus investors on the long term story." Target (TGT) stock tanked in early trading on Wednesday, falling more than 20% after the retail giant slashed its full-year guidance and missed Wall Street's estimates for both earnings per share and revenue in its third quarter. Before the bell, Target said it now expects full-year earnings per share in a range of $8.30 to $8.90, below its prior range of $9.00 to $9.70. The new guidance also came in well below the $9.61 earnings per share that Wall Street had expected. The retailer also took a cautious stance on prospects for the holiday shopping season. Read more on Target's quarter from Yahoo Finance Executive editor Brian Sozzi here. US stocks wavered on Wednesday ahead of Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings, seen as a crucial litmus test for the AI trade that could set the direction of markets for days to come. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was up about 0.2%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) hugged the flat line. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped about 0.2%, following a mixed day on Wall Street on Tuesday. After surging on Tuesday amid increased optimism surrounding the stock ahead of earnings, Nvidia shares slid more than 1% in early trade. Comcast (CMCSA) is looking to play offense in the ever-evolving media landscape. On Wednesday, the company said that it will spin off most of its cable networks into a new publicly traded company called SpinCo. The stock jumped as much as 3.5% in premarket trading before paring those gains. The new venture will house the majority of NBCUniversal’s cable television networks, including USA Network, CNBC, MSNBC, Oxygen, E!, SYFY, and Golf Channel. Those networks collectively generated about $7 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, Comcast said in its announcement. Comcast's Peacock streaming service and the NBC broadcast network will remain under the parent company. “This transaction positions both SpinCo and NBCUniversal to play offense in a changing media landscape,” said Comcast president Mike Cavanagh.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks recovered from steep losses Wednesday ahead of Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings, a crucial litmus test for the artificial intelligence trade that could set the direction of markets for days to come. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) finished the day up about 0.3%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) closed flat. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped about 0.1%. All three major indexes had been deep in the red at some point in the day, with the Nasdaq down over 1% in morning trading. After the bell, Nvidia reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.81 on revenue of $35.1 billion. Analysts were anticipating EPS of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion but shares slipped early in after-hours trading. The $3.61 trillion chipmaker, now the world's most valuable company, had seen its stock surge 200% this year so far, hitting record highs after the US presidential election. Elsewhere in corporates, Target (TGT) muted its outlook for holiday-season sales and profit after posting a big quarterly profit miss and slashing its full-year guidance. The retail giant's shares sank more than 21% after the earnings. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices were up more than 3% to hit a fresh record near $94,500 per token before paring back some gains and falling below $94,000. Optimism for a crypto-friendly Trump White House has spurred the digital currency's recent rally. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Nvidia (NVDA) stock slipped about 1% in after-hours trade after the company reported quarterly results that surpassed Wall Street's expectations for both earnings per share and revenue. For the third quarter, Nvidia reported earnings per share of $0.81 on revenue of $35.1 billion. Wall Street had expected earnings per share of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Nvidia shares had been up nearly 200% heading into the print. Target (TGT) stock fell more than 21% on Wednesday after the retail giant slashed its full-year guidance and missed Wall Street's estimates for both earnings per share and revenue in its third quarter. The Wednesday tumble marked the stock's worst one-day performance since May 2022. Read more about Target's quarter here. Homebuilder stocks are losing steam. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) has fallen nearly 5% in the past month. DR Horton (DHI), the biggest US homebuilder, along with Lennar (LEN) and PulteGroup (PHM), have seen declines of more than 12%, 6%, and 11% in the past month, respectively. “It's not surprising and not really alarming that the group is giving some of its [gains] back,” Wedbush analyst Jay McCanless told Yahoo Finance. “When you look at what mortgage rates have done in the past month, basically since the beginning of the calendar 4Q, these stocks tend to trade in an inverse fashion of what mortgage rates are doing.” Rates on the 30-year mortgages have been hovering around 6.7%, according to Freddie Mac, up from around 6% in September. Meanwhile, lumber prices have been climbing, with the framing lumber composite price rising 1.4% for the week ending Nov. 15, reaching the highest level since August 2023, according to the National Association of Home Builders. “It just may be a little more expensive from a lumber perspective for the builders than what they were paying this time last year," McCanless said. Nvidia's highly anticipated earnings report is set for release after the closing bell. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley breaks down the key numbers and themes to watch: Nvidia is expected to report Q3 earnings per share (EPS) of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That works out to an 83% year-over-year increase on both the top and bottom lines compared to the same period last year when Nvidia saw EPS of $0.40 on revenue of $22.1 billion. Nvidia’s Data Center segment, its largest business, is set to bring in $29 billion for the quarter. That’s a 100% rise on the $14.5 billion reported in Q3 last year. Gaming revenue is expected to top out at $3 billion, up 7% from last year, when the segment brought in $2.8 billion. Analysts are anticipating gross margins to hit 75%. Investors will be on the lookout for not only whether Nvidia beats on the top and bottom lines for Q3 but also whether it raises its outlook for Q4. Analysts are expecting Nvidia to give guidance of $37 billion in revenue in the quarter. Read more of the preview here. Shares of the chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) dropped 6.6% following its investor day, which focused on how the company will diversify revenue just as its business with Apple (AAPL) falls into jeopardy. Qualcomm discussed further diversifying revenue beyond its smartphone chips to chips for personal computers, autos, and a range of advanced systems from machinery in factories to surveillance technology (dubbed its "Internet of Things" segment). Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman reports that the company expects to generate $22 billion in sales of those semiconductors by 2029. Currently about 10% of Qualcomm's revenue comes from sales of its modem chips to Apple for the iPhone, but that business has come under pressure as Apple increasingly develops its own custom chips for the devices. Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon spoke with Yahoo Finance about what's ahead for the company Tuesday afternoon. Read more here. Nvidia (NVDA) is set to report earnings after the bell and give investors another look at the state of AI spending. The stock is already up nearly 200% this year, and more than 2,600% in the past five years as the company's revenues have run wild amid a surge in demand for its AI chips. In a media roundtable on Wednesday, Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin made the case that it may be time for investors to look elsewhere to benefit from the AI boom. Nvidia's liftoff was "phase one" of the AI trade, Kostin said. The "AI infrastructure" trade, companies that will help power the AI boom and are spending on AI chips to operate new servers, has already taken off too, in some cases beyond their projected earnings growth, per Kostin. But the prices of stocks in Goldman's "AI enabled revenue" group haven't seen the same reaction. This group, Kostin said, could benefit from not having to spend as much on expensive AI hardware but still reap the potential benefits from AI as a whole. The group includes stocks like Uber (UBER), Adobe (ADBE), Mastercard (MA), Salesforce (CRM), and more. "We at companies in the AI enabled revenue group of stocks where their performance of the shares have basically matched their earnings growth," Kostin said. "And so our analysis is there's a potential for multiple expansion in those stocks." Williams-Sonoma (WSM) shares soared roughly 30% after the company reported third quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street's expectations and boosted its outlook for the full year. The high-end retailer — which owns Pottery Barn and West Elm in addition to its namesake, Williams-Sonoma — also said it's prepared to deal with potential upcoming tariffs under president-elect Donald Trump. CFO Jeffrey Howie said, "We've significantly reduced our China-sourced goods from 50% to 25% over the last few years. So our exposure is significantly less than the last time in 2018 that we saw this activity." "The US is already a major manufacturing hub for Williams-Sonoma, Inc.," he added. "Much of our upholstery is manufactured domestically in our facilities in North Carolina and Mississippi." Howie continued, "We're prepared to reduce our exports to China further if tariffs increase. We've mapped out a category-by-category plan to reduce China sourcing if conditions warrant, and we're currently evaluating and quantifying the impact from additional tariffs. We have a wide range of mitigation options." Owning a home is becoming increasingly more expensive than renting one. Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports: Exact cost estimates vary, but recently the premium for homeownership has been at least 35% over renting, a level that’s near historical highs and is likely to persist. “We’re well, well beyond what the typical historical difference is if you were to buy an entry-level home versus rent a starter home,” said Rick Palacios Jr., director of research at John Burns Research and Consulting. “I think that’s a big part of why you see the resale market in a recession.” Palacios’s firm has found factors like rising homeowners insurance premiums explain much of the growing gap. Higher mortgage rates don’t help either. Leaving other factors constant, it would take mortgage rates to be at 3.5% for the buying versus renting math to return to historical averages.

On Wednesday, Federal Reserve governor Michelle Bowman expressed concern that the Fed’s progress toward 2% inflation has “stalled” and the central bank should proceed "cautiously" when lowering interest rates. Bowman was the lone official to dissent when the Fed slashed the rate by half a percentage point, saying then that the Fed should've cut interest rates by 25 basis points instead of 50. On Wednesday, she argued there are "greater risks to the price stability side of our mandate, especially while the labor market remains near full employment." "We have seen considerable progress in lowering inflation since early 2023, but progress seems to have stalled in recent months," Bowman said in a speech at the Forum Club of the Palm Beaches. To Bowman's point, last week the "core" Consumer Price Index (CPI), which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, showed prices increased 3.3% annually for the third consecutive month during October. Recent data has increased debate over whether or not the Fed will cut rates in December. As of Wednesday afternoon, markets are pricing in a roughly 56% chance the Fed cuts rates in December, down from a more than 82% chance seen last week, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has soared about 40% since Donald Trump won the presidential election to trade above $94,000 per coin for the first time on Wednesday. On Wednesday, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz told Yahoo Finance why the market has been betting the new administration will be more pro cryptocurrency. "All the guys around the table like our space," Novogratz said. "They believe in the digital asset world. They believe in blockchains and bitcoin. And so the whole energy of this administration is going to be so different than the Elizabeth Warren, Gary Gensler era." Novogratz added that he expects an administration that's more supportive of crypto will help US crypto business operate without the "fear of litigation." And for company's like Novogratz's it could help cut down on costs too. "Our audit at Galaxy cost three times what it would if we were a non-crypto company," Novogratz said. "So we're spending $9 million a year on an audit for a medium-sized company. That's insane. So the tax on crypto has been brutal. That is going to come way down. People aren't going to fear ... they're constantly getting a Wells notice." Brutal day for Target (TGT) after earnings. Here are three problems I saw in the quarter. I wasn't the only one spotting these things, of course. The Citi research team swooping in with a midday downgrade on Target (a late one at that). "We are downgrading Target from buy to neutral. Though 3Q may have had some unique challenges, we believe very poor results at Target in 3Q (and an uninspiring outlook for 4Q) show Target is likely losing share to Walmart (WMT). With Walmart's market share gains coming largely from higher income consumers (as they called out yesterday), Target seems to be the one most at risk of losing additional share. We believe Target is likely to need to be more promotional to drive traffic/sales, which we believe makes fiscal year 2025 much more uncertain, especially because in 3Q Target did not show an ability to adjust SG&A to offset the sales/gross margin weakness," said Citi analyst Paul Lejuez. Bottom line: It's going to take Target several quarters to regain investor trust. It could begin to do that by delivering on its severely lowered holiday quarter guidance. Walmart (WMT) and Lowe's (LOW) are the latest American retailers to warn that product costs could rise if President-elect Donald Trump makes good on his tariff promises — which include 10% to 20% tariffs across the board and a 60% tariff on goods from China. Walmart CFO John David Rainey hinted in an interview with Yahoo Finance’s Brian Sozzi on Tuesday that Trump’s tariff promises would prompt the retailer to hike costs, pointing to the impact of higher tariffs enacted during the president-elect's first term under his “America First” agenda. “If we look back historically when tariffs were enacted seven years ago, it did result in higher prices for customers,” Rainey said. Lowe's echoed the sentiment. “Roughly 40% of our cost of goods sold are sourced outside of the US, and that includes both direct imports and national brands through our vendor partners,” said CFO Brandon Sink in a call with investors on Tuesday. “And as we look at potential impact, certainly would add product costs, but timing and details remain uncertain at this point.” Read the full story here. Nvidia (NVDA) is set to report earnings on Wednesday after the bell. Expectations — as they have been for more than a year now — are monstrous. Nvidia is expected to report Q3 earnings per share of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Both metrics would mark a more than 80% increase compared to the same quarter a year ago. Nvidia has been consistently surpassing analyst estimates every quarter since OpenAI launched ChatGPT in November 2022. The AI chip leader's stock reaction has been more mixed in the day following earnings announcements as expectations have grown lofty, but it hasn't fallen two quarters in a row on the day following its earnings release since the middle of 2021. That could change during Thursday's trading day if Nvidia has a repeat of last quarter when the company's upbeat outlook wasn't enough to impress investors and the stock fell more than 6%. "The company hasn’t had a negative price reaction in back to back post earnings release days since [the first quarter of 2021], when GenAI wasn’t a phrase in investors’ dictionary," Julian Emanuel, who leads the equity, derivatives, and quantitative strategy team at Evercore ISI, wrote in a note to clients on Sunday. "A positive reaction following the 11/20 release, following the negative move last quarter, could help cushion the S&P 500’s decline somewhat near term but is more likely to refocus investors on the long term story." Target (TGT) stock tanked in early trading on Wednesday, falling more than 20% after the retail giant slashed its full-year guidance and missed Wall Street's estimates for both earnings per share and revenue in its third quarter. Before the bell, Target said it now expects full-year earnings per share in a range of $8.30 to $8.90, below its prior range of $9.00 to $9.70. The new guidance also came in well below the $9.61 earnings per share that Wall Street had expected. The retailer also took a cautious stance on prospects for the holiday shopping season. Read more on Target's quarter from Yahoo Finance Executive editor Brian Sozzi here. US stocks wavered on Wednesday ahead of Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings, seen as a crucial litmus test for the AI trade that could set the direction of markets for days to come. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was up about 0.2%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) hugged the flat line. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped about 0.2%, following a mixed day on Wall Street on Tuesday. After surging on Tuesday amid increased optimism surrounding the stock ahead of earnings, Nvidia shares slid more than 1% in early trade. Comcast (CMCSA) is looking to play offense in the ever-evolving media landscape. On Wednesday, the company said that it will spin off most of its cable networks into a new publicly traded company called SpinCo. The stock jumped as much as 3.5% in premarket trading before paring those gains. The new venture will house the majority of NBCUniversal’s cable television networks, including USA Network, CNBC, MSNBC, Oxygen, E!, SYFY, and Golf Channel. Those networks collectively generated about $7 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, Comcast said in its announcement. Comcast's Peacock streaming service and the NBC broadcast network will remain under the parent company. “This transaction positions both SpinCo and NBCUniversal to play offense in a changing media landscape,” said Comcast president Mike Cavanagh.

Target posted its biggest earnings miss in two years and cut its forecast. The company spoke about a "deceleration in discretionary demand" and blamed higher costs caused by the rush to move inventory ahead of the short-lived port strike in October. On the company's earnings call, CEO Brian Cornell described U.S. consumers who are "shopping carefully as they work to overcome the cumulative impact of multiple years of price inflation" and holding out for the best possible deal. Walmart, on the other hand, hiked its full-year forecast. It said it's gaining upper-income shoppers and seeing better trends for sales of merchandise outside of the grocery department, even as consumers look for value. Customer traffic gains were similar at the two stores, yet Walmart's sales trends looked much better than Target's. Walmart's traffic growth edged out its rival's, with a gain of 3.1% at Walmart U.S. versus 2.4% at Target. Walmart's same-store sales rose 5.3%, while Target's increased only 0.3% year over year. Walmart's e-commerce sales in the U.S. rose 22%, a bigger increase than the nearly 11% at Target. The sharp differences between the two big-box retailers — and how their businesses are executing in the same economic backdrop — illustrate where consumers are willing to spend money and where they are pulling back as they remain selective about spending. That sharp divergence of the winners and losers in the industry could become even starker as retailers enter their most crucial sales season of the year. Michael Baker, a retail analyst at D.A. Davidson, said Target's disappointing results reflect the company's performance rather than the health of consumers. "It's as simple as this: They are losing share," Baker said. "They are losing share to Walmart, Amazon and Costco." He said Target's inconsistent results over the past year are a warning sign about execution. The company has missed Wall Street's quarterly sales and earnings expectations in two quarters and beat on them in two other quarters. "That kind of back and forth makes you wonder if there's something going on internally," he said. Several equity research analysts, including Citi Research, Deutsche Bank and HSBC Global Research, downgraded Target's stock Wednesday, citing concerns that the Minneapolis-based retailer has lost shoppers and sales to competitors. Its stock dropped more than 20% in trading Wednesday. In a research note, Paul Lejuez, a retail analyst for Citi, said the company's poor results and weak outlook show Target is "likely losing share" to Walmart and risks losing more of the market unless it steps up promotions. One of the roots of Target's troubles is the company's merchandise mix, said Kate McShane, a retail analyst for Goldman Sachs. About 60% of Target's sales come from discretionary items, such as home goods and clothing. That's the opposite of Walmart, which draws about 60% of its sales from everyday necessities, such as groceries and household items such as paper towels. Those discretionary categories, which customers sometimes splurge or pull back on, explain "some of the volatility and the bumpiness you are seeing that is more specific to Target," she said. Both Walmart and Target mentioned the negative impact of the port strike, but Target appeared to put a major share of the blame for its weak quarter on the stoppage. D.A. Davidson's Baker said weak sales can "make those kinds of cost increases stand out more." Target has other questions that will factor into its future, including who will lead the company. Cornell, who has been chief executive since 2014, agreed in September 2022 to stay on as the company's leader for three more years. On a call with investors Wednesday, Cornell pointed to "green shoots" in the business, even as sales results disappointed. He spoke about customer traffic growth, online sales gains and relative strength in apparel sales, even as unseasonably warm weather kept shoppers from buying clothes for cooler temperatures. Yet on that same call, several analysts posed questions about Target's plans for the future. UBS equity research analyst Michael Lasser asked if Target needs to make changes or invest more in its business. Cornell said the company will stick with what it already does: offering unique items and national brands, opening new stores, expanding its advertising business and offering more ways for shoppers to buy online. "We'll continue on our current strategy, stay in step with the consumer and make sure Target's doing the things that consumers across America expect from us," he said. Got a confidential news tip?

Title: ‘Bud Light 2.0:’ Jaguar Blasted for Ad Featuring Crossdressers but Not Cars

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/20/2024 12:23:51 PM PST by Morgana Jaguar is being blasted on social media for its ultra-woke commercial featuring androgynous models and not even a single car, with conservatives dubbing the ad “Bud Light 2.0.” The Jaguar commercial, which was posted to the car company’s social media on Tuesday, showed only androgynous individuals clad in bizarre attire that would hardly fit in at a fashion show. The advertisement also failed to showcase even one single vehicle from the luxury car company. The Jaguar ad also featured what appears to be a man wearing a dress, and included messaging that read, “create exuberant,” “live vivid,” “delete ordinary,” and “break moulds.” One social media user reacted to the commercial, declaring, “10 [years] ago: Jags are badass muscle cars for villains. Today: Yass queen gay race communism.” “This is so the wrong timing for this. I can understand the C-suite being conned into this in 2022, but they have completely misread the moment. Bud Light 2.0,” columnist Jon Gabriel wrote. Gabriel was likely referring to President-elect Donald Trump’s landslide victory — that included winning the popular vote — in the 2024 election, which many took as a message from the American people that the era of “wokeness” needs to end. “This is the new head of brand strategy at Jaguar. Not looking good for them at all,” another X user remarked. (Excerpt) Read more at breitbart.com ...

The advertisement also failed to showcase even one single vehicle from the luxury car company.

Title: Investors want to see a 'bullish' Nvidia in its earnings, analyst says

Time Published: 2024-11-20T20:11:46Z
Full Content:
After reporting record earnings for its fiscal second quarter on Aug. 30, Nvidia’s (NVDA+0.59%) shares tumbled after investors were left unimpressed by its guidance for the fiscal third quarter. With Nvidia’s fiscal third quarter results coming imminently, those expectations are still “incredibly high,” Daniel Newman, chief executive of The Futurum Group, told Quartz. “We know from the last quarter what happens if they are too conservative,” Newman said. “People want to see it be bullish.” Nvidia is still in the cycle where expectations are palpable and meeting expectations is not enough — investors want to hear a beat, Newman said. The chipmaker is expected to set fiscal fourth quarter guidance at $37.09 billion, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS+2.46%). “To support the stock on earnings day,” Nvidia will have to report fiscal fourth quarter guidance of at least $38 billion, John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, said in comments shared with Quartz. Investors are also expecting updates on Blackwell, both Belton and Newman said, separately, amid reports that the highly-anticipated artificial intelligence chips are overheating when connected on custom-designed server racks that combine 72 of the company’s GPUs, or graphics processing units. However, Dell (DELL+3.78%) said it has started shipping Nvidia’s GB200 NVL72 server racks, and Microsoft (MSFT-0.42%) announced a private preview of the Blackwell AI infrastructure on its Azure cloud computing platform. Blackwell experienced production and shipping delays earlier this year due to a design flaw that was fixed, Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said in October, after media reports about the issue surfaced in August. Before Huang addressed the design flaw, Nvidia’s shares got a boost after he said Blackwell was in full production and demand for the chip was “insane.” “People want confirmation on Blackwell and margin integrity,” Newman said, adding that Blackwell revenue will come into play during the next earnings cycle. “People want to see how much enthusiasm there is,” and if the numbers can provide a positive outlook that the market wants to hear. Nvidia has already announced its next-generation AI chip platform, Rubin, which will come after Blackwell in 2026. The Rubin platform will include new GPUs and a new central processing unit (CPU) called Vera, as well as advanced networking chips. During the company’s fiscal first-quarter earnings call, Huang said the chipmaker is “on a one-year rhythm” with producing new chips. Investors will want to hear Nvidia’s roadmap for Rubin and if it can sustain its annual cycle, as well as whether its small but mighty customer base can continue buying at a fast rate while delivering returns, Newman said. Additionally, investors will be interested in Nvidia’s ability to keep its 92% share of the data center GPU market, including its plans to maintain pricing power and growth on the path to a $4 trillion valuation. Meanwhile, “Nvidia’s foray into the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space is a positive,” Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, said in comments shared with Quartz. “Notably, Nvidia’s focus on incorporating AI into the cockpit for infotainment systems is allowing it to grow its autonomous driving revenues.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

As NVIDIA Corp prepares to release its highly anticipated earnings report Wednesday evening, investors are watching closely for the potential ripple effects on the broader market—and particularly on peer stocks like Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO). What To Know: Nvidia's dominance in AI-driven technology and its pivotal role in the S&P 500's performance make its results a market-moving event, with implications for key players in the semiconductor industry. Broadcom, like Nvidia, has leveraged the surging demand for AI infrastructure. It supplies high-performance networking chips and custom silicon that power data centers—critical components for Nvidia’s AI-focused operations. Don’t Miss: Warren Buffett once said, "If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die." These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100. A strong earnings beat from Nvidia could reinforce investor confidence in AI growth prospects, lifting sentiment around Broadcom as a beneficiary of the same demand drivers. Conversely, a disappointing Nvidia report could signal a slowdown in AI investments, weighing on Broadcom's outlook. Historically, Broadcom's stock has moved in tandem with Nvidia’s during major market reactions. Nvidia’s implied one-day move of 12.5% adds volatility to the semiconductor sector, underscoring the high stakes. By now you're likely curious about how to participate in the market for Broadcom – be it to purchase shares, or even attempt to bet against the company. Buying shares is typically done through a brokerage account. You can find a list of possible trading platforms here. Many will allow you to buy ‘fractional shares,' which allows you to own portions of stock without buying an entire share. For example, some stock, like Berkshire Hathaway, can cost thousands of dollars to own just one share. However, if you only want to invest a fraction of that, brokerages will allow you to do so. If you're looking to bet against a company, the process is more complex. You'll need access to an options trading platform, or a broker who will allow you to ‘go short' a share of stock by lending you the shares to sell. The process of shorting a stock can be found at this resource. Otherwise, if your broker allows you to trade options, you can either buy a put option, or sell a call option at a strike price above where shares are currently trading – either way it allows you to profit off of the share price decline. Check It Out: Arrived allows individuals to invest in shares of rental properties for as little as $100, providing the potential for monthly rental income and long-term appreciation without the hassles of being a landlord. With over $1 million in dividends paid out last quarter and a growing selection of properties across various markets, Arrived offers an attractive alternative for investors seeking to build a diversified real estate portfolio. In October 2024, Arrived sold The Centennial, achieving a total return of 34.7% (11.2% average annual returns) for investors. Arrived aims to continue delivering similar value across our portfolio through careful market selection, attentive property management, and thoughtful timing in sales.

Title: Nvidia and the rest of the Magnificent 7 create a risky scenario for the market, strategist says

Andrew Krei, co-chief investment officer at Crescent Grove Advisors, spoke with Quartz for the latest installment of our “Smart Investing” video series. Watch the interview above and check out the transcript below. The transcript of this conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity. ANDY MILLS (AM): Nvidia reports earnings on Wednesday after the bell. Sometimes even when they surpass expectations, the markets are unhappy, do they have to have blow out earnings for the markets to react positively? ANDREW KREI (AK): It speaks to the idea that whether you look at the valuation or the assumptions that go into Nvidia’s (NVDA) price are ultimately a high bar, right? The market is expecting that this AI growth theme continues for quite some period of time, that Nvidia continues to capture a large portion of market share, that their margins stay very healthy where they are now. And if there’s any sign that that story or that narrative is breaking in, in some way, shape, or form, then I think again, investors look at this with a very high bar. If Nvidia can’t exceed that bar, to your point, there’s disappointment around that. And I think it speaks to the broader AI theme as well. And some of the other companies that have been the poster children, the Magnificent Seven, those mega-cap tech names that have benefited from that narrative, just this idea that going forward, valuations are really demanding. Expectations are really demanding in terms of what investors are looking for around their execution on these themes. If they don’t meet those high bars going forward, they can’t exceed those, then that’s where you see the knee-jerk reaction of people selling off these stocks because that uncertainty starts to exist to a greater degree than where it has been before. AM: The majority of the growth in the indexes has been in the Mag Seven over the last couple of years. What risk does such market concentration pose? AK: I would say if you look historically at episodes where you have a significant amount of concentration at the top of markets, meaning the top 10 names or so, what they represent is a percentage of the aggregate market cap. Right now we’re in the 30% range, mid-thirties, something along those lines generally doesn’t end well, right? There’s just a huge amount of piling into these names that happens from investors that you create this momentum that begets buying, begets more buying, that sort of thing. Ultimately, when there is a reversal, of course, if the narrative does start to break, again, go back to the AI theme, right? If the execution isn’t absolutely spot on going forward, when you start to extrapolate the assumptions that are built into these stocks, that’s when you can start to see a wave of capital outflows from these names. And that’s again, historically speaking, what you’ve seen now are these businesses, they’re phenomenal businesses, right? I think it’s warranted the idea that their growth has exceeded the rest of the market and they’ve again, I think, been deserving of the status to be market leaders. When you look at the relative earnings growth over the last several years from our perspective and as we look forward and we think about investors, the basic portfolio management principles that we go to, we think about diversification and sort of this idea of how do you avoid some of those concentration risks. For us, it’s taken some chips off the table, rebalancing into other segments of the market that now the earnings growth picture starts to look a little bit more favorable. The expectations are coming down a little bit for earnings growth for the likes of Nvidia and Microsoft (MSFT). The Magnificent Seven and earnings growth potential is ticking up for the, let’s call it “S&P 493”, the non-Magnificent Seven names. I think gives us the specter of a potential convergence in performance going forward, if not an outright rotational opportunity for investors, relative value going from something really highly valued to something that’s more reasonably valued in the market with fundamentals now that, again, start to converge a little bit. So that to us is the way to play it. But again, it’s been deserved, I think for the Magnificent Seven to see the gains that they’ve seen. AM: So in the other, the S&P 493, are there any sectors or companies you’re looking at that investors should consider investing in? AK: How we kind of frame it up is there’s tech, there’s the Mag Seven, the mega cap tech names, and then everything else. So there’s that very, very high-level taxonomy for us, and I think we just want to be a little more focused on the everything else bucket over the next, you know, 12-plus months and thinking about that relative value, rotation opportunity. But even within that, I would say value segments of the market. So that can be things like industrials, materials can be even things like consumer staples, healthcare, just these sort of segments that have been a little bit left for dead in some respects over the last several years because their earnings have been kinda middling. The growth hasn’t quite been there to the same magnitude that the tech earnings growth has been. We just think, again, there’s an opportunity for capital to flow into those segments. In particular, if we look at that forward-looking picture for the new administration, if there is gonna be more fiscal stimulus, if there’s gonna be deregulation, financials a big piece of the value index. You look at these other segments that could benefit from this pro-cyclical type of growth backdrop that we could see going forward. And that to us represents a compelling proposition relative to, again, these tech names that have done so well and now trade at really demanding valuations.

Title: Will Microsoft Buy Bitcoin After Michael Saylor’s 3-Minute BTC Strategy Pitch To Board?
URL: https://zycrypto.com/will-microsoft-buy-bitcoin-after-michael-saylors-3-minute-btc-strategy-pitch-to-board/
Time Published: 2024-11-20T17:32:22Z

Bitcoin uber-bull and MicroStrategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor revealed that he agreed to present a Bitcoin investment strategy to Microsoft’s board of directors, advocating for the premier crypto as a treasury asset. Saylor sees a potential Microsoft Bitcoin investment as a game-changer for the tech giant, especially as Bitcoin inches closer to the highly coveted $100,000 zone. Speaking during a Tuesday X space discussion hosted by crypto ETF provider VanEck, Michael Saylor said he will be delivering a brief, three-minute presentation to Microsoft’s board. Saylor’s pitch comes amid a shareholder proposal calling for Microsoft to evaluate the potential impact of a Bitcoin investment. “The activist that put that proposal together contacted me to present to the board, and I agreed to provide a three-minute presentation— that’s all you’re allowed — and I’m going to present it to the board of directors,” Saylor said. The MicroStrategy founder, who is a devout Bitcoin evangelist, slammed companies with huge cash reserves for “burning shareholder value”, during yesterday’s discussion. Saylor, who has led MicroStrategy to become the world’s biggest corporate Bitcoin holder with 331,200 BTC (worth $31 billion based on today’s price), believes Bitcoin is a vital asset for corporations with huge hordes of cash. According to him, the benchmark crypto can add significant stability to enterprise value. “It would be a lot more stable stock and a much less risky if half of the enterprise value of the stock was based upon tangible assets or property like Bitcoin,” he explained. Saylor has publicly urged Microsoft to consider adding Bitcoin to its treasury. He thinks it can make “the next trillion dollars” for Microsoft shareholders. Meanwhile, Microsoft shareholders are scheduled to vote on Dec. 10 on whether the company should conduct a formal assessment of Bitcoin as an investment. Some prominent shareholders include major financial institutions like Vanguard Group, BlackRock, State Street, and Fidelity Management & Research. Despite the push from shareholders and Saylor’s advocacy, Microsoft’s board has recommended voting against the proposal, stating that they already assessed a wide range of investable assets, including Bitcoin. As of publication time, Bitcoin had traded for $94,218, reflecting a 1.8 percent gain on the day. Its market cap stood at $1.86 trillion.

Title: DeFi’s Renaissance

Time Published: 2024-11-20T16:16:32Z

Election 2024 coverage presented by The repercussions of historically stringent cryptocurrency oversight are well-documented, but the ensuing sea change is perhaps not fully appreciated. With pro-crypto legislators likely to replace the current regulatory regime, we anticipate a more favorable environment for crypto applications. Decentralized finance (DeFi), in particular, is well-positioned to reap these benefits. From opening the door for traditional finance (TradFi) to partake in DeFi, to enabling fee switches and U.S. user access to protocols, it’s hard to overstate the impacts for DeFi and stablecoins that can come with regulatory clarity. With DeFi TVL up 31% and the stablecoin market cap up 4% since the election, it’s clear that users share this sentiment. You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Historically, institutions have hesitated to move on-chain due to regulatory risks. However, with bitcoin ETF AUM inflows on track to surpass the gold ETFs’ AUM within a year, finance and tech companies exploring the technology and offering crypto products, and corporates adding digital assets to their balance sheets, institutional interest in crypto has never been higher. That said, the coexistence of off-chain and on-chain capital thus far has mainly involved using on-chain capital to capture off-chain yield (e.g., Tether purchasing billions of dollars in U.S. treasuries). With regulatory clarity, we are now in the early stages of off-chain capital moving on-chain. Post-election developments, like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton expanding their tokenized money funds to new chains, exemplify the substantial capital ready to enter DeFi and are likely just the tip of the iceberg. And beyond tokenization, Stripe recently acquired stablecoin startup Bridge, McDonald’s partnered with NFT project Doodles, and PayPal is using Ethereum and Solana to settle contracts. This streamlines asset management, enhances market efficiency and liquidity, improves financial inclusion, and ultimately accelerates economic growth. Regulatory clarity will add an accelerant to this already-burgeoning activity. Similarly, DeFi projects like Ethena and Blur are starting to adapt to the evolving environment as they anticipate improvements in regulatory clarity. A frequent criticism of altcoins is their lack of inherent utility. Addressing this, Ethena approved a proposal to allocate a portion of protocol revenue ($132 million annualized) to sENA holders, bridging the gap between revenue generation and token holders. Once executed, the proposal could increase participation and investment in Ethena by directly rewarding token holders, thus setting a potential precedent for revenue sharing in DeFi. This move might also encourage other protocols to consider similar mechanisms, enhancing the appeal of holding DeFi tokens. In addition, protocols may also enable US users to access front-ends and partake in airdrops, compared to the current default of restricting US users. At the same time, development and innovation should flourish, with founders more confident about the reduced risks of building in the U.S. By expanding token utility to benefit from protocol success, enabling access to fair and free on-chain services often without rent-seeking intermediaries, and removing barriers to innovation that have made this country so great, we may be on the brink of a new era for DeFi development and usage. Collectively, these factors indicate that DeFi may be on the brink of a new growth phase, potentially expanding beyond its crypto-native user base to interact more directly with broader financial systems. The DeFi renaissance is here. Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.

Title: Weight loss drug makers want more insurance plans to cover Wegovy and Zepbound
URL: https://qz.com/wegovy-zepbound-insurance-coverage-1851703905
Time Published: 2024-11-20T16:14:00Z
Full Content:
Weight-loss drug makers are directly targeting employers in a campaign to expand health insurance coverage of their popular, but pricey, medications. The Wall Street Journal reports that reps for both Novo Nordisk (NVO-2.50%), the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY-0.48%), which produces Zepbound and Mounjaro, are visiting labor unions and HR teams across the country to make the case for anti-obesity drugs. These treatments belong to the class of drugs known as GLP-1 medications, made popular by Novo Nordisk’s diabetes treatment Ozempic. The drugs mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar and have become highly sought after as treatments for obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Morgan Stanley (MS+2.48%) analysts anticipate the global market for these drugs will reach $105 billion by 2030, but that will hinge on patient access. However, insurance coverage for GLP-1 drugs for the specific use of weight loss varies by plan. Some insurance companies and employers have been reluctant to cover these treatments due to their steep costs, which can significantly inflate employers’ healthcare budgets and drive up premiums across the board. Without insurance, Wegovy is $1,349.02 for a month’s supply. Zepbound’s list price for most of its doses is $1,059.87 a month. Only about 65 million, or 25%, of Americans have a health insurance plan that covers these weight-loss drugs, according to data from consulting firm Leverage. The firm’s AXIACI Obesity Coverage Nexus database tracks the insurance coverage of weight-loss treatments of roughly 80% of Americans. The majority of GLP-1 weight-loss drug coverage comes from state Medicaid plans. Leverage estimates that Medicaid plans, which are government programs for low-income families, provide weight-loss drug coverage for 31.6 million people. Medicare only covers these treatments if they are prescribed to treat a second condition in addition to weight loss. When it comes to private or employer-sponsored plans, these only provide GLP-1 weight-loss drug coverage for 13.7 million people, according to the database. But because many employers don’t make the details of their plans public, Leverage estimates this number could be up to 24.4 million people. A recent survey revealed that only around 44% of U.S. employers with 500 or more employees offered coverage for weight-loss drugs in 2024. In response, drugmakers are emphasizing that addressing obesity and its related complications could lead to significant long-term savings in healthcare costs for employers. Both Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have been testing these medications to uncover any additional health benefits they might provide. This year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy for reducing heart risks like heart attacks and strokes. Eli Lilly is also seeking approval for Zepbound to treat sleep apnea. Additionally, numerous studies suggest these medications may help with a range of conditions — from treating addictions and Alzheimer’s disease to reducing the risk of COVID-19-related deaths.

Title: Pivoting in politics, tech, antitrust and economic growth | Gary Shapiro interview

Time Published: 2024-11-20T15:30:00Z

Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More Gary Shapiro, the CEO of the CTA, has seen tech change over decades. I talked to him about his latest views of politics, tech and economic growth. He was blunt in his responses, and that reminded me of the title of his new book on innovation, dubbed Pivot or Die: How Leaders Thrive When Everything Changes. I spoke with Shapiro a day before the U.S. presidential election. I asked him about politics and tech in one of my early questions. But he first went on to tell me about CES 2025, the big tech trade show in Las Vegas that will happen in early January. After all, that’s job one for Shapiro, who, as CEO of the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), has to make sure the massive trade show for technologists goes off without a hitch. We eventually circled back and talked about some political issues. He was particularly concerned about the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s “excessive” antitrust enforcement against the tech giants under the leadership of Democratic appointee Lina Khan. We also talked about the turbulent tech economy and how its been affected by the shadow of two major wars in the world. And we addressed the impact of AI on the tech industry. That led us to a discussion of the role of government in the tech industry, when it comes to both support and oversight. And I asked him about the chance we have for balanced growth — where revenues grow, AI gets accepted, and jobs grow too. Here’s an edited transcript of our interview. VentureBeat: It’s good to see you getting another book out. Gary Shapiro: It’s still relevant. We just had a meeting today, the day before the election and 60 days before CES. We talked about the pivots we had made previously in the last few years as an organization. Given the uncertainty of what’s going to happen tomorrow, given the economy and everything else, the only thing that’s certain–well, something will happen. VentureBeat: This is going to run after the election, but what are some of your thoughts that link what you have in the book to your views of politics and tech? Shapiro: The CES is an amazing, powerful tech event. I was looking back at what you had written last year about it, before and after. A lot of people go with a very full agenda, but we always say you have to have time for serendipity and discovery. We have a new look, a new feel. We focused the campaign on “Dive in.” We’re inviting attendees to do three things: connect, solve, and discover. “Connect,” in the technology world–we want people to get together, through B2B and B2C. The statistic we’ve used before is that the average attendee has about 29 meetings during the show. It’s an important business event. You get that face to face. About 75% of attendees say their business is primarily B2B, or both B2B and B2C. We struggle with the name. Some people call it the Consumer Electronics Show, but it’s just CES. There’s so much there that’s B2B. That’s one of the changes that occurs for people when they discover. Another theme of the show is not only to connect, but to solve. We talked about human security for all, our work with the United Nations focusing on the sustainable development goals, focusing on fundamental human security in areas like health care, finances, personal safety. We see that in all sorts of ways. Of course accessibility is another big thing. Even for me, attending the show in 2024, that was one of the biggest surprises and themes. I don’t think I even talked about that before the show – how many people were there looking out on behalf of the disability community, and how many companies were responding to that with all sorts of technology. We have a meeting of the disability community before the show. We had to cut off attendance because there wasn’t enough room. Discovery or serendipity is the third theme, the trends we see. Some of it is a continuation, but some of it is new. Obviously AI is still a big thing. It pervades almost every category. Digital health is also very big. Mobility is huge with electric vehicles and connected cars, autonomy, sustainability. We’ve done our own pivots as well. The concept of electricity being available is not something we’ve talked about at CES before. Now we have a whole conference track on it. With electric cars, generative AI, and quantum, they all use tremendous amounts of electricity that we’re not prepared for. Not surprising to me, a number of companies in the last month have announced deals with nuclear power plants and things like that, which is totally new, but it’s a way of dealing with it. We’ll have that. We’ll have exhibitors focusing on energy savings on the supply side, heat reduction, local production. We’ll also have panels talking about how we can look at the electric grid. Similarly to that vein, we’ll have a shift that we haven’t had before to quantum computing. We have a half day of programming on that. While AI and generative AI is currently the thing, now generative AI doesn’t get you to the finish line with a lot of things, for example in health care. It’s a whole shift upwards in computing that we haven’t had in a long time. The other great thing about CES, we have the most powerful group of keynotes we’ve ever had. You heard about Delta earlier this week. We’ll continue to announce more. This is our first keynote in the Sphere, Ed Bastian. Delta is celebrating its 100th anniversary. Their shift to becoming a technology company is centered around CES. In mobility we also have the Volvo Group. We have a first-time exhibitor, OshKosh. You may only know them from kids’ clothing, but they also have a huge business where they dominate in fire trucks, ambulances, and emergency vehicles. They want to show what they can do against some of the other mobility companies. And how could I not mention Nvidia? This is Jensen Huang’s third time keynoting. It’s a big shift from the last time. I’ve known Jensen for a very long time. I’m sure you’ve known him longer. It’s the hottest company there is right now. VentureBeat: At one point it was one of 80 graphics chip companies. Shapiro: I wish I’d bought their stock, but hey. And we have many other new exhibitors. Foxconn, Komatsu, Scout Motors. I think the number I heard at our staff meeting today is at least 400 new companies. VentureBeat: How do you feel about how the tech companies feel right now as far as the strength of the tech economy? It feels to me like some elements are very out of sync with each other. The AI boom is happening for a lot of the tech industry, but the game industry is coming off 30 months of layoffs. It’s fairly weak. Hollywood feels like it’s also been on the ropes in many ways. These things that used to be so tied together feel like they’re on different economic cycles. Shapiro: Certainly there’s economic uncertainty. If you think about it, COVID was devastating to the economy, but good for the tech industry. It forced people to stay home and play games and watch movies and build home offices and invest in all these things. People invested in their homes. Then we had the government fueling a tremendous amount of cash into the economy. Every time I’m trying to drive around the Detroit area, there’s construction projects on top of construction projects. Obviously they don’t talk to each other, so it takes a long time to drive anywhere. What’s obviously also changed in the last couple of years, we’ve had a couple of major wars going on. There’s a lot of uncertainty right now. The economic uncertainty sometimes builds on itself until we talk ourselves into a recession. The tech industry is positive and promising a better future, better solutions. Certainly there’s a dislocation going on with the skills that are needed. Because of generative AI, a lot of companies are trying to hire people who know how to deal with generative AI and try to make them more efficient. Some of the people who were really hot a few years ago, software people, are less so. In the free market economy there’s some dislocation going on. In the long run it’ll work out for the better of everyone, but in the short there are some personally painful situations. Anyone who’s running an organization, the last thing you want to do is lay off people. But it’s the reality. The other thing that’s going on, and we’ll know in a week or two whether it will continue–the federal government, the Federal Trade Commission, has been pretty tough on tech. The chairman of the FTC literally wrote her thesis that made her famous about why Amazon is so terrible. She believes big companies should not acquire small companies. That isn’t something that’s been pervasive. The positive thing is, a lot of tech people supporting the Democrats and Harris, those same tech people are saying that she’s gotta go. Not all of them, but a lot of them. On the Republican side, obviously–I could get into the details a lot on this issue. JD Vance has said he kind of likes her. Who knows what Donald Trump thinks? It’s unlikely he would keep a Democratic chairman of the FTC, especially because she rules like such an authoritarian. Changed the antitrust standards. Literally, there’s a report that just came out Wednesday or Thursday last week from the House oversight committee laying out in very clear detail what happened with Amazon and iRobot and others, how they’ve gone to Europe and tried to stop American companies and gotten fines put on them. Also, internal emails showing that they intentionally tried to keep large companies from buying small companies. Not just through the lawsuits, which is the tangible side. They’ve lost almost every one of them at the FTC. But just the threats. Acquisition activity has gone down, and therefore startup activity has gone down, because startup investors don’t see the exits they used to see. That adds to an uncertain economy. There’s a different level of investment. VentureBeat: I see part of this playing out in a different way on my level. Epic Games has been at war with Apple over antitrust issues for quite a while now. The platform companies extract their fees. They hold the most power in the industry. They’re the biggest companies. The developer companies are underneath paying these 30% fees. Is that holding back growth from happening? Those big companies are getting bigger. Apple is getting bigger. But the developers of those technologies can’t necessarily move on to the next generation if they’re paying 30% of the top line to platform companies. But it’s not a black and white issue. Shapiro: There are two issues there. One is, what is the federal government’s role? I would maintain that it’s been overly aggressive, anti-American, anti-big tech, expressly so. It’s not only the U.S. It’s a global situation. For the most part our companies dominate the world. There’s a legitimate question about the role of the federal government. Plus they’ve changed the standard, which President Carter put into place almost 50 years ago, which is what’s best for consumers, not what’s best to protect existing competitors. Those are big changes. I believe they’ve been very unhealthy for tech and the U.S. economy in general. On the other hand, there are private lawsuits, which is what you’re talking about. We’ve stayed out of that. I would agree with you that there are arguments on both sides. On the one hand, you can take each of the platforms and say they’ve enabled X hundreds of thousands, or even millions of new businesses to do business on their platforms. Before this technology revolution they wouldn’t even exist. It’s not just one platform. There are several. They keep coming alive. Everyone thinks that once they have this exclusive hold–the history of technology has shown that it’s hard to come up with a platform that survives for more than 20 or 30 years. They seem to be eclipsed. If you look at the different search engines and the different selling platforms that come along–to me that’s something for the courts to work out on the basis of those private lawsuits, whether you’ve taken advantage of something in a way that’s wrong or unfair. But companies do have a right to do business and try to grow. We have a right to know what the law is. In some cases Congress hasn’t done their job. They sometimes come up with a compromise that’s intentionally ambiguous. What has changed, and radically so, is that the Supreme Court came out with a case several months ago saying the agencies can’t do anything other than what Congress says they can do. They can’t fill the gaps. That’s already created a huge number of lawsuits challenging regulations and government action. In the private antitrust area–these antitrust lawsuits are expensive on both sides. I have mixed feelings. I started out as an antitrust lawyer. I have a lot of experience in this area and I follow it closely. In the U.S. there are litigation costs that no one else has. Both sides pay a lot for antitrust lawsuits. There are treble damages. It’s very unusual. I just wish there was a better way of creating legal certainty. At CES, we have the best thing for competition in the world. Trade shows are great because you get to see all the competitors lined up. We’re seeing it play out in so many areas. We see it in electric vehicles. I was reading a Wall Street Journal story about the Latin American market for electric vehicles, because the U.S. and Europe are shutting them out. Competition is an amazing thing. It drives down prices for consumers. VentureBeat: A good question is, what’s going to be the way to something like an open metaverse? How can you ensure that it will be open and accessible so that we get the best of all economies that come from it? Shapiro: Things have a way of working themselves out. If you make something too closed it doesn’t work. That goes all the way back to VHS and Beta. Sony had the better technology by almost every definition, but Matsushita was smart enough to license out theirs to everyone. VentureBeat: Or America Online. Shapiro: Right, and all the systems before and after that. I hear you. If you don’t allow returns on investment for the companies that are there first, you don’t get investment. The bottom line is, we have to create a system if we want to be a winning country. You have to be willing to change your response to circumstances. Many of these companies are going through a rough patch, but they have to pivot. COVID allowed every company to pivot in a way they’d never done before. That was to the benefit of tech as well. What I talk about a lot in the book a lot is, who can pivot quicker? A big company or a small one? The truth is, a small company can pivot quicker by far. They can adjust. That’s why big companies like to acquire them. A big company has the capital and the infrastructure, but they’re always protecting their existing moneymakers. VentureBeat: You mentioned that a lot of companies pivoted during the pandemic. Do you feel like this is a time for pivoting again, for any particular reason, in the post-COVID era? Do companies have to change one more time? Shapiro: What’s changed since COVID is that–certainly we focus on our health. That will always be important. Tech provides a lot of solutions there. That’s why generative AI and health tech and telemedicine and all these things are so important. We have–again, talking very specifically about this moment in time, where we have what feels like an equally divided election, where all three bodies of government are equally up for grabs, where we have an economy that’s so uncertain. The Fed lowered interest rates by half a point and there was no response. The long-term yield hasn’t changed, which is unprecedented. They’re meeting the day after the election as we’re talking about another quarter point. At the same time inflation seems to feel high, although the numbers don’t indicate it. Consumers are whiplashed. The university system, the educational system is under dramatic change. There’s a lot of pressure to cause a lot of change very quickly. We have two pretty significant wars that are going on that are very new. VentureBeat: We still don’t know what the true effect of AI is going to be. Shapiro: We’ve seen already that generative AI is having positive effects, a lot of efficiency and improved competence. We’re seeing promise in health care very quickly. I’m an optimist. I think it’s going to be great. I think we’re going to solve fundamental problems. That’s what CES is about, solving these problems. Generative will be there. But that also comes with new problems. When we focus on efficiency we get a lot of things. We get the products the Department of Energy certifies as Energy Star compliant from us, from our companies. But that was the products themselves. I don’t think we focused on the energy business the way we do now. If you look at the numbers, the numbers don’t lie. If generative AI truly does take off, that’s a lot of energy. The same with electric cars. Energy has to come from somewhere. The same with quantum. This is definitely a transformational period in our technological history. There are new challenges. With all these new challenges, you have to pivot. What I talk about in the book, there are certain things that force pivots. We had COVID. We have to change quickly in response to external forces. Or what Microsoft just did with the nuclear power plant. There are startup pivots, where you get new opportunities, new equipment. That’s where startups are at. Then there are failure pivots, where you know your business is going down, and if you don’t succeed, you try again. VentureBeat: The media business is front and center for that one. Shapiro: It is. I just saw the headline today. Marc Benioff is looking at selling Time. I was wondering what value it had. A lot of tech moguls bought media properties. Jeff Bezos was in the news this week because of the Washington Post [he had killed an editorial endorsing Kamala Harris]. There’s a lot of stuff going on. It seems like you’ve figured it out. You write more words than anyone I know. VentureBeat: The interesting thing to me is that some people feel like tech and government, tech and politics, have always been different topics, not tied together so much. But I remember this one program way back. George Gilder was talking about how tech companies bring themselves up by their bootstraps and get things done, and they’re so much more efficient than anything related to the government. And then Andy Grove was in the same session, and he said, you know, does it give you no pause that all of us, all the chip companies were born because of the space program? It was an interesting moment to hear that government and technology have gone hand in hand over many years. Shapiro: They have. If you look back to developments in telecommunications, a lot of it is government procurement. They’re the biggest customer. On the other hand the government can also slow it down. Look what they did with AT&T. Look what they did with Microsoft. They spent years killing it off just on the basis of the search engine, which makes no sense. A lot of the government actions against the big tech companies prove to be irrelevant, but they do distract the companies and their senior leadership in a big way. Generative AI is one area where China has definite advantages over the free market system, given the lack of focus on privacy and their strategic focus on it. There’s more of an international competition going on in a non-war environment than any other time. When the government has gotten its act together in the U.S., it’s been World War II and other things. That’s when technology worked well with the government. Right now, is technology working well with the government? I’m not sure. I don’t know if I have a good answer. In some ways, yes. AI is one area. Generative AI is one area where the government, the federal government at least, has taken a very reasonable approach. It started with Trump and continued with Biden. The only challenge is, just as with self-driving cars, Congress has been rather slow to react. Congress, especially the Senate side, they’ve really engaged in some listening, and they recognize that premature action is probably going to be less helpful than anything. But I don’t think the private sector is looking to the government on generative AI for anything other than guardrails. We say, because we believe in this as an organization–the mistake that Europe has made on AI is they made it so difficult and expensive for any startup to get involved. That’s not healthy. We don’t want to be like Europe. Going forward, we’ll know by January which direction we’ll be going in terms of government. VentureBeat: One thing I hope, and I wonder whether you agree–eventually we’ll get to balanced growth, which to me would mean revenues for the industries all keep growing. Jobs also stabilize and keep growing. People hire a lot of people. And we embrace new technology like AI. We don’t get these things out of sync – AI advances and all of a sudden jobs disappear. That’s not what we want. Or revenue grows but no hiring happens. If they could all synchronize and be together – people accept new technology, people get jobs, and revenues grow for companies. Shapiro: What I’ve learned in my career is that you never get to perfect, but you just try to do better than you did last year. The definition of perfect changes. I don’t think, in a free market economy, that perfect is where everyone gets to keep their jobs. You have to learn new skills. There is another theory out there, though, which is that it will add more free time, and that will generate its own economic growth. My wife goes to a lot of medical conferences, and there’s a generational difference between doctors in that the incoming doctors don’t want to work as hard. They want regular hours. They don’t want the lengthy hours. Today that’s a front page story in the Wall Street Journal. I’ve been talking about this for two years now. It’s true, and I know this because I’ve talked to enough doctors in different fields about it. People want time now. It probably predated COVID. People value experience and time. That’s what it is. There are two theories. One is the one you mentioned. I don’t want to call it old school, but it’s based on traditional economics. Economic growth can solve big problems with debt. Economic growth can lift up everyone. Economic growth should not cost jobs. And the way you do that is you get people trained differently and quickly. That’s one thing Trump did a lot of. He doesn’t get credit for it, but the whole white collar apprentice concept of hiring people and training. That’s one thing he was personally focused on with his daughter Ivanka. I worked with them a lot on that. They had major strides. The Biden people kept it up. But guaranteeing employment, making it more difficult to fire people, putting European restrictions on letting people go and how much you have to pay them–we’ve already seen some of that. You can’t have non-disclosure agreements. You have to disclose salaries. You can’t ask people what they’ve been paid. You can’t do all these things. That’s a shift toward a more European way. But there is that third way, where people start talking about guaranteed income, basic income and things like that. Studies have shown that it doesn’t really work very well, because then people don’t work. If nothing happens then they’re not necessarily happy. My belief in life is that people are happy if they’re productive, if they have some type of job or volunteering where they do something good. A lot of these discussions will occur. I don’t think it’s next year’s issue. Several years ahead, I think you’re right. People will talk about it. I’ve been in the room with President Trump where he’s in with companies committing to how many people they will train and hire. They make commitments. First there was no follow-through. We didn’t make that commitment, because we’re an association. A lot of our members made commitments, but you can’t make commitments like that because the economy is so volatile. It’s very difficult. It was an interesting time. Trump tried to establish himself as a president for the working class. If he’s elected again, I’m pretty sure he’s not going to go back there. He’ll talk about AI in that way. But I also think Harris will talk about AI in that way if she’s elected. We’ll see. The federal government is imposing rules. The question is whether they’ll put up the type of strictures that have made Europe very non-competitive, non-innovative, and non-productive. The number one export from Europe is now regulation.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Reuters) - Eli Lilly (LLY) and Hong Kong-listed Laekna (2105.HK) will collaborate to develop an experimental obesity drug that aims to help patients lose weight while preserving muscle, the biotech said on Wednesday. Why it matters Lilly is aiming to strengthen its position as a leader in the obesity treatment market, which is expected to hit $150 billion in revenue by the next decade. Last year, the company spent about $2 billion to acquire Versanis' drug that acts directly on fat cells, without prompting lean mass loss. Several other drugmakers including Regeneron and Scholar Rock are testing treatments that could help preserve muscle, which is often lost when patients lose weight through lifestyle changes, bariatric surgery or the use of GLP-1 treatments such as Lilly's Zepbound and Novo Nordisk (NVO)'s Wegovy. Context The collaboration will accelerate the development of Laekna's experimental drug, LAE102, which belongs to a class of drugs that play a key role in muscle regeneration as well as the breakdown and storage of fat for energy. Lilly will fund the development of the drug and share its resources and expertise, but Laekna will retain the global rights for the drug and plans to advance the early-stage trial of the drug in China. Laekna said the drug has shown to increase lean mass and decrease fat mass in lab studies. In combination with a GLP-1 treatment, it could further reduce fat mass and help patients significantly regain the lean mass lost during weight loss.

Title: U.S. Bitcoin reserve draws mixed reactions: ‘The market is skeptical on…’

BTC hasn’t priced in the potential U.S. BTC reserve, according to Blockstream’s Adam Back. The crypto market is watching two key updates from Trump’s transition team: the treasury secretary pick and the creation of a national Bitcoin [BTC] reserve. The latter has been deemed a significant price driver for BTC, yet it has elicited mixed views from top asset managers in the sector. According to VanEck’s head of digital assets research, Mathew Siggel, the firm fully supports the proposal. Siggel stated, “VanEck endorses Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.” There have been mixed reports from BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager. Earlier in the week, reports suggested that the firm supported the Bitcoin reserve proposal. However, Fox Business’s Eleanor Terret discredited the earlier reports, citing people close sources close to BlackRock. She said, “Sources close to BlackRock tell FoxBusiness the big money manager is not endorsing a strategic $BTC reserve despite recent reports that it is.” That said, long-time BTC critic Peter Schiff recently claimed that the proposal could affect the U.S. dollar and BTC itself if approved. Part of Schiff’s reaction read, “Ultimately, so many dollars would be printed to buy Bitcoin that the U.S. would experience hyperinflation, rendering the dollar completely worthless. Once the dollar is worthless, the U.S. could no longer keep buying Bitcoin.” However, Senator Cynthia Lummis, one of the BTC reserve proponents, championed selling U.S. gold reserves for Bitcoin. The mixed views have made it difficult to gauge whether Trump will eventually create the BTC reserve. In fact, as of press time, Polymarket’s odds of President-elect Trump forming the reserve were below 40%. Source: Polymarket This could mean that a potential reserve wasn’t priced in, according to Blockstream’s Adam Back. Back projected that BTC could hit seven figures (+$1M) if players begin front-running the U.S. reserve. He said, “If the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve happens prepare for 7-figure bitcoin this cycle. The market is skeptical on meaningful follow-through for now, so that is not at all priced in.” That said, the next few days/weeks could offer more insight into whether President Trump will proceed with the proposal.

Title: Weight loss drug makers still have huge upside, and the market overreacted to RFK Jr. named to top health role, BMO says
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/weight-loss-drugs-stocks-rfk-trump-health-hhs-secretary-ozempic-2024-11
Time Published: 2024-11-20T14:41:12Z
Full Content:
Shares of pharmaceutical companies that produce popular weight loss drugs have tumbled since president-elect Donald Trump named Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, but analysts at BMO Capital Markets said this week that the selloff is overdone. Since Kennedy's nomination last Thursday, stocks like Wegovy and Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk and Zepbound maker Eli Lilly have lost 3% and 7%, respectively. Other weight loss drug stocks like Amgen and Structure Therapeutics, meanwhile, have fallen 5% and 13%. The selloffs "reflect more fear than real fundamental downside risk," the analysts argued in a note. They say Kennedy's role as the top health leader in the US comes with limited ability to actually change policy that would impact the pricing and availability of the drugs. As a result, there is likely little risk to the shares of companies like Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. "The head of HHS is typically a more administrative position," the analysts said. Kennedy has previously pledged to fight obesity with nutrition instead of GLP-1 drugs. In an interview with Fox News last month, he pointed to a bill that would make Ozempic available to overweight Americans, which would cost $3 trillion per year, he said. He suggested those funds would be better used for other initiatives. "If we spend about one-fifth of that giving good food, three meals a day to every man, woman, and child in our country, we can solve the obesity and diabetes epidemic overnight for a tiny fraction of the cost," he said. In reality, though, the health secretary has limited actual authority to influence either GLP-1 drug pricing or the passage of future bills like the Treat and Reduce Obesity Act, which expands Medicare coverage to cover weight loss drugs, the BMO analysts said. If a public health emergency was declared, the secretary could adjust Medicare reimbursement for some "Part B" drugs, but weight loss drugs fall under "Part D," the analysts say. "While RFK Jr. appears less optimistic on the use of incretins to curb the obesity crisis, he remains limited in his ability to influence either policy or pricing of obesity medications," the analysts said. As a result, weight loss drugs still have massive potential, the analysts said, pointing to Novo Nordisk's recent Wegovy launch in China, which has a largely untapped potential market of around 180 million obese adults. "Importantly, China's national healthcare will not cover Wegovy, and upcoming patent expiration may limit long-term sales in the geography, but we continue to highlight the significant size of patient population and prevalence of cash payment in China may be a tailwind that benefits Novo going forward," the analysts say. The analysts maintain their $156 price target for Novo Nordisk stock, implying 52% upside from current levels, as well as a price target of $1010 for Eli Lilly, a potential 38% rise. Kennedy's nomination also sparked a sell-off in health stocks more broadly, particularly among vaccine makers like Moderna, Pfizer, and GSK, as well as a range of European healthcare stocks with exposure to the US market. Kennedy has been a vocal skeptic of vaccines, once calling those that protect against COVID-19 a "crime against humanity." The sector's losses stand out from much of the rest of the market, which has rallied on the hopes that Trump's deregulatory policies and corporate tax cuts will boost profitability.

Title: Bitcoin ETF Options Redefine Crypto Markets with $2B Launch

We write helpful technology guides, unbiased product reviews, and report on the latest tech and crypto news. We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. QUICK HITS If you’re looking for an explanation for crypto’s astounding growth, look at these two factors: That second point was on full display over the past day, as a leading Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) provider – Blackrock – saw a record-breaking $2B trading volume with the launch of options trading on its ETFs. Now, other providers are hurrying to get in on the action. All that institutional support helped push $BTC to a new all-time high of $93.8K. Let’s see exactly what happened and why it’s such a big deal. The cryptocurrency market witnessed a transformative shift with the introduction of options trading for Bitcoin ETFs. The SEC approved options back in September for several providers. Blackrock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) was the first to launch options trading on Tuesday. It didn’t take long for the money to start flowing in – big time. On the very first day, the market saw an impressive $2B in trading volume, reflecting strong investor enthusiasm. The dominance of call options highlighted bullish sentiment, with many traders speculating on Bitcoin’s potential for significant price appreciation. Options on ETFs open new avenues for investors, heralding a significant moment in the evolution of Bitcoin’s market structure. Hot on the heels of BlackRock’s success, Grayscale announced plans to launch options for its Bitcoin ETF. Grayscale’s options were approved back in September, but BlackRock launched first. If Grayscale had any qualms about offering options, $1.9B and 289K call options probably went a long way toward settling them. By joining the options race, Grayscale aims to maintain competitiveness and capitalize on the burgeoning interest in Bitcoin ETF options. And as one of the largest players in the crypto investment space, Grayscale’s entry is set to further energize the ETF market. Going back to the top – Trump’s support for crypto, including a proposed new SEC chair, has set the stage for renewed investor confidence. Support for Trump’s $BTC reserve appears to be growing, and major companies like Microsoft seem open to the idea of their own $BTC holdings. And all along, professional traders and financial institutions continue to embrace the new trading instruments, using IBIT options to bet on dramatic price increases and leverage new ways of earning income from $BTC. Some are even targeting valuations as high as $100 for the ETF. Beyond speculation, the introduction of Bitcoin ETF options is expected to bring more liquidity to the market, offering new tools for hedging and investment strategies. The arrival of options trading for Bitcoin ETFs signifies a pivotal development for the cryptocurrency market. It reflects growing institutional adoption and provides a platform for sophisticated investment strategies. With major players like BlackRock and Grayscale driving innovation, the market dynamics of Bitcoin are poised for profound transformation. All eyes remain on how these financial products shape the future of Bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem. Get the latest updates, trends, and insights delivered straight to your fingertips.

Title: What Trump 2.0 means for tech and AI regulation
URL: https://www.nextgov.com/policy/2024/11/what-trump-20-means-tech-and-ai-regulation/401161/
Time Published: 2024-11-20T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
MIT professor Max Tegmark and Bloomberg tech columnist Parmy Olson discuss what AI policy might look like under the next Trump Administration at the 2024 Web Summit in Lisbon, Portugal. Camille Tuutti Stay Connected By Camille Tuutti A second Trump administration could reshape U.S. and global tech industries, with deregulation, artificial intelligence safety and Elon Musk’s growing influence at the forefront. These potential shifts were discussed at Lisbon’s Web Summit during the Nov. 12 session “A New Trump Era,” moderated by NPR CEO Katherine Maher. “Pod Save the People” host DeRay Mckesson and “West Wing” actor Richard Schiff explored how Trump’s second presidency might impact the tech world. Schiff began the session by comparing tech’s growing influence to that of the oil industry, highlighting its ability to drive policy and accumulate wealth. “I think Elon Musk has already doubled his wealth since last Tuesday,” he said. “And tech to me . . . might very likely be the new oil in that it's going to affect policy because the money is there and the power is there.” Schiff said he doubted the Trump administration would regulate tech or address monopolies, a stance he said benefits the industry but raises equity concerns. “The most important tech person in the world has now become the shadow vice president and, if not more, so I think the tech industry is going to get whatever they want,” he said, referring to Musk. “Are we going to stop monopolies? Probably not. Are we going to regulate? Probably not. Maybe that's great for tech, I don't know. I don't know how good it is for the world, the country.” Mckesson turned the conversation to Musk’s leadership, criticizing his tenure at X for making the platform more ideological, despite Musk’s claims to oppose such tendencies. He compared Musk’s polarizing approach to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s growing reputation as a more moderate leader. “[Zuckerberg] was a villain for so long in Silicon Valley,” Mckesson said. “Now, he's sort of the sane person left standing, it seems. So it'll be interesting to see what he does with WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook — these places that are in the ecosystem that is not Twitter.” Maher then shifted the discussion to AI, asking whether a stronger AI sector could bolster national security. Schiff offered a cultural perspective, suggesting that tough times often ignite creativity. “The silver lining, for me, might be that in authoritarian societies, the best art comes out of the more compressed artists feel, the more expression they end up having,” he said. “There's that darkness that there's light somewhere.” Musk’s role in the Trump administration At a Nov. 13 panel titled “Did Elon Musk Destroy Twitter?” panelists examined Musk’s leadership style and its implications as the proposed head of the Department of Government Efficiency. Kate Conger, a New York Times tech reporter, argued Musk’s drastic cost-cutting measures at X could serve as a blueprint for how he might address federal bureaucracy. “Musk's campaign to downsize Twitter is really a model for what he wants to do for the federal government, and in a lot of ways, it's empowered him to pursue this role,” she said. She pointed to Musk’s perceived success in maintaining X operations after massive layoffs that gutted 75% of the workforce. “Despite some small outages, it still has continued to run, and so he must feel very empowered by that and feels that he can make these deep cuts to the government and bureaucracy,” she said Ryan Mac, another New York Times tech reporter, brought up Musk’s potential conflicts of interest leading DOGE. Tesla and SpaceX, both of which rely on federal contracts, are under at least 20 federal investigations, according to NYT reporting, he said. As DOGE head, Musk could wield significant influence over the agencies regulating his companies, Mac added. “If there is a situation at the [Federal Aviation Administration], which oversees Tesla and SpaceX, could [Musk] have his finger on the scale to change what the FAA does?” Mac asked. “We just don't know. I think that potential is pretty scary.” AI policy and power concentration Trump has suggested rolling back President Joe Biden's 2023 executive order on AI, a move that could shutter the U.S. AI Safety Institute. Part of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the institute addresses risks to national security, public safety and individual rights. During the panel “Is AI the Answer or the Problem?” Bloomberg tech columnist Parmy Olson explored whether Musk’s outspoken concerns about AI risks might influence Trump to adopt stricter AI policies instead of loosening regulations to compete with China. She asked MIT professor Max Tegmark if Musk’s views could shape Trump’s approach to AI governance. “I hope so,” Tegmark said, stressing the need to educate leaders about AI’s dangers. “You don't actually need to persuade them that they shouldn't want to be replaced by and dominated by some new weird machine species. They are already against that. It's just a matter of education.” Tegmark expressed optimism that Musk could help Trump grasp the national security risks posed by uncontrolled AI and the economic importance of building safe, manageable AI. “I'm definitely hoping that Elon can help Donald Trump understand that this is just not in America's national security interests that American companies build something that we lose control over in two years, and that the real path to prosperity in America and even strength is to build AI tools that can be controlled,” he said. Olson also highlighted the growing concentration of AI power, pointing out how companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Google are snapping up smaller startups. Tegmark identified two major risks: the dominance of a few companies and humanity losing control over powerful AI systems. Despite these concerns, Tegmark ended on a hopeful note, highlighting AI’s potential to solve global challenges if developed responsibly. “With AI, there's so many things we would love to do but just haven't figured out how to do — prevent our loved ones from dying of diseases and safeguard our climate and so on and so forth,” he said. “And if we can get this right with tool AI, we can have a more amazing future than we ever dreamt of.” This year’s Web Summit attracted over 71,500 attendees from around the globe, according to a LinkedIn post by the event's organizers, including industry leaders, policymakers and innovators.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA) reported third quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday that topped expectations on the strength of sales of its high-powered AI chips fueling what its CEO Jensen Huang called the "age of AI." The world’s largest publicly traded company by market cap, Nvidia reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.81 on revenue of $35.1 billion. Analysts were anticipating EPS of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion. Nvidia also said it anticipates revenue of $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, for the fourth quarter. That's just ahead of Wall Street expectations of $37 billion. Nvidia's stock price fell roughly 3% in premarket trading on Thursday, as investors weighed the forecast. “The age of AI is in full steam, propelling a global shift to Nvidia computing,” Huang said in a statement. “Demand for Hopper and anticipation for Blackwell — in full production — are incredible as foundation model makers scale pretraining, post-training, and inference." The chip giant's Data Center business, which makes up the vast majority of its revenue, brought in $30.8 billion in the quarter, beating out analysts' expectations of $29 billion and jumping 112% versus the $14.5 billion the segment made in Q3 last year. Nvidia's gaming revenue came in at $3.3 billion, up from the $2.8 billion the division brought in last year. Analysts were looking for $3 billion. Nvidia's stock has continued to rocket higher throughout 2024, thanks to the explosive growth in AI across the tech landscape and beyond. Read more: Nvidia nearly triples in value over 11 months: Is it time to invest? Nvidia also appeared to assuage concerns about potential slowdowns in the availability of its next-generation Blackwell chip, with CFO Colette Kress saying that the AI GPU will begin shipping in the current quarter and ramp into the year ahead. "Both Hopper and Blackwell systems have certain supply constraints, and the demand for Blackwell is expected to exceed supply for several quarters in fiscal 2026," she added. Read more: How does Nvidia make money? Shares of Nvidia were up 192% year to date as of Wednesday, easily outpacing any of the company’s chipmaker rivals. AMD (AMD), the closest competitor, has seen its stock price sink over 5% year to date, while Intel (INTC), which is contending with a difficult turnaround, has seen its stock plunge nearly 52%. Nvidia is facing an uncertain future, given that Donald Trump has threatened to put blanket tariffs on products from around the world. In addition, the president-elect has raised the specter of tariffs on Taiwan-made chips. That would be a potential alternative to the CHIPS Act, which is designed to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US. The vast majority of Nvidia’s chips are built by TSMC in Taiwan. A tariff could mean that Nvidia will charge more for its AI chips, depressing margins, or pass the added cost on to its customers.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA) will report its third quarter earnings after the bell today, giving Wall Street its best and latest look into the strength of the artificial intelligence trade. The world’s largest publicly traded company by market cap, Nvidia’s stock price has continued to rocket higher throughout 2024, thanks to the explosive growth in AI across the tech landscape and beyond. Shares of Nvidia were up 196% year to date as of Wednesday, easily outpacing any of the company’s chipmaker rivals. AMD (AMD), the closest competitor, has seen its stock price sink over 5% year to date, while Intel (INTC), which is contending with a difficult turnaround, has seen its stock plunge nearly 52%. Nvidia is expected to report Q3 earnings per share (EPS) of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That works out to an 83% year-over-year increase on both the top and bottom lines versus the same period last year, when Nvidia saw EPS of $0.40 on revenue of $22.1 billion. Nvidia’s Data Center segment, its largest business, is set to bring in $29 billion for the quarter. That’s a 100% rise on the $14.5 billion reported in Q3 last year. Gaming revenue is expected to top out at $3 billion, up 7% from last year, when the segment brought in $2.8 billion. Analysts are anticipating gross margins to hit 75%. Investors will be on the lookout for not only whether Nvidia beats on the top and bottom lines for Q3, but also whether it raises its outlook for Q4. Analysts are expecting Nvidia to give guidance of $37 billion in revenue in the quarter. Even if the AI chip leader delivers a stellar report and outlook, its share price could still fall. Nvidia topped expectations on the top and bottom lines and beat out anticipated guidance in Q2, but its stock dropped 6% immediately after its results. That could be a sign that some investors weren’t impressed with Nvidia’s performance compared to prior quarters, where it saw revenue growth of 200% and EPS growth of nearly 600%. Or it could simply come down to investors taking profits on their gains. Investors will also be looking for any insights from CEO Jensen Huang about Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell line of AI chips, which are used to both train and run AI applications. During the company’s last earnings call in August, Huang said Blackwell production would pick up in Q4, when he expects to see several billions of dollars of revenue from the chips. At the time, Huang said demand for Blackwell was already outstripping supply, and he anticipated that would continue in the year ahead. What’s more, he said the company’s Hopper chip, the predecessor to the Blackwell line, was expected to continue selling well into Q4. Blackwell shipments have faced delays, however, and on Sunday, the Information reported that the AI chips have run into problems with overheating servers — a potential hold-up to installation in data centers. Nvidia is facing an uncertain future, given Donald Trump has threatened to put blanket tariffs on products from around the world. In addition, the president-elect has raised the specter of tariffs on Taiwan-made chips. That would be a potential alternative to the CHIPS Act, which is designed to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US. The vast majority of Nvidia’s chips are built by TSMC in Taiwan. A tariff could mean that Nvidia will charge more for its AI chips, depressing margins, or pass the added cost on to its customers. Investors are sure to be looking for any guidance Huang has to offer on the topic. Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com. Follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley.

Title: BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Options Surge: December 20 Call Signals BTC Price Target Of $180,000

BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has officially launched options trading for its Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). This debut comes after the ETF received regulatory approval in January and has since attracted significant inflows. According to Bloomberg, the introduction of options trading on the $43 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust is anticipated to reduce volatility while broadening Bitcoin’s investor base. Alex Thorn, head of firmwide research at Galaxy Digital, stated during a Bloomberg Television interview that as Bitcoin becomes more widely held, its volatility is likely to decrease. “Options will help dampen volatility, and as volatility comes down, people can take larger position sizes,” he explained. Thorn noted that a decrease in volatility could shift investor sentiment, encouraging them to view Bitcoin as a viable asset for fundamental use cases rather than merely a speculative gamble. The availability of options will also enable institutions to hedge their positions more effectively, increasing liquidity and potentially impacting retail trading during bullish market conditions. Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart reported that on the first day of options trading, the total notional exposure for IBIT reached nearly $1.9 billion, spread across 354,000 contracts. Of these contracts, 289,000 were calls, while 65,000 were puts, resulting in a bullish call to put ratio of 4.4:1. Seyffart claimed that this overwhelming interest in call options contributed to Bitcoin hitting new all-time highs of $94,000 during Tuesday’s trading session for the market’s leading crypto. Balchunas, on the other hand, pointed out that the majority of options contracts are bullish, especially the December 20 call option, which essentially bets that the Bitcoin price will double within a month. This means that based on current prices, investors are expecting BTC to hit a new record high of little over $180,000 by that date. The put/call volume ratio for BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF was “impressive,” according to Balchunas, who noted that the ratio of 0.17 indicates strong bullish sentiment compared to other ETFs, such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) with a ratio of 1.1. Market expert Marty Party highlighted in a social media post that options on the iShares Bitcoin Trust will settle in actual Bitcoin. This means that when an option contract is exercised, settlement will involve the delivery of Bitcoin, giving investors direct exposure to BTC price movements without the need to interact with crypto exchanges. At the time of writing, the market’s leading digital asset is trading at $91,580, up 4% in the weekly time frame after today’s bullish move to its new high.

Title: First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Hits New Highs as ETF Options Traders Go Degen

Election 2024 coverage presented by This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day. CoinDesk 20 Index: 2,981.79 +0.61% Bitcoin (BTC): $93,634.61 +2.04% Ether (ETH): $3,090.71 -1.65% S&P 500: 5,916.98 +0.40% Gold: $2,628.53 -0.15% Nikkei 225: 38,352.34 -0.16% Bitcoin (BTC) is eyeing record highs once again heading into Wednesday's U.S. session. The largest crypto is trading just below $94,000, the new record from Tuesday, and leading the broader market with a 2% climb over the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index was little changed and large-cap altcoins ether (ETH) and solana (SOL) fell. Options on BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF (IBIT) saw staggering first-day trading activity yesterday, pushing the BTC price higher, analysts noted. Most of the activity focused on calls, representing a bullish view, with some traders betting on a doubling of IBIT's share price. "It’s pretty interesting to see 'professionals' degen into $100 strikes (this effectively means a doubling of BTC prices given IBIT trades near $50)," crypto quant researcher Samneet Chepal noted. Options on other BTC ETFs will follow in the coming days, fueling more activity. It's not only bitcoin where the crypto action is concentrated, though. Trading volumes for popular altcoins dogecoin (DOGE) and XRP (XRP) surpassed BTC's on South Korean crypto exchanges Upbit and Bithumb. MicroStrategy (MSTR) broke into the top 100 U.S. publicly traded companies by market capitalization as its share price closed Tuesday's session at a record $430, far above its dotcom bubble highs. The firm owns the largest corporate bitcoin treasury in the world and its shares have rallied 528% this year, outperforming bitcoin and chipmaker giant Nvidia (NVDA). The developments keep coming for the firm, CoinDesk analyst James Van Straten noted. On Monday, it announced a $1.75 billion 5-year convertible senior note issuance at a 0% coupon. "We are waiting on further developments if this convertible note has been oversubscribed, which would increase its issuance by $250 million, for a total of $2 billion," Van Straten said. Robinhood (HOOD) is poised to benefit the most from crypto deregulation in the U.S. under President-elect Donald Trump, broker Bernstein said in a report. The trading app can drive higher revenues by listing new tokens and introducing new crypto product lines to target the wider opportunity, the report said. Robinhood's acquisition of EU-based exchange Bitstamp and its European platform should "further boost value added crypto services," the authors wrote. Bernstein raised the price target for Robinhood shares to $51 from $30, which would translate to a 45% appreciation from Tuesday's closing price. - Omkar Godbole Coinbase Delists Wrapped Bitcoin wBTC, Citing 'Listing Concerns' Crypto Exchange Archax to Offer Tokenized Money Market Funds from State Street, Fidelity International and LGIM Meta's Mark Zuckerberg Could Teach DAOs, Like Compound, a Governance Lesson Edited by Sheldon Reback.

Title: World of Warcraft gave me my one elite gamer moment: Kiting the General in Upper Blackrock Spire

﻿LFM UBRS have key need hunter by Susana Polo I’ve never been a person who aspires to do “elite gamer” stuff in video games. My favorite genres are point-and-click puzzle adventures and narrative role-playing games, I prefer to enjoy video games alone, and I’m constitutionally noncompetitive. Given all that, you might wonder how I nevertheless spent eight years of my life playing World of Warcraft. Perhaps it was because, early in the life of the storied MMO, it gave me a glimpse of what it might be like to have an elite level of skill, and have that skill recognized by other players. My elite gamer moment wasn’t reaching max level in four expansions, or when my raid guilds put both Arthas and Deathwing in the ground — no. Nothing else in WoW, or other games, has captured the feeling I got by being a Hunter who could kite the General in Upper Blackrock Spire. That was the telltale message in the Looking For Group chat channel, circa 2005, that signaled one of base World of Warcraft’s most trying dungeon crawls. This message meant that a group of players was looking for more folks to attempt the 10-player dungeon called Upper Blackrock Spire. UBRS, as it was abbreviated, was a stepping-stone raid on the way to Molten Core, WoW’s very first 40-man raid tier. And it fit the part: Where Molten Core took place in the elemental plane of fire, UBRS was a lava-split fortress built inside an active volcano, full of black dragons, fire elementals, and even a Core Hound boss encounter, foreshadowing the use of the two-headed, lava-drooling beasts as the iconic basic mobs of Molten Core. To even get into Upper Blackrock Spire — back in the certifiably crunchier days of Vanilla World of Warcraft — you needed at least one member of the raid to have completed a circuitous questline involving a random item drop, a hidden NPC, at least one full run through the Lower Blackrock Spire dungeon, and a schlep all the way out to Dustwallow Marsh to subdue a random dragon because you need its fire breath, specifically. It took a lot to put a group together for UBRS, but, paradoxically, those groups were usually highly tenuous. Although UBRS required 10 people and a Big Raid-style questline to gain entry, it had the same level of loot as any other max-level, five-player dungeon. So, even if you were in a raiding guild, it was unlikely to be something they spent a raid night on — you’d have to rely on strangers to fill out your group, and you had to have at least one person who’d done all that work to get the key. And, on top of that, you needed a Hunter player who knew how to kite the General. The final boss of Upper Blackrock Spire was a centaur-dragon sort of guy called General Drakkisath. He was a big bruiser who hit very hard, but so did his two guards — they output so much damage on a single tank character that healers would get overwhelmed and you’d wipe. The most accepted way of defeating him was to have most of your group focus on killing the guards first, while one person got the General to chase them away from the rest of the fight, or “kite” him. And only the Hunter class, a ranged, physical damage-dealer with a pet, had the right combination of abilities to do it. The General ran faster than a basic player’s run speed — but Hunters could turn on Aspect of the Cheetah to get a speed boost. The General’s melee attacks hit so hard that he would quickly pulverize anyone but a tank who was receiving consistent healing — but the Hunter ability Distracting Shot could apply a taunt from range, keeping that Hunter from getting walloped. A Hunter could kite the General through several long, large rooms — including a narrow, railing-less pathway with a sheer drop on both sides — all the way back to the room of the previous boss fight. At that point, ideally, everybody else had managed to kill his guards, and the Hunter could use their Feign Death ability to zero out any interest the General had in them, then follow him back to the group in time to kick his ass. But a Hunter’s strictly mechanical abilities still weren’t enough to kite the General. Distracting Shot had a limited duration, and if you didn’t keep applying it, the General would get tired of chasing you and return too early, wiping your raid. But Distracting Shot could not be fired at something behind you, so you would have to turn around to hit him again. But, even with Aspect of the Cheetah, the General was so fast that if you stopped or ran in anything other than a straight line he’d catch up to you, turn you into paste, and then run back too early, wiping your raid. The solution rested entirely on whether or not the Hunter player could perform a trick: the jumpshot. The jumpshot takes advantage of how World of Warcraft’s jump physics work to get around the “you cannot fire a gun behind you” restriction. When you press the jump button, your character leaps briefly into the air. If you jump while running, your character continues the momentum they had before you pressed it, and their direction cannot change until they “hit” the ground again — normal jump physics for this genre of game. So, to perform a jumpshot, you start running, and hit the jump button. Then in the moment of time before your character comes back down, you whip your mouse around 180 degrees, fire off your ranged ability, and then whip your mouse back around 180 degrees again. Hopefully, you hit the ground pointing in roughly the same direction as when you started, and you’ve lost minimal, if any, forward momentum. Thanks to the new Distracting Shot you fired, General Drakkisath is still trying to kill you (which, remember, is what you want), and, if you did your jumpshot right, you haven’t slowed down enough for him to catch you. Now do it several more times, because his guards are tough, your group isn’t done with them yet, and you still have to cross that bridge with no railings. So you’ve beaten the odds. Your UBRS raid found 10 random players, including someone with the annoying key, and the right composition of tanks, healers, and DPS. It’s taken hours. You’ve done the tense tiptoe through the infamous Leeroy Jenkins room, where stepping on a single egg summons five billion deadly baby dragons. You’ve probably walked back from the ludicrously far away graveyard at least once, possibly because, if you played on a PvP server, there could be a 40-player raid group of the opposite faction setting up at the nearby entrance to Molten Core, and it was all too trivial for them to camp your corpses as you tried to get into UBRS. But you’ve done it: You’ve made it all the way to General Drakkisath, the final boss. And now the question of whether this will be a successful and complete run of Upper Blackrock Spire rests entirely on your shoulders. Nine strangers depending on you, the Hunter, to kite the General right. In an MMORPG, damage classes don’t get a lot of chances to feel like the hero of the raid. Your job is more about “don’t”s than “do”s. Do deliver the most damage mechanically possible by collecting the right gear. But don’t draw aggro, don’t stand in the fire, and don’t fuck up, because the healers aren’t going to be healing you — it’s a waste of resources. The real heroes of the raid are the tanks and the healers, by the way. If they die, that’s an emergency. If you die, it might be a little harder, but we’ll rez you when it’s over. Kiting the General, though, was a rite of passage. It was a skill passed down from more experienced Hunter players via word of mouth that you could use to be invited instantly to any UBRS group. It gave you a sense of ownership and belonging in your class; you weren’t just somebody who played a Hunter, you were a Hunter player. Now, I’m well aware that the jumpshot is not the highest caliber reflex skill the gaming world has to offer. It’s no Chicken Dinner, no Street Fighter championship, no Bloodborne using only a DDR pad. But World of Warcraft’s endgame culture was one of accepted guides and meticulously updated player-made calculators, of mathematically optimizing gear and button macros, creating ideal spell rotations, and memorizing focus fire order and boss patterns. Kiting the General wasn’t about how good you were at following the math. Either you, you the player, knew how to do it, or you didn’t. It wasn’t a just-right combo of class abilities that every character got by level X, or even a piece of loot that only had a 5% drop rate. To be a hunter who could kite the General was to be an elite in your category, based on your skill and interest in the game alone. In later updates to World of Warcraft, Blizzard made a concerted effort to move away from boss encounters that required specific classes to defeat. It was the right choice, as demonstrated by how gosh-dang difficult it was to put a good UBRS group together. And while I regretted that I was never given another boss fight on which to flex my Hunter pride, there’s still an upside. By eliminating the demand for class-specific strategies, Blizzard made the experience of playing that class-specific strategy even more rarified. So what if nobody needs to kite the General anymore? I’ll always be among the elite cadre of Hunter players who can say they did it, and World of Warcraft will be the closest I’ve ever come to that classic (and admittedly dubious) elite gamer cachet.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks fell on Wednesday ahead of Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings, seen as a crucial litmus test for the artificial intelligence trade that could set the direction of markets for days to come. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was down about 0.1%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell nearly 0.5%. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped about 0.7%, following a mixed day on Wall Street on Tuesday. Investors are counting down to Nvidia's results after the bell, hoping the last of the "Magnificent Seven" tech megacaps to report can provide some fresh momentum for stocks. It's seen as a reality check on just how important the AI poster child (and its cousins) are to the two-year bull market. The $3.61 trillion chipmaker, now the world's most valuable company, has seen its stock surge 200% this year so far, hitting record highs after the presidential election. The European Central Bank has warned of a bubble in AI stocks amid high concentration and the risk that lofty earnings hopes won't be met. Nvidia's share price was down almost 2%, after surging on Tuesday to buoy the Nasdaq to a win. Traders are bracing for a potential post-earnings swing of 8% — or $300 billion in market value — in either direction, going by options markets. Elsewhere in corporates, Target (TGT) muted its outlook for holiday-season sales and profit after posting a big quarterly profit miss and slashing its full-year guidance. The retail giant's shares sank more than 21% after the earnings. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices were up more than 3% to hit a fresh record near $94,500 per token before paring back some gains and falling below $94,000. Optimism for a crypto-friendly Trump White House has spurred the digital currency's recent rally. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Homebuilder stocks are losing steam. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) has fallen nearly 5% in the past month. DR Horton (DHI), the biggest US homebuilder, along with Lennar (LEN) and PulteGroup (PHM) have seen declines of more than 12%, 6% and 11% in the past month, respectively. “It's not surprising and not really alarming that the group is giving some of its [gains] back,” Wedbush analyst Jay McCanless told Yahoo Finance. “When you look at what mortgage rates have done in the past month, basically since the beginning of the calendar 4Q, these stocks tend to trade in an inverse fashion of what mortgage rates are doing.” Rates on the 30-year mortgages have been hovering around 6.7%, according to Freddie Mac, up from around 6% in September. Meanwhile, lumber prices have been climbing, with the framing lumber composite price rising 1.4% for the week ending Nov. 15, reaching the highest level since August 2023, according to the National Association of Home Builders. “It just may be a little more expensive from a lumber perspective for the builders than what they were paying this time last year," McCanless said. Nvidia's highly anticipated earnings report is set for release after the closing bell. Yahoo Finance's dan Howley breaks down the key numbers and themes to watch: Nvidia is expected to report Q3 earnings per share (EPS) of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That works out to an 83% year-over-year increase on both the top and bottom lines compared to the same period last year when Nvidia saw EPS of $0.40 on revenue of $22.1 billion. Nvidia’s Data Center segment, its largest business, is set to bring in $29 billion for the quarter. That’s a 100% rise on the $14.5 billion reported in Q3 last year. Gaming revenue is expected to top out at $3 billion, up 7% from last year, when the segment brought in $2.8 billion. Analysts are anticipating gross margins to hit 75%. Investors will be on the lookout for not only whether Nvidia beats on the top and bottom lines for Q3 but also whether it raises its outlook for Q4. Analysts are expecting Nvidia to give guidance of $37 billion in revenue in the quarter. Read more of the preview here. Shares of the chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) dropped 6.6% following its investor day, which focused on how the company will diversify revenue just as its business with Apple (AAPL) falls into jeopardy. Qualcomm discussed further diversifying revenue beyond its smartphone chips to chips for personal computers, autos, and a range of advanced systems from machinery in factories to surveillance technology (dubbed its "Internet of Things" segment). Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman reports that the company expects to generate $22 billion in sales of those semiconductors by 2029. Currently about 10% of Qualcomm's revenue comes from sales of its modem chips to Apple for the iPhone, but that business has come under pressure as Apple increasingly develops its own custom chips for the devices. Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon spoke with Yahoo Finance about what's ahead for the company Tuesday afternoon. Read more here. Nvidia (NVDA) is set to report earnings after the bell and give investors another look at the state of AI spending. The stock is already up nearly 200% this year, and more than 2,600% in the past five years as the company's revenues have run wild amid a surge in demand for its AI chips. In a media roundtable on Wednesday, Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin made the case that it may be time for investors to look elsewhere to benefit from the AI boom. Nvidia's liftoff was "phase one" of the AI trade, Kostin said. The "AI infrastructure" trade, companies that will help power the AI boom and are spending on AI chips to operate new servers has already taken off too, in some cases beyond their projected earnings growth, per Kostin. But the price of stocks in Goldman's "AI enabled revenue" group haven't seen the same reaction. This group Kostin said could benefit from not having to spend as much on expensive AI hardware but still reap the potential benefits from AI as a whole. The group includes stocks like Uber (UBER), Adobe (ADBE), Mastercard (MA), Salesforce (CRM) and more. "We at companies in the AI enabled revenue group of stocks where their performance of the shares have basically matched their earnings growth," Kostin said. "And so our analysis is there's a potential for multiple expansion in those stocks." Williams-Sonoma (WSM) shares soared roughly 30% after the company reported third quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street's expectations and boosted its outlook for the full year. The high-end retailer — which owns Pottery Barn and West Elm in addition to its namesake, Williams-Sonoma — also said it's prepared to deal with potential upcoming tariffs under president-elect Donald Trump. CFO Jeffrey Howie said: "[W]e've significantly reduced our China-sourced goods from 50% to 25% over the last few years. So our exposure is significantly less than the last time in 2018 that we saw this activity." "The US is already a major manufacturing hub for Williams-Sonoma Inc," he added. "Much of our upholstery is manufactured domestically in our facilities in North Carolina and Mississippi." Howie continued: "We're prepared to reduce our exports to China further if tariffs increase. We've mapped out a category-by-category plan to reduce China sourcing if conditions warrant, and we're currently evaluating and quantifying the impact from additional tariffs. We have a wide range of mitigation options." Owning a home is becoming increasingly more expensive than renting one. Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports: Exact cost estimates vary, but recently the premium for homeownership has been at least 35% over renting, a level that’s near historical highs and is likely to persist. “We’re well, well beyond what the typical historical difference is if you were to buy an entry-level home versus rent a starter home,” said Rick Palacios Jr., director of research at John Burns Research and Consulting. “I think that’s a big part of why you see the resale market in a recession.” Palacios’s firm has found factors like rising homeowners insurance premiums explain much of the growing gap. Higher mortgage rates don’t help either. Leaving other factors constant, it would take mortgage rates to be at 3.5% for the buying versus renting math to return to historical averages.

On Wednesday, Federal Reserve governor Michelle Bowman expressed concern that the Fed’s progress toward 2% inflation has “stalled” and the central bank should proceed "cautiously" when lowering interest rates. Bowman was the lone official to dissent when the Fed slashed the rate by half a percentage point, saying then that the Fed should've cut interest rates by 25 basis points instead of 50. On Wednesday, she argued there are "greater risks to the price stability side of our mandate, especially while the labor market remains near full employment." "We have seen considerable progress in lowering inflation since early 2023, but progress seems to have stalled in recent months," Bowman said in a speech at the Forum Club of the Palm Beaches. To Bowman's point, last week the "core" Consumer Price Index (CPI), which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, showed prices increased 3.3% annually for the third consecutive month during October. Recent data has increased debate over whether or not the Fed will cut rates in December. As of Wednesday afternoon, markets are pricing in a roughly 56% chance the Fed cuts rates in December, down from a more than 82% chance seen last week, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has soared about 40% since Donald Trump won the presidential election to trade above $94,000 per coin for the first time on Wednesday. On Wednesday, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz told Yahoo Finance why the market has been betting the new administration will be more pro cryptocurrency. "All the guys around the table like our space," Novogratz said. "They believe in the digital asset world. They believe in blockchains and bitcoin. And so the whole energy of this administration is going to be so different than the Elizabeth Warren, Gary Gensler era." Novogratz added that he expects an administration that's more supportive of crypto will help US crypto business operate without the "fear of litigation." And for company's like Novogratz's it could help cut down on costs too. "Our audit at Galaxy cost three times what it would if we were a non-crypto company," Novogratz said. "So we're spending $9 million a year on an audit for a medium-sized company. That's insane. So the tax on crypto has been brutal. That is going to come way down. People aren't going to fear ... they're constantly getting a Wells notice." Brutal day for Target (TGT) after earnings. Here are three problems I saw in the quarter. I wasn't the only one spotting these things, of course. The Citi research team swooping in with a midday downgrade on Target (a late one at that). "We are downgrading Target from buy to neutral. Though 3Q may have had some unique challenges, we believe very poor results at Target in 3Q (and an uninspiring outlook for 4Q) show Target is likely losing share to Walmart (WMT). With Walmart's market share gains coming largely from higher income consumers (as they called out yesterday), Target seems to be the one most at risk of losing additional share. We believe Target is likely to need to be more promotional to drive traffic/sales, which we believe makes fiscal year 2025 much more uncertain, especially because in 3Q Target did not show an ability to adjust SG&A to offset the sales/gross margin weakness," said Citi analyst Paul Lejuez. Bottom line: It's going to take Target several quarters to regain investor trust. It could begin to do that by delivering on its severely lowered holiday quarter guidance. Walmart (WMT) and Lowe's (LOW) are the latest American retailers to warn that product costs could rise if President-elect Donald Trump makes good on his tariff promises — which include 10% to 20% tariffs across the board and a 60% tariff on goods from China. Walmart CFO John David Rainey hinted in an interview with Yahoo Finance’s Brian Sozzi on Tuesday that Trump’s tariff promises would prompt the retailer to hike costs, pointing to the impact of higher tariffs enacted during the president-elect's first term under his “America First” agenda. “If we look back historically when tariffs were enacted seven years ago, it did result in higher prices for customers,” Rainey said. Lowe's echoed the sentiment. “Roughly 40% of our cost of goods sold are sourced outside of the US, and that includes both direct imports and national brands through our vendor partners,” said CFO Brandon Sink in a call with investors on Tuesday. “And as we look at potential impact, certainly would add product costs, but timing and details remain uncertain at this point.” Read the full story here. Nvidia (NVDA) is set to report earnings on Wednesday after the bell. Expectations — as they have been for more than a year now — are monstrous. Nvidia is expected to report Q3 earnings per share of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Both metrics would mark a more than 80% increase compared to the same quarter a year ago. Nvidia has been consistently surpassing analyst estimates every quarter since OpenAI launched ChatGPT in November 2022. The AI chip leader's stock reaction has been more mixed in the day following earnings announcements as expectations have grown lofty, but it hasn't fallen two quarters in a row on the day following its earnings release since the middle of 2021. That could change during Thursday's trading day if Nvidia has a repeat of last quarter when the company's upbeat outlook wasn't enough to impress investors and the stock fell more than 6%. "The company hasn’t had a negative price reaction in back to back post earnings release days since [the first quarter of 2021], when GenAI wasn’t a phrase in investors’ dictionary," Julian Emanuel, who leads the equity, derivatives, and quantitative strategy team at Evercore ISI, wrote in a note to clients on Sunday. "A positive reaction following the 11/20 release, following the negative move last quarter, could help cushion the S&P 500’s decline somewhat near term but is more likely to refocus investors on the long term story." Target (TGT) stock tanked in early trading on Wednesday, falling more than 20% after the retail giant slashed its full-year guidance and missed Wall Street's estimates for both earnings per share and revenue in its third quarter. Before the bell, Target said it now expects full-year earnings per share in a range of $8.30 to $8.90, below its prior range of $9.00 to $9.70. The new guidance also came in well below the $9.61 earnings per share that Wall Street had expected. The retailer also took a cautious stance on prospects for the holiday shopping season. Read more on Target's quarter from Yahoo Finance Executive editor Brian Sozzi here. US stocks wavered on Wednesday ahead of Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings, seen as a crucial litmus test for the AI trade that could set the direction of markets for days to come. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was up about 0.2%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) hugged the flat line. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped about 0.2%, following a mixed day on Wall Street on Tuesday. After surging on Tuesday amid increased optimism surrounding the stock ahead of earnings, Nvidia shares slid more than 1% in early trade. Comcast (CMCSA) is looking to play offense in the ever-evolving media landscape. On Wednesday, the company said that it will spin off most of its cable networks into a new publicly traded company called SpinCo. The stock jumped as much as 3.5% in premarket trading before paring those gains. The new venture will house the majority of NBCUniversal’s cable television networks, including USA Network, CNBC, MSNBC, Oxygen, E!, SYFY, and Golf Channel. Those networks collectively generated about $7 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, Comcast said in its announcement. Comcast's Peacock streaming service and the NBC broadcast network will remain under the parent company. “This transaction positions both SpinCo and NBCUniversal to play offense in a changing media landscape,” said Comcast president Mike Cavanagh.

In a November 19 Twitter Space discussion hosted by Bitcoin ETF issuer VanEck, the Bitcoin maximalist announced that he has agreed to deliver a concise, three-minute presentation to Microsoft’s leadership. The pitch comes amidst a shareholder proposal calling for Microsoft to assess Bitcoin’s potential impact on its balance sheet. “The activist that put that proposal together contacted me to present to the board, and I agreed to provide a 3-minute presentation,” Saylor said. “That’s all you’re allowed—and I’m going to present it to the board of directors” A staunch advocate of Bitcoin, Saylor criticized corporations with large cash reserves for “burning shareholder value,” during yesterday's the Twitter space discussion. In his view, Bitcoin can bring great stability to enterprise value. “It would be a lot more stable stock and a much less risky stock if half of the enterprise value of the stock was based upon tangible assets or property like Bitcoin,” he stated. Saylor, who has led MicroStrategy to become the largest corporate Bitcoin holder with 252,220 BTC valued at $16.8 billion, believes Bitcoin is a necessary asset for companies with large cash reserves. He shared during the discussion that his earlier request for a private meeting with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to discuss the topic has not yet been accepted. Hey @SatyaNadella, if you want to make the next trillion dollars for $MSFT shareholders, call me. pic.twitter.com/NPnVvL7Wmj — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) October 25, 2024 In October, Saylor directly addressed Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on Twitter, saying, “If you want to make the next trillion dollars for $MSFT shareholders, call me.” Microsoft shareholders are scheduled to vote on whether the company should conduct a formal assessment of Bitcoin as an investment on Dec. 10. The National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR) introduced the proposal last month, citing MicroStrategy’s success with Bitcoin. MicroStrategy’s stock has outperformed Microsoft’s by 313% this year, even though the company operates at a much smaller scale. “MicroStrategy, like Microsoft, is a technology company, but unlike Microsoft, it holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet,” noted NCPPR in the proposal. Despite the push from shareholders and Saylor’s advocacy, Microsoft’s board has recommended voting against the proposal. Microsoft maintains that it already evaluates a broad range of investment options, including Bitcoin. The company’s share price traded relatively modest on Wednesday, increasing 0.49% to $417.79, Google Finance data shows. Edited by Stacy Elliott.

Title: BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF options brings in nearly $2b in trade on day one

Options contracts on BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) saw “unheard-of” notional exposure levels, helping push Bitcoin to a record of over $94,000. Taking to X, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, said: “Final tally of $IBIT’s 1st day of options is just shy of $1.9 billion in notional exposure traded via 354k contracts. 289k were Calls & 65k were Puts. That’s a ratio of 4.4:1. These options were almost certainly part of the move to the new #Bitcoin all time highs today.” UPDATE: Final tally of $IBIT's 1st day of options is just shy of $1.9 billion in notional exposure traded via 354k contracts. 289k were Calls & 65k were Puts.

With the new options contract, investors can speculate on price movements by trading shares at predetermined prices. Joe Constori, head of growth at Theya and institutional lead at the Bitcoin Layer, said on X that “TLDR; the market is bullish that Bitcoin’s price ends the year well over $100k.” Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas added: “$1.9b is unheard of for Day One. For context, $BITO did $363m and that’s been around for four years. And also this is with 25,000 contract position limits.” $1.9b is unheard of for Day One. For context, $BITO did $363m and that's been around for four years. And also this is with 25,000 contract position limits. That said, $1.9b isn't quite big dog level yet tho, eg $GLD did $5b today, but give it a few more days/weeks. https://t.co/nAr2rracjb — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 19, 2024 The launch of BlackRock’s options contracts comes as institutional interest in Bitcoin rises. With the IBIT options, investors can gain exposure to new avenues of investment while managing their risk through the call and put options without owning the underlying asset. In January, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETFs). Since then, the market has grown with BlackRock leading the way. At the end of October, BlackRock’s IBIT reached $30 billion in net assets in a record 293 days. Two weeks later, it reached $40 billion in net assets in 211 days, showcasing rising interest in crypto investments.

Title: Why Nvidia earnings could be a sink-or-swim moment for this bull market

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings Chip stocks are down 3% since the election. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) is up by about the same measure. Once the pillar of this two-year bull market, semiconductors have been a net drag on US stocks over the last four months. Nvidia (NVDA) earnings — coming after the bell Wednesday — will provide a reality check on just how important the AI poster child (and its cousins) are to this rally. Tom Essaye, founder and president of the Sevens Report, recently joined Yahoo Finance and broke down the key elements traders are looking for in Nvidia earnings Wednesday. "It's all about the guidance. How enthusiastic and how aggressive [Nvidia is] on the guidance," said Essaye. "It's a growth story here. We all know it. It's the future. It's the next big thing. They've got to keep us excited about it via this earnings print." Nvidia has roared back strong since its July slump, rising 45% from the major August low. The chip stock — up nearly 200% this year and up over 1100% in the last two years — hit record highs following the election. But many of Nvidia's peers, especially smaller ones, have become a net drag on the industry and US stocks writ large since the start of the second half of the year. The worst-off among this group of chip stocks, Super Micro Computer (SMCI), faces idiosyncratic problems as it struggles to avoid delisting on the Nasdaq exchange. Qorvo (QRVO) is down over 40%, as is Mobileye Global (MBLY) in the second half of the year so far. Meanwhile, Intel (INTC), Micron (MU), KLA Corp (KLAC), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Microchip (MCHP) are all down more than 20%. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) — seen as Nvidia's biggest competitor — is down 14%. The PHLX Semiconductor Index (^SOX), which tracks chip industry stocks, has fluctuated for several months. And a fresh two-month low on Monday this week made some technical traders nervous. To be fair, the US rally has already broadened in the third and fourth quarters far beyond the influence of chip stocks, and that's likely to continue next year, as Josh Schafer wrote Monday. "Nvidia is not the full market driver that it was, say, earlier [in the rally]," said Essaye. Since the second quarter, Tech (XLK) has been the second-worst-performing sector after Healthcare (XLV), barely in positive territory. Accordingly, investors might wonder if this bull market can continue if tech suddenly becomes an anchor on the S&P 500. And should Nvidia — "priced to perfection" according to many analysts — underdeliver and underwhelm, investors may face that reckoning. But Essaye is willing to overlook some of the recent weakness in this "bellwether" stock, citing pre-earnings jitters. It's hard not to be optimistic, based on the momentum of the past two years. "They've got a tough tightrope to walk, but they've done it successfully so far," he said. "I think they can do it again."

Title: From far-right gains to the economy: What’s at stake in Germany’s election?
URL: https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/20/from-far-right-gains-to-the-economy-whats-at-stake-in-germanys-election

Germans will head to the polls early next year after the coalition led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz collapsed. Berlin, Germany – In some countries, a snap election is held in a matter of weeks. Germany, by contrast, will enjoy a leisurely three months before it goes to the polls in an election that is likely to be overshadowed by the return of Donald Trump to the White House, an increasingly perilous situation in Ukraine, and a flagging domestic economy. Germany’s ruling “traffic light” coalition, formed by the Social Democratic Party (SPD), Greens and Free Democrats (FDP) collapsed on November 6, after Chancellor Olaf Scholz dismissed his finance minister, FDP leader Christian Lindner. Scholz has announced a vote of confidence will take place on December 16. The snap poll is expected to take place on February 23. The three-way alliance formed after the 2021 elections was a rarity for Germany, and the FDP’s fiscal hawkishness always made an uneasy marriage with its centre-left partners, who campaigned in the 2021 elections on increased social and climate spending. The final break came during preparations for the 2025 budget, with Scholz arguing to pause Germany’s “debt brake”, which tightly limits public borrowing. Lindner insisted on demanding major public spending cuts and rolling back climate targets. Last week in the Bundestag, Scholz accused the FDP leader of pitting the government’s financial and military support for Ukraine against German pensioners. The national weekly newspaper Die Zeit reported that the FDP had deliberately provoked Scholz to collapse the coalition and force an early election, which the party has denied. “It was difficult to reconcile those three very different political ideas and ideologies,” said Markus Ziener, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund think tank, who believes infighting has weakened Germany’s position within the European Union at a time when the bloc is sorely in need of leadership. “The hope could be that the next elections will bring much more stable conditions to form a reliable government.” The Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party are currently polling at 32 percent, according to a recent INSA poll, more than all three of the coalition parties put together. Friedrich Merz, a former BlackRock board member who has moved the party rightward since becoming leader in 2022, is therefore well-placed to become the next chancellor. Based on current polling, he could lead a government with the SPD – based on the latest predictions likely to secure 16 percent, as a junior partner, a return to the familiar “grand coalition” that was in place for three of Angela Merkel’s four terms, or with the Greens, which are polling at 12 percent. Merz has promised to roll back several of the coalition’s reforms, including on climate. He wants to lower taxes, reduce social welfare spending and tighten the country’s borders. “It is time for a fundamental course correction in migration, security, foreign and economic policy,” Merz told the Bundestag last week. Scholz, now the least popular chancellor in post-war German history according to polls, has indicated that he will run again as the party’s candidate. But many senior figures in the SPD want to make a clear break with his tenure, and quickly. If he is to be deposed, Defence Minister Boris Pistorius is likely to replace him. The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) is on course to record a historic result. Assessments from Germany’s domestic intelligence agency that several of the party’s state branches are right-wing extremist organisations have not prevented the party from polling second, at 20 percent. Though all other parties refuse to form a coalition with the AfD, a strong performance could increase its influence on powerful parliamentary committees. Meanwhile, the FDP and the socialist Left party are currently below the 5 percent threshold required to enter parliament. The newly formed, left-wing Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance is at 7 percent. Trump’s campaign promise to bring a quick end to the conflict in Ukraine, and threats to pull military assistance to President Volodymr Zelenskyy’s government, come at a time when the war-torn nation is losing ground to Russia in the east and facing major attacks on its energy infrastructure ahead of winter. If Trump follows through, Germany, Ukraine’s second-largest backer, will be expected to dig deep and massively increase its military spending. Scholz recently spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin for the first time in two years. He tends to tread a more careful approach and has refused to deliver long-range Taurus missiles out of fears of escalating the conflict. By comparison, Merz has been more hawkish on weapons deliveries and indicated he would approve the transfer, in line with the policies of the United Kingdom, France and the United States. Potentially adding further strain to the budget, Trump’s plans to slap 20 percent tariffs on all imports and 60 percent on Chinese imports would have severe consequences for the economy, as Germany remains heavily reliant on exporting manufactured goods. Europe’s largest economy is also its slowest growing. Though it has narrowly skirted recession, Germany’s central bank said on Tuesday that the present stagnation is likely to continue in the face of weak international demand and investment, and the prospect of new US tariffs. “We’re basically in a squeeze here. On the one hand, we probably have to deal with direct additional customs in the United States,” said Ziener. “On the other hand, we will probably be very much affected by high duties against Chinese products.” With no end in sight to the economic woes, more financial institutions and business representatives are calling for a reform of Germany’s debt brake to increase public investment, which has lagged for years. Merz, long known as a fiscal disciplinarian, has recently suggested an openness to reforming it, a possible sign of a shifting consensus. The constitutional-anchored measure limits borrowing to 0.35 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), but special investment off-budget funds worth hundreds of billions have been used to circumvent it. Dezernat Zukunft, a research institute that advocates for reform of the debt brake, estimates that Germany requires public spending of $782bn before 2030, which it says can be achieved without constitutional amendments. “The deeper question is whether there’s a political majority for debt finance in Germany,” said Max Krahe, director of research at Dezernat Zukunft, a research institute that campaigns for reform of the debt brake. “To say, yes, we are willing to use debt as a financing instrument to tackle all the problems in front of us, whether it’s defence, decarbonisation, infrastructure, competitiveness, education, healthcare.” Follow Al Jazeera English:

Title: Nvidia Stock Is A Buy On Dips Before Blackwell Arrives In 2025

Nvidia’s stock broke to all-time highs recently, trading at $148 in early November and $147 yesterday. The stock has left many investors wondering “what comes next” after the unrelenting, historic surge that began seven quarters ago. To help my readers determine where Nvidia’s stock will go next, I’ve been fastidious in my analysis about the company’s outsized AI potential since 2018, tracking Big Tech capex as a proxy for AI demand since 2022, discussing the anomalous earnings and revenue revisions throughout 2023 and 2024, and reporting on never-before published data on supply chain checks as recent as two months ago. CEO of Nvidia, Jensen Huang, waves during the launch of the supercomputer Gefion at Vilhelm ... [+] Lauritzen Terminal in Kastrup, Denmark, on October 23, 2024. The new AI supercomputer has been established in collaboration with EIFO and NVIDIA and is operated by the Danish Center for AI Innovation (DCAI). The computer is aimed 'at breakthroughs in quantum computing, clean energy, biotechnology and other areas serving Danish society and the world', according to Nvidia. (Photo by Mads Claus Rasmussen / Ritzau Scanpix / AFP) / Denmark OUT (Photo by MADS CLAUS RASMUSSEN/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images) The thoroughness is needed, however, as rumors from the media and short sellers alike run amuck. Rest assured, as 2025 approaches, supply chain data is giving bullish signals that the new generation of GPUs shipping in full volume by mid-2025 (and beginning to ship in the January quarter) will far exceed the GPU sales we saw in 2023 and 2024 combined. Regarding my firm’s confidence in tracking supply chain data, when The Information stated Nvidia was experiencing a material delay on the next generation of GPUs, going so far as to state that Taiwan Semiconductor had machines sitting idle, I quickly refuted the report based on supply chain data my firm had been tracking. Those data points continue to indicate Blackwell is ramping. Here is what I stated: “As of now, there’s a disconnect between next fiscal year’s revenue estimates of $167 billion and the $210 billion in GB200s alone expected to ship next year. Perhaps analysts are waiting for signals the supply chain can produce these outsized orders. So far, so good with the signals we see from TSMC and SMCI’s most recent earnings reports. Foxconn commentary helps, as well.” Fast forward two months, and next year’s fiscal estimates stand at $185 billion up from $167 billion; showing no material impact from the delay (quite the opposite). Our firm was also able to use that same supply chain data to buy Nvidia in July/August, for an average cost basis of $109. The I/O Fund’s first trade was at $3.15, but we actively track the stock and publish our real-time trade alerts for anyone who feels they missed out on the AI juggernaut. The first item that will determine the strength of the upcoming earnings report from Nvidia has nothing to do with the Q3 results. Rather, what the market will want to know is how much Blackwell revenue is expected in the January quarter. Morgan Stanley has estimates placed at $5 to $6 billion, with this number hitting a ceiling due to supply constraints; however, Piper Sandler sees Blackwell revenue potentially higher, at $5 billion up to $8 billion. The bigger picture is that Blackwell will ramp by an order of magnitude, eventually exceeding Hopper’s revenue. To quantify this, Hopper has delivered approximately $125 billion in data center revenue since Q1 2023, based on estimates from Trend Force placing Hopper at generating 90% of data center revenue in 2024. Blackwell, on the other hand, is expected to deliver up to $210 billion next year alone, based on estimates for up to 60,000 to 70,000 GB200 NVL72 servers priced up to $3 million each. Given the company is lapping tough comparables, the growth rate will slow considerably even if Blackwell does ramp from $6 billion per quarter to $60 billion per quarter by late-2026 (Hopper is in its seventh quarter and Blackwell will be in its seventh quarter by late 2026). This is because excellence begets excellence, and thus, Nvidia is competing with itself with each new generation of GPUs. For example, with Hopper, the company reported peak quarterly growth of 262% and 265% earlier this year, yet is expected to slow to the mid-40% for growth as we close out 2025. Nvidia has multiple levers it can pull and outside forces at play that will help it maintain this 40%+ growth rate. This includes a 1-year product road map, Big Tech’s large appetite for AI spending, and long-term AI GPU market growth from Enterprises and the Consumer, plus a commanding market share position. By coming to market with upgraded, more powerful GPUs on a now-annual cadence, with Blackwell Ultra, Rubin and Rubin Ultra soon to come, Nvidia will continue to be the largest beneficiary of Big Tech’s AI capex to an unprecedented degree as the company continually raises the bar on performance and TCO upgrades with each new generation. Additionally, Nvidia has a software moat with CUDA and the cash to reserve chip capacity in bulk at the fab level to maintain an 80% to 85% share of what executives foresee as a $500 billion AI accelerator market by 2028. I first covered these points in my free newsletter when I published: “Here’s Why Nvidia Stock Will Reach $10 Trillion Market Cap by 2030.” Of these points, one of the most visible is that Nvidia continues to pry away tens of billions in cash – and now hundreds of billions —- from the world’s leading tech companies. All roads lead to Nvidia, and it’s no secret that Big Tech and others are competing to purchase Nvidia’s supply constrained GPUs. Our firm began tracking Big Tech capex as a proxy for Nvidia demand in 2022, and tracking it on a quarterly basis starting in early 2023 – to help gauge AI demand, I continue to track Big Tech capex quarterly closely for our readers. Our recent checks published in the analysis “AI Spending to Exceed a Quarter Trillion Next Year” reveal that AI spending continues to accelerate, with Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta on track to increase their spend by ~$90 billion YoY in 2024. This does not include xAI, CoreWeave, Oracle and dozens of others who are also spending multiple billions on Nvidia’s GPUs, as well. To better understand the trajectory of AI spending, let’s take a step back to 2023, where the rapid ascent of ChatGPT at the beginning of the year set the stage for AI to step into the spotlight. Big Tech could spend another $70 billion in Q4, based on guidance and comments from executives, who overwhelmingly discussed the need for more AI infrastructure, putting full year capex at ~$240 billion, or nearly 15% higher than the level they were tracking at the start of the year. Big Tech’s Q4 capex could hit $70B, driven by AI infrastructure demand—pushing 2024’s total to ... [+] ~$240B, up 15% from early-year estimates! For 2025, Big Tech has already signaled a willingness to spend substantially more on AI. There is clear ROI for Amazon, Google and Microsoft as they rush to meet the elevated demand that continues to outpace AI capacity in their cloud infrastructures. More broadly, Big Tech and large enterprises are racing to further develop and broaden AI services and models. UBS projects Big Tech will spend ~10% more YoY, placing AI-driven capex at $267 billion; however, if 2024 is any sign, this estimate is too low. This all fits in with longer-term projections from Bank of America that sees a cumulative $700 billion spent on AI through 2026. As we go through a lull between the Hopper generation being in its seventh quarter, and Blackwell not yet shipping in volume, our firm will be buying the dips on Nvidia for many reasons – one of them being it’s the market leader on margins. By having a near monopoly on GPUs, Nvidia has incredibly strong pricing power. The GPUs coming in 2025, called Blackwell, are set to intensify this pricing power with DGX B200 systems reportedly going for up to a 40%+ premium to the previous DGX H100 systems, at $500,000 per server versus the low $300,000s per server, respectively. While GB200 prices are estimated at $60,000 to $70,000 for a single chip, the NVL36 and NVL72 configurations carry much higher price tags and thus, higher average prices per GB200. For example, the NVL36 is expected to cost ~$1.8 million, and for 18 GB200s (36 B200 GPUs), that comes out to $100,000 per GB200 and additional components. For the NVL72, it works out to ~$83,333 per GB200 and additional components. While there were concerns about Nvidia’s margins given that management guided for a sequential contraction in gross margins in Q3, the sheer pricing power of Blackwell will ultimately be a non-issue next year. Nvidia’s operating margin of 62% exceeds second place Microsoft by 17.5 points and third place Meta by 21.9 points; Nvidia is more than double the rest of the Mag 7 including Apple and Alphabet. This is because Hopper’s pricing power versus the Ampere generation: Nvidia’s Compute and Networking operating margin expanded from 28.5% in Q3 FY23 when Hopper reached full production to 71.3% in the most recent quarter even as revenue grew 7x during that seven-quarter period. Nvidia leads the MAG 7 with a 62% operating margin, driven by Hopper’s pricing power—more than ... [+] double Apple, Alphabet, and others in the group! Nvidia is expected to report roughly 50 bps to 100 bps margin contraction this quarter compared to last quarter, and will see roughly 200 bps to 300 bps margin contraction from its peak growth quarters earlier this year. As stated, the pricing power I foresee from Blackwell will keep the margins strong well into 2025, therefore, any concerns over margins this quarter will be a moot point by next year. The strong margins combined with the expected growth in AI accelerators has caused some analysts to increase earnings per share substantially as of late. Bank of America increased its EPS estimates for next calendar year from $3.90 to $4.47 and for calendar year 2026 from $4.72 to $5.67. In February, I wrote an analysis describing how Nvidia’s valuation was “eerily low despite 420% rally since 2023” to help our readers prepare for a higher return in the coming months, which detailed the importance of these revisions. Ultimately, these revisions make the stock cheaper as it leads to more room in the bottom-line valuation. Despite being fairly straight forward, the velocity of the revisions is the single most important point that short sellers and Nvidia critics cannot seem to understand. Of all the quarters since Nvidia’s Hopper release, this is the quarter most likely to be lackluster. This is because the impact of Hopper and the H200s are well-known and the Blackwell generation won’t be shipping in volume until Q1 and ramping further into Q2. I am looking forward to the fiscal year guide in the February call, and am even more excited about the May earnings call when Blackwell’s impact will be better understood. Nvidia is expected to report revenue of $32.9 billion for growth of 81.8% at the midpoint. Analyst expectations are higher than management guidance of $32.5 billion at the midpoint, for growth of 79.4%. This is a deceleration from last quarter’s 122.4% growth, and peak growth of 262% and 265% in the April and January 2024 quarters. As pointed out on EPS, another area where Nvidia is unique is the sheer amount of analyst revisions on the stock. It not only speaks to Nvidia’s dominance in the AI data center to continually surprise the Street, but also to the challenge that analysts face in terms of predicting Nvidia’s persistent revenue surge. For example, this year alone, analysts originally expected Nvidia to report 33.4% revenue growth and this quarter is now expected to be 81.8% growth, for revisions that total 48.4 points in about six months’ time (more than double the original growth expectations). This quarter, there is a wide range of expectations with UBS believing Nvidia will beat by as much as $2 billion, for revenue of $34.5 billion to $35 billion for Q3. Piper Sandler foresees a beat of $1.3 billion for Q3, and a beat of $1.5 billion for Q4. It’s been quite clear for the past two years that analysts do not know how to gauge the growth coming from this company. In 2025, Blackwell is likely to wildly exceed analyst estimates again. This quarter, analysts are expecting EPS of $0.74 compared to EPS of $0.67 last quarter. For nearly two years, the company has beaten EPS estimates by 10% or more, yet in the last quarter, the beat was more muted at 5.7%. On the topic of Nvidia having 2X better margins than most of the Mag 7, here is a glimpse of how Nvidia compares on EPS with a 35%+ growth rate compared to the Mag 7 reporting half this growth rate through 2026: Nvidia: 35.5% 2Y revenue CAGR, 35.1% EPS CAGR Apple: 7.1% revenue CAGR, 14.4% EPS CAGR Microsoft: 14.2% revenue CAGR; 14.9% EPS CAGR Amazon: 10.7% revenue CAGR; 22.3% EPS CAGR Meta: 13.5% revenue CAGR; 12.5% EPS CAGR This quarter, Nvidia’s CFO Colette Kress, will not offer a full year guide yet have to address the elephant in the room — supply constraints. The fab that makes Nvidia’s chips, Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC), is working overtime to boost capacity to meet demand. TSMC’s monthly CoWoS capacity was estimated at ~15,000/month at the end of 2023, and was originally expected to triple to ~45,000 to 50,000/month by the end of 2024 in order to meet such high demand from Nvidia, AMD and other advanced node clients. Now, capacity is expected to rise ~300% to 60,000/month. TSMC remains committed to significantly boosting CoWoS capacity over the next few years in order to accommodate these accelerated AI GPU timelines from both Nvidia and AMD, with multiple different product lines expected to come to market over the next couple of years. By year-end 2025, CoWoS capacity is estimated to be 80,000 to 90,000/month, per Morgan Stanley, with Nvidia reportedly already reserving half of this capacity. By the end of 2026, CoWoS capacity is estimated to expand to as much as 140,000 to 150,000/month, representing 10x growth in capacity from the end of 2023. Source: Beth_Kindig xAI Foxconn and Quanta are also both signaling strong demand for Blackwell come 2025. Foxconn has said that they see “crazy” demand for Blackwell servers, and forecast AI servers to make up half of their overall server business in 2025. Foxconn has said that initial shipments are on time for Q4 before ramping much faster in Q1, with Quanta saying the same, that initial shipments are on schedule and will ramp in Q1. Quanta sees triple-digit AI server growth through next year on the back of strong demand, with Deputy Spokesperson Carol Hsu saying that “recent capex guidance from top US hyperscalers also confirmed their aggressive spending on AI in 2025, all from a high base in 2024.” Nvidia is the subject of some of the most severe export restrictions from the US due to its integral role in advancing AI computing. Subsequently, the company’s China exposure is among the lowest in the semiconductor sector, leaving it less exposed should we see heightened geopolitical tensions — especially tariffs. Nvidia’s China revenue was 9.6% in Q1 and 12.2% in Q2, down from the low-20% range in the same quarters in fiscal 2024. For all of FY 2024, Nvidia’s China revenue was 16.9%, down from 21.5% the year prior. Other semi peers are much more heavily exposed to China: Broadcom’s China exposure was 32.2% in FY 2023, Intel’s exposure was above 27%, and Qualcomm and Marvell both had more than 40% of revenue stem from China in FY 2024. Although Nvidia’s fundamentals are a perfect 10, the stock is contending with weak peers, as evidenced by major semiconductor ETFs, SOXX and SMH, not making new highs with the S&P 500. Retail investors often find out the hard way, even the most perfect stock must contend with market forces beyond its control. This is the primary reason Nvidia’s stock may pullback as Nvidia is holding up the semiconductor market, which has grown unusually weak in the past few weeks. SOXX is 20% of its all-time highs and SMH is 14% of its all-time highs despite the S&P 500 making new highs. In a 1-hour webinar for I/O Fund Members last quarter, I discussed why this is an issue for AI investors and what I’d like to see before I resume buying Nvidia. My firm has become well-known for calling Nvidia an AI stock in 2018, and later stating Nvidia would Surpass Apple, and finally that Nvidia will reach a $10 trillion market cap by 2030. Yet, perhaps lesser-known is that I nailed the October 2022 bottom by stating Nvidia was Ready to Rumble on H100 GPUs along with a real-time trade alert for $10.80 on October 13th 2022 a mere 25 months ago. Here is what I stated at the exact moment Nvidia’s stock bottomed in October after selling off 60% following the August earnings report: “Today, Nvidia’s AI products serve nearly every enterprise company’s artificial intelligence and machine learning ambitions. The company has an impressive launch schedule starting in October for two flagship products – the RTX 40 Series and the H100 GPU. The timing of these releases is no coincidence as it’s a rapid two months following the crypto/gaming revenue miss. Suffice to say, Nvidia’s management team is prepared to rumble —- putting its very best release in gaming and its most powerful AI chip to-date up against the crypto mining selloff. If history is any indication, the turnaround will only be a matter of time.” The upcoming earnings report has a few similarities to October of 2022, which is that we are toward the end of a product cycle and the CFO cannot offer fiscal year guidance. Despite the H100s ramping and Nvidia having visibility into that ramp, the CFO was tight-lipped two years ago stating: “Our Data Center yes, we do expect it to grow. It may grow about what we just saw between Q1 and Q2. We’ll continue to look at it.” Therefore, I am not expecting much from the CFO on Blackwell in this report, but that lack of detail will be a distant memory this time next year. Make no mistake, Nvidia is the best stock of the decade and we are only four years in. The big picture is that Nvidia's trajectory will continue due to two words: pricing power. Our firm has an aggressive buy plan at key levels should the stock pullback, and we have a backup plan should the stock overcome the peer pressure we are seeing from SMH and meaningfully breakout.The keyword is “buy” but the skillset is patience. My firm has blended cutting-edge analysis alongside careful, patient buys for returns of 3280% since our first tranche. Most importantly, the I/O Fund continues to offer buy zones for those who’d like to participate. The I/O Fund first called out Nvidia’s AI opportunity in November 2018 with our first trade alert at $3.15 for returns of 3280%. We also provided 9 buy alerts from 2021 – 2022 to buy NVDA stock below $20. The I/O Fund has been closely analyzing lesser-known stocks in AI plus crypto with real-time trade alerts and webinars.

Nvidia’s stock broke to all-time highs recently, trading at $148 in early November and $147 yesterday. The stock has left many investors wondering “what comes next” after the unrelenting, historic surge that began seven quarters ago. To help my readers determine where Nvidia’s stock will go next, I’ve been fastidious in my analysis about the company’s outsized AI potential since 2018, tracking Big Tech capex as a proxy for AI demand since 2022, discussing the anomalous earnings and revenue revisions throughout 2023 and 2024, and reporting on never-before published data on supply chain checks as recent as two months ago. CEO of Nvidia, Jensen Huang, waves during the launch of the supercomputer Gefion at Vilhelm ... [+] Lauritzen Terminal in Kastrup, Denmark, on October 23, 2024. The new AI supercomputer has been established in collaboration with EIFO and NVIDIA and is operated by the Danish Center for AI Innovation (DCAI). The computer is aimed 'at breakthroughs in quantum computing, clean energy, biotechnology and other areas serving Danish society and the world', according to Nvidia. (Photo by Mads Claus Rasmussen / Ritzau Scanpix / AFP) / Denmark OUT (Photo by MADS CLAUS RASMUSSEN/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images) The thoroughness is needed, however, as rumors from the media and short sellers alike run amuck. Rest assured, as 2025 approaches, supply chain data is giving bullish signals that the new generation of GPUs shipping in full volume by mid-2025 (and beginning to ship in the January quarter) will far exceed the GPU sales we saw in 2023 and 2024 combined. Regarding my firm’s confidence in tracking supply chain data, when The Information stated Nvidia was experiencing a material delay on the next generation of GPUs, going so far as to state that Taiwan Semiconductor had machines sitting idle, I quickly refuted the report based on supply chain data my firm had been tracking. Those data points continue to indicate Blackwell is ramping. Here is what I stated: “As of now, there’s a disconnect between next fiscal year’s revenue estimates of $167 billion and the $210 billion in GB200s alone expected to ship next year. Perhaps analysts are waiting for signals the supply chain can produce these outsized orders. So far, so good with the signals we see from TSMC and SMCI’s most recent earnings reports. Foxconn commentary helps, as well.” Fast forward two months, and next year’s fiscal estimates stand at $185 billion up from $167 billion; showing no material impact from the delay (quite the opposite). Our firm was also able to use that same supply chain data to buy Nvidia in July/August, for an average cost basis of $109. The I/O Fund’s first trade was at $3.15, but we actively track the stock and publish our real-time trade alerts for anyone who feels they missed out on the AI juggernaut. The first item that will determine the strength of the upcoming earnings report from Nvidia has nothing to do with the Q3 results. Rather, what the market will want to know is how much Blackwell revenue is expected in the January quarter. Morgan Stanley has estimates placed at $5 to $6 billion, with this number hitting a ceiling due to supply constraints; however, Piper Sandler sees Blackwell revenue potentially higher, at $5 billion up to $8 billion. The bigger picture is that Blackwell will ramp by an order of magnitude, eventually exceeding Hopper’s revenue. To quantify this, Hopper has delivered approximately $125 billion in data center revenue since Q1 2023, based on estimates from Trend Force placing Hopper at generating 90% of data center revenue in 2024. Blackwell, on the other hand, is expected to deliver up to $210 billion next year alone, based on estimates for up to 60,000 to 70,000 GB200 NVL72 servers priced up to $3 million each. Given the company is lapping tough comparables, the growth rate will slow considerably even if Blackwell does ramp from $6 billion per quarter to $60 billion per quarter by late-2026 (Hopper is in its seventh quarter and Blackwell will be in its seventh quarter by late 2026).

Source: Beth_Kindig xAI Foxconn and Quanta are also both signaling strong demand for Blackwell come 2025. Foxconn has said that they see “crazy” demand for Blackwell servers, and forecast AI servers to make up half of their overall server business in 2025. Foxconn has said that initial shipments are on time for Q4 before ramping much faster in Q1, with Quanta saying the same, that initial shipments are on schedule and will ramp in Q1. Quanta sees triple-digit AI server growth through next year on the back of strong demand, with Deputy Spokesperson Carol Hsu saying that “recent capex guidance from top US hyperscalers also confirmed their aggressive spending on AI in 2025, all from a high base in 2024.” Nvidia is the subject of some of the most severe export restrictions from the US due to its integral role in advancing AI computing. Subsequently, the company’s China exposure is among the lowest in the semiconductor sector, leaving it less exposed should we see heightened geopolitical tensions — especially tariffs. Nvidia’s China revenue was 9.6% in Q1 and 12.2% in Q2, down from the low-20% range in the same quarters in fiscal 2024. For all of FY 2024, Nvidia’s China revenue was 16.9%, down from 21.5% the year prior. Other semi peers are much more heavily exposed to China: Broadcom’s China exposure was 32.2% in FY 2023, Intel’s exposure was above 27%, and Qualcomm and Marvell both had more than 40% of revenue stem from China in FY 2024. Although Nvidia’s fundamentals are a perfect 10, the stock is contending with weak peers, as evidenced by major semiconductor ETFs, SOXX and SMH, not making new highs with the S&P 500. Retail investors often find out the hard way, even the most perfect stock must contend with market forces beyond its control. This is the primary reason Nvidia’s stock may pullback as Nvidia is holding up the semiconductor market, which has grown unusually weak in the past few weeks. SOXX is 20% of its all-time highs and SMH is 14% of its all-time highs despite the S&P 500 making new highs. In a 1-hour webinar for I/O Fund Members last quarter, I discussed why this is an issue for AI investors and what I’d like to see before I resume buying Nvidia. My firm has become well-known for calling Nvidia an AI stock in 2018, and later stating Nvidia would Surpass Apple, and finally that Nvidia will reach a $10 trillion market cap by 2030. Yet, perhaps lesser-known is that I nailed the October 2022 bottom by stating Nvidia was Ready to Rumble on H100 GPUs along with a real-time trade alert for $10.80 on October 13th 2022 a mere 25 months ago. Here is what I stated at the exact moment Nvidia’s stock bottomed in October after selling off 60% following the August earnings report: “Today, Nvidia’s AI products serve nearly every enterprise company’s artificial intelligence and machine learning ambitions. The company has an impressive launch schedule starting in October for two flagship products – the RTX 40 Series and the H100 GPU. The timing of these releases is no coincidence as it’s a rapid two months following the crypto/gaming revenue miss. Suffice to say, Nvidia’s management team is prepared to rumble —- putting its very best release in gaming and its most powerful AI chip to-date up against the crypto mining selloff. If history is any indication, the turnaround will only be a matter of time.” The upcoming earnings report has a few similarities to October of 2022, which is that we are toward the end of a product cycle and the CFO cannot offer fiscal year guidance. Despite the H100s ramping and Nvidia having visibility into that ramp, the CFO was tight-lipped two years ago stating: “Our Data Center yes, we do expect it to grow. It may grow about what we just saw between Q1 and Q2. We’ll continue to look at it.” Therefore, I am not expecting much from the CFO on Blackwell in this report, but that lack of detail will be a distant memory this time next year. Make no mistake, Nvidia is the best stock of the decade and we are only four years in. The big picture is that Nvidia's trajectory will continue due to two words: pricing power. Our firm has an aggressive buy plan at key levels should the stock pullback, and we have a backup plan should the stock overcome the peer pressure we are seeing from SMH and meaningfully breakout.The keyword is “buy” but the skillset is patience. My firm has blended cutting-edge analysis alongside careful, patient buys for returns of 3280% since our first tranche. Most importantly, the I/O Fund continues to offer buy zones for those who’d like to participate. The I/O Fund first called out Nvidia’s AI opportunity in November 2018 with our first trade alert at $3.15 for returns of 3280%. We also provided 9 buy alerts from 2021 – 2022 to buy NVDA stock below $20. The I/O Fund has been closely analyzing lesser-known stocks in AI plus crypto with real-time trade alerts and webinars.

Title: MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor to pitch Bitcoin strategy to Microsoft’s board

Microsoft's cash-rich reserves could face a potential shift with Saylor's brief but powerful Bitcoin pitch. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Michael Saylor, prominent Bitcoin advocate and founder of MicroStrategy, will present a Bitcoin investment strategy to Microsoft’s board of directors next month. In a Nov. 19 VanEck-hosted X Space, Saylor shared that he has been allotted three minutes to make a case for Bitcoin investment to Microsoft’s board of directors. While Saylor agreed to the brief presentation, he noted that his separate request to discuss the matter with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has not yet been accepted. He stated: “The activist that put that [Bitcoin purchase] proposal together contacted to me to present to the board, and I agreed to provide a three-minute presentation.” The development comes after Saylor made headlines last month by offering to help Microsoft generate a trillion dollars using a Bitcoin-based treasury strategy. In the October X post, Saylor asked Nadella to call him if he wants “to make the next trillion dollars for MSFT shareholders.” This offer followed news that Microsoft shareholders would vote on a proposal to explore Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Microsoft’s board has recommended against adopting the proposal. However, market observers noted that key shareholders like Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street, and Fidelity would play pivotal roles in the firm’s eventual decision. Microsoft, holding $78 billion in cash reserves, has substantial investments in companies like Skype and OpenAI but has yet to allocate funds to Bitcoin or related assets. Saylor argues this strategy is short-sighted, urging tech giants like Microsoft, Apple, and Google to view Bitcoin as a superior alternative to cash reserves. Saylor said: “If Apple bought $100 billion of Bitcoin, it would likely grow to $500 billion, and the company would have a $500 billion business growing at 20% a year.” Under Saylor’s leadership, MicroStrategy has become the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with over 330,000 Bitcoin valued at approximately $30 billion. Saylor often emphasizes how adopting Bitcoin as a treasury strategy has enabled MicroStrategy to outperform broader markets, presenting a compelling case for other corporations to follow suit.

Title: Bitcoin ATH: As BTC touches $94K, will THESE factors boost it to $100K?

Bitcoin’s meteoric rise past $94,000 marks a turning point, driven by election-fueled hype and institutional adoption. Bitcoin [BTC] reached a new all-time high, surpassing $94,000 on the 19th of November, extending its remarkable rally that began after Donald Trump’s presidential election victory. The king coin has surged nearly 35% from around $70,000 on election night. Source: TradingView Bitcoin’s surge to an ATH of $94,000 — the coin’s price had dropped to the $92,000 mark at press time — has been driven by a confluence of short-term factors. The RSI climbed to 76.74, signaling strong bullish momentum yet entering overbought territory, suggesting potential caution for traders. OBV has risen sharply, reflecting sustained accumulation by large players, while trading volumes have remained robust, highlighting increased market activity. Media attention has played a pivotal role, with the presidential election sparking renewed interest in cryptocurrencies as speculative assets. The combination of increased mainstream visibility and institutional demand has fueled market enthusiasm. Speculation surrounding Bitcoin as a hedge against potential macroeconomic instability under Trump’s presidency has further amplified its rise. Additionally, whale activity in the market has been notable in the last few weeks, with large buy orders providing a foundation for the rally. However, with RSI approaching critical levels, traders may need to watch for consolidation or short-term corrections. While short-term catalysts have fueled Bitcoin’s recent surge, long-term factors have steadily supported its ascent. Over the past two months, institutional investments have surged, with asset managers like BlackRock increasing exposure to Bitcoin-backed ETFs, signaling growing mainstream acceptance. Corporate treasuries, including Tesla’s, have bolstered holdings as Bitcoin solidifies its status as a digital store of value. Adoption has also expanded, with major payment platforms integrating Bitcoin into retail transactions. Notably, during the presidential election, speculation around Trump’s policy stance on crypto regulation reignited interest. Additionally, reports of Trump Media & Technology Group’s discussions to acquire the Bakkt platform have amplified market optimism. This potential acquisition is seen as a move to integrate Bitcoin into mainstream financial and media ecosystems, further legitimizing its role in global markets and sustaining bullish sentiment. As Bitcoin basks in its historic rally, potential challenges lie ahead. Regulatory responses are expected to take center stage, with global policymakers likely to scrutinize the cryptocurrency’s rapid ascent. Trump’s administration could influence crypto regulations, either bolstering adoption or dampening sentiment depending on its approach. Meanwhile, market corrections are also on the radar. With the RSI in overbought territory and whale-driven momentum at risk of cooling, short-term pullbacks are a possibility. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024–2025 Many analysts have suggested that $90,000 could serve as a key support level, but any breach may spark a deeper correction. However, Bitcoin’s long-term fundamentals remain robust, providing a strong foundation for continued growth, even amidst short-term volatility.

Title: Pulling in top talent: The work perks that really matter
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/your-money/2024/11/20/the-work-perks-that-really-matter/
Time Published: 2024-11-20T06:00:00Z

From performance bonuses to babysitting, Deliveroo vouchers to doggy day care, employee benefits packages have got a whole lot more interesting. Big employers use headline-grabbing benefits to position themselves as desirable and to attract top talent. From carpooling to counselling, grocery delivery to co-working hub vouchers, some companies are even offering free babysitting to make sure knackered staff get out on date night. But which perks are worth the most, and how do you make sure you are getting everything available? In addition to salary, good benefits increase an employer’s chance of beating others to the best staff. Some benefits are arguably aimed at a specific demographic only, leaving other applicants cold. This may be a strategy. Would you be persuaded by seemingly generous doggy day-care vouchers and Just Eat delivery? These benefits signal that new hires can expect to be time-poor, unable to commit to mealtimes at home, or to responsibilities outside of work. They are likely to be aimed at attracting those for whom the office can be dominant in their lives — they won’t require being away from it much. If that’s where you are at, then these perks can pay off in the short term. A dog sitter in Dublin city for example is about €25 a day, or about €4,500 a year for someone in the office four days a week. Those travelling for business can expect to pay €35 for overnight dog sitting. If you’re offered food delivery credits as a perk, know that how you use them may be restricted. In October, staff at Meta in the US were fired for eating the meal at home instead of the office. Meta, like many big tech companies, offers free food to employees based out of its Silicon Valley headquarters. Staff in smaller offices without a canteen are offered Uber Eats or Grubhub credits, for example, for food to be delivered to the office. They are given daily allowances of $20 for breakfast, $25 for lunch and $25 for dinner. Employees who were getting the meals sent home when they were required to only eat the food in the office were fired. Some perks leave a bad taste. Less than one per cent of employers offer anything by way of childcare vouchers, says Trayc Keevans of Morgan McKinley survey. What’s the benefit the employees in Ireland most care about? No, it’s not doggy day care that’s really keeping us awake at night, but rather how to pay for our lives once we retire. Pension tops the list of the most desired benefits, according to a survey of 3,400 professionals and 650 employers globally as part of a 2024 report by recruiter Morgan McKinley. “We are seeing employees younger than ever before actually looking at pension,” says Trayc Keevans, Morgan McKinley Ireland’s global foreign direct investment director. “It wasn’t as important before, but in the most recent survey, right across the board, pension was an important benefit,” says Keevans. By 2046, Irish men can expect to live to 85 and women to 89. So if you retire at the current State pension age of 66, you’ll have about 20 years of living after your last pay cheque. [ Has Fingal County Council found a solution to Ireland’s housing crisis?Opens in new window ] If you start to save for retirement at age 30, on a salary of €40,000, you will need to set aside a minimum of 18 per cent of gross salary every year until age 66 to get an income of €2,000 a month in today’s money – and that’s including the State pension, according to Pensions Authority calculations. With parenthood and home ownership happening later than ever, the cost of supporting children and paying a mortgage is now stretching past retirement age. Housing costs mean more people will be renting in retirement too. This is bringing employer pension contributions into sharp focus for employees. Don’t just ask a prospective employer if there’s a pension, ask about the terms, says Keevan. Some are only finding out when it comes to contract signing that the terms are less generous than their current employer. Know the contribution from your current employer at least get that matched, says Keevans. Smaller companies will usually pay pension contributions of between 3 and 6 per cent, matching your contribution, she says. “Standard in a midsize to multinational company would be from 5 per cent matching up to manager level,” says Keevans. “Above that, a company might make contributions of anything up to 10 or 12 per cent. The larger multinationals will go even higher,” she says. “The best pension I have seen was a 19 per cent employer contribution, with the employee being asked to make a contribution of 4 per cent, bringing it up to 23 per cent.” Ask if pension entitlements increase as you climb the ranks. Employer pension contributions nudge up when you reach a certain age in some companies. Knowing this can help inform your job hunting. Paid private health insurance is the second most valued employee benefit, according to the Morgan McKinley research. A separate survey of 1,000 adults by Dooley Insurance Group puts health insurance top of the heap with 56 per cent of employees prioritising it. More than three in 10 of us didn’t go to a healthcare appointment because we could not afford it, according to an Irish Cancer Society survey last month [November]. One in four, meanwhile, felt we must prioritise other costs over healthcare. With the average adult paying €1,685 a year for health insurance, according to the Health Insurance Authority figures, this is a valuable perk for your health and your pocket. “We find at manager level and above, the policy covers the spouse and dependents as well,” says Keevans. Families with two adults and two children can pay up to €5,000 a year for insurance cover. You’ll need to earn about €10,000 to pay for that out of after-tax income. The cost isn’t the only benefit with paid health insurance, but rather access to basic treatment in a reasonable time frame. Almost two-fifths of people put off a medical appointment due to pressures in the system, according to the Irish Cancer Society survey. Working from home takes the third spot as the most valued employee benefit, says Morgan McKinley survey. Remote working was also highly rated by participants in the Dooley Insurances survey, with 35 per cent placing significant value on it. Remote working saves on transport and clothing costs. Coupled with flexible working, it may even enable some households to save on before and after-school care. This can mean significant savings. Only about a fifth of those eligible are claiming the remote work tax credit, according to Revenue figures. The credit for a year averages about €40 to €60, so there’s no boon here. The real pay-off is work-life balance, and job candidates are negotiating hard on this. “If they take a holiday in Spain every year, they might ask to tag on another few weeks and work from there, if that’s permissible,” says Keevans. “They are asking for a ‘work from anywhere’ policy in their contract that would allow them to do that. That’s quite attractive and we’ve seen a lot of people negotiate that.” Companies are still grappling with how many weeks an employee can work out of the country, before triggering tax liabilities there, she says. “Companies are tending to be quite conservative in guesstimating what that will be, the most we have seen is six weeks, but we see a lot of reluctance to it.” Flexibility around working patterns remains a prominent request. “Somebody might be joining a company where the standard is three days a week in the office, but it’s moving to four days. They might negotiate to move it back to three, but that can be difficult in the current climate,” says Keevans. New hires could negotiate an initial period of office time to get to build relationships and understand the culture, with that being reviewed, she says. Who doesn’t love a bonus? If this is part of the package, it’s important to understand what’s on offer. “Is it tied to your personal contribution and meeting personal performance metrics such as sales quotas, project milestones, performance reviews or KPIs? [key performance indicators]” says Keevans. “We see some employers and if the company isn’t performing, there’s no bonus for anyone and if it is performing, then the individual performance piece is cleared for payment,” she says. “The better you perform, the better chance you have of a bonus, but again, it tends to be predicated on the company performing first.” Exceptions to retain top talent can be made, rewarding them even when the company isn’t performing, she says. If a new employer needs you to join pronto, but that means missing out on the bonus at your old job, then negotiate on this. “They may pay you a sign-on bonus to offset what you are losing,” says Keevans. Shares can be great, but only if you know what to do with them. “In most cases, it’s a share purchase scheme that is offered. This is where you can buy shares in the company through salary sacrifice or bonus, usually at a discounted rate,” says David Looney or Alpha Wealth. Typically if these shares are held for three years, you don’t have to pay tax on the benefit, so the only tax due will be capital gains on any increase in their value if sold. Sometimes senior staff are offered stock options or restricted share units. Stock options are where you are allowed to buy a specific amount of shares at a fixed price in the future. If the share price is more than that price at the time you buy, happy days. Options usually have an expiration date, so a perk like this requires ongoing review to assess if it makes sense to buy at a particular time. Share prices can go up and down of course, and things can change quickly. You may benefit from independent financial advice. “We meet clients with little in their pensions, large mortgages and car loans, little in other savings and investments, and then have hundreds of thousands worth of Google stock that they are too afraid to sell,” says David Looney. “You can benefit from tax-free gains of €1,270 a year if selling, previous capital losses can be offset against gains too, but I would encourage anyone with a large amount of shares, six figures, to ignore this and put risk management above tax efficiency,” he says. Selling company stock and investing the proceeds in a more diversified way means all your eggs aren’t in your employer’s basket. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Further 12 abuse survivors at Spiritan schools have come forward since September’s scoping inquiry
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/2024/11/20/further-12-abuse-survivors-at-spiritan-schools-have-come-forward-since-septembers-scoping-inquiry/
Time Published: 2024-11-20T06:00:00Z
Full Content:
A further 12 survivors of abuse at Spiritan schools have come forward since the scoping inquiry discovered 347 allegations of child sex abuse at the five schools in September. The scoping inquiry report found that there were allegations made against 67 alleged abuses at the Spiritan-run schools: Blackrock College, St Mary’s College, St Michael’s College and Templeogue College in Dublin, and Rockwell College in Co Tipperary. The incidents of sexual abuse were among a total of 2,395 allegations of sexual abuse at 308 schools run by the religious orders. The abuse was mostly described as having occurred from the early 1960s to the early 1990s, with the highest number of reported incidents occurring in the early to mid-1970s. The latest additional cases are disclosed in a newsletter from Restore Together, a voluntary support group for victims/survivors of sexual abuse in the Spiritan schools. “It is a well-documented fact that sex abuse is underreported and that is especially true of non-recent male, child sex abuse. We are acutely aware that there are many people affected by abuse who need support but have not yet made the very difficult decision to come forward,” the group said. Supported by past pupils’ unions at the five Spiritan schools, Restore Together has highlighted the availability of help and support for abuse survivors through the Spiritan Schools’ Restorative Programme. “There is an entirely confidential listening ear” available to people who may need it, the group said. “Expert therapy and counselling from independent professionals are available to all impacted by abuse, in all Spiritan institutions,” with costs paid for by the Spiritans, it said. “Our collective responsibility is to ensure that no Spiritan survivor of abuse will be left behind,” they said. The scoping inquiry uncovered 130 allegations made against 24 alleged abusers at Willow Park, the primary school next to Blackrock College, and 55 allegations against 13 abusers at Blackrock College itself. The next highest number of allegations was 60 relating to 18 alleged abusers at Rockwell College. There were 32 allegations made against six alleged abusers at St Mary’s College in Rathmines; 10 against four alleged abusers at St Michael’s primary and post-primary school in Ballsbridge; and five allegations against two alleged abusers at Templeogue College. Thirty-seven additional allegations were made against the Spiritans that were not connected to any school. “Child sex abuse is the most abhorrent issue in the history of the Spiritan schools,” Restore Together said. It is “criminal in nature, and horrific in its scale and impact” and though it may have taken place decades ago, it “continues to torment victims/survivors daily and destroy their lives.” Restore Together is in ongoing negotiations with the Spiritans about a redress scheme for survivors of abuse in their institutions. “Considerable progress has been made in recent months and a proposed scheme is in the final stages of review,” the group said. The group expects to launch its own website before Christmas, at www.restoretogether.ie Patsy McGarry is a contributor to The Irish Times © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article Michael Saylor will share his insights on Bitcoin investment strategies in a three-minute presentation to Microsoft’s board of directors, following a proposal from the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR)—who urged Microsoft to consider Bitcoin investment. “The activist that put that proposal together contacted me to present to the board, and I agreed to provide a three-minute presentation,” said MicroStrategy co-founder during an X Spaces event hosted by VanEck. “I’m going to present it to the board of directors.” Saylor has publicly encouraged Microsoft to consider adding Bitcoin to its treasury. He believes it can make “the next trillion dollars” for Microsoft shareholders. Companies like Berkshire Hathaway, Apple, Google, and Meta (formerly Facebook) should discuss and evaluate Bitcoin as a potential investment, Saylor suggested, “because they all have huge hordes of cash, and they’re all burning shareholder value.” Microsoft shareholders are scheduled to vote on a proposal to consider adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet on December 10. Top shareholders include major financial institutions like Vanguard Group, BlackRock, State Street, and Fidelity Management & Research. Vanguard, a known crypto skeptic, has also invested in MicroStrategy’s stock (MSTR), as well as shares of other crypto firms like Coinbase and MARA Holdings. As of September 30, the asset management giant reported holding approximately 16 million MSTR shares. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy has led to huge stock price appreciation, outperforming Microsoft’s stock (MSFT) performance. According to data from Yahoo Finance, MicroStrategy’s stock jumped to a fresh record high at market close on Tuesday. It has skyrocketed 581% so far this year, while Microsoft’s stock has seen around 12% gains over the same timeframe. The NCPPR previously used MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy to persuade Microsoft leadership about Bitcoin buying tactics. They noted that the company’s share price had outperformed Microsoft’s. Microsoft’s board initially recommended voting against the proposal, stating they already “evaluate a wide range of investable assets,” including Bitcoin. While there is interest from certain shareholders, Microsoft’s top priority is artificial intelligence. However, Ethan Peck, deputy director of the NCPPR’s Free Enterprise Project, warned that the assessment could trigger a shareholder lawsuit if they decide not to invest in Bitcoin and the asset’s value subsequently rises.

Title: Asian shares cautious before Nvidia result, dollar gives back gains

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. By Chibuike Oguh and Amanda Cooper NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) -Global shares edged lower on Wednesday as markets weighed tensions between Russia and the West, while bitcoin hit a new record high and the dollar gained after three straight sessions of losses. Shares of Nvidia were down 0.4% in after-market trading after the artificial intelligence powerhouse forecast fourth-quarter revenue that was largely in line with analyst estimates. The stock of the world's most valuable company had closed down 0.8% in regular hours trading on Wednesday. Benchmark S&P 500 finished flat while the Dow gained and the Nasdaq ended lower. Healthcare, energy and materials stocks were the biggest gainers, while consumer discretionary, financials and technology equities were the biggest drag. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.32% to 43,408.47, the S&P 500 was flat at 5,917.11 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.11% to 18,966.14. The MSCI All-World index was down 0.16% to 847.84. European shares finished down 0.02%. "Nvidia is obviously a bellwether stock for the market and it seems to be down a little bit after market, but it wasn't a catastrophe by any stretch of the imagination," said James St. Aubin, chief investment officer at Ocean Park Asset Management in Santa Monica, California. "The bar keeps getting raised and raised and raised. But eventually it just becomes really difficult to exceed that bar. And I think that's kind of where we're at with Nvidia." Safe-haven assets such as gold and government bonds got a lift on Tuesday after news of Ukraine launching U.S.-made ATACMS missiles into Russia, and with Russia announcing it had lowered the threshold for nuclear action. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, however, later downplayed the nuclear threat, helping to calm markets. Gold prices climbed for a third consecutive session to mark a one-week high. Spot gold rose 0.69% to $2,649.89 an ounce. U.S. gold futures settled 0.8% higher at $2,651.70. Investors are also watching President-elect Donald Trump's pick for Treasury secretary, which may come as soon as Wednesday. Markets were realizing that some of Trump policies, including tariffs and deportations, could be inflationary, said Lukasz Tomicki, founding partner at LRT Capital in Austin, Texas. "There's been this belief that Trump's policies will be inflationary and we've seen the spike in yields since his election," Tomicki said. The dollar index rose 0.54% to 106.68, snapping three consecutive sessions of losses but still below one-year highs. It has gained nearly 3% since the Nov. 5 U.S. general election. The dollar was last up 0.48% against the yen at 155.40. Against the Swiss franc, the dollar was up 0.2% at 0.88410. The Chinese yuan weakened against the greenback after the central bank held benchmark lending rates steady, as widely expected. In the offshore market, the yuan was down 0.22% against the dollar at 7.251. Bitcoin, which hit a fresh record high just shy of $95,000, was up 2.53% at $94,579.01. The price has risen by well over 30% since Trump's election, buoyed by expectations that he will create a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment. The gains in bitcoin have been aided by a Financial Times report that Trump Media and Technology Group, which operates Truth Social and is majority-owned by Trump, is close to an all-stock acquisition of crypto trading firm Bakkt. Oil prices settled lower after U.S. crude and gasoline stocks rose by more than expected last week. Brent crude futures for January settled 0.68% at $72.81. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures for December expired on Wednesday, and settled down 0.75% at $68.87, while the more active WTI contract for January settled down 0.71% at $68.75.

Title: Keysight Technologies, Inc. (KEYS): Unveils AI-Enhanced EDA Software Portfolio to Revolutionize Next-Gen Technology Design

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News Investors Can’t Afford to Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Keysight Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:KEYS) stands against the other AI stocks investors can't afford to miss. According to a famous Wall Street brokerage Goldman Sachs, the S&P 500 index will reach 6,500 by the end of 2025. The US economy and corporate earnings are expected to continue growing, a key factor driving the optimism behind this forecast. Another brokerage, Morgan Stanley, has made a similar prediction, stating that US earnings will continue to grow in 2025. This can be expected if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates next year and there are signs of a stronger business cycle. The 'Magnificent 7' stocks, which are key tech giants leading in AI innovation, are likely to outperform the rest of the 493 companies in the benchmark index next year, Goldman notes. The outperformance, however, is only predicted to be by 7 percentage points, the slimmest margin in seven years. READ NOW: 15 AI News Stories Shaking Up Wall Street and 15 AI News That Broke The Internet As companies increasingly leverage artificial intelligence to drive growth, the pivotal role that AI technology is playing in influencing market trends becomes increasingly undeniable. In the latest news, AI-powered search engine Perplexity is reportedly taking a jab at some of the tech giants by launching its very own shopping feature that it claims is a “one-stop solution where you can research and purchase products.” “You can use it to research and make purchases on all things like building your library, buying electronics for throwing a party, and so on,” The shopping tool allows users to enter queries, refine results, and includes features such as one-click checkout. Its major point of differentiation, however, is that it describes its results as “unbiased recommendations” that are powered by AI and based on in-platform reviews. “When you ask Perplexity a shopping question, you’ll still get the precise, objective answers you expect, plus easy-to-read product cards showing the most relevant items, along with key details presented in a simple, visual format.” In other news, Coca-Cola is facing backlash with an AI-made advertisement. Originally meant to pay homage to a classic 1995 commercial, many creatives have drawn criticism, stating that it is distasteful for the company to use AI technology to create the video instead of the work of artists. As per Forbes, the video was created by three AI studios, namely Secret Level, Silverside AI, and Wild Card, and used four different generative AI models. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A technician examining a complex circuit board in a semiconductor development lab. Market Capitalization: $26.28 billion Keysight Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:KEYS) is a global technology company that provides electronic design and test solutions that support the development and optimization of AI-driven technologies. On November 18, Keysight Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:KEYS) announced the launch of their new Electronic Design Automation (EDA) software portfolio that transforms the way engineers handle challenges related to next-generation technologies. Their suite of EDA leverages artificial intelligence, machine learning, and Python integrations; speeding up the design process and time taken for complex RF and chiplet products. In turn, this enables easier development of advanced solutions for 5G/6G and data center applications. “AI is transforming how engineers approach complex design challenges. Automating traditionally time-intensive tasks enables engineers to focus on innovation rather than repetitive refinements, resulting in real productivity gains. The foundation for the practical application of AI and ML is first having an open, interoperable workflow and then providing turn-key solutions tuned for specific applications. It's a fascinating time, and AI and ML will undoubtedly be a huge driver of design innovation in the future”. Overall KEYS ranks 5th on our list of the AI stocks investors can't afford to miss. While we acknowledge the potential of KEYS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than KEYS but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

In the latest news, AI-powered search engine Perplexity is reportedly taking a jab at some of the tech giants by launching its very own shopping feature that it claims is a “one-stop solution where you can research and purchase products.” “You can use it to research and make purchases on all things like building your library, buying electronics for throwing a party, and so on,” The shopping tool allows users to enter queries, refine results, and includes features such as one-click checkout. Its major point of differentiation, however, is that it describes its results as “unbiased recommendations” that are powered by AI and based on in-platform reviews. “When you ask Perplexity a shopping question, you’ll still get the precise, objective answers you expect, plus easy-to-read product cards showing the most relevant items, along with key details presented in a simple, visual format.” In other news, Coca-Cola is facing backlash with an AI-made advertisement. Originally meant to pay homage to a classic 1995 commercial, many creatives have drawn criticism, stating that it is distasteful for the company to use AI technology to create the video instead of the work of artists. As per Forbes, the video was created by three AI studios, namely Secret Level, Silverside AI, and Wild Card, and used four different generative AI models.

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/19/2024 5:01:59 PM PST by xxqqzz Blackstone has agreed to buy Jersey Mike’s Subs, the sandwich chain said Tuesday, in a deal that a source said valued the company at around $8 billion, including debt. Reuters had reported on Monday, citing a person familiar with the matter, that Blackstone was nearing a deal for Jersey Mike’s. The deal, which is expected to close in early 2025, underscores private equity (PE) firms’ increasing interest in franchise operators. Last year, PE firm Roark Capital agreed to buy Subway, Jersey Mike’s bigger rival, in a deal valued at up to $9.55 billion. Jersey Mike’s, known for its submarine sandwiches, traces its roots back to 1956 when Cancro started working at the company’s Point Pleasant, NJ., location, which was founded as Mike’s Subs. Cancro acquired the location in 1975 and began franchising units in 1987. Since then, Jersey Mike’s has grown into one of the major fast-casual restaurant chains in America with over 3,000 locations nationwide open and in development. “We believe we are still in the early innings of Jersey Mike’s growth story and that Blackstone is the right partner to help us reach even greater heights,” Jersey Mike’s founder and CEO Peter Cancro said.

Title: New judge to hear Rosmah’s case
URL: https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2024/11/20/new-judge-to-hear-rosmahs-case
Time Published: 2024-11-19T23:00:00Z
Full Content:
Wednesday, 20 Nov 2024 KUALA LUMPUR: The US$346mil lawsuit filed by 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) against Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor over the alleged purchase of luxury goods using 1MDB monies will be heard before a different judge. This is following Judicial Commissioner Leong Wai Hong allowing Rosmah’s application to recuse him from presiding over the case. In a brief decision yesterday, Leong said he recused himself on the principle of justice. In Rosmah’s supporting affidavit, she stated that the judicial commissioner was a partner and head of litigation and arbitration at law firm Messrs Skrine between 2011 and 2021. Rosmah contended that at the material time at Skrine, which acted for the plaintiff in the present case, the law firm had relations to lawsuits including investigation into 1MDB and her husband, Datuk Seri Najib Razak, who was the prime minister then. “After considering the application, I agree to recuse myself from hearing this suit on the principle that justice must not only be done but must also be seen to be done. “In the premise, I allow the application. This suit will be heard before another High Court judge,” Leong said. This is the second time Rosmah applied for the recusal of the judge in the lawsuit. She, however, failed in her first recusal application. On Sept 9, High Court judge Justice Adlin Abdul Majid dismissed Rosmah’s recusal application, stating that Rosmah failed to prove any real danger of bias if she continues to preside over the civil suit. Justice Adlin said she was in charge of the corporate division when she was with the law firm Lee Hishammuddin Allen & Gledhill (LHAG), while all affairs related to 1MDB were handled by the legal division. It is understood that Justice Adlin was transferred to New Commercial Courts (NCC) from the Civil division, resulting in the lawsuit being brought before Leong. On May 9, 1MDB, SRC International Sdn Bhd and nine subsidiaries filed the civil lawsuit against Rosmah and another individual seeking US$346mil belonging to the company. The plaintiffs claimed that Rosmah had used the funds from the companies to purchase luxury items such as jewellery, watches and handbags. Apart from 1MDB and SRC, other plaintiffs are 1MDB Energy Holdings Ltd, 1MDB Energy Ltd, 1MDB Energy (Langat) Ltd and Global Diversified Investment Company Ltd (formerly 1MDB Global Investments Ltd). The other plaintiffs also include Affinity Equity International Partners Ltd, Alsen Chance Holdings Ltd, Blackrock Commodities (Global) Ltd, Blackstone Asia Real Estate Partners Ltd and Brightstone Jewellery Ltd. They named Rosmah as first defendant and Shabnam Naraindas Daswani (known as Natasha Mirpuri) as second defendant. They claimed Shabnam, who is based in Singapore, had purchased or procured the luxury items on Rosmah’s behalf. The plaintiffs claimed that funds from 1MDB and its subsidiaries were channelled to various offshore entities – including Affinity Equity, Alsen Chance, Blackrock Commodities, Blackstone Asia and Brightstone Jewellery – before being paid out to 48 different vendors based in 14 jurisdictions for the luxury goods. They further claimed the goods sought were “traceable substitute” of 1MDB and its subsidiaries’ trust property, thus the plaintiffs had an equitable proprietary interest in the luxury goods. They are seeking a court declaration that they have an equitable proprietary interest in the good and traceable proceeds in the hands of Rosmah as well as an order for Rosmah to pay the first until the sixth plaintiffs a sum of US$346mil.

Title: Bitcoin Hits Fresh Record High Above $94,000 As Spot Bitcoin ETF Options Trading Kicks Off
URL: https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-hits-fresh-record-high-above-94000-as-spot-bitcoin-etf-options-trading-kicks-off/

Full Content:
The price of Bitcoin punched past another all-time high above the $94,000 mark on Tuesday after options trading on spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) officially went live, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) product kicking things off. BlackRock and other asset managers have been seeking to list and trade options for their spot BTC ETFs following the Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval of nearly a dozen Bitcoin ETFs in January. Although the SEC greenlighted the listing and trading options for the IBIT in September, the approval by the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) on Monday represented the last major hurdle before their launch today. “A few hundred million so far in options volume on IBIT (a ton for day one),” Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas wrote in a post on X. Balchunas also pointed out that the huge majority of the contracts were calls, suggesting bets that BTC’s price would continue rocketing. According to industry pundit and head of growth at Bitcoin custody firm Theya, Joe Consorti, the launch of options trading on spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds is a huge boon for the top crypto as additional liquidity could unlock a fresh tsunami of institutional and retail investors. “The floodgates for Bitcoin’s next evolution in financial markets are about to open. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETF options, specifically for the IBIT vehicle, marks the beginning of a new era for price dynamics, volatility, and institutional adoption,” Consorti posited in a Nov. 19 post on X. Spot bitcoin ETF options begin trading on the Nasdaq tomorrow.Here's why it matters.[B2YB @TheyaBitcoin] pic.twitter.com/BgDXmXI66M Consorti noted that options are the cornerstone of capital markets as they offer liquidity, risk management tools, and price discovery, specifically for institutional investors that “drive a lot of the core of the market.” “This matters because, in traditional markets, derivatives are 10 to 20 times the size of the underlying market cap,” he explained, before adding that with Bitcoin, listed derivatives are less than 1% of the $1.8 trillion spot market cap. Consorti stated that Bitcoin derivatives are considerably underdeveloped, which hampers the market’s maturity. There is a massive demand for these products from institutional investors to hedge their positions. The expert further said that the majority of Bitcoin derivatives are traded offshore or over the counter on platforms like Deribit, which currently boasts over $30 billion in open interest, while US investors remain sidelined. The US stock market is currently the world’s biggest and most liquid, consisting of 45% of the $110 trillion global stock market, he observed, adding: “Listing options on Bitcoin ETFs brings BTC into the largest capital market in the world and unlocks unprecedented opportunities because of this, namely liquidity in depth.” Retail investors that previously had no access can now foray into the Bitcoin derivatives market, increasing the user base considerably. Bitcoin reached a new peak of $94,040.99 early today per data from CoinGecko. At press time, the BTC price had retraced slightly to $93,567.61, still up 2.6% over the past 24 hours. The market cap of the benchmark crypto has now swelled to as high as $1.85 trillion.

As DOGE shows absolute correlation with Bitcoin, Ethereum strays further to a three-year low. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate.

Bitcoin (BTC) reached a new all-time high of $93,970.91 on Nov. 19, roughly $500 above its previous price peak less than a week ago. BTC rose 3% over the past 24 hours. According to CryptoSlate data, Solana (SOL) closely followed Bitcoin’s performance, with a 2.7% price increase, reaching $244 at the time of publication. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) stood still with a 0.1% drawdown in the same period, priced at $3,128.78. Notably, ETH has accumulated a negative 5% performance over the past seven days, despite its spot exchange-traded funds (ETF) net flows becoming positive recently. Ki Young Ju, founder and CEO of CryptoQuant, highlighted that ETH reached a three-year low correlation with BTC, as the pair’s Pearson correlation coefficient reached 0.3 points. He added: “Just because BTC is strong doesn’t mean you should buy ETH. Each asset is now following its own path.” The Pearson Correlation Coefficient tracks the relation between two variables, ranging from -1 to 1. The closer the relation gets to 1 point, the more positively correlated the variables are. On the other hand, Dogecoin (DOGE) maintains its bullish momentum, rising 10.7% daily to $0.408, its highest price since early June 2021. According to DefiLlama, DOGE’s correlation with BTC has been 0.99 over the past month. The new price peak comes amid boosted optimism following the start of options trading on BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas pointed out that the ratio between calls and puts on IBIT’s options closed at 0.17. This ratio means much more interest in calls than puts, which is a bullish setup. He added: “For context, this ratio for $SPY is 1.1 and $TSLA is .59 while $TLT is .79.” In the first hours of trading, IBIT’s options registered over $446 million in volume, which Balchunas called “a ton” for an opening trading day.

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. A Walmart in Miami, Florida. The US retail giant reported robust third-quarter results this week. Photo / Getty Images via AFP Lex is the flagship investment column of the Financial Times and has been published since 1945. OPINION It is a rare retailer whose shares trade at a premium to those of Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet. But there are merchants, and then there is Walmart. Operationally, the 800-pound gorilla of American retail is in a class of its own. While others have struggled to entice inflation-weary consumers to open their wallets, comparable sales at Walmart US grew 5.3% during the third quarter. That handily trounced expectations for a 3.7% rise, which is no small feat given Walmart’s size. It pulled in US$648 billion ($1.096 trillion) in revenue last year. Adding to the flex, Walmart upped its full-year guidance for a second time this year. True, the stock itself is no bargain after climbing nearly 64% this year. It trades on a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 33. That beats not only direct rival Target, but also Google parent Alphabet, Facebook owner Meta Platforms and smartphone supremo Apple, according to financial markets data provider London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG). But this premium is deserved. Walmart has navigated the challenges of a lukewarm economy and inflation with aplomb by drawing in higher income customers and growing alternative revenue streams. It continued to take market shares from rivals in both groceries and general merchandise during the third quarter. Upper-income households making US$100,000 ($169,000) a year or more accounted for about three-quarters of the share gains during that period, the company said. Operating profit is also growing faster than sales thanks to its array of higher-margin side businesses. These include a third-party online marketplace, digital advertising and an Amazon Prime-like membership scheme called Walmart Plus. All these are fast growing and more profitable. This has allowed Walmart to keep prices low on food — and even cut them — to drive traffic and put pressure on rivals. Few other bricks-and-mortar retailers can claim to be able to do the same. Tighter inventory management also contributed to the rise in gross margins during the quarter. A strong dollar and proposed tariff plans touted by President-elect Donald Trump are some of the potential issues that could hurt Walmart. About a fifth of its sales come from outside the United States and the greenback’s rise this year could reduce the value of its non-dollars earnings abroad. But these should be more than manageable. Walmart’s size and diversified business model mean it has managed nearly a decade of uninterrupted like-for-like sales growth. It may not grow as fast as tech, but its prospects do not rely on having to invent whole new business models — and there are fewer regulators with an itch to break it up. Its shares are unlikely to find themselves in the clearance aisles anytime soon. © Financial Times Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.

Title: Nvidia Stock Earnings Preview: What To Know Before The Report

Time Published: 2024-11-19T20:22:18Z

Copyright 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved Nvidia’s (NVDA) upcoming earnings report has the tech world buzzing. This article dives into the significance of the report, key drivers of Nvidia’s growth, and what investors should watch for. This preview of Nvidia stock earnings explores key aspects investors should consider, from recent financial performance to AI's growing role in driving growth. Nvidia’s earnings report, which is scheduled to be released on November 20, carries immense weight for the company and the tech industry as a whole. The stakes are high for Nvidia stock earnings, as the company leads the AI revolution, making its results a key barometer for the tech industry. As the backbone of AI hardware, Nvidia drives innovation across sectors like data centers, gaming and autonomous vehicles. A strong report not only bolsters investor confidence but also sets a benchmark for competitors like AMD and Intel, influencing the broader market outlook. The AI boom has propelled Nvidia into the spotlight, with its GPUs powering generative AI models like ChatGPT. Analysts view the earnings report as a litmus test for the sustainability of Nvidia’s dominance in this space. With increasing reliance on AI, the report’s outcomes could ripple through related industries, affecting investment trends and corporate strategies. Nvidia’s recent financial results have been a showcase of its dominance in the AI and semiconductor industries. In the previous quarter, the company reported record revenues of $30.04 billion, up 122.4% year over year. The surge was largely driven by AI demand, with data center revenue contributing more than 70% of the total. The recent growth trajectory of NVDA stock earnings demonstrates robust demand across AI and gaming sectors, boosting confidence in its market leadership. Gaming revenue also showed signs of recovery, rebounding 22% year over year, reflecting the easing of macroeconomic pressures. Nvidia’s consistent profitability and strong gross margins—above 70%—further underscore its operational excellence. For more insights on Nvidia's future, explore Nvidia in five years.

Unlock Premium Access — Free For 25 Days. Nvidia’s cutting-edge GPUs remain critical for AI model training and deployment. With companies investing heavily in AI infrastructure, the continued demand for Nvidia’s A100, H100 chips and Blackwell, will likely play a pivotal role in this quarter’s performance. While demand remains robust, any disruption in chip production or supply chain logistics could constrain Nvidia’s ability to meet orders. Recent geopolitical tensions add to these uncertainties. With inflation moderating, consumer spending on gaming hardware is picking up, which could positively influence Nvidia’s gaming division. However, a potential slowdown in enterprise IT spending could temper overall growth. Those impacting export licenses could significantly influence NVDA stock earnings, especially given its reliance on Chinese markets. AI has become the crown jewel of Nvidia’s growth strategy. The company’s GPUs are the backbone of AI models used in everything from chatbots to advanced analytics. Generative AI, in particular, has catapulted demand, with Nvidia benefiting from its early investments in AI-centric architectures. Data centers represent another growth engine. Nvidia’s dominance in this space, with products like the DGX SuperPOD, has solidified its position as the go-to provider for scalable AI infrastructure. Revenue from this segment has consistently surpassed expectations, demonstrating the increasing reliance of enterprises on Nvidia’s technology. AI-driven advancements continue to propel Nvidia stock earnings, as the company solidifies its leadership in GPUs for large-scale computing and AI applications. The gaming sector, once Nvidia’s bread and butter, continues to be a key contributor to its revenue. The company’s RTX 40 series GPUs have been well-received, boosting revenue in recent quarters. Post-pandemic, the gaming industry experienced a slowdown, but recent data suggests a recovery. The resurgence of the gaming market has contributed positively to NVDA stock earnings, with the RTX 40 series outperforming competitor offerings. Nvidia’s efforts to optimize its products for gamers while capitalizing on AI-enhanced gaming experiences have positioned it favorably in this evolving market. In the race for AI dominance, Nvidia has maintained a significant lead over competitors like AMD and Intel. Its proprietary CUDA platform and robust ecosystem give it a clear edge in AI training and inference workloads. While AMD has made strides with its MI300 chips, they have yet to achieve the widespread adoption Nvidia enjoys. Similarly, Intel faces delays in delivering competitive GPU solutions. This disparity reinforces Nvidia’s leadership in both innovation and market share.

Analysts anticipate Nvidia to report earnings of $0.75 per share on revenues of $33.12 billion, marking another record-breaking quarter. Analysts forecast robust figures for Nvidia stock earnings and growth, which reflects surging demand for AI-driven technologies and expanding market penetration. However, the projections come with a caveat: Nvidia’s high valuation means any miss could lead to significant market volatility. As a result, investor expectations are tempered with caution despite the bullish outlook. Historically, NVDA stock earnings drive volatility, as investors anticipate results from Nvidia's high-growth markets like AI and gaming. Nvidia’s stock tends to rally in the weeks leading up to earnings announcements, driven by optimism around its performance. However, the stock also sees heightened volatility, reflecting mixed sentiment among traders and institutional investors. Recent trading sessions suggest a cautious yet positive trend, with Nvidia shares holding steady near all-time highs. Investor sentiment surrounding Nvidia remains overwhelmingly bullish, with analysts largely assigning "Buy" ratings. Consensus price target by analysts for NVDA stock stands at $160.38 currently. Bullish sentiment around NVDA earnings reflects confidence in Nvidia’s AI capabilities and broader growth outlook. Firms like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs have reiterated their confidence in Nvidia, citing its leadership in AI and robust revenue growth. However, concerns about valuation and macroeconomic risks have tempered enthusiasm among some investors, who worry about potential downside if growth slows. While AI is a growth driver, Nvidia’s dependence on this single sector makes it vulnerable to any slowdown in AI adoption or spending. As a major chip exporter, Nvidia is exposed to trade restrictions and regulatory challenges, particularly concerning China. Regulatory restrictions on exports to China remain a key factor that could dampen Nvidia stock earnings. Although currently dominant, advances by AMD and Intel could erode Nvidia’s market share if the company fails to maintain its innovation pace. The growing adoption of AI across industries ensures a long runway for Nvidia’s growth. From healthcare to finance, the company’s GPUs are pivotal in enabling AI-driven transformations. Nvidia’s DRIVE platform is gaining traction among automakers, offering another lucrative growth avenue. As the metaverse concept evolves, Nvidia’s Omniverse platform positions it to capitalize on this next wave of digital innovation. For a deeper analysis of Nvidia's long-term potential, read Nvidia in 5 years. Nvidia’s earnings report is poised to reflect its dominance in the AI and data center markets. While risks persist, the company’s robust growth trajectory and leadership in innovation make it a stock to watch closely. Investors should prepare for potential volatility as Nvidia navigates its high-stakes earnings season. Nvidia’s earnings reports often lead to significant stock price movements due to its high valuation and investor interest in its growth story. The data center and gaming sectors are Nvidia’s largest revenue drivers, with data centers recently accounting for over 70% of total revenue. Nvidia maintains a strong lead over AMD and Intel in AI and data center markets, thanks to its advanced GPUs and robust ecosystem. With strong demand for AI, data centers, and gaming hardware, Nvidia’s growth trajectory appears sustainable, barring macroeconomic disruptions. Key risks include overreliance on AI, geopolitical tensions, and increasing competition from AMD and Intel.

Title: The S&P 500 is about to have a big year, Goldman Sachs says — even without the 'Magnificent 7'
URL: https://qz.com/goldman-sachs-s-p-500-magnificent-seven-1851703165

After Morgan Stanley’s (MS+2.48%) bullish outlook, another financial giant has joined the optimistic chorus for the S&P 500 in 2025. What’s more, it expects the growth of the S&P 500 to occur without relying on the outperformance of the Magnificent Seven, marking a notable shift in market dynamics. On Tuesday, Goldman Sachs’ (GS+2.42%) chief U.S. equity strategist, David Kostin, released a report projecting an 11% rise in the S&P 500, with the index expected to hit 6,500 by the end of 2025. This aligns closely with Morgan Stanley’s forecast, which set the same target just a day earlier. Goldman’s analysts anticipate that the dominance of the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks — Apple Inc. (AAPL-0.19%), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT-0.42%), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN-2.26%), Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL-4.71%) (the parent company of Google), Meta Platforms Inc. (META-0.42%) (formerly Facebook), Nvidia Corp. (NVDA+0.59%) and Tesla Inc. (TSLA-0.70%) — may taper off in 2025. While these companies have driven significant market gains in recent years, analysts suggest that their influence might narrow as broader sectors contribute more evenly to market growth. The “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks have significantly outpaced the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500 over the past few years. In 2023, these seven companies delivered a remarkable 63 percentage points of outperformance over the rest of the index and have continued their dominance in 2024, outperforming by 22 percentage points year-to-date. However, this gap is expected to narrow in 2025. According to consensus estimates, the outperformance margin is projected to shrink to just seven percentage points. Similarly, the earnings per share (EPS) growth premium enjoyed by the Magnificent Seven is expected to narrow significantly in 2025. In 2024, the seven tech giants outpaced the rest of the S&P 500 by a robust 30 percentage points in EPS growth. However, this advantage is forecasted to shrink dramatically, with the EPS growth premium for the Magnificent Seven expected to compress to just 6 percentage points in 2025. This slowdown signals a broader market transition, with other sectors poised to deliver stronger performance and gradually erode the dominance of these high-flying tech stocks. It suggests a potential diversification of market leadership, as contributions to overall growth become more evenly distributed across a wider range of industries in the coming year.

IBIT traded 73,000 options contracts in the first 60 mins of trading Tuesday, Nasdaq told CNBC, placing the fund in the top 20 of the most active nonindex options. Options trading allows investors to play bitcoin's notorious volatility by letting them buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price based on whether they anticipate the price will rise or fall in a given period. "Bitcoin has a lively derivatives market, but in the U.S. it is still tiny compared to other asset classes, and is largely limited to institutional players," said Noelle Acheson, economist and author of the "Crypto is Macro Now" newsletter. "A deeper onshore derivatives market will enhance the growing market sophistication. This will reinforce investor confidence in the asset, bringing in new cohorts while enabling a greater variety of investment and trading strategies … [That] should, all else being equal, dampen both volatility and downside." The market for options contracts on major ETFs can be extremely active, and are widely used by more sophisticated traders. For example, over the past five business days, Interactive Brokers clients have more options orders on the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) and the SDPR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) than for the funds themselves, according to data from the brokerage. The launch of the bitcoin ETF options will likely also lead to new funds that incorporate those options, said Todd Sohn, ETF strategist at Strategas. "Grayscale already did a filing for a covered call [fund], and I'm sure BlackRock will come out with it too. And then we're going to get buffers, and then we're going to get whatever other trend-following-type strategy that folks think of. I think the ecosystem's really going to start to fly here," Sohn said. Spot bitcoin ETFs began trading in January and have been hailed as the most successful ETF launches in history. Other bitcoin ETFs are expected to have options available as soon as this week. Last month, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the rule changes filed by the New York Stock Exchange, which lists the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) and the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), and Cboe Global Markets, which lists the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB).

Title: Nvidia stock rises on AI spending, chip deal ahead of earnings

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose nearly 5% on Tuesday, following bullish notes from Wall Street analysts citing strong chip demand ahead of its earnings report set for Wednesday afternoon. In a client note this week, Stifel analyst Ruben Roy raised his price target on Nvidia to $180 from $165, while Truist Securities' William Stein raised his price outlook to $167 from $148. Roy cited "a diverse set of data points," including continued high spending on AI infrastructure by hyperscalers and demand for Nvidia's latest Blackwell AI chips. "We believe that NVDA is well positioned in markets that combine to yield an overall TAM [total addressable market, or revenue opportunity] of more than $100 billion exiting 2025 and a longer-term opportunity funnel that could approach $1 trillion,” Roy wrote. Nvidia stock also rose on news that one of its customers, cloud provider Nebius Group (NBIS), is launching its first GPU cluster in the US, which will use up to 35,000 Nvidia chips. A GPU cluster is a network of graphics processing units, or AI chips, with massive compute power used to train and run artificial intelligence software. For reference, Nebius' order of 35,000 Nvidia chips is equivalent to about 4% of the volume of Hopper AI chips Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia to have shipped in the October period, Bloomberg consensus data shows. Nvidia declined to comment on the deal. Nvidia stock’s climb comes a day after shares fell on a report by the Information about overheating issues with its Blackwell AI servers. In August, Nvidia was reportedly dealing with design flaws related to the individual Blackwell chips themselves, which prompted the company to push back the chips' production ramp to the January quarter. Nvidia has not confirmed overheating issues with its Blackwell servers, and the company told Yahoo Finance Monday that "the engineering iterations are normal and expected." Truist Securities’ Stein said of the overheating issues reported this week, “Conversations with our industry contacts don't precisely corroborate this latest data point, but they do reflect supply chain challenges around the production ramp.” Despite reported Blackwell issues, Dell Technologies (DELL) said it has already shipped its latest AI hardware product, the PowerEdge system, with Nvidia’s latest GB200 NVL72 systems. “[C]ommentary from NVDA, partners, and our industry contacts feel overwhelmingly positive,” Stein wrote in a note to investors. He pointed to emerging demand for Nvidia chips in the robotics and “traditional” computing sectors as well as that from AI software developers. KeyBanc analysts took a more cautious outlook on Nvidia ahead of earnings, lowering their earnings and revenue outlook for Nvidia for the January quarter, citing a squeeze on demand in China for Nvidia H20 chips. "We believe H20 demand in China is getting pushed out as there is increased pressure among China hyperscalers to use domestic AI solutions," they wrote in a note on Tuesday. They also stated fears that Nvidia’s latest Blackwell chips could cannibalize Nvidia's prior-generation Hopper chips. "Regarding H200, we are hearing that some demand is getting pushed out given the availability of Blackwell (B200)." KeyBanc lowered its fiscal fourth quarter sales guidance for Nvidia to $37.7 billion from $40 billion and its earnings outlook to $0.83 per share from its prior guidance of $0.88 per share. Still, KeyBanc maintained its Overweight rating on the stock and its price target of $180. Overall, analysts see Nvidia’s adjusted quarterly earnings rising 85% from the year-ago period to $0.74 per share and revenue rising roughly 84% to $33.2 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. About 90% of Wall Street analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on X @LauraBratton5.

Getting this powerful technology to actually work well with the digital assistant is a monumental challenge that's been plagued by gnarly technical problems and repeated delays. Customer-friction concerns, partnership hiccups, compatibility questions, latency problems, and accuracy issues have snarled progress, according to internal Amazon documents and multiple people involved in the project. The Alexa team is under immense pressure to get something out. A decade ago it launched with Echo speakers and became a household name. But that early success fizzled and the business has so far failed to become profitable, leading to drastic cutbacks and layoffs in recent years. Some company insiders consider this AI moment to be a seismic opportunity for Alexa, and potentially the last chance to reignite consumer interest in the voice assistant through the power of large language models. A product of this scale is "unprecedented, and takes time," an Amazon spokesperson told Business Insider. "It's not as simple as overlaying an LLM onto the Alexa service." One of the main challenges facing the new Alexa relates to how the digital assistant will interact with other companies and services, and who is responsible for customers if their requests, orders, and payments don't go smoothly. In late August, Amazon was working on integrating 8 third-party applications, including Uber and Ticketmaster, into the upcoming AI-powered Alexa to handle various user inquiries. At that time, the goal was to launch the new Alexa around mid-October, according to one of the internal documents obtained by Business Insider. However, it was still unclear which companies would be responsible for customer support issues, like payment and delivery errors, this document stated. The lack of clarity could cause Amazon to send "frequent" customer contacts to the partner companies. Then, those partners would sometimes redirect the users back to Amazon, the document explained. "This level of support would cause significant customer friction, when some of the orders/purchases are time-sensitive (meal orders or rideshare trips) and purchase mistakes can be expensive (e.g. buy Taylor Swift tickets)," the document said, assigning it a "RED" warning. Snafus like this have caused Amazon to push back the release date, almost on a weekly basis, according to some of the people involved in the project, which has been codenamed "Banyan" or "Remarkable Alexa." BI's sources asked not to be identified because they're not authorized to talk to the press. For example, without more clearly defined responsibilities with third-party partners, Amazon expected further delays in the launch. "Alignment on customer support plans between Product teams and the 3P partners may push this timeline further out if any delays occur," one of the documents warned. The company had once planned for a June launch, but after repeated delays, it told employees late last month that the new Alexa would launch "no earlier" than November 20, one of the documents said. A few of people BI spoke with recently are even talking about the Alexa upgrade rolling out in early 2025, which would miss the key holiday period. Bloomberg earlier reported on a 2025 launch plan. As of late October, Amazon had not settled on an official brand for the updated voice assistant, and instructed employees to simply call it the "new Alexa" until further notice, one of the documents said. To be sure, Alexa has significant long-term potential in the generative AI era — as long as Amazon can iron out problems relatively quickly. Time is of the essence, partly because the existing Alexa business has lost momentum in recent years. According to a recent report from eMarketer, user growth for major voice assistants, including Alexa, has declined significantly in recent years. The sudden rise of ChatGPT has showcased what is possible when powerful AI models are integrated smoothly with popular products that consumers and companies find useful. Some Amazon leaders are bullish about the AI-powered Alexa and a new paid subscription service that could come with it. At least one internal estimate projected a 20% conversion rate for the paid subscription, one of the people said. That would mean that out of every 100 existing Alexa users, roughy 20 would pay for the upgraded offering. Amazon doesn't publicly disclose the number of active Alexa users but has said it has sold more than 500 million Alexa-enabled devices. An internal description of the new Alexa shows Amazon's grand ambitions: "A personalized digital assistant that can handle a wide range of tasks, including drafting and managing personal communications, managing calendars, making reservations, placing orders, shopping, scouting for deals and events, recommending media, managing smart home devices, and answering questions on virtually any topic," one of the documents said. Customers will be able to access the new Alexa "through natural language using voice, text, email, shared photos, and more across all their devices like Echo, Fire TV, mobile phones, and web browsers," it added. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy shared a similar vision during last month's earnings call, saying the new Alexa will be good at not just answering questions, but also "taking actions." In an email to BI, Amazon's spokesperson said the company's vision for Alexa is to build the world's "best personal assistant." "Generative AI offers a huge opportunity to make Alexa even better for our customers, and we are working hard to enable even more proactive and capable assistance on the over half a billion Alexa-enabled devices already in homes around the world. We are excited about what we're building and look forward to delivering it for our customers," the spokesperson said. Still, the project has grappled with several challenges, beyond customer friction and partnership problems. Latency has been a particularly tough problem for the AI Alexa service. In some tests, the new Alexa took about 40 seconds to respond to a simple user inquiry, according to three people familiar with the test results. In contrast, a Google Search query takes milliseconds to respond. To speed up, Amazon considered using a smaller AI model, like Anthropic's Claude Haiku, to power the new Alexa, one of the people said. But that dropped the quality and accuracy of the answers, leaving Amazon in limbo, this person said. In general, smaller language models generate quicker responses than larger models but can be less accurate. Amazon had initially hoped to use a homegrown AI model, one of the people said. Last year, Alexa head scientist Rohit Prasad left the team to create a new Artificial General Intelligence group at Amazon. The stated goal of the new team was to create Amazon's "most expansive" and "most ambitious" large language models. However, this AGI team has not produced notable results so far, which led Amazon to consider Anthropic's main Claude offering as the primary AI model for the new Alexa, this person said. Reuters previously reported that Amazon was going to mainly power Alexa with Claude. Amazon's spokesperson said Alexa uses Amazon Web Services's Bedrock, an AI tool that gives access to multiple language models. "When it comes to machine learning models, we start with those built by Amazon, but we have used, and will continue to use, a variety of different models — including Titan and future Amazon models, as well as those from partners — to build the best experience for customers," the spokesperson said. The spokesperson also added a note of caution by highlighting the difficulties of successfully integrating large language models with consumer applications. These models are great for conversational dialogue and content creation, but they can also be "non-deterministic and can hallucinate," the spokesperson added. Getting these models "to reliably act on requests (rather than simply respond) means it has to be able to call real-world APIs reliably and at scale to meet customer expectations, not just in select instances," the spokesperson explained. In late August, Amazon discovered several new risk factors for the AI Alexa service. Only 308 of more than 100,000 existing Alexa "skills," or voice-controlled applications, were compatible with the new Alexa, presenting a "high risk for customers to be frustrated," one of the documents explained. Some older Echo devices would not be able to support the AI-powered Alexa, the document also warned. And there were no plans for expanding the new service to dozens of overseas markets where Alexa is currently available, leaving a large user base out of touch, it also noted. Fortune previously reported some of these risk factors. As of late August, Amazon had 8 "confirmed" partner companies to handle certain tasks for the new Alexa, as BI previously reported. The company hopes to onboard roughly 200 partners by the third year of the new Alexa's launch, one of the documents said. Integrating with some of these companies has already created headaches. One document said that Amazon struggled to develop a consistent troubleshooting process across every partner service. Companies including Uber, Ticketmaster, and OpenTable have deprecated their existing Alexa skills, further disconnecting them from the voice assistant. Amazon's spokesperson said that, as with any product development process, a lot of ideas are discussed and debated, but "they don't necessarily reflect what the experience will be when we roll it out for our customers." Amazon has also anticipated customer complaints, at least in the early launch phase. One internal document from late August stated that the new Alexa was projected to receive 176,000 customer contacts in the first three months of its release. At one point, Amazon considered launching a new automated troubleshooting service for issues related to its devices and digital services, including Alexa, according to one of the internal documents. That was later shelved. Do you work at Amazon? Got a tip? Contact the reporter, Eugene Kim, via the encrypted-messaging apps Signal or Telegram (+1-650-942-3061) or email (ekim@businessinsider.com).

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks recovered from steeper losses in late morning trading on Tuesday as fears over a nuclear escalation to the Russia-Ukraine war rattled markets, stealing focus from Nvidia (NVDA) earnings and other corporate results. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the declines, down about 0.5% but off of the lows of the session. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) battled to back to trade just above the flatline after the index fell below its election breakout level earlier in the trading day. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) reversed declines to gain around 0.3% on the heels of a mixed day for the major gauges. Investors are assessing news that President Vladimir Putin has signed a revised nuclear doctrine that allows Russia to expand its use of atomic weapons. The changes mean a large-scale aerial attack could prompt a nuclear response, and any attack by a non-nuclear state that is supported by a nuclear power will be viewed as a joint assault. It comes just days after President Joe Biden gave Ukraine the go-ahead to use US long-range missiles to strike inside Russia. Ukraine carried out its first such aerial attack in a border region on Tuesday morning. US bond prices climbed alongside gains for gold (GC=F), and other safe-haven assets as the risk-off trade kicked in. Treasury yields — which move inversely to bond prices — fell, with the 10-year benchmark yield (^TNX) down 4 basis points to around 4.37%. Gold jumped almost 1% to trade above $2,600 an ounce. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices rose to trade above $92,400 a token. The geopolitical situation blotted out themes such as corporate earnings, President-elect Trump's cabinet picks, the path of interest rates, and Wall Street's view of where stocks are headed. Meanwhile, the countdown is on to Nvidia earnings on Wednesday, seen as a test of the AI trade that has powered gains on Wall Street. The chipmaker's stock edged higher in premarket trading after getting bruised by a report of overheating issues with its flagship new AI product. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy It was a tale of two retailers this morning ... Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma reports: Walmart (WMT), the world's biggest retailer, posted fiscal third quarter results that easily beat Wall Street expectations as inflation-weary shoppers continue to search for value. The stock popped over 3%. Sales of $169.59 billion topped analyst estimates for $167.5 billion. Adjusted earnings per share eclipsed estimates by 5 cents at $0.58. The company also raised its guidance for fiscal year 2025 for the third time. Read more here. Lowe's (LOW) stock fell nearly 5% shortly after the opening bell as investors honed in on continued negative sales growth, despite results that beat the Street's estimates. The home improvement retailer posted revenue of $20.17 billion, compared to estimates of $19.93 billion. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $2.89, versus the $2.82 expected. Same-store sales fell 1.1%, less than the 2.7% decline anticipated. The company alluded to ongoing softness in the "DIY bigger-ticker discretionary demand," which was offset by hurricane-related recovery efforts following Hurricanes Helene and Milton and positive same-store sales in its Pro business and online. Read more here. Housing starts fell in October, pressured by a drop in single-family construction. Data from the Census Bureau showed housing starts dropped 3.1% in October to an annual rate of 1.311 million units. Meanwhile, single-family housing starts slipped 6.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 970,000 units, unchanged from a year ago. The decline came as mortgage rates have been climbing, with the average 30-year fixed loan hovering around 6.7%. Rates on a home loan tend to follow US Treasury yields, which have been rising since mid-September partly due to investor anticipation of Trump’s victory and his proposed policies around taxes and tariffs. Higher rates also likely discouraged builders from filing building permits during the month. Contract permits for single family dwellings fell to a pace of 968,000, a 0.5% drop from September’s revised figure of 963,000. "Major storms likely stalled the beginnings of some residential projects, causing a steep decline in construction in the southeast," Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial, wrote after the release. "Both housing starts and building permits declined in October as several homebuilders appeared to hold back the start of projects until after the election. However, more recent surveys showed a rebound in homebuilder confidence." US stocks fell at the open on Tuesday after President Vladimir Putin signed a revised nuclear doctrine, allowing Russia to expand its use of atomic weapons in a possible escalation of the Russia-Ukraine war. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the declines, down about 0.8%. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) slid roughly 0.5% to fall below its election breakout level, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also dropped around 0.5% on the heels of a mixed day for the major gauges. Super Micro Computer (SMCI), an AI server maker and Nvidia (NVDA) partner, soared over 25% premarket Tuesday. The sprint higher came after the company on Monday submitted a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission saying that it's supplied a compliance plan with the Nasdaq to avoid delisting. Also boosting the stock, Super Micro said it's hired a new auditor, BDO, after its prior accountant, Ernst & Young, resigned in late October. The company was in hot water with the Nasdaq after delaying both its annual and quarterly filings to the SEC following a scathing report from short-selling firm Hindenburg Research. The report shed light on potential accounting malpractices, violations of export controls, and shady relationships between top executives and Super Micro partners. The company is reportedly being investigated by the Department of Justice. Even with this week's surge, shares have tumbled roughly 56% over the past three months. After gaining as much as 300% earlier this year, SMCI stock is now down over 20% in 2024. Read the full story here. Economic data: Housing starts (October); Building permits (October) Earnings: Lowe's (LOW), Walmart (WMT), XPeng (XPEV) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: Wall Street isn't banking on AI to lift stocks any more Nvidia options primed for $300B post-earnings price swing YF columnist Rick Newman: My Trump trade went bust — with a consolation prize Walmart lifts guidance after earnings and revenue beats Goldman sees S&P 500 hitting 6,500 by end of next year DOJ will push Google to sell Chrome to break search monopoly Super Micro stock surges as company files plan to avoid Nasdaq delisting Walmart (WMT) has worked very diligently behind the scenes the past two years to be a major player online. The retailer has expanded its assortment online and has fine-tuned its "buy online, pick up in store" functionality — among other initiatives. The efforts continue to show up on earnings days. Here are the company's e-commerce results by division for the third quarter reported this morning: These results are eye-popping for two reasons: 1) Walmart isn't exactly a startup; 2) the competition online is as fierce as ever. I am talking to Walmart CFO John David Rainey live at 9:15 a.m. ET on Yahoo Finance. Rest assured, we will ask him about these online sales numbers! Hat tip to Goldman Sachs's chief US equity strategist David Kostin for calling out specific stocks in his 2025 outlook piece that just dropped. So often these year-end works of art from investment bank strategists simply serve up S&P 500 (^GSPC) targets, with various underlying scenarios explained. But usually, no stock predictions. Kostin is calling out another year of strong performance for the Mag 7 trade, just not as hot as recent years. Says Kostin: It's a good point by Kostin, and comes in the face of all these Mag 7 stocks trading at rich multiples on hearty outlooks for profit growth. There is only so far you can push a stock price using reasonable future financial assumptions! You can toil around on Mag 7 valuations on Yahoo Finance's new stock comparison tool here. As I noted on Monday in our blog, expectations on Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings and outlook are very robust ... to say the very least. If there is one thing that could trip up the bullish trade the morning after earnings, it's Nvidia's guidance. While it will likely be above consensus, it may not be above consensus enough given the dynamics around Blackwell chip demand. Nvidia could opt to go stronger with guidance when it reports three months from now or so. Important point on this from Stifel analyst Ruben Roy this morning in a note: This explosive shift in rates—in the wrong direction—is a harbinger of trouble as it is a crucial long-term driver of stock returns. The Oracle of Omaha has shed more than 615 million shares of Apple over the last year, and recently took a notable stake in one of America's most well-known consumer-facing businesses. Warren Buffett was a net seller of stocks for the eighth consecutive quarter in Q3. Berkshire initiated new positions in only two stocks in the last quarter. Its biggest addition was 1.28 million shares of pizza franchiser Domino's Pizza (NYSE: DPZ). Stanley Druckenmiller wowed investors year after year with his winning streak at the helm of Duquesne Capital Management. This top investor closed the fund in 2010 but has since continued investing through the Duquesne Family Office -- and one of his favored stocks in recent times has been artificial intelligence (AI) giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Earlier this year, this star investor started cutting his Nvidia holding, and in the third quarter, he sold all of his Nvidia shares. Super Micro Computer met a deadline Monday to avoid delisting from the Nasdaq after delaying prior financial statements. After TLRY hits a 52-week low, we assess whether the current level warrants an opportunity to accumulate shares, hold positions or book profits. Englander's Millennium Management sold close to 4.5 million shares of Palantir and practically tripled its stake in a high-octane electric-vehicle (EV) company in the September-ended quarter. The Oracle of Omaha sets his sights on a prominent brand. MicroStrategy is still holding a lot of Bitcoin. NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) shares are trading higher in premarket Tuesday ahead of the company’s upcoming third-quarter financial results, set for release on Wednesday, November 20, before U.S. markets open. Today, the company’s top peer Chinese EV maker XPeng Inc (NYSE: XPEV) reported fiscal third-quarter sales growth of 18.4% year-on-year, to 10.10 billion Chinese Yuan ($1.44 billion), topping the analyst consensus estimate of $1.38 billion.

Treasury yields — which move inversely to bond prices — fell, with the 10-year benchmark yield (^TNX) down 4 basis points to around 4.37%. Gold jumped almost 1% to trade above $2,600 an ounce. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices rose to trade above $92,400 a token. The geopolitical situation blotted out themes such as corporate earnings, President-elect Trump's cabinet picks, the path of interest rates, and Wall Street's view of where stocks are headed. Meanwhile, the countdown is on to Nvidia earnings on Wednesday, seen as a test of the AI trade that has powered gains on Wall Street. The chipmaker's stock edged higher in premarket trading after getting bruised by a report of overheating issues with its flagship new AI product. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy It was a tale of two retailers this morning ... Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma reports: Walmart (WMT), the world's biggest retailer, posted fiscal third quarter results that easily beat Wall Street expectations as inflation-weary shoppers continue to search for value. The stock popped over 3%. Sales of $169.59 billion topped analyst estimates for $167.5 billion. Adjusted earnings per share eclipsed estimates by 5 cents at $0.58. The company also raised its guidance for fiscal year 2025 for the third time. Read more here. Lowe's (LOW) stock fell nearly 5% shortly after the opening bell as investors honed in on continued negative sales growth, despite results that beat the Street's estimates. The home improvement retailer posted revenue of $20.17 billion, compared to estimates of $19.93 billion. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $2.89, versus the $2.82 expected. Same-store sales fell 1.1%, less than the 2.7% decline anticipated. The company alluded to ongoing softness in the "DIY bigger-ticker discretionary demand," which was offset by hurricane-related recovery efforts following Hurricanes Helene and Milton and positive same-store sales in its Pro business and online. Read more here. Housing starts fell in October, pressured by a drop in single-family construction. Data from the Census Bureau showed housing starts dropped 3.1% in October to an annual rate of 1.311 million units. Meanwhile, single-family housing starts slipped 6.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 970,000 units, unchanged from a year ago. The decline came as mortgage rates have been climbing, with the average 30-year fixed loan hovering around 6.7%. Rates on a home loan tend to follow US Treasury yields, which have been rising since mid-September partly due to investor anticipation of Trump’s victory and his proposed policies around taxes and tariffs. Higher rates also likely discouraged builders from filing building permits during the month. Contract permits for single family dwellings fell to a pace of 968,000, a 0.5% drop from September’s revised figure of 963,000. "Major storms likely stalled the beginnings of some residential projects, causing a steep decline in construction in the southeast," Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial, wrote after the release. "Both housing starts and building permits declined in October as several homebuilders appeared to hold back the start of projects until after the election. However, more recent surveys showed a rebound in homebuilder confidence." US stocks fell at the open on Tuesday after President Vladimir Putin signed a revised nuclear doctrine, allowing Russia to expand its use of atomic weapons in a possible escalation of the Russia-Ukraine war. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the declines, down about 0.8%. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) slid roughly 0.5% to fall below its election breakout level, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also dropped around 0.5% on the heels of a mixed day for the major gauges. Super Micro Computer (SMCI), an AI server maker and Nvidia (NVDA) partner, soared over 25% premarket Tuesday. The sprint higher came after the company on Monday submitted a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission saying that it's supplied a compliance plan with the Nasdaq to avoid delisting. Also boosting the stock, Super Micro said it's hired a new auditor, BDO, after its prior accountant, Ernst & Young, resigned in late October. The company was in hot water with the Nasdaq after delaying both its annual and quarterly filings to the SEC following a scathing report from short-selling firm Hindenburg Research. The report shed light on potential accounting malpractices, violations of export controls, and shady relationships between top executives and Super Micro partners. The company is reportedly being investigated by the Department of Justice. Even with this week's surge, shares have tumbled roughly 56% over the past three months. After gaining as much as 300% earlier this year, SMCI stock is now down over 20% in 2024. Read the full story here.

The retailer has expanded its assortment online and has fine-tuned its "buy online, pick up in store" functionality — among other initiatives. The efforts continue to show up on earnings days. Here are the company's e-commerce results by division for the third quarter reported this morning: These results are eye-popping for two reasons: 1) Walmart isn't exactly a startup; 2) the competition online is as fierce as ever. I am talking to Walmart CFO John David Rainey live at 9:15 a.m. ET on Yahoo Finance. Rest assured, we will ask him about these online sales numbers! Hat tip to Goldman Sachs's chief US equity strategist David Kostin for calling out specific stocks in his 2025 outlook piece that just dropped. So often these year-end works of art from investment bank strategists simply serve up S&P 500 (^GSPC) targets, with various underlying scenarios explained. But usually, no stock predictions. Kostin is calling out another year of strong performance for the Mag 7 trade, just not as hot as recent years. Says Kostin: It's a good point by Kostin, and comes in the face of all these Mag 7 stocks trading at rich multiples on hearty outlooks for profit growth. There is only so far you can push a stock price using reasonable future financial assumptions! You can toil around on Mag 7 valuations on Yahoo Finance's new stock comparison tool here. As I noted on Monday in our blog, expectations on Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings and outlook are very robust ... to say the very least. If there is one thing that could trip up the bullish trade the morning after earnings, it's Nvidia's guidance. While it will likely be above consensus, it may not be above consensus enough given the dynamics around Blackwell chip demand. Nvidia could opt to go stronger with guidance when it reports three months from now or so. Important point on this from Stifel analyst Ruben Roy this morning in a note: This explosive shift in rates—in the wrong direction—is a harbinger of trouble as it is a crucial long-term driver of stock returns. The Oracle of Omaha has shed more than 615 million shares of Apple over the last year, and recently took a notable stake in one of America's most well-known consumer-facing businesses. Warren Buffett was a net seller of stocks for the eighth consecutive quarter in Q3. Berkshire initiated new positions in only two stocks in the last quarter.

US stocks recovered from steeper losses in late morning trading on Tuesday as fears over a nuclear escalation to the Russia-Ukraine war rattled markets, stealing focus from Nvidia (NVDA) earnings and other corporate results. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the declines, down about 0.5% but off of the lows of the session. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) battled to back to trade just above the flatline after the index fell below its election breakout level earlier in the trading day. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) reversed declines to gain around 0.3% on the heels of a mixed day for the major gauges. Investors are assessing news that President Vladimir Putin has signed a revised nuclear doctrine that allows Russia to expand its use of atomic weapons. The changes mean a large-scale aerial attack could prompt a nuclear response, and any attack by a non-nuclear state that is supported by a nuclear power will be viewed as a joint assault. It comes just days after President Joe Biden gave Ukraine the go-ahead to use US long-range missiles to strike inside Russia. Ukraine carried out its first such aerial attack in a border region on Tuesday morning.

Title: How Technology Makes The CFO’s Job More About Driving Value

Plus: Finance Departments Plan To Use AI To Be More Efficient—With A Lower Headcount, Trump Stock Rally Slows, The Fight To Be Treasury Secretary, Overtime Rule Expansion Rejected Finance departments are finally getting the technology they need and plan to use it to work efficiently—and will likely need fewer people in the process, according to a new survey from Datarails. Spending on the CFO tech stack is increasing—making them no longer a neglected “Cinderella” department, the study found—with 70% set to invest in AI technology in 2025. More than half say they expect to need fewer people by 2026 when AI use is entrenched. There are plans to use AI throughout the financial sector, although there’s no majority consensus on any one function or task. More than a quarter say financial reporting is the most ripe for AI disruption, but 22% say analytics has that distinction, and 21% say it’s risk assessment. Regardless of how they want to use AI, nearly three in five CFOs at finance, banking and insurance companies say there will be a drop in roles due to AI adoption. A total of 57% of software CFOs are predicting an AI-lowered headcount. But 27% say that it will not impact the number of roles available. Many analysts say that while generative AI can help companies do more, it shouldn’t be replacing actual human employees. But considering the current state of the financial department, this might mean that companies may be able to continue to function at their current levels in the future. The number of accountants is dwindling, with fewer people pursuing accounting college degrees and the CPA career path—the number of bachelor’s degree graduates dipped by 7.8% between 2020-21 and 2021-22, and 6.4% fewer master’s degrees were conferred in the same time period, according to the American Institute of CPAs. And while good financial talent is getting harder to find, AI may be able to fill in some of the gaps. Using more AI may even have the net effect of bringing more people to the financial profession, which Even without AI, technology has led to big changes in CFOs’ jobs—both with what they are expected to do and what they are able to do. I talked to EY Global Finance Transformation Leader Deirdre Ryan about how technology is making CFOs need to be more forward thinking. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange last week. After the votes were tallied and it was clear that Donald Trump would be the next president, the markets took off. But at the end of the last week, investors hit the brakes. Several things happened to cool the rally. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in a speech last Thursday that there are no economic signals that interest rates need to be immediately cut any further. Meanwhile, after Trump announced he would nominate vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Health and Human Services secretary, stocks of vaccine makers Novavax, BioNTech and Moderna dropped 5% or more. Tesla, whose stock has been booming in large part because of CEO Elon Musk’s close alliance with Trump, fell into correction mode last week on reports that the president-elect would kill a tax credit for EV purchasers—though it saw a 5.6% rise Monday based on a Bloomberg report that a federal framework for self-driving vehicles was an administration priority. “Trump’s recent unorthodox cabinet picks,” combined with the dollar’s rise to a 12-month high and the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields climbed from 4.29% to 4.41% following the election, “is causing investors to re-assess the potential impacts of the incoming Republican government,” wrote Sevens Report founder Tom Essaye in a Friday note to clients. However, analysts are bullish on the markets for the long term. Both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley predicted the S&P 500 would hit an all-time high of 6,500 by the end of 2025, based on projected earnings growth and interest rate cuts. The S&P closed at 5,893.62 on Monday. October inflation was up for the first time since March, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released last week, with consumer prices 2.6% higher in October than a year before. Core inflation, excluding more volatile food and energy costs, saw a 3.3% increase. And while these numbers are progress for economists, consumer prices have not fallen as quickly as inflation rates, and people still feel the impact of high inflation. Many people who have analyzed the presidential election have said voters’ personal experiences with inflation were a key driver of Trump’s victory. Brandon Bell/Getty Images While President-elect Donald Trump has quickly been naming his picks to Cabinet-level positions—some controversial and others widely expected—one key nominee has not been announced: Treasury secretary. Reports indicate a three-way race between hedge fund manager Scott Bessent, Wall Street billionaire Marc Rowan and former Federal Reserve governor Kevin Warsh. Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick had been in the running, but reports indicate Trump wants to nominate him for Commerce secretary. The New York Times reported that Trump said he wants someone “big” for the job, and places a high value on wealth and respect from Wall Street. Considering that many of his campaign trail policies centered on the economy—tax cuts, tariffs, ending inflation—the policies enacted by this member of his Cabinet could be among the most important. There’s been no indication when this nominee will be named, though reports indicate the leading candidates are working to showcase their plans—and loyalty—to Trump. getty A federal judge last week rejected President Joe Biden’s rule increasing the maximum employee salary that requires employers to pay an overtime premium. The rule, which took effect in July, increased the salary cap from $35,500 to $44,000. The next increase, which was slated to go into effect next year, would have raised the cap to nearly $59,000. And it also mandated that beginning on July 1, 2027, the maximum salary receiving overtime would automatically increase every three years. The new rule would have expanded overtime pay to 4 million workers. U.S. District Judge Sean Jordan struck it down because it is based on salary, not job duties, which Jordan said also needs to be considered when determining if a salaried employee is eligible for overtime. A similar attempt to increase the maximum salary for receiving overtime issued at the tail end of the Obama administration was struck down in 2017. EY Global Finance Transformation Leader Deirdre Ryan. The CFO’s role has been in flux, transitioning from someone who solely worked with numbers to increasingly becoming a leader in strategy. I talked with Deirdre Ryan, EY Global Finance Transformation leader, about the reasons behind these changes, the new challenges CFOs today face, and what the future likely holds for the position. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. What do you think has caused the biggest change to the CFO’s traditional role? Ryan: The advance of technology has allowed them to focus in an area that ultimately better supports the goal of their enterprise. Before, so much time was spent processing transactions. That was the bulk of the effort, not just for the CFO, but the entire finance organization. Most finance organizations, they probably spent 60% to 80% of their time ingesting and processing transactions so that they could produce accurate financial statements. Now with digital technologies, most organizations have leveraged that capability to automate, and it’s allowed them to shift their focus to more value-added activities. We have a point of view that we put together about a year ago. I brought together some of our best global thought leaders. I wanted to very practically say: What is a finance function going to look like three to five years out? There’s just so much change and disruption, and a lot of [CFOs] needed to better understand. What do I need to look like three years from now, five years from now to either gain or maintain a competitive advantage? A lot of that is about automation and leveraging those technologies so that you can pivot your team to really drive value for the enterprise. One of the major challenges is not just learning how to use this technology, but ensuring that the data is clean and can be processed effectively by the system. What are some of the other big challenges CFOs today are facing? The CFO role is evolving, but they’re in this position right now where they have to balance these traditional mandates: Basically we need our CPAs, we need our MBAs, we have to get the numbers right, we have to figure out the “so what” of the data. It’s balancing the traditional mandates and what historically has been expected of a CFO with bold transformation and being able to help her or his organization envision the art of the possible. Historically, when we wanted to drive improvement in finance, typically we would look at an end-to-end process and say: How can we make this more efficient? We could make a little tweak here, put a Band-Aid here, put some bubble gum here. We could drive some efficiency. But now what we’re saying is: Let’s take a step back and think about this differently. Let’s think about the data, as opposed to the process. That’s really going to drive value. Let’s take FP&A. Historically, organizations could have looked at that end-to-end process and said: I’m going to tweak this. I’m going to fix that. But now, given these technologies that we have, you really have to completely reimagine how you’re running that department. It’s such an exciting time, but it takes skill sets that finance professionals didn’t need to lean on so heavily before. That takes a really good understanding of the capabilities of these tools and technologies. Not just reading an article or PowerPoint, but getting your hands dirty and really understanding. It also takes creativity to step back and say: How do I do this in a way that’s effective, efficient, but leveraging these technologies, changing my mindset and opening my mind to the art of the possible? How do you see the CFO's role continuing to evolve in the next five to 10 years? Organizations that have put focus on driving transformation, hopefully they’ll have automated 80% of their transaction processing. CFOs are going to continue to understand and have in-house automation experts.

Nvidia reported its much-anticipated quarterly earnings on Wednesday as Wall Street watched closely for an update on demand for its latest Blackwell AI chips and spending across the industry. Nvidia delivered another strong quarter, saying "the age of AI is in full steam" as sales of its popular semiconductor chips rose. The company reported third-quarter revenue of $35.08 billion — a 94% year-over-year increase — beating the consensus analyst estimate of $33.25 billion. Wall Street analysts were zeroed in on the company's projections for the current quarter and beyond. Nvidia's guidance gives clues to whether Big Tech companies will continue to shovel massive amounts of cash at it as they train their AI models. Nvidia forecast fourth-quarter sales of $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, lining up with estimates of $37.1 billion. While the guidance was largely in line with estimates, it failed to surpass the most sky-high of analyst expectations. The chipmaking giant said production for its Blackwell chip — its follow-up to the wildly popular Hopper chip favored by many Big Tech companies — will continue ramping up into fiscal 2026. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Blackwell demand was strong and "coming from a lot of different places." "Demand for Hopper and anticipation for Blackwell — in full production — are incredible as foundation model makers scale pretraining, post-training, and inference," he said. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said that demand for Blackwell "is expected to exceed supply for several quarters in fiscal 2026." The company's profit margin, a closely watched metric, is expected to be impacted by Blackwell production in the short-term but Kress said it could return to the mid-70s in the second half of next year. Asked about Trump's tariff plans and any anticipated impact on Nvidia's China business, Huang said the company is taking things "one quarter at a time." "Whatever the new administration decides, we will, of course, support the administration" and "fully" comply with any new regulations, Huang said. Nvidia's stock fell 2% in volatile after-hours trading shortly after the results and was trading down more than 1% as the analyst call concluded. The stock is up 194% so far in 2024. That's a wrap on the Q&A portion of the call. Huang recaps the "new industrial revolution" the company says is underway amid the AI boom, and talks about Hopper and Blackwell demand. The CEO mentions AI coworkers and the age of robotics as some of the transformations on the horizon. The newest AI applications consume a huge amount of computing, Huang says, and that's good for Nvidia's business. "There are more foundation model makers now than there were a year ago," Huang says. "The computing scale of pre-training and post-training continues to grow exponentially. There are more AI native startups than ever, and the number of successful inference services is rising." Investments in industrial robotics are surging due to breakthroughs in physical AI, Huang adds. "The age of robotics is coming," Huang says, and the AI age is already upon us. "Thanks for joining us today," the CEO says in closing. "Catch up next time." Asked about Trump's tariff plans and any impact on Nvidia's China business, Huang dodges a bit on talking specifics, saying the company is taking things "one quarter at a time." "Whatever the new administration decides we will of course support the administration," Huang says. Nvidia will comply "fully" with any regulation that comes along with Trump's return to the White House while also continuing to compete in the marketplace, he adds. Kress says the ability to sell Nvidia's networking with many of its systems that the company is doing in its data centers continues to do "quite well." "So this quarter is just a slight dip down, and we're going to be right back up in terms of growing," CFO Kress says. "We're getting ready for Blackwell and more and more systems that will be using not only our existing networking, but also the networking that is going to be incorporated in a lot of these large systems that we are providing them to," she adds. Google's Notebook LM, which started out as an experiment, allows users to drop in links, information, and files. It will generate a podcast hosted by two AI hosts, as well as study guides and briefing docs.Huang says NotebookLM is one of his favorite applications. "I use the living daylights out of it," Huang says, adding that he puts every PDF and archive into it. He says the goal is to train models so that people use it. At the same time, companies are looking to build out their Blackwell systems, the CFO says. It's possible for Hopper to grow from Q3 to Q4, Kress says, but "we'll see." Blackwell will put pressure on profit margins next quarter, but Kress says it may recover as the ramp-up continues next year. "I think it is a reasonable assumption or a goal for us to do, but we'll just have to see how that mix of ramp goes." Asked if Nvidia's gross margins could we reach the mid-70s in the second half of next year, Kress says "Yes." The first shift is moving from coding that runs on CPUs to machine learning that runs off GPUs. "That fundamental shift from coding to machine learning is widespread," Huang says, adding that "there are no companies" that won't do machine learning. The second shift is that the systems are creating AI, he says. "When we say generative AI, we're essentially saying that these data centers are really AI factories," Huang adds. The CEO says he expects the modernization of this new industry to go on for several years. In discussing supply and demand, Huang says the company is at the beginning of a Gen AI revolution and the new generation of foundation models that can reason, such as OpenAI's o1 model. Huang names physical AI as a "really exciting" area. He defined it as AI "that now understands the structure of the physical world." Huang is asked a tough question that references past production challenges for Blackwell and a recent report about heating issue concerns. An analyst asks what he would say to investors who are concerned about Nvidia's ability to execute the roadmap Huang previously presented. In his response, Huang reiterates that Blackwell production is in full steam. Nvidia will deliver more Blackwells this quarter than previously estimated, the CEO says, and demand exceeds supply as expected. Our execution is "going well," he adds. Huang says the engineering required to get each system online in customers' data centers is complicated. "We're very good at it, but still, there's still a lot of a lot of engineering that happens at this point." Huang says Blackwell demand is "coming from a lot of different places." In a question about whether demand for Blackwell is greater since clusters have yet to benefit from it, the CEO said demand is coming from various areas: Pre-training scaling, post-training scaling, and inference time scaling. Huang says Nvidia is especially seeing "inference demand go up" CEO Jensen Huang fields the first question. Fourth-quarter revenue is expected to decline sequentially. The CFO says the decline is due to supply constraints. She adds that Nvidia is currently focusing on on "ramping to strong demand." As Blackwell ramps up, Kress says margins are expected to be in the low 70's, and "when fully ramped," she expects margins in the mid-70's. Accenture has trained 30,000 consultants on Nvidia's product stack. Kress highlighted one case in which the steps required for a marketing campaign decreased 35% with AI. The CFO mentions Deloitte as well. Combined the two have more than 1 million employees. Kress says Nvidia data center revenue in China "grew significantly due to shipments of export-compliant Hopper products." As Kress continues with her prepared remarks, Nvidia stock was trading down around half a percent in after-hours trading. Nvidia had some early production issues that it had to work through. Nvidia's CFO says Blackwell is in "full production" after making changes. Nvidia shipped 13,000 GPU samples to customers in the third quarter, including one of the first engineering samples. She says demand for the chip "is staggering," and the company is "racing to scale supply" to meet the demand. Kress also mentions data center revenue hitting a new quarterly record of $30.8 billion. CEO Jensen Huang and CFO Colette Kress are on the call, which opens with some prepared remarks about the company's performance over the third quarter. The execs will then field questions from Wall Street analysts. Emarketer technology analyst Jacob Bourne tells BI that Nvidia continues to show its dominance in AI chip demand, but "critical questions" remain around Blackwell's production and customer concentration. Bourne says Nvidia's expansion into areas including digital twins and autonomous vehicles "shows promising diversification" but also strong dependance on certain customers. "Despite Nvidia's technological leadership through CUDA and its first-mover advantage in AI infrastructure, there's little room for execution missteps in 2025," Bourne says. "Particularly given uncertainties around Blackwell's rollout and increasing competition from both AMD and key customers' in-house chip development efforts." 3rd quarter Revenue: $35.08 billion, +94% y/y, estimate $33.25 billion 4th quarter guidance Revenue: $37.5 billion, plus/minus 2%, estimate $37.1B Source: Bloomberg Nvidia stock was down 2% heading into its third-quarter earnings report. The intra-day decline was more than triple the Nasdaq's 0.6% decline, and far outpaced the S&P 500's 0.4% dip. The options market implies an 8% swing in Nvidia stock in either direction after it reports its earnings results later today. If realized, the swing would imply a $300 billion gain or loss in market value for the AI giant. Nvidia has a market valuation of about $3.53 trillion as of Wednesday afternoon. Long-time Nvidia bull Dan Ives of Wedbush expects Nvidia to deliver the goods when it reports earnings on Wednesday. "We expect another drop the mic performance from Nvidia tomorrow after the bell as right now Jensen & Co. are the only game in town with $1 trillion+ of AI Cap-Ex on the way for the next few years with Nvidia's GPUs the new oil and gold in this world," Ives said in a Tuesday note. Ives said he expects Nvidia to beat both revenue and guidance estimates by $2 billion. "Blackwell production and demand appear robust and we expect very bullish commentary from Jensen on the conference call which will be a focus of the Street that sends the bears back into their caves and hibernation mode," Ives said. Ives added that he is encouraged by the "cloud numbers and AI data points" offered by cloud hyperscalers like Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet during their recent earnings calls. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Kunjan Sobhani said in a recent note that he expects Nvidia's profit margins to remain well above the 70% level, which is high for a hardware manufacturer. "Gross margin is likely to decline as much as expected in 4Q yet remain comfortably above 73%," Sobhani said. "Nvidia is likely to solidly exceed 3Q revenue consensus more than it did in the past two quarters and the company will likely raise 4Q guidance, driven by greater adoption of its Hopper family, even as hyperscaler customers await the Blackwell ramp-up in 2025," Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Kunjan Sobhani said in a recent note. Sobhani highlighted that Blackwell delay concerns were likely solved in the third-quarter, setting up the expectation that shipments "to key customers" will begin in the fourth-quarter. "Increased capex guidance from hyperscalers has further boosted confidence in near-term sales. We expect small volume shipments of Blackwell in fiscal 4Q, reaching full speed in 1Q26, though supply remains constrained," Sobhani said. Analysts at Goldman Sachs said they're hyper-focused on Nvidia's guidance for the fourth quarter, which they expect should confirm their bullish thesis on the stock. They added that they expect the company's "break out" quarter to be the first quarter of 2025 as the Blackwell product launch ramps up. Goldman Sachs expects Nvidia to deliver $34.3 billion in revenue for the third quarter, with adjusted earnings per share at $0.79, which is above consensus estimates. "We expect strong demand for Nvidia's Hopper-based GPUs (i.e. H100 and particularly the H200) and Spectrum-X (i.e. Ethernet-based Networking product) to drive strong double-digit (%) Data Center revenue growth," Goldman Sachs said. The strong expected earnings results, combined with Nvidia's current valuation, suggest to Goldman that the stock should perform well going forward. Goldman Sachs rates Nvidia at "Buy" with a $150 price target. According to CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino, investors should manage expectations around guidance for Nvidia's highly anticipated Blackwell launch. "We caution investors to temper expectations for Blackwell inclusion for the Jan-Q outlook (we conservatively look for $3B-$5B in sales), limiting upside to consensus views in the near term as NVDA likely takes a somewhat conservative stance to provide itself with a buffer," Zino said in a recent note. Still, Zino expects Blackwell chips will be sold out for much of 2025. "We expect Blackwell to be supply constrained through CY 25, given heightened demand from hyperscalers to support next-generation data centers. In addition to Blackwell expectations/performance concerns that will likely dominate NVDA's Q&A session on the call, we expect investors to dissect any comments on tariffs/Sovereign AI after Trump's victory," Zino said. CFRA Research rates Nvidia at "Buy" with a $160 price target. 3rd quarter Revenue estimate: $33.25 billion 4th quarter Source: Bloomberg Jump to

Title: YieldMax ETFs: What They Are And Are They Safe

getty The rapid increase in interest in the stock market since the start of the pandemic has some important by-products. One of those is the rocketing appeal in using options as part of an overall investing strategy. Options are not new, nor are exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have been around for more than 30 years. However, the combination of the ETF product structure, with options driving the performance from within, is entering a golden era of sorts. Enter YieldMax ETFs, a recently-launched product line, launched through a collaboration between Tidal Investments (the advisor) and ZEGA Financial (the sub-advisor). The product line now includes more than 30 funds, just two years after the initial launch of a Tesla-based ETF (YieldMax TSLA Option Income Strategy (TSLY)) on November 22, 2022. At the core of these funds is the idea of taking the price volatility of an underlying stock or set of stocks, and using a strategy known as “credit call spreads” to convert that volatility into a high level of income, modest participation in price upside, and some degree of downside protection. YieldMax ETFs are typically a combination of three investments. First is a backing of the options strategy using U.S. Treasury Bills, which frequently make up more than 80% of the value of the ETF each month, when expiring options are replaced with newer options contracts. The other two investments are a pair of options. Instead of buying the stock outright, as some of its peers do, YieldMax buys call options to act as a surrogate for owning the stock. These are “out of the money” call options, which means that the fund can benefit from some of the future price appreciation, if any, in the target stock. The other option is the sale of a call option, which has a strike price between 0% and 15% of the current stock price. That means that the upside in the stock is limited, but in exchange for giving up that potential return, the shareholder receives a handsome income payout each month. Depending on the ETF and market conditions, Yield Max ETFs will also use other option strategies, such as selling put options. These obligate the holder of the option to buy the underlying stock at a future price that is typically below the price of the stock when the put option is sold. In other words, the investor is receiving cash now in exchange for the risk of being forced to buy the stock later.

Unlock Premium Access — Free For 25 Days. As noted above, the underlying assets are call options (bought and sold) and T-bills. The stock itself is not owned, and does not have to be for the strategy to work. The calls obligate the holder to produce the shares if “called” upon. And the sale of the other call position brings in the income. Income is generated from the sale of the call options, since the investor is sacrificing upside to be paid now. That income and any other cash flow resulting from the T-bills or other assets is delivered to shareholders in a monthly dividend. Expense ratios for these ETFs are typically 0.99% of assets, which gets them just under the 1.00% rate that industry participants often screen for in considering candidates to be sufficiently cost-efficient. But frankly, YieldMax ETFs are a different breed altogether, given their tremendous income-producing potential. The product line also includes several applications of the strategy to more than a single stock, and those have expense ratios slightly above 1.00%. This fairly new line of ETFs has attracted lots of attention during its first two years of existence. That is due to a combination of the popularity of the Magnificent 7 stocks like Nvidia, Microsoft, Tesla and Meta, and the increased demand for income from an ever-growing number of Baby Boomers, who are retiring or shifting from growth toward income in their investment objectives. These ETFs typically yield above their peers, since they aim to spin off option income from single stocks, which are more volatile than indexes (baskets of stocks). There are some YieldMax funds that allocate among stocks, but the most popular so far have been the ones aimed at a single stock. While those stocks can present big risk from lack of diversification, the use of T-bills and options acts as a potential risk modifier. The ETF package is a nice match for the combination of call options known as a call spread. While the elements of these portfolios can be created and managed by investors on their own, there are variables each month based on how volatile the stocks involved and the market happen to be. Monthly income from these ETFs is more in sync with the pace at which investors prefer to receive portfolio cash flow if they are using that money to live on.

So of course there is risk and volatility in the price of these securities. T-bills are considered to be very safe investments, and options are heavily-regulated and in the case of the contracts used by YieldMax, quite liquid. That said, if the fund company’s success reaches the point where they need to resort to private placement options contracts, as has been the case with other ETF producers, that could introduce credit risk. Interest rates impact everything, as does market volatility. The key impact here is the extent to which rates hurt the prices of the underlying stocks, as well as the income available from that large T-bill allocation. Interest rates also may have an impact on the premiums available to bring in as income via the call option sales that drive these products. YieldMax is not a new concept, but it does take the option-driven approach to another level. By applying call spread investing and trading to single stocks, investors who are income-oriented but would like to get a piece of the potential return from lower yield and no yield stocks, can look at YieldMax ETFs as a potential investment. Dividend investing is changing rapidly. Stocks do not yield as much as they used to, thanks in part to rising stock prices and also because company management increasingly back stock instead of using their excess cash flow for dividends. And, short-term bond rates are much higher than a few years ago. That makes YieldMax ETFs an intriguing investment for those who want to complement their traditional approach to income investing. It should come as no surprise that the most popular YieldMax ETFs in terms of assets are those that target single stocks that are very popular. Those include NVDY (YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy), which applies the YieldMax call spread methodology to Nvidia; MSTY (YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy), which points to MicroStrategy, CONY (YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy), which is based on Coinbase stock; and TSLY, in which Tesla is the underlying stock. The expense ratio and other fees, though modest for a product line as innovative as this one, is still a consideration for investors. When the yield is flowing and the stocks are holding up, that roughly 1% cost is lost in the profits and income. But in a sustained rough stock market, all costs of investing should get more scrutiny. Start with the idea that when investing, nothing is totally “safe.” But working up from there, the T-bills, options (which commit less money to the stock’s future price movement than buying shares outright) and the oversight of the firms involved here provide a competitive environment for these new ETFs to succeed. The best thing investors can do in considering YieldMax ETFs is to understand the different parts of the fund’s asset allocation, how they work separately and together. Only then can someone determine to what extent, if any, the combination of features, benefits and risks fits for them. Investors seeking to access the underlying stocks and stock baskets these ETFs aim to track, but do with higher expected income, are the most likely candidates to give YieldMax funds a good look. Personally, I own several of them, as a complement to my own dividend stock and income ETF portfolio. That said, I also take the additional step of using hedging mechanisms to buffer my portfolio against severe stock price weakness or other risks cited above. YieldMax ETFs are popular for many good reasons. But with any investment, it is a personal choice, and research and true understanding of what one is buying is the best way to meet your own expectations without risking disappointment. A fund listed on the public market that combines T-bills and options to produce income and upside potential from stocks and stock baskets, many of which do not have high dividend yields. Yes. Tidal investments is involved in many aspects of the ETF business, including product creation, distribution and advisory. YieldMax is one of many ETFs they play a prominent role in creating, marketing and managing. Disclosure: I own several YieldMax funds.

Another Nvidia (NVDA+0.59%) customer is ready to launch the chipmaker’s highly-anticipated new artificial intelligence platform. Microsoft (MSFT-0.42%) chief executive Satya Nadella announced the first cloud private preview of Nvidia’s Blackwell AI infrastructure on its cloud computing platform, Azure, during the company’s developers’ conference on Tuesday. The Azure ND GB200 V6 VM series is based on the Nvidia Blackwell platform. “Blackwell is pretty amazing. It’s got this 72 GPUs on a single NVLink domain, and then you combine it with InfiniBand on the backend,” Nadella said during his keynote at Microsoft Ignite. “These racks are optimized for the most cutting-edge training workloads and inference workloads.” New servers from Microsoft will also be equipped with its new in-house security chip, Azure Integrated HSM, or hardware security module, that uses encryption and signing keys for protection. Meanwhile, Nvidia’s customers reportedly have been worried about delays for the Blackwell AI platform. The chipmaker repeatedly has asked its suppliers to change the design of its custom-designed server racks in recent months because its Blackwell AI chips are overheating when connected, The Information reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. The server racks combine 72 of the AI chips in hopes that larger AI models can be trained faster with more GPUs, or graphics processing units. The redesigns are being made later than usual in the production process, The Information reported, but Nvidia could still ship the server racks on schedule, which it set at the end of the first half of next year. Nvidia previously faced production and shipping delays for Blackwell due to a design flaw, Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said in October, after media reports surfaced in August. “It was functional, but the design flaw caused the yield to be low,” Huang said. “It was 100% Nvidia’s fault.” Microsoft also introduced new purpose-built AI agents in Microsoft 365 Copilot, including an interpreter agent that allows for real-time interpretation in up to nine languages in Microsoft Teams meetings, which will launch in preview early next year. It also rolled out a project manager agent, now in preview, that can automatically create plans and oversee projects. In addition, the tech giant launched the autonomous AI agent capabilities that it announced in October. Customers can build their own autonomous agents in Copilot Studio that can “understand the nature of your work and act on your behalf,” Microsoft said.

Super Micro Computer stock (SMCI+15.35%) surged more than 30% on Tuesday morning after the AI hardware company successfully maintained its Nasdaq (NDAQ+0.96%) listing by hiring a new auditor. The move comes several weeks after the server company’s auditor, Ernst & Young, resigned, following months of disagreement over Super Micro Computer’s governance practices and board independence. “We are pleased to welcome BDO as Supermicro’s independent auditor,” Super Micro CEO Charles Liang said in a statement. Moreover, the company submitted a detailed compliance plan to the Nasdaq, outlining its efforts to meet the exchange’s requirements and avoid delisting. The San Jose-based company expressed its ability to meet key regulatory deadlines, stating that it expects to finalize its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, as well as its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ending September 30, 2024. The company aims to bring its periodic filings up to date within the discretionary period allowed by Nasdaq staff. The statement has alleviated fears about the tech giant’s potential removal from the Nasdaq, putting an end to the uncertainty surrounding its listing. The news sparked a relief rally among investors, boosting confidence in the company’s ability to navigate regulatory hurdles. Super Micro’s stock is currently trading at $27, representing a steep decline of 78% from its March peak of $123. Super Micro makes hardware that supports AI applications. The stock has thrived for much of this year and entered the Fortune 500 at No. 498 as part of a frenzy over AI and related tools. As a key partner and reseller of Nvidia’s (NVDA+0.59%) GPUs and other components, Super Micro integrates the technology into its servers to support AI workloads. Super Micro CEO Charles Liang and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang are both Taiwanese immigrants and have a long-standing relationship. Super Micro Computer went through a rough phase in September when a short seller, Hindenburg Research, published a scathing report accusing the company of accounting red flags and questionable business dealings, including alleged sanctions evasion from exports to Russian and Chinese firms.

Title: Goldman Sachs sees S&P 500 hitting 6,500 in 2025 amid 'narrowing' big tech outperformance

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Another Wall Street strategist sees the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gaining by a double-digit percentage over the next year. On Monday night, Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin initiated a 2025 year-end S&P 500 target of 6,500, representing about an 11% gain in the benchmark index from current levels. The call falls in line with the 6,500 projection Morgan Stanley made the day prior and just shy of BMO Capital Markets' 2025 year-end target of 6,700. "In our baseline macro outlook, the economy and earnings continue to grow and bond yields remain around current levels," Kostin wrote. "But event risk remains high heading into 2025, including from the potential threat of an across-the-board tariff and the potential risk from even higher bond yields." Kostin and others say the market could surge higher even without the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks' massive outperformance. His work shows that the combination of Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) outperformed the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500 by 63 percentage points in 2023 and 22 percentage points thus far this year. In 2024, this was driven by Magnificent Seven earnings outperforming the rest of the index by 30 percentage points. But that margin is projected to fall to just 6 percentage points in 2025, per consensus estimates. This, Kostin believes, will lead to that cohort beating the other 493 stocks by just 7 percentage points in 2025, the narrowest level of outperformance from the Magnificent Seven dating back to 2018. "The narrowing differential in earnings growth rates should correspond with a narrowing in relative equity returns," Kostin wrote. "Although the 'micro' earnings growth story supports continued ‘Magnificent 7’ outperformance, more 'macro' factors such as economic growth and trade policy lean in favor of the S&P 493."' Within this call for a broadening of stock market performance within the S&P 500, Goldman also argues that the stocks leading the artificial intelligence trade may begin to shift. Goldman believes gains will shift from a group it has dubbed AI "infrastructure," which includes companies on the ground floor of AI like Nvidia (NVDA), to a group of companies that will have "enabled revenues" from AI, meaning those that can use AI to drive sales but aren't actually selling things like AI chips to other companies. The largest companies by market cap in Goldman's enabled revenues basket are Meta and Apple. In the outlook named after Donald Trump's "Art of the Deal," Kostin recommends owning stocks that could be exposed to a pickup in M&A under the president-elect's administration as well as companies who benefit from a pickup in activity among small and medium-size businesses. Kostin cited a pickup in the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) small business optimism index back in November 2016 when Trump was first elected. Goldman identified a list of 60 companies with at least 50% of revenues tied to small businesses. Large companies in that cohort include Meta, Deere & Company (DE), and Waste Management (WM). "It was truly a reflection of 'animal spirits' coming to life and this behavior is likely to be repeated now that Donald Trump has been elected to serve as the 47th President from January 2025 to January 2029," Kostin wrote. "The valuation of [small business]-exposed stocks reflects the current depressed level of small business sentiment. We expect an improving small business operating environment will boost the sentiment and spending of [small businesses] in 2025 and lift the earnings and valuation of stocks with revenues tied to that spending."

Title: Huawei's advanced chips are taking a hit from U.S. sanctions

Time Published: 2024-11-19T13:35:00Z

China’s answer to being banned from Nvidia’s (NVDA+0.59%) artificial intelligence chips is reportedly being stalled by U.S. trade restrictions. Huawei’s next two Ascend processors are being designed with the 7-nanometer process that has existed for years, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. The hampered efforts are reportedly due U.S.-led export controls that don’t allow Huawei’s Chinese chipmaking partners to get extreme ultraviolet lithography machines from the Netherlands-based ASML (ASML+2.03%). The snag means Huawei’s technology for its advanced chips will be years behind until at least 2026, and advanced processors for its Mate 60 smartphones will also be held back, people told Bloomberg. For comparison, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM+1.62%), the manufacturing partner to Nvidia and Apple (AAPL-0.19%), has said it expects volume production of 2-nanometer chips in 2025 — three generations ahead of Huawei. To add to the pain, Huawei’s main Chinese chipmaking partner, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., is reportedly having issues producing steady yields — or the amount of functional chips it can produce per manufacturing process — of 7-nanometer chips. One person told Bloomberg that Huawei may not have enough chips for AI and smartphones in the next few years. Meanwhile, TSMC reportedly told its Chinese customers earlier this month that it is no longer manufacturing AI chips with the advanced 7 nanometer process. If TSMC does produce the advanced chips for Chinese firms in the future, the U.S. government would likely be involved in an approval process, the Financial Times reported. The Taiwanese chipmaker’s new rules come as it faces an investigation into how its advanced chip technology ended up in a cutting-edge AI accelerator from the sanctioned Huawei. Canadian research firm TechInsights took apart Huawei’s chip and reportedly found the TSMC-made tech. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Streaming TV Enshittification Will Continue Until Morale Improves
URL: https://www.techdirt.com/2024/11/19/streaming-tv-enshittification-will-continue-until-morale-improves/
Time Published: 2024-11-19T13:29:26Z
Full Content:
Failures We’ve documented in detail how the whole AT&T–>Time Warner–>Warner Brothers Discovery merger process has been a pointless mess, resulting in no limits of layoffs and damage to the underlying brands. What was supposed to be a gambit by these companies to dominate streaming TV, wound up being a very expensive act of seppuku by over-compensated executives clearly out of their depths. With streaming subscription growth saturated, the market has been forced to get “creative” in order to feed Wall Street its expected quarterly returns. That has meant sagging quality control for streaming services like Max, and a steady parade of price hikes that generally haven’t been worth it. Speaking on the company’s recent conference call, Time Warner Discovery executives are making it clear that all manner of new restrictions and price hikes are on the way, just in case you were looking forward to more of that sort of thing. Among them will be a crackdown on the diabolical “password sharing” the industry used to view as helpful free advertising: “During the earnings call for parent company Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) for its fiscal Q3 2024, which ended on September 30, WBD signaled that it’s gearing up to roll out its next strategy for growing streaming revenue—charging subscribers extra for sharing passwords—over the next few months. This will start with “very soft messaging” toward Max users before the crackdown intensifies in 2025 and 2026, WBD CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels said. Wiedenfels admitted that on their own, password crackdowns are “a form of price rises.” Executives say they’re also exploring, like Amazon, steadily increasing the number of ads paying customers see. And they will, of course, just be rising prices steadily until they see a mass exodus of subscribers: “WBD also hinted at potential price hikes for Max today. During the earnings call, JB Perrette, WBD’s CEO and president of global streaming and games, noted that although Max has raised US subscription prices twice in the past two years, WBD believes it can get away with even higher prices: “We think the premium nature of our product in particular lends us to be – to have a fair amount of room to continue to push price.” Except the “premium nature” of the product doesn’t exist anymore. Any cachet enjoyed from the HBO brand has largely been killed off thanks to executives’ prioritization of lower-quality reality TV dreck as they pursue lowest common denominator engagement bait at scale. There’s still occasionally good art on Max; but the heyday of HBO as a prestige production empire is long, long dead. Meanwhile the kind of things that customers actually want (lower prices, better quality, better customer service) cost money and erode those sweet quarterly returns. The kinds of things customers and labor don’t want (price hikes, sagging quality, layoffs, weird new restrictions on access) are where the current growth and revenue boosting resides. So guess what you’re going to get. It’s not enough for a publicly traded company to provide an affordable product that people really like. That doesn’t achieve exponential, impossible growth. To get that (or the illusion of that) requires a certain aggressive creativity. And if streaming can’t obtain it via annoying price hikes and restrictions, as Time Warner Discovery CEO David Zaslav has made clear, they’ll achieve it with pointless new harmful mergers under Trump. These folks insist they’re just engaging in the cold calculus of cost efficiency, but you’ll notice that excessive and unwarranted executive compensation somehow always avoids scrutiny. Again, I suspect what’s next for the industry is a whole bunch more consolidation and mergers to try and minimize any serious price competition and to nab tax breaks. From there I suspect you’ll start seeing a greater fixation on finding creative new ways to “reduce churn,” which will likely (now that the FTC will be lobotomized under Trump) include complicated new tricks to make cancelling services more difficult. When customers inevitably revolt and flock back to piracy (which is already starting to happen), execs will freak out and blame everyone but themselves for the trend (VPNs! Generational entitlement! The wokes!), and the innovation and disruption cycle will repeat itself all over again. Filed Under: cable, competition, consolidation, disruption, mergers, streaming, time warner discovery, tv, video Companies: warner bros. discovery I share my streaming stuff with my partner. Thing is, because of my stepdaughter education I live in 2 different addresses. Since I’d have to pay added fees for more than one service I decided a vpn was the least expensive way to deal with the issue for now. Customer service was utterly useless to deal with this on all of them. I already canceled Netflix because of the price hikes and because the content isn’t worth it and from the looks of it more services are joining it soon. I’m already planning some Plex setup for the kid because we all know where this shit is going to. And a bottle of rum. You have been watching too many videos that are rated “Arrr!” Hadn’t watched Amazon Prime in a while and when I did it literally started with 6 ads. Now I think of it like warming up the air fryer. Hit watch and know I’ve got 5 minutes to do something else. The “premium nature” of the product seems to only be the price. By this logic, the more customers pay, the more it’s worth. And since every service raise their price, the more the market worth. But how to explain to customers that they need to pay to please shareholders they don’t even know? Well, just ask Trump to declare that cancelling a subscription is illegal. TV Industry: “We will merge until your options are content at an infinite price or no content.” I’m wondering why the shareholders don’t sue the WBD Board of Directors over Zaslav’s absurd compensation, considering the stock’s horrible performance. None of the streaming services are “premium” enough to keep me interested for more than a month or two out of every 12 so that’s all I give them. Put them all together, and it’s not even 12 months so sometimes I just watch Hoopla and Kanopy and read a book. execs will freak out and blame everyone but themselves for the trend (VPNs! Generational entitlement! The wokes!) Woke decline wasn’t evident until this past year or late 2023 at earliest. The spastic woke energy that erupted after George Floyd’s death was purposefully directed into the institutions over the next 24 months and then plateaued late 2023 to early 2024 and then started on a slight downward gradient until 10/7. I don’t think Trump will calm things down. But this time I think there are people in his orbit who ‘get it’ and will be very capable and aggressive in terms of how they use the bureaucracy and administrative law. Please define “woke” in objective terms within the context in which you’re using it. Is it too “woke” to provide healthcare to pregnant women who experience difficulties during child gestation? Why is it that so many maga men want to see all women suffer and die needlessly? Is it “woke” to be offended by such hateful actions? A complete misunderstanding. Which seems to be purposeful here. Why do you want men punching women in the face and call it “sport?” “Your body, my choice” will be met with “Your crotch, my boot” Get back to me when the man can say abort, I don’t want to support that child. “I don’t want to support that child.” Well then, keep it in your pants. Is this too difficult for you? Keep your legs closed. Is that too difficult for you? A woman consenting to sex isn’t the same as consenting to pregnancy. And yes, historically, considering the number of unplanned pregnancies, it is difficult for some people to abstain. “Try not getting a cold your entire life!” Thanks, doctor dude! A woman consenting to sex isn’t the same as consenting to pregnancy Nor is a consenting man consenting to financial burden Then consenting man should consent to wearing a rubber, fool. That’s not a matter of consent, but a matter of law. Genetic donors are typically considered legally required to provide support of some kind. I don’t consent to having to mow my lawn, but the city will fine me if I don’t. Why do you want men punching women in the face and call it “sport?” The only reason you give a shit about women’s sports is so you can exclude a mere handful of people from it. You wouldn’t give a shit otherwise. Hell, you don’t even seem to give a shit about the idea of “biological women” playing in men’s sports⁠—and that’s because I’ve never seen anyone who rails against trans women do the same schtick for trans men. It really is all about penises and who’s “allowed” to have them, isn’t it. Women are free to join any mans league. NHL, NFL…There is a reason they don’t. Maybe one day you will figure it out. Figure what out? What does sports have to do with women’s healthcare? Are you addicted to adderall like your hero Donald? Don’t know what it is. But since you are accusing… Women are free to join any mans league. NHL, NFL… There is a reason they don’t. It’s because men needlessly feel ashamed when outperformed by women in any sport. It really is all about penises and who’s “allowed” to have them, isn’t it You make it sound so, binary Adjective; 1) anything I don’t like. 2) anything for the benefit of anyone who isn’t me (see 1). by over-compensated executives clearly out of their depths You make it sound like pointless mergers are a bad thing. The executives keep getting over-compensated, so they’re happy. Who gives a fuck that everyone else is unhappy. When customers inevitably revolt Would be nice if we could have that revolt now, and skip this whole cycle of enshittifying. Instead of increasing the subscription count after the password crackdown, for once. Welcome to the USAnian Consumer’s Front. In the old days, TV programs were free to the viewer because networks ran ads. We all accepted the increasing interruptions because we weren’t paying for the content. Then we got tired of ads and decided to pay networks to show up content without ads, which led to cable channels such HBO, Showtime, and so on. Then it let to services like Netflix, which had movies and TV shows in one place. But now we have to pay for content AND watch commercials? AND the length of the commercials is as long as, or LONGER THAN, networks TV?? How long will it take until people stop putting up with it? Do the executives not realize that pay services are not essential and it’s only a matter of time before people think the service isn’t worth the money? “Why do people put up with it? ” I don’t It’s all lies anyway We all accepted the increasing interruptions because we weren’t paying for the content. No; it was accepted because there was no other choice. If you went to a movie theater, you’d see ads (some called “trailers” because they used to run after the movie, till the advertisers realized everyone was leaving without watching them; and since 1990 or so, there are also just regular paid ads). Books would often have ads for other books by the same author or publisher. Magazines and newspapers were full of advertising, and also abused their subscribers by selling their data to postal and telephone spammers. TV shows were only distributed on advertising-supported networks, whether or not you were paying a cable provider for them, and were never sold; same for radio shows. When networks like HBO and Showtime came around, a small number of people were willing to pay because there were shows they couldn’t get elsewhere; being ad-free was mostly a bonus. Some of the “premium” networks were themselves initially “bonuses” (or forced subscriptions, depending on your point of view) included with cable TV. Similarly for streaming services: they were sold on the basis of being convenient (lots of stuff to watch, no schedules), not being ad-free; and some, notably Amazon, were bundled with unrelated subscriptions. Streaming TV Enshittification Will Continue Until Morale Improves But morale hasn’t got a chance of improving until streaming services are no longer enshittified, so I guess streaming TV is going to die.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Latest Mad Money Episode: Top 10 Stocks to Watch. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other stocks on Jim Cramer's top stocks to watch list. Jim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC made the case for investing in individual stocks to enjoy bigger gains when compared to investing in just the broader market index funds. Cramer said that while it's "easy" to just park your money in index funds and let the market do the work, investing in individual stocks can give you some "serious gains." "I think you should own more than just an index fund because buying individual stocks with special characteristics is how you can rack up some really serious gains. That includes often scoring speculative stocks. Far too often, we become snobs when we talk stocks. So many experts think that if you venture past the index, you could fall off some sort of intellectual cliff that makes any gains null and void. It’s as if the huge swath of points you could have gained simply don’t count. But that, people, is nonsense." Cramer said banks do not "care" where the money comes from and neither should investors. He urged investors to not always avoid speculation. "I come tonight to praise speculation. Here, I’m the only one on TV who actually does this, believe it or not, and to show you how well you could have done if you picked some high flyers for your portfolio and simply held them for the long ride, along with your prosaic, precious index funds."

For this article we watched the latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC and picked 10 stocks he's talking about. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 130 Commenting about Broadcom in a latest program on CNBC, Jim Cramer said: “I am also pulling for Broadcom. I think Broadcom should do well. I don’t know whether Cisco is going to hurt it today with its light guidance because I think Broadcom is doing very very well.” Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) continues to be a leader in the AI ASCI and networking chips market. Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) has 3nm AI ASIC chip deals with Alphabet and Meta in addition to many other tech giants aiming massive spending for AI hyperscaling. The company’s Ethernet business is also strong amid partnerships with Arista Networks (ANET), while the company is also collaborating with Dell (DELL), Juniper (JNPR), and Super Micro (SMCI) in the networking business and other segments. Baron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “We continued to build our position in Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), a global technology leader that designs, develops, and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. As AI continues to proliferate, we believe hyperscalers – such as Meta, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Compute, and Amazon Web Services, to name just a few – will increasingly deploy custom accelerator chips for their AI workloads as they can be more cost-effective and energy-efficient than using NVIDIA’s general-purpose GPUs. Broadcom has a leading position partnering with hyperscalers to develop these custom chips, with its AI customer accelerator business up 3.5-times year-over-year in its most recently reported quarter, and a goal of at least $8 billion in custom accelerator revenues for this fiscal year. Additionally, VMware continues to perform better than expected as Broadcom is implementing its product simplification and subscription revenue model strategy.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) stock rose more than 20% in early trading Tuesday after the artificial intelligence server maker submitted a compliance plan with the SEC late Monday to avoid delisting from the Nasdaq. The company — which partners with Nvidia (NVDA) to provide high-tech servers with its AI chips and recently scored a major deal to supply those servers to Elon Musk's xAI — said its compliance plan shows it is on track to submit delayed filings to the SEC "and become current with its periodic reports within the discretionary period available to the Nasdaq staff to grant." Investors eagerly awaited the filing following a Barron’s report on Friday after the bell, which stated that Super Micro would submit its plan to prevent delisting by the deadline on Monday per Nasdaq rules, citing people familiar with the matter. The stock surged roughly 16% during regular trading Monday. The server maker also said Monday that the company has hired a new auditor, BDO, after its prior accountant, EY, resigned in late October. Even with this week's surge, shares have tumbled roughly 56% over the past three months. After gaining as much as 300% earlier this year, SMCI stock is now down over 20% in 2024. Super Micro has been grappling with the fallout from an August report by short seller firm Hindenburg Research, which shed light on alleged accounting malpractices, violations of export controls, and shady relationships between top executives and Super Micro partners. Following the Hindenburg report, the company delayed its annual 10-K filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission. And last week, Super Micro also delayed filing its most recent quarterly 10-Q report to the SEC. Adding to its woes, the company is reportedly being investigated by the Department of Justice. The barrage of bad news sent shares tumbling — EY’s resignation, in particular, pushed Super Micro stock down more than 30% in a single day in late October. Shares of the company also fell sharply following Super Micro’s fiscal first quarter earnings report on Nov. 5, which missed Wall Street’s expectations, sending shares down 18% on the day following the results. Super Micro rose to prominence over the past year as the generative artificial intelligence boom propelled sales for its AI servers and other AI-related tech. In its fiscal year 2024, Super Micro’s adjusted earnings rose nearly 90% to $2.21 per share, and revenue soared 110% to $15 billion. Analysts expect the company’s earnings to grow more than 40% in the 2025 fiscal year, and they see sales surging just over 70%. Elsewhere on Monday, the server maker announced product updates during the Supercomputing Conference in Atlanta, including its next-generation AI servers using Nvidia Blackwell chips. "Supermicro has the expertise, delivery speed, and capacity to deploy the largest liquid-cooled AI data center projects in the world, containing 100,000 GPUs, which Supermicro and NVIDIA contributed to and recently deployed," Super Micro CEO Charles Liang wrote in a statement on Monday. "We now have solutions that use the NVIDIA Blackwell platform." Nvidia will report its earnings for its fiscal third quarter on Wednesday. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

What investors will want to see when Nvidia reports its third-quarter earnings on Wednesday is whether it can continue to grow at a fierce rate, even as the boom in AI enters its third year. Nvidia is entering "uncharted territory" as it attempts to continue growing on a $3.5 trillion market cap, wrote HSBC analyst Frank Lee in a report this week. "We have pondered this amazing growth trajectory and not only do we see no signs of a slowdown, we expect further upside in 2026 data center momentum," Lee said in his note. He has a buy rating on the stock. Future growth will have to come from Blackwell, its next-generation chip that has just started shipping to end-users such as Microsoft, Google and OpenAI. More important than Nvidia's third-quarter results will be what the company says about demand for the Blackwell chip. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang will likely update investors about how that is shaping up on Wednesday, and he will potentially address reports that some of the systems based on Blackwell chips are experiencing overheating issues. In August, Nvidia said it expected about "several billion" in Blackwell sales during the January quarter. "Our base case is for NVDA to ship ~100K Blackwell GPUs in 4Q, which we believe is near the low-end of investor expectations," Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri wrote in a note last week. He has a strong buy rating on the stock. Since Nvidia's last earnings report, the stock is up nearly 19%, capping off a stunning run that has seen the share price rise eightfold since ChatGPT was released in late 2022. Alongside the stock's rise has been a fierce increase in sales and margin, and its forward price to earnings ratio has expanded to just under 50, according to FactSet. Growth is slowing, but that is partially because Nvidia's top line is so much larger than before. Nvidia reported 122% growth in sales in the most-recent quarter. That was lower than the 262% year-over-year growth it reported in the April quarter and the 265% growth in the January quarter. Analysts polled by LSEG are expecting around $33.12 billion in revenue, which would be nearly 83% growth compared to a year ago. The company is also expected to post 75 cents in earnings per share, according to LSEG consensus estimates. Nvidia's data center business accounted for nearly 88% of sales in the most-recent quarter, taking the focus off the company's legacy computer games business. The company makes the chip for the Nintendo Switch, for example, which the Japanese video game company says is seeing major sales declines as the game console ages. Nvidia's gaming business is expected to grow about 6% to $3.03 billion, according to a FactSet estimate. Its automotive business, making chips for electric cars, is still small, even though analysts expect it to grow 38% to about $360 million in sales. But none of that will matter as long as Nvidia's data center business continues to grow at a rate that is nearly doubling on an annual basis and Huang signals to investors that the party won't end.

Title: Can Nvidia Stock Lose 50%?

SUQIAN, CHINA - NOVEMBER 16, 2024 - Illustration Nvidia invests in Applied Digital, Suqian City, ... [+] Jiangsu Province, China, Nov 16, 2024. (Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images) Nvidia stock has been a standout performer in the AI boom, rising by over 180% year-to-date. However, could this remarkable run reverse, and the stock fall by over 50% from current levels? It’s a real possibility. At the current market price of $140, Nvidia trades at over 80x trailing earnings and 50x projected FY’25 earnings. These multiples seem elevated, but they sure are supported by the company’s recent high growth rates as Nvidia has been witnessing booming demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs), which have become the go-to silicon for artificial intelligence applications. However, stock markets often extrapolate short-term trends into the long run. For another stock that has been volatile recently see Is Super Micro Stock A Buy Now? In Nvidia’s case, the price likely assumes that demand growth, pricing power, and profits for Nvidia’s accelerators will remain robust as the generative AI wave holds up. Yet, there are significant risks to this assumption, making a sizable correction a real possibility. The broader economic environment adds another layer of uncertainty. While markets have rallied following the election of Donald Trump, the risk of inflation persists amid threats of tariffs and deportation policies. These factors could impact the interest rate environment and, in turn, the valuation of high-growth stocks like Nvidia. (S&P To Crash More Than 40%?) We present this downside as a counter to our analysis of Nvidia’s upside to $300. Indeed we believe this broad range of upside and downside potential represents a simple fact: Nvidia is a volatile stock. How Volatile Has Nvidia Stock Been? While NVDA stock swelled over 10x from levels of $13 in early January 2021 to around $140 now, vs. an increase of about 50% for the S&P 500 over this roughly 4-year period. It was a bumpy ride, with returns for the stock being 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, and 239% in 2023. The underperformance in NVDA’s stock vs. the S&P 500 in 2022 stands out in particular - as the benchmark index had returns of -19% that year, compared to a 50% drawdown for Nvidia. Notably, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Nvidia’s Growth Rates Could Cool Off Nvidia’s sales have grown at a breakneck pace. Nvidia’s revenues were up by close to 3x over the last 12 months as companies doubled down on accelerated computing using GPUs to perform more artificial intelligence tasks. However, there is a possibility that growth could cool considerably or potentially even flatline. Why? The underlying economics of the end market for GPU chips and the broader AI ecosystem are weak, and most of Nvidia’s customers remain loss-making. Large language models are very expensive to build and train. VC firm Sequoia estimated that the AI industry spent $50 billion on Nvidia chips last year, and the total could exceed $100 billion when including ancillary investments. Despite this, these investments have only generated about $3 billion in revenue, with few AI services besides ChatGPT gaining a large base of paying customers. We could very well be in a phase where companies are seeing so-called FOMO, compelling them to invest in AI just because their rivals are doing so, without a thought about the return on investments. As shareholders seek better returns, we could see capital spending cool off, impacting the likes of Nvidia. The macro environment might also play spoilsport. The Fed all but finalized last week that rates are unlikely to be cut in the Fed’s December meeting amid concerns about inflation. Elevated interest rates could further compound the weak payback equation for AI GPUs. Separately, large AI deployments have two stages: the compute-intensive training phase, which drives Nvidia’s current demand, and the deployment phase, where trained models are used in real-world applications with lower power requirements. Most companies are going through the compute-intensive training phase at the moment, and there’s a real possibility that demand for GPUs could cool off once these companies move to the deployment phase. Even if demand for Nvidia’s products remains strong, growth could face challenges on account of supply constraints or execution issues. Nvidia has adopted a timeline of releasing a new AI chip series annually, which increases the risk of missteps. For instance, Nvidia’s latest Blackwell chip faced certain design flaws which delayed its release by a quarter. Although these issues were eventually resolved, a recent report by The Information indicates that the chip is now overheating when used with certain customized server racks. While Nvidia is reportedly working with its suppliers to redesign these racks to address the problem, the incident highlights the risks associated with Nvidia’s aggressive development schedule. Moreover, Nvidia relies almost entirely on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for GPU production. This dependency could introduce further bottlenecks, as TSMC’s production timelines may not align with Nvidia’s ambitions. While Nvidia aims to launch a new AI chip every year, TSMC requires at least 18 months to set up new manufacturing facilities, according to The Economist. A potential misalignment between Nvidia’s goals and TSMC’s production capabilities could constrain Nvidia’s ability to meet demand effectively. Now, Nvidia’s revenues are on track to more than double this year to about $126 billion per consensus estimates. However, if its growth rates slow considerably from here on to just about 15% over the next two years due to the aforementioned factors, sales could see a much more subdued move from around $61 billion in FY’24 to about $166 billion in FY’27. Nvidia’s Margins Could Be At Risk Nvidia’s margins (net income, or profits after all expenses and taxes, calculated as a percent of revenues) have been expanding - they grew from levels of about 25% in FY’19 to about 49% in FY’24 as the company witnessed better economies of scale and a more favorable product mix skewed toward complex data center products. Our dashboard has more details about the various components responsible for Nvidia’s net income change. However, there is a real possibility that margins could decline to levels of about 35%. Why is that so? Competition is mounting with other chipmakers such as AMD investing significantly to catch up in this space given the high stakes. AMD claims that its new Instinct MI300X chip outperforms Nvidia’s current chips in several parameters, while Intel is also looking to make a dent in the space with more value-priced AI chips. Customers are also looking for alternatives to Nvidia, as they look to better manage costs. On Monday IBM said that it was collaborating with AMD to include Instinct MI300X accelerators into its cloud offerings. Separately, big tech players like Google - who are among the biggest buyers of Nvidia’s GPUs - are doubling down on their own AI and machine learning-related silicon. It’s quite likely that stronger competition will make Nvidia’s current revenue growth rates and abnormally high margins unsustainable. How Does This Impact Nvidia’s Valuation? If we combine 1.3x revenue growth (up 30%) between FY’25 and FY’27, with margins contracting from 50% levels currently to about 35% (down 30%, or 0.7x), this would imply that net income could decline by roughly 10% by 2027. Now if earnings shrink by 10%, the P/E multiple is also likely to take a hit as investors re-assess Nvidia’s long-term growth prospects. If Nvidia’s P/E gradually shrinks from a multiple of about 50x now to about 25x, this could translate into a decline in Nvidia stock by over 50% to levels of roughly $65 per share. What about the time horizon for this negative-return scenario? In practice, it won’t make much difference whether it takes two years or five years - if the competitive threat plays out and Nvidia’s GPU cash cow faces headwinds, we could see a sizable correction in Nvidia stock. (Should you Buy, Sell, Or Hold Nvidia Stock?) And it could be a bumpy ride yet again. While there is certainly a case to be made for long-term gains from NVDA stock, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio could be right up your alley if consistent outperformance is at the top of your list.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stock futures fell on Tuesday as worries about a nuclear escalation to the Russia-Ukraine war rattled markets, stealing focus from Nvidia (NVDA) earnings and other corporate results. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) led declines, down 0.5%, while S&P 500 futures (ES=F) slid roughly 0.3%. Contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) dropped 0.1%, on the heels of a mixed day for the major gauges. Stocks are retreating as investors assess news that President Vladimir Putin has signed a revised nuclear doctrine that allows Russia to expand its use of atomic weapons. The changes mean any large-scale aerial attack could prompt a nuclear response, and come just days after President Biden gave Ukraine the go-ahead to use US long-range missiles to strike inside Russia. US bond prices climbed alongside gains for the yen (JPY=X), gold (GC=F), and other safe-haven assets as the risk-off trade kicked in. Treasury yields — which move inversely to bond prices — fell, with the 10-year benchmark yield (^TNX) down 5 basis points to around 4.37%. Gold jumped almost 1% to trade at around $2,639 an ounce. The geopolitical situation blotted out themes such as corporate earnings, President-elect Trump's cabinet picks, the path of interest rates, and Wall Street's view of where stocks are headed. Retailers Walmart (WMT) and Lowe's (LOW) posted quarterly reports before the bell, with investors watching out for hints to the resilience of the consumer. Walmart stock popped following a boost to guidance after a strong quarter. Lowe's likewise beat on earnings and revenue, but the DIY giant's shares slipped as investors focused on a negative outlook for sales. Meanwhile, the countdown is on to Nvidia earnings on Wednesday, seen as a test of the AI trade that has powered gains on Wall Street. The chipmaker's stock edged higher in premarket trading after getting bruised by a report of overheating issues with its flagship new AI product. Goldman Sachs strategists said they expect outperformance by Nvidia and its "Magnificent Seven" tech megacap peers to narrow next year, in an S&P 500 (^GSPC) forecast setting a 6,500 target by the end of next year. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Walmart (WMT) has worked very diligently behind the scenes the past two years to be a major player online. The company has expanded its assortment online and has fine-tuned its buy online, pickup in store functionality — amongst other initiatives. The efforts continue to show up on earnings days. Here are the company's e-commerce results by division for the third quarter reported this morning: These results are eye-popping for two reasons: 1) Walmart isn't exactly a startup; 2) the competition online is as fierce as ever. I am talking to Walmart CFO John David Rainey live at 9:15am on Yahoo Finance. Rest assured we will ask him about these online sales numbers! Hat tip to Goldman's chief US equity strategist David Kostin for calling out specific stocks in his 2025 outlook piece that just dropped. So often these year end works of art from investment bank strategists simply serve up S&P 500 targets, with various underlying scenarios explained. But usually, no stock predictions. Kostin is calling out another year of strong performance for the Mag 7 trade, just not as hot as recent years. Says Kostin: "The ‘Magnificent 7’ stocks (Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA)) collectively will outperform the S&P 493 in 2025, but by roughly 7 percentage points, the slimmest margin in seven years and down from 63 percentage points in 2023 and 22 percentage points year to date. Narrowing relative EPS growth will drive the narrowing performance gap." It's a good point by Kostin, and comes in the face of all these Mag 7 stocks trading at rich multiples on hearty outlooks for profit growth. There is only so far you can push a stock price using reasonable future financial assumptions! You can toil around on Mag 7 valuations on Yahoo Finance's new stock comparison tool here. As I noted on Monday in our blog, expectations on Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings and outlook are very robust...to say the very least. If there is one thing that could trip up the bullish trade the morning after earnings, it's Nvidia's guidance. While it will likely be above consensus, it may not be above consensus enough given the dynamics around Blackwell chip demand. Nvidia could opt to go stronger with guidance when it reports three months from now or so. Important point on this from Stifel analyst Ruben Roy this morning in a note: "While expectations are elevated and our scenario appears to be widely anticipated (consensus estimates for FY2026/FY2027 have moved roughly +4% over the past two weeks), our conversations suggest that a Blackwell driven inflection to the upside is more likely an April quarter event than January."

Title: Lifting 42% YTD What Next For Bank Of America?

Bank of America at the heart of Canary Wharf financial district on 5th November 2024 in London, ... [+] United Kingdom. (photo by Mike Kemp/In Pictures via Getty Images) Bank of America’s stock (NYSE: BAC) has gained about 42% year-to-date, compared to the 25% rise in the S&P500 index over the same period. Bank of America’s peer Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) is up by an even stronger 54% YTD. Overall, at its current price of $46 per share, BAC is trading around the Trefis’ estimate for Bank of America’s valuation. Some of the stock’s recent gains come off the back of the U.S. election, which saw the election of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency for a second term. Investors are betting that the Trump administration’s focus on deregulation could translate into a more lenient approach to bank oversight versus the Biden administration. This could help banks boost their revenues, via higher deal volumes, lending activity, and potentially lower compliance costs which could boost profitability. Trump has also been in favor of tax cuts and this could also help the bottom lines of banks like Bank of America. Republicans, who generally favor free markets, have won control of the Senate and are on track to win the House of Representatives as well, and this could also be seen as a positive for the banking sector at large. The increase in BAC stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 50% in 2021, -24% in 2022, and 5% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is much less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could BAC face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump? Let’s take a look at the company’s recent performance and outlook to find out. Bank of America outperformed the street expectations in the third quarter of FY 2024, with total revenues coming in at $25.3 billion roughly flat compared to last year as the company’s gains in trading revenues, asset management, and investment banking fees were offset by a decline in net interest income. In addition, net profits declined 12% year-over-year to $6.9 billion, on account of higher provisions for loan losses. Net interest income has been impacted by rising rates, which result in higher payments on deposits while potentially deterring borrowing and loan growth as financing becomes more expensive for clients. However, the company has seen stronger activity in its advisory and trading businesses. While the Fixed-income trading revenue rose 8% year-over-year during the last quarter, led by stronger currencies and interest rate-related activity, Equities trading jumped 18% on account of higher cash and derivative volumes. BofA’s wealth and investment management revenue also rose 8% year-over-year to $5.8 billion driven by rising market valuations and client flows. Looking ahead, things could get better. The company’s net interest income could improve in Q4 driven in part by the Federal Reserve rate cuts which started in September. The sequential growth in NII during Q3 also indicates that a potential turnaround is taking hold. Additionally, lower interest rates and more political certainty post-election could spur investment banking activity, with increased debt and equity issuances with M&A-related activity also poised to increase.

Title: The AI race is shifting to AI agents. What are they?

A future where everyone has an artificial intelligence-powered assistant might not be too far off. While tech giants and AI startups have been racing to launch the smartest AI-powered chatbots, recent AI product rollouts point to a shift toward developing the most helpful AI-powered assistants — or as some in the tech industry are calling them, AI agents. That’s not to be confused with AI assistants, also known as co-pilots, which mostly refer to AI that can work alongside people to help them carry out tasks, but don’t usually work autonomously. The terminology around these technologies remains fluid, with companies marketing products with different labels to differentiate from one another. While addressing concerns over the impact AI will have on jobs, Nvidia (NVDA+0.59%) chief executive Jensen Huang said that it’s likely every job, including his, will be transformed by the technology, because everyone will eventually have an AI assistant. Even Nvidia’s chip designers are using AI assistants, Huang said during an interview at the industry conference SIGGRAPH 2024. Without AI assistants, the company’s highly sought-after Hopper chips, which power some of the world’s leading AI models, wouldn’t have been possible, he said. The same apparently goes for the chipmaker’s new AI platform, Blackwell. “I think the main reason is that the value that they capture and generate is just a magnitude different from what we’ve had so far,” Daniel Vassilev, co-founder and chief executive of Relevance AI, told Quartz. “What agents are kind of promising us is this future where they can complete work that was previously impossible to be done with automation.” Companies are starting to focus on AI agents because “everyone realizes now that we’re in a place where the future is going to look very different — we’re going to have the capacity to do a whole lot more,” Vassilev said. “I think a lot of people are realizing that the old way of doing things is probably also going to change.” Simply put, an AI agent is software that can complete complex tasks autonomously. So far, most AI-powered tools have been co-pilots that can help users work more efficiently, Vassilev said. OpenAI’s ChatGPT, for example, is a co-pilot. Users can interact with and work alongside ChatGPT, “but it’s still ultimately an assistant” that has to be prompted over and over, Vassilev said. With AI agents, users can delegate work to the tool, then check to see if it needs assistance or if it has finished. Vassilev’s company, Relevance, develops virtual workforces of AI agents that are used by major companies including Activision (MSFT-0.42%) and Roku (ROKU0.00%). Rebecca Greene, co-founder and chief technology officer of Regal, said AI agents are “like humans” that can be given personas and jobs to do. But, Greene said, AI agents are not meant to trick customers into thinking they’re speaking to a real human. “When you’re calling them or when they’re calling you, they know exactly what they’re trying to accomplish, what their goals are, what their personality is,” Greene said. Regal, which develops purpose-built AI agents for call centers, believes 90% of interactions in contact centers are going to be AI-led over the next ten years, Greene said. For now, most AI agents are simple, Greene said, such as those used for setting up doctor’s appointments. “An AI agent can place a phone call, not take the doctor’s time, speak to the customer on the other side, find a mutually agreeable time to schedule something, book that appointment in the doctor’s calendar, and the customer confirms it,” she said. So far, Greene said Regal’s clients see acceptance from customers for AI agents, which can perform better than some humans in areas such as speaking in several languages, being available at all hours of the day, and keeping composure in difficult situations. Microsoft launched its new, purpose-built AI agents in Microsoft 365 Copilot at Ignite 2024, its annual conference for developers. The AI agents can work on simple or complex, multi-step tasks with or on behalf of a team or organization, Microsoft said. The new AI agents include the Interpreter agent that allows for real-time interpretation in up to nine languages in Microsoft Teams meetings. The Interpreter agent, which will be in preview early next year, gives meeting participants the ability to speak and listen to meetings in the language of their choice. The agent can also simulate a participant’s voice. The Project Manager agent, which is in preview now, can automate project management tasks in Microsoft Planner. The agent can automatically create new plans from scratch or from a template, assign tasks, track project progress, and send status updates to participants, Microsoft said. In Copilot Studio, Microsoft announced that customers can build their own autonomous agents that can take action without prompting. In the agent library, users can build off of templates of common-use AI agents. In October, Microsoft announced that it would be rolling out the AI agents which, “offer more precise predictions, enhanced natural language processing, and improved decision-making support.” At SIGGRAPH 2024 in July, Meta (META-0.42%) chief executive Mark Zuckerberg announced the wider rollout of Meta’s platform, AI Studio, which allows users and creators to generate AI characters of themselves that can act as an assistant for different tasks, including interacting with their community. Meta’s vision, Zuckerberg said, is to empower users, from creators to small businesses, to create agents for themselves. Meanwhile AI startup OpenAI is reportedly preparing to launch an AI agent, codenamed “Operator,” that can do tasks on behalf of a person, including coding and booking travel, Bloomberg reported. The startup is also reportedly close to completing another AI agent project that can perform tasks in a web browser. As companies begin adopting AI agents, they will likely invest in building their own, Greene said, that align with their industry-use cases and that are trained on their data. Vassilev said the focus will be on less-risky parts of a business, such as highly-repetitive and monotonous tasks that workers don’t want to do. Now that companies realize that “2025 is going to be the year of AI agents,” Vassilev said he expects an uptick in AI agent products. Alongside that, people will have to build trust with AI agents the way they would with a human co-worker. “When you’re hiring someone, you want to trust them, you want to know they’re doing a good job,” Vassilev said. “I think in a similar way, when you’re adopting an agent that’s going to be autonomous, you also need to build that trust.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Stocks That Could 10X Over the Next 3 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against the other stocks that could 10x over the next 3 years. The new president of the United States is set to take office in January 2025, and investors are concerned about how the new policies will impact big tech. On November 14, Arvind Krishna, Chairman and CEO of IBM, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to share his expectations from big tech as the new presidency takes over the White House. Krishna shares that he expects more innovation and less regulation in the tech sector, with certain "guardrails." He adds that the business community is particularly excited and expects strong tailwinds to the US economy as we enter 2025. In the same interview, William Kerwin, an analyst at Morningstar Technology, appeared to discuss the potential future of big tech under the new presidency and how the new policies could impact companies, particularly those trading in China. Kerwin emphasizes that a lot is yet to unfold but the most crucial element is tariffs. With a proposed 60% tariff on Chinese imports, companies reliant on the region will face severe headwinds and may have to seek trade relationships with other regions like India and Southeast Asia. However, he does add that high exposure to China does not necessarily equate to "high investment risk." READ ALSO 10 Best Predictive Analytics Stocks to Invest in Now and 12 Cheap Chinese Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. Speaking of mergers and acquisitions and antitrust regulations, Kerwin is rather optimistic. He expects more merger and acquisition deals to come through over the next four years. In addition to that, he expresses that anti-trust regulations are less likely to be focused on a specific company or a product, and more on the platforms and their respective use cases offered by big tech. Kerwin also adds that he does not expect significant breakups but foresees regulations to be enforced that "erode" the competitive advantages the big tech companies enjoy at the moment. Kerwin believes that companies well exposed to artificial intelligence are currently overvalued. However, he reiterates that this "does not mean" that there are not any opportunities within the sector. He also shares a couple of names in the chip equipment and semiconductor sectors that are well-positioned at the moment. He suggests that while these sectors are pressed over cyclicality worries and the fear of AI reaching maturity, some companies hold promise and are valuable. Since investors are excited to see the business opportunities coming over the next four years, there are certain stocks, especially in the realm of technology, most likely to gain significant momentum. That said, let's take a look at the 8 stocks that could 10x over the next 3 years. Our Methodology To come up with the 8 stocks that could 10x over the next 3 years, we sifted through multiple similar rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 stocks. We then ranked the top 8 based on their upside potential, as of November 18, 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a complex network of integrated circuits used in logic semiconductors. Analyst Upside as of November 18, 2024: 29% Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is one of the stocks that could 10x over the next three years. The semiconductor company makes chips for technology giants like NVIDIA and AMD. In the third quarter of 2024, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) logged revenue worth $23.7 billion (NT$759.69 billion) and net income worth $10.13 billion (NT$325.26 billion), up by 39% and 54.2% year-over-year, respectively. TSM attributes its revenue growth to the increasing demand for artificial intelligence and expects its four-year revenue to increase by nearly 30%. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is expanding its presence across the world. The company recently formed a joint venture with major partners in Germany and expanded its partnership with Amkor to facilitate advanced packaging in Arizona, fueling the semiconductor ecosystem in the region. In addition to that, the company expects to spend $32 billion to $40 billion in capital expenditures in 2024, allocated to advanced process technologies, specialty technologies, and advanced packaging and testing. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) expects revenue from AI chips to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50% by 2027. Baron Global Advantage Fund stated the following regarding Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “We established a small position in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM). Morris Chang founded TSMC in 1987, as the world’s first dedicated semiconductor foundry. Until then, semiconductor chips were always designed and manufactured by the same company. TSMC introduced a groundbreaking new business model, in which it acted purely as a contract manufacturer, which proved to be highly successful. TSMC maintained a focus on improving its manufacturing process technology and enabled the emergence of innovative fabless design companies, including NVIDIA, Apple, and Qualcomm, who became TSMC’s key customers. Today, TSMC has a more than 60% share of the total semiconductor foundry market and over 90% share in leading-edge manufacturing. TSMC enjoys high barriers to entry given the ever-increasing cost and technological complexity of semiconductor manufacturing while benefiting from economies of scope as once leading-edge manufacturing becomes lagging edge on fully depreciated equipment. TSMC also benefits from scale– higher profits lead to higher R&D and capex investments, allowing for further technological differentiation, resulting in more profits. We believe TSMC will sustain strong double-digit earnings growth for years to come, driven by continued market share gains, strong pricing power, and structural growth in AI demand. According to C.C. Wei, TSMC’s CEO, “almost all the AI innovators are working with TSMC to address the insatiable AI-related demand.”6 Management forecasts that revenue from server AI chips, such as GPUs and other AI accelerators, will grow at a 50% CAGR from 2022 to 2028 and account for more than 20% of TSMC’s revenue by 2028. We except further long-term upside from the eventual proliferation of edge AI devices, including AI smartphones and AI PCs, which will require significantly more computing power and drive even stronger demand for TSMC’s leading-edge technology.” Overall TSM ranks 5th on our list of the stocks that could 10x over the next 3 years. While we acknowledge the potential of TSM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Novo Nordisk said Monday it has launched its popular obesity drug Wegovy in China, the world’s second-largest pharmaceuticals market where it estimates more than 180 million people live with obesity. The move intensifies the competition with Eli Lilly, which secured approval for its weight-loss drug in China in July but has yet to launch it. Both companies are ramping up production to capitalize on a weight-loss market projected by analysts to exceed $150 billion by the beginning of the next decade. A spokesperson for the Danish drugmaker confirmed the news to Reuters after it was first reported by China-based financial media outlet Yicai. Related article Your employer may start covering weight-loss drugs soon The list price of Wegovy in the United States is about $1,349 for a month’s supply. The Novo spokesperson did not comment on the price in China. Novo gained approval for Wegovy in China in June and will initially target Chinese patients willing to pay out-of-pocket for the weekly injectable drug. Novo (NVO) launched Wegovy in the US in 2021. Strong sales there and in the 15 other countries where Wegovy has since launched have propelled Novo’s shares to record highs. The company has a market capitalization of about $449 billion. Wegovy will not be reimbursed by China’s national healthcare insurance, which provides basic coverage for most of the country’s 1.4 billion people. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Time Published: 2024-11-18T18:33:00Z

November 18, 2024 13:33 ET | Source: NVIDIA NVIDIA ATLANTA, Nov. 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SC24 -- NVIDIA today announced an NVIDIA Omniverse™ Blueprint that enables industry software developers to help their computer-aided engineering (CAE) customers in aerospace, automotive, manufacturing, energy and other industries create digital twins with real-time interactivity. Software developers such as Altair, Ansys, Cadence and Siemens can use the NVIDIA Omniverse Blueprint for real-time computer-aided engineering digital twins to help their customers drive down development costs and energy usage while getting to market faster. The blueprint is a reference workflow that includes NVIDIA acceleration libraries, physics-AI frameworks and interactive physically based rendering to achieve 1,200x faster simulations and real-time visualization. “We built Omniverse so that everything can have a digital twin,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Omniverse Blueprints are reference pipelines that connect NVIDIA Omniverse with AI technologies, enabling leading CAE software developers to build groundbreaking digital twin workflows that will transform industrial digitalization, from design and manufacturing to operations, for the world’s largest industries.” One of the first applications of the blueprint is computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, a critical step to virtually explore, test and refine the designs of cars, airplanes, ships and many other products. Traditional engineering workflows — from physics simulation to visualization and design optimization — can take weeks or even months to complete. In an industry first, NVIDIA and Luminary Cloud are demonstrating at SC24 a virtual wind tunnel that allows users to simulate and visualize fluid dynamics at real-time, interactive speeds, even when changing the vehicle model inside the tunnel. Unifying Three Pillars of NVIDIA Technology for DevelopersBuilding a real-time physics digital twin requires two fundamental capabilities: real-time physics solver performance and real-time visualization of large-scale datasets. The Omniverse Blueprint achieves these by bringing together NVIDIA CUDA-X™ libraries to accelerate the solvers, the NVIDIA Modulus physics-AI framework to train and deploy models to generate flow fields, and NVIDIA Omniverse application programming interfaces for 3D data interoperability and real-time RTX-enabled visualization. Developers can integrate the blueprint as individual elements or in its entirety into their existing tools. Ecosystem Uses NVIDIA Blueprint to Advance SimulationsAnsys is the first to adopt the Omniverse Blueprint, applying it to Ansys Fluent fluid simulation software to enable accelerated CFD simulation. Ansys ran Fluent at the Texas Advanced Computing Center on 320 NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchips. A 2.5-billion-cell automotive simulation was completed in just over six hours, which would have taken nearly a month running on 2,048 x86 CPU cores, significantly enhancing the feasibility of overnight high-fidelity CFD analyses and establishing a new industry benchmark. “By integrating NVIDIA Omniverse Blueprint with Ansys software, we’re enabling our customers to tackle increasingly complex and detailed simulations more quickly and accurately,” said Ajei Gopal, president and CEO of Ansys. “Our collaboration is pushing the boundaries of engineering and design across multiple industries.” Luminary Cloud is also adopting the blueprint. The company’s new simulation AI model, built on NVIDIA Modulus, learned the relationships between airflow fields and car geometry based on training data generated from its GPU-accelerated CFD solver. The model runs simulations orders of magnitude faster than the solver itself, enabling real-time aerodynamic flow simulation that is visualized using Omniverse APIs. Altair, Beyond Math, Cadence, Hexagon, Neural Concept, Siemens, SimScale and Trane Technologies are also exploring adoption of the Omniverse Blueprint into their own applications. The Omniverse Blueprint can be run on all leading cloud platforms, including Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. It is also available on NVIDIA DGX™ Cloud. Rescale, a cloud-based platform that helps organizations accelerate scientific and engineering breakthroughs, is using the NVIDIA Omniverse Blueprint to enable organizations to train and deploy custom AI models in just a few clicks. The Rescale platform automates the full application-to-hardware stack and can be run across any cloud service provider. Organizations can generate training data using any simulation solver; prepare, train and deploy the AI models; run inference predictions; and visualize and optimize models.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 15 AI News and Ratings You Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI news and ratings you should not miss. AI technology has forced businesses worldwide to reconsider their money making models. This revolutionary change is now making its way into the government sector as well. According to a report from news agency Reuters, Mothibi Ramusi, the chief of the communications regulator in South Africa, recently said that the information and communications technology sector needs policy and regulatory changes to keep up with emerging technologies. The country is also debating new regulations for mobile virtual networks and spectrum sharing. The regulator has initiated an inquiry into the licensing framework for satellite-internet providers to provide clear rules for potential operators in the country. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. In Japan, multinational conglomerate Softbank has partnered with chipmaker NVIDIA in a partnership that aims to turn communication base stations from cost centers into AI revenue-producing assets. The latter claims that traditional telco networks are built to handle peak loads and usually use only about one-third of their capacity. With AI-RAN, a new communications tech, they can expect to monetize the remaining two-thirds of the capacity for AI inference services. Softbank estimates a return of up to 219% for every AI-RAN server it adds to its infrastructure.

Title: NVIDIA Accelerates Google Quantum AI Processor Design With Simulation of Quantum Device Physics

SC24—NVIDIA today announced it is working with Google Quantum AI to accelerate the design of its next-generation quantum computing devices using simulations powered by the NVIDIA CUDA-Q™ platform. Google Quantum AI is using the hybrid quantum-classical computing platform and the NVIDIA Eos supercomputer to simulate the physics of its quantum processors. This will help overcome the current limitations of quantum computing hardware, which can only run a certain number of quantum operations before computations must cease, due to what researchers call “noise.” “The development of commercially useful quantum computers is only possible if we can scale up quantum hardware while keeping noise in check,” said Guifre Vidal, research scientist from Google Quantum AI. “Using NVIDIA accelerated computing, we’re exploring the noise implications of increasingly larger quantum chip designs.” Understanding noise in quantum hardware designs requires complex dynamical simulations capable of fully capturing how qubits within a quantum processor interact with their environment. These simulations have traditionally been prohibitively computationally expensive to pursue. Using the CUDA-Q platform, however, Google can employ 1,024 NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs at the NVIDIA Eos supercomputer to perform one of the world’s largest and fastest dynamical simulation of quantum devices — at a fraction of the cost. “AI supercomputing power will be helpful to quantum computing’s success,” said Tim Costa, director of quantum and HPC at NVIDIA. “Google’s use of the CUDA-Q platform demonstrates the central role GPU-accelerated simulations have in advancing quantum computing to help solve real-world problems.” With CUDA-Q and H100 GPUs, Google can perform fully comprehensive, realistic simulations of devices containing 40 qubits — the largest-performed simulations of this kind. The simulation techniques provided by CUDA-Q mean noisy simulations that would have taken a week can now run in minutes. The software powering these accelerated dynamic simulations will be publicly available in the CUDA-Q platform, allowing quantum hardware engineers to rapidly scale their system designs.

Title: Delta will lay out plans for its continued carrier dominance at Investor Day

Delta Air Lines (DAL-0.53%) is having a pretty good year so far. Its stock has climbed 57% since January 1, more than double the gains of the S&P 500. And despite the CrowdStrike (CRWD+2.09%) software outage that introduced far more chaos into its operations than its industry peers — to the tune of $500 million in losses — the carrier is still pulling in profits. Now Delta wants to let its current and prospective shareholders know that it expects to have a pretty good 2025 as well. It’s not dealing with severe financial woes like Spirit Airlines. It’s not coming out the other end of a nasty proxy battle like Southwest Airlines. And it’s not battling to regain the trust of key constituencies like American Airlines. So its upcoming Investor Day should prove to be a pretty low-key affair. Maintaining a comfortable cruising altitude is sometimes easier said than done; investors will be looking to see if Delta can stay on course. Next year marks the company’s 100th anniversary — with a rockstar launch to come in Las Vegas — and it looks like Delta will get to have its birthday cake and eat it, too. Delta is the largest airline in America by market share according the Department of Transportation, edging out the likes of fellow majors Southwest and American Airlines (AAL-1.80%). The ratings agency Fitch restored Delta’s investment-grade credit rating this July after cutting it to junk during the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic. When it did so, it specifically cited Delta’s best-in-class market share as part of its rationale. “Delta’s investment grade rating is supported by its position as a leading network airline in the consolidated U.S. market,” the agency said. “Dominant positions in key hubs and a high level of network utility provide a competitive advantage over smaller airlines.” When Delta presented its most recent earnings report in October, one of the biggest headlines coming out of the release was a focus on the potential for election-week flying jitters to ding what is expected to be an otherwise robust fourth quarter. With Delta’s top-flight status secured, its next step is ensuring that it stays on top. Though there has been some focus on its efforts to swoop down to poach customers from low-fare airlines, its higher-profile customer-development schemes are trained on squeezing more money out of first- and business-class flyers who desire luxurious experiences, which just so happen to be much more profitable to provide. Per airline analyst Tom Fitzgerald at TD Cowen (TD-0.09%): We expect customer demographics to be a focus, both the company’s efforts around cultivating long-term relationships with clients as their desired cabin section progresses upward along their careers, as well as the opportunity around baby boomers and older members of Gen X who are able to fund premium travel out of robust nest eggs. After all, enormous and exclusive airport lounges are not a loss-leader proposition. During that last earnings call, analysts kept asking Delta’s executives if they could shed some light on the carrier’s long-term plans. The c-suite was cagey with specifics, but one theme of the executives’ comments was that everything seemed to be firing on all cylinders and would continue to do so. CEO Ed Bastian said that his company’s inertial sturdiness was one of its most prized assets. “It’s really hard to change course and to try to catch what is a train that’s moving at a pretty good speed … and so, we’ll continue on the pace we’re on,” he said. “We’re not going to change course. If anything, we’re just going to continue to accelerate.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Government-funded insurance plans are more likely to cover weight-loss drugs than private plans
URL: https://qz.com/medicaid-wegovy-insurance-coverage-1851701911
Time Published: 2024-11-18T17:16:00Z
Full Content:
New data shows that government-funded health insurance plans in the United States provide the majority of coverage for popular weight-loss drugs like Novo Nordisk’s (NVO-2.50%) Wegovy and Eli Lilly’s (LLY-0.48%) Zepbound. Wegovy and Zepbound belong to the class of drugs known as GLP-1 medications, made popular by Novo Nordisk’s diabetes treatment Ozempic. The drugs mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar and have become highly sought after as treatments for obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Ozempic and prescription weight-loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know Insurance coverage for GLP-1 drugs for the specific use of weight loss varies by plan. Some insurance companies and employers have been hesitant to cover the treatments due to their high cost. Only about 65 million, or 25%, of Americans have a health insurance plan that covers these weight-loss drugs, according to data from consulting firm Leverage. The firm’s AXIACI Obesity Coverage Nexus database tracks the insurance coverage of weight-loss treatments of roughly 80% of Americans. The majority of GLP-1 weight-loss drug coverage comes from state Medicaid plans. Leverage estimates that Medicaid plans, which are government programs for low-income families, provide weight-loss drug coverage for 31.6 million people. Medicare only covers these treatments if they are prescribed to treat a second condition in addition to weight loss. Additionally, 20.6 million federal, state, and local government employees and their families have plans with weight-loss drug coverage. Together, these government-funded plans make up about 80%, or 52.2 million, of the Americans with weight-loss drug coverage. When it comes to private or employer-sponsored plans, these only provide GLP-1 weight-loss drug coverage for 13.7 million people, according to the database. But because many employers don’t make the details of their plans public, Leverage estimates this number could be up to 24.4 million people. Without insurance, Wegovy is $1,349.02 for a month’s supply. Zepbound’s list price for most of its doses is $1,059.87 a month. A Morgan Stanley (MS+2.48%) survey conducted earlier this year among GLP-1 drug users, including those using the treatments for diabetes, found that about two-thirds of respondents had their medication fully covered by insurance. Those with out-of-pocket costs reported an average monthly cost of $196. Novo Nordisk claims that the majority of patients with insurance coverage pay $25 or less for a month’s supply of Ozempic or Wegovy. The drugs’ high list price and scarce insurance coverage have forced some people to turn to a growing copycat market. Some digital healthcare companies, online pharmacies, and wellness spas have started selling compounded versions of GLP-1 drugs for hundreds of dollars cheaper than branded versions. Compounding refers to the customization of an approved drug by a pharmacy or physician to meet the specific needs of an individual patient. Typically, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits compounding drugs that are just copies of commercially available medications. But drugs that are in shortage are not considered by the FDA to be commercially available. The limited supply of highly coveted and expensive brand-name drugs like Wegovy has spurred several healthcare companies to take advantage of that provision.

Title: Navigating The Trump 2.0 Market: What a second Trump presidency could mean for investors in the US and elsewhere.
URL: https://freerepublic.com/focus/f-chat/4279214/posts
Time Published: 2024-11-18T16:34:03Z

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/18/2024 8:34:03 AM PST by SeekAndFind Donald Trump and the Republican Party made a clean sweep in the US election. Some aspects of Trump’s campaign were a little vague, but we can be fairly certain of lower taxes and deregulation. That, and the strong US economy, should lead to higher corporate profits. On the other hand, the policies he plans to enact could be inflationary, and US government debt doesn’t look like it’s coming down anytime soon. This week we are having a look at what a second Trump presidency could mean for investors in the US and elsewhere. What Happened in Markets this Week?Here’s a quick summary of what’s been going on:⛏️ Gold price falls most since 2022 as investors pile into equities ( CNBC )What’s our take?This is a more typical ‘risk on’ reaction.Gold has rallied along with stocks throughout 2024, and the price was up 39% YTD before the election. That’s unusual, as gold typically outperforms during periods of uncertainty.But gold is also regarded as an inflation hedge. Now that expectations for inflation are rising again, we’ll have to see what that means for the gold price. It’s likely that investors decided to take profits on gold and put that money into more obvious short term trades. If that’s the case they have created an opportunity for gold bulls.🪙 iShares Bitcoin ETF is now bigger than its gold counterpart ( CNBC )What’s our take?This could be a sign of changing tides for cryptocurrencies.Trump’s election win has spurred on a Bitcoin rally as the cryptocurrency surged to new all-time highs. Investors were likely encouraged by expectations that the Trump administration could be crypto-friendly, given Trump himself spoke at the 2024 Bitcoin Conference.The recent surge could also be explained by investors gravitating towards Bitcoin as a hedge against the US dollar, in the event that Trump’s proposed tariffs have an inflationary effect and ultimately devalue the dollar. Interestingly, the US dollar also hit a 1-year high this week.💸 China sells USD bonds in Saudi Arabia ( FT )What’s our take?The USD remains the go-to currency for lenders and borrowers alike.An auction of $2 billion worth of government bonds by the Chinese Finance Ministry was 20 times oversubscribed. The 3 and 5-year bonds were sold with yields only slightly higher than equivalent US treasuries. That could mean investors believe the credit quality of both nations is the same - or that investors are happy with a little more diversification.China usually holds bond auctions in Hong Kong but held this one in Saudi Arabia for the first time. This could be an effort to build closer ties with investors in the country.This bond issue was tiny compared to China’s overall funding program. But the strong demand shows that appetite for USD denominated bonds is as strong as ever.💰 Buffett’s Berkshire Is Being Packaged Into a Leveraged ETF ( Bloomberg )What’s our take?The Sage of Omaha probably wouldn’t approve.When you buy a leveraged instrument, you are effectively borrowing money to increase buying power. Since Berkshire Hathaway is sitting on a huge pile of cash, you would effectively be borrowing cash to invest in… cash.On top of that, the funding rate you would effectively be paying would be a hurdle. Unless Berkshire outperforms that funding rate, returns could end up being underwhelming.🏗️ Homebuilder deal activity is surging, fueled by major Japanese buyers ( CNBC )What’s our take?Japanese efficiency could revolutionize the homebuilder market.Record-high housing demand in the U.S. has led to a rush of M&A activity among homebuilders. What’s more interesting is that almost half the deals are with Japanese companies according to Whelan Advisory, which makes sense when you consider Japan’s low-growth environment and low cost of capital.Japanese firms like Sekisui House are making inroads by acquiring major U.S. builders such as MDC Holdings, hoping to bring their advanced value engineering and efficiency techniques to the American market. It’s likely that other Japanese companies will follow suit, which could shake up the homebuilding processes and make housing more affordable through innovations like 3-D imaging and pre-cut materials.📉 US Inflation ticks up while jobless claims fall to lowest in six months ( Reuters )What’s our take?The rate cut journey won’t be all smooth sailing. Expect a few twists and turns along the way.Stubborn inflation and a reduction in first-time unemployment benefit applications are challenging the Federal Reserve's plans for aggressive rate cuts.Economists still expect a rate cut in December, but are now expecting a shallower rate-cutting cycle heading in to 2025. It’s expected that tariffs from President-elect Trump's incoming administration will add upward pressure on inflation and complicate the Fed's decision-making process.In our view, the Fed is likely to opt for fewer rate cuts in 2025 than previously projected, carefully balancing the risks of persistent inflation against the need to support economic growth.⚖️ Meta hit with €797 million EU fine for breaking antitrust rules ( Fortune )What’s our take?Big tech income statements need a new line item: ‘EU Fines’The EU's hefty €797 million fine against Meta for antitrust violations is a huge escalation in regulatory scrutiny over Big Tech's market practices.Meta's defense - that users engage with Facebook Marketplace by choice and not compulsion - seems to overlook the EU's concern about automatic access potentially stifling competition, particularly among competitors that advertise on Meta’s platforms.EU regulators are well armed in their fight against Big Tech, with major twin laws, the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act, that carry massive financial penalties in the event of infringements. Don’t expect this to be the last time a tech giant butts heads with EU regulators and has to cough up some cash.🇺🇸 The Trump 2.0 Stock MarketUS equities rallied when it became clear that Donald Trump would be returning to the White House. The market’s response was in part a relief rally after the outcome became clear early on, but some sectors certainly began to price in Trump’s pro-business stance. US Market Sector Performance 6th to 14th November - Simply Wall St As we’ve mentioned previously, elections tend to have less impact on the overall economy and stock market than leaders like to think. But, this election could be more consequential than usual for a few reasons:The result gave Donald Trump a clear mandate to govern.His campaign platform included some promises that are far more radical than prior elections.The GOP controls the White House, the Senate and the House. This will make it easier to pass legislation without votes from Democrats.This isn’t his first rodeo. Donald Trump hasn’t wasted any time nominating people for key roles, and he appears to have a plan to hit the ground running on day one.In short, the market appears to be anticipating higher growth, along with higher inflation and interest rates. The way things actually play out will depend on if, when, and how his policies are implemented.📈 Inflation and Interest RatesIn the run-up to the election, investors were aware that a Trump Presidency could lead to a rebound in inflation. The yield on 10-year treasuries rose as Trump’s poll numbers and the odds on betting platforms rose. This also occurred after the Fed cut rates by 50 basis points. US 10-year yields, US index and Trump Betting Odds - Finbold Two of Donald Trump’s biggest election promises were the mass deportation of illegal immigrants and tariffs on imports to the US. Both would probably be inflationary, depending on how or when they are implemented.💱 TariffsTrump has pledged to impose a 10% tariff on all imports, and a 60% tariff on goods from China. Tariffs would result in higher prices for US businesses and consumers. Tariffs would also incentivize local manufacturing, but it’s unlikely that prices would be competitive with low-cost manufacturing hubs, even with the tariff.Import duties result in a one-time increase in inflation, but inflation tends to ripple through the entire economy. The inflationary effect could also be offset - or amplified - by whatever happens to energy prices and the USD at the time.✨ A new round of tariffs could also result in trade partners responding with tariffs of their own. That would hurt US exporters - but could also lead to new trade deals being negotiated.🛫 Mass DeportationsIt’s estimated that there are 10 million or more undocumented immigrants in the US, many of whom are part of the labor force. Plans to deport these people at a time when the unemployment rate is historically low could result in a labor shortage. That would be good news for US workers, particularly those in low-paying jobs.However, it would also be inflationary, and could leave companies struggling to replace workers.The sectors that would be most affected include hospitality , construction , and agriculture where most undocumented immigrants work.In the case of both tariffs and deportations, the impact will depend on how far and how fast the administration implements these policies. The market will probably be quick to react, in which case implementation may be reassessed.Which companies would be shielded or benefit from these policies? Companies with little exposure to imports, and those that benefit from higher interest rates. would be best positioned. This includes smaller companies, banks and technology companies.✨ On the losing side of the equation, the valuations on growth stocks with high multiples and little to no earnings may need to adjust to higher discount rates.💰 Tax Cuts and DeficitsThe US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians. The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump’s campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let’s hope there’s still an appetite for those bonds.⚡ EnergyIt’s no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can’t be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump’s win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it’s probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It’s also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that’d actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It’s now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon’s proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. 🪙 The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it’ll probably hurt a lot of global business.✨ Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump’s election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it’s less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.💡 The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it’s worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‘time the market’ off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn’t a lot of clarity on what Trump’s second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Bon of Babble Perhaps the most contentious aspect of Trump’s economic policy was his approach to trade, particularly with China. The imposition of tariffs led to increased costs for businesses reliant on global supply chains and created uncertainty in the markets. However, many investors saw these moves as part of a broader strategy to level the playing field for American businesses. Add it all up, and this mix of lower taxes, lower regulatory burden, and America-first dynamics were a boon for corporate profits, which drive stocks. The market roared higher during Trump’s 1st term. Even when the pandemic hit, Trump’s combination of aggressive stimulus along with the Fed’s extraordinary actions resulted in a rapid recovery. 3 posted on 11/18/2024 8:43:49 AM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Lower regulations, simplified approvals, govt not making itself the center of all R&D and business activity and America First industrial and trade policies = Tech and US Economy increase way beyond (those taking foreign bribes to hold it back) can limit it. 4 posted on 11/18/2024 8:49:38 AM PST by Justa (Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people....)

On the other hand, the policies he plans to enact could be inflationary, and US government debt doesn’t look like it’s coming down anytime soon. This week we are having a look at what a second Trump presidency could mean for investors in the US and elsewhere. What Happened in Markets this Week?Here’s a quick summary of what’s been going on:⛏️ Gold price falls most since 2022 as investors pile into equities ( CNBC )What’s our take?This is a more typical ‘risk on’ reaction.Gold has rallied along with stocks throughout 2024, and the price was up 39% YTD before the election. That’s unusual, as gold typically outperforms during periods of uncertainty.But gold is also regarded as an inflation hedge. Now that expectations for inflation are rising again, we’ll have to see what that means for the gold price. It’s likely that investors decided to take profits on gold and put that money into more obvious short term trades. If that’s the case they have created an opportunity for gold bulls.🪙 iShares Bitcoin ETF is now bigger than its gold counterpart ( CNBC )What’s our take?This could be a sign of changing tides for cryptocurrencies.Trump’s election win has spurred on a Bitcoin rally as the cryptocurrency surged to new all-time highs. Investors were likely encouraged by expectations that the Trump administration could be crypto-friendly, given Trump himself spoke at the 2024 Bitcoin Conference.The recent surge could also be explained by investors gravitating towards Bitcoin as a hedge against the US dollar, in the event that Trump’s proposed tariffs have an inflationary effect and ultimately devalue the dollar. Interestingly, the US dollar also hit a 1-year high this week.💸 China sells USD bonds in Saudi Arabia ( FT )What’s our take?The USD remains the go-to currency for lenders and borrowers alike.An auction of $2 billion worth of government bonds by the Chinese Finance Ministry was 20 times oversubscribed. The 3 and 5-year bonds were sold with yields only slightly higher than equivalent US treasuries. That could mean investors believe the credit quality of both nations is the same - or that investors are happy with a little more diversification.China usually holds bond auctions in Hong Kong but held this one in Saudi Arabia for the first time. This could be an effort to build closer ties with investors in the country.This bond issue was tiny compared to China’s overall funding program. But the strong demand shows that appetite for USD denominated bonds is as strong as ever.💰 Buffett’s Berkshire Is Being Packaged Into a Leveraged ETF ( Bloomberg )What’s our take?The Sage of Omaha probably wouldn’t approve.When you buy a leveraged instrument, you are effectively borrowing money to increase buying power. Since Berkshire Hathaway is sitting on a huge pile of cash, you would effectively be borrowing cash to invest in… cash.On top of that, the funding rate you would effectively be paying would be a hurdle. Unless Berkshire outperforms that funding rate, returns could end up being underwhelming.🏗️ Homebuilder deal activity is surging, fueled by major Japanese buyers ( CNBC )What’s our take?Japanese efficiency could revolutionize the homebuilder market.Record-high housing demand in the U.S. has led to a rush of M&A activity among homebuilders. What’s more interesting is that almost half the deals are with Japanese companies according to Whelan Advisory, which makes sense when you consider Japan’s low-growth environment and low cost of capital.Japanese firms like Sekisui House are making inroads by acquiring major U.S. builders such as MDC Holdings, hoping to bring their advanced value engineering and efficiency techniques to the American market. It’s likely that other Japanese companies will follow suit, which could shake up the homebuilding processes and make housing more affordable through innovations like 3-D imaging and pre-cut materials.📉 US Inflation ticks up while jobless claims fall to lowest in six months ( Reuters )What’s our take?The rate cut journey won’t be all smooth sailing. Expect a few twists and turns along the way.Stubborn inflation and a reduction in first-time unemployment benefit applications are challenging the Federal Reserve's plans for aggressive rate cuts.Economists still expect a rate cut in December, but are now expecting a shallower rate-cutting cycle heading in to 2025. It’s expected that tariffs from President-elect Trump's incoming administration will add upward pressure on inflation and complicate the Fed's decision-making process.In our view, the Fed is likely to opt for fewer rate cuts in 2025 than previously projected, carefully balancing the risks of persistent inflation against the need to support economic growth.⚖️ Meta hit with €797 million EU fine for breaking antitrust rules ( Fortune )What’s our take?Big tech income statements need a new line item: ‘EU Fines’The EU's hefty €797 million fine against Meta for antitrust violations is a huge escalation in regulatory scrutiny over Big Tech's market practices.Meta's defense - that users engage with Facebook Marketplace by choice and not compulsion - seems to overlook the EU's concern about automatic access potentially stifling competition, particularly among competitors that advertise on Meta’s platforms.EU regulators are well armed in their fight against Big Tech, with major twin laws, the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act, that carry massive financial penalties in the event of infringements. Don’t expect this to be the last time a tech giant butts heads with EU regulators and has to cough up some cash.🇺🇸 The Trump 2.0 Stock MarketUS equities rallied when it became clear that Donald Trump would be returning to the White House. The market’s response was in part a relief rally after the outcome became clear early on, but some sectors certainly began to price in Trump’s pro-business stance. US Market Sector Performance 6th to 14th November - Simply Wall St As we’ve mentioned previously, elections tend to have less impact on the overall economy and stock market than leaders like to think. But, this election could be more consequential than usual for a few reasons:The result gave Donald Trump a clear mandate to govern.His campaign platform included some promises that are far more radical than prior elections.The GOP controls the White House, the Senate and the House. This will make it easier to pass legislation without votes from Democrats.This isn’t his first rodeo. Donald Trump hasn’t wasted any time nominating people for key roles, and he appears to have a plan to hit the ground running on day one.In short, the market appears to be anticipating higher growth, along with higher inflation and interest rates. The way things actually play out will depend on if, when, and how his policies are implemented.📈 Inflation and Interest RatesIn the run-up to the election, investors were aware that a Trump Presidency could lead to a rebound in inflation. The yield on 10-year treasuries rose as Trump’s poll numbers and the odds on betting platforms rose. This also occurred after the Fed cut rates by 50 basis points. US 10-year yields, US index and Trump Betting Odds - Finbold Two of Donald Trump’s biggest election promises were the mass deportation of illegal immigrants and tariffs on imports to the US. Both would probably be inflationary, depending on how or when they are implemented.💱 TariffsTrump has pledged to impose a 10% tariff on all imports, and a 60% tariff on goods from China. Tariffs would result in higher prices for US businesses and consumers. Tariffs would also incentivize local manufacturing, but it’s unlikely that prices would be competitive with low-cost manufacturing hubs, even with the tariff.Import duties result in a one-time increase in inflation, but inflation tends to ripple through the entire economy. The inflationary effect could also be offset - or amplified - by whatever happens to energy prices and the USD at the time.✨ A new round of tariffs could also result in trade partners responding with tariffs of their own. That would hurt US exporters - but could also lead to new trade deals being negotiated.🛫 Mass DeportationsIt’s estimated that there are 10 million or more undocumented immigrants in the US, many of whom are part of the labor force. Plans to deport these people at a time when the unemployment rate is historically low could result in a labor shortage. That would be good news for US workers, particularly those in low-paying jobs.However, it would also be inflationary, and could leave companies struggling to replace workers.The sectors that would be most affected include hospitality , construction , and agriculture where most undocumented immigrants work.In the case of both tariffs and deportations, the impact will depend on how far and how fast the administration implements these policies. The market will probably be quick to react, in which case implementation may be reassessed.Which companies would be shielded or benefit from these policies? Companies with little exposure to imports, and those that benefit from higher interest rates. would be best positioned. This includes smaller companies, banks and technology companies.✨ On the losing side of the equation, the valuations on growth stocks with high multiples and little to no earnings may need to adjust to higher discount rates.💰 Tax Cuts and DeficitsThe US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians. The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump’s campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let’s hope there’s still an appetite for those bonds.⚡ EnergyIt’s no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can’t be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump’s win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it’s probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It’s also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that’d actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It’s now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon’s proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. 🪙 The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it’ll probably hurt a lot of global business.✨ Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump’s election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it’s less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.💡 The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it’s worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‘time the market’ off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn’t a lot of clarity on what Trump’s second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Bon of Babble Perhaps the most contentious aspect of Trump’s economic policy was his approach to trade, particularly with China. The imposition of tariffs led to increased costs for businesses reliant on global supply chains and created uncertainty in the markets.

Don’t expect this to be the last time a tech giant butts heads with EU regulators and has to cough up some cash.🇺🇸 The Trump 2.0 Stock MarketUS equities rallied when it became clear that Donald Trump would be returning to the White House. The market’s response was in part a relief rally after the outcome became clear early on, but some sectors certainly began to price in Trump’s pro-business stance. US Market Sector Performance 6th to 14th November - Simply Wall St As we’ve mentioned previously, elections tend to have less impact on the overall economy and stock market than leaders like to think. But, this election could be more consequential than usual for a few reasons:The result gave Donald Trump a clear mandate to govern.His campaign platform included some promises that are far more radical than prior elections.The GOP controls the White House, the Senate and the House. This will make it easier to pass legislation without votes from Democrats.This isn’t his first rodeo. Donald Trump hasn’t wasted any time nominating people for key roles, and he appears to have a plan to hit the ground running on day one.In short, the market appears to be anticipating higher growth, along with higher inflation and interest rates. The way things actually play out will depend on if, when, and how his policies are implemented.📈 Inflation and Interest RatesIn the run-up to the election, investors were aware that a Trump Presidency could lead to a rebound in inflation. The yield on 10-year treasuries rose as Trump’s poll numbers and the odds on betting platforms rose. This also occurred after the Fed cut rates by 50 basis points. US 10-year yields, US index and Trump Betting Odds - Finbold Two of Donald Trump’s biggest election promises were the mass deportation of illegal immigrants and tariffs on imports to the US. Both would probably be inflationary, depending on how or when they are implemented.💱 TariffsTrump has pledged to impose a 10% tariff on all imports, and a 60% tariff on goods from China. Tariffs would result in higher prices for US businesses and consumers. Tariffs would also incentivize local manufacturing, but it’s unlikely that prices would be competitive with low-cost manufacturing hubs, even with the tariff.Import duties result in a one-time increase in inflation, but inflation tends to ripple through the entire economy. The inflationary effect could also be offset - or amplified - by whatever happens to energy prices and the USD at the time.✨ A new round of tariffs could also result in trade partners responding with tariffs of their own. That would hurt US exporters - but could also lead to new trade deals being negotiated.🛫 Mass DeportationsIt’s estimated that there are 10 million or more undocumented immigrants in the US, many of whom are part of the labor force. Plans to deport these people at a time when the unemployment rate is historically low could result in a labor shortage. That would be good news for US workers, particularly those in low-paying jobs.However, it would also be inflationary, and could leave companies struggling to replace workers.The sectors that would be most affected include hospitality , construction , and agriculture where most undocumented immigrants work.In the case of both tariffs and deportations, the impact will depend on how far and how fast the administration implements these policies. The market will probably be quick to react, in which case implementation may be reassessed.Which companies would be shielded or benefit from these policies? Companies with little exposure to imports, and those that benefit from higher interest rates. would be best positioned. This includes smaller companies, banks and technology companies.✨ On the losing side of the equation, the valuations on growth stocks with high multiples and little to no earnings may need to adjust to higher discount rates.💰 Tax Cuts and DeficitsThe US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians. The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump’s campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let’s hope there’s still an appetite for those bonds.⚡ EnergyIt’s no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can’t be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump’s win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it’s probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It’s also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that’d actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It’s now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon’s proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. 🪙 The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it’ll probably hurt a lot of global business.✨ Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump’s election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it’s less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.💡 The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it’s worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‘time the market’ off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn’t a lot of clarity on what Trump’s second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Bon of Babble Perhaps the most contentious aspect of Trump’s economic policy was his approach to trade, particularly with China. The imposition of tariffs led to increased costs for businesses reliant on global supply chains and created uncertainty in the markets. However, many investors saw these moves as part of a broader strategy to level the playing field for American businesses. Add it all up, and this mix of lower taxes, lower regulatory burden, and America-first dynamics were a boon for corporate profits, which drive stocks. The market roared higher during Trump’s 1st term. Even when the pandemic hit, Trump’s combination of aggressive stimulus along with the Fed’s extraordinary actions resulted in a rapid recovery. 3 posted on 11/18/2024 8:43:49 AM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Lower regulations, simplified approvals, govt not making itself the center of all R&D and business activity and America First industrial and trade policies = Tech and US Economy increase way beyond (those taking foreign bribes to hold it back) can limit it. 4 posted on 11/18/2024 8:49:38 AM PST by Justa (Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people....)

I have been buying back into my funds on market down days like last Friday, but still with some trepidation. I am at a 65/35 cash/equity split now, and will work towards a 50/50 split as Trump takes office in January.

We’ve had so many financial crises (2008 real estate, Asian) but we’ve weathered them. I bailed out of equities when the Internet bubble popped in 2000 (was it 2001? ‘02?) and it took me a while to get back in, so I missed the huge run-up when the market got back to normal. So, since then, it’s been steady as she goes. 9 posted on 11/18/2024 9:49:48 AM PST by ProtectOurFreedom (Republicans are the party that says ‘Government doesn’t work.’ Then they get elected and prove it.)

That’s unusual, as gold typically outperforms during periods of uncertainty.But gold is also regarded as an inflation hedge. Now that expectations for inflation are rising again, we’ll have to see what that means for the gold price. It’s likely that investors decided to take profits on gold and put that money into more obvious short term trades. If that’s the case they have created an opportunity for gold bulls.🪙 iShares Bitcoin ETF is now bigger than its gold counterpart ( CNBC )What’s our take?This could be a sign of changing tides for cryptocurrencies.Trump’s election win has spurred on a Bitcoin rally as the cryptocurrency surged to new all-time highs. Investors were likely encouraged by expectations that the Trump administration could be crypto-friendly, given Trump himself spoke at the 2024 Bitcoin Conference.The recent surge could also be explained by investors gravitating towards Bitcoin as a hedge against the US dollar, in the event that Trump’s proposed tariffs have an inflationary effect and ultimately devalue the dollar. Interestingly, the US dollar also hit a 1-year high this week.💸 China sells USD bonds in Saudi Arabia ( FT )What’s our take?The USD remains the go-to currency for lenders and borrowers alike.An auction of $2 billion worth of government bonds by the Chinese Finance Ministry was 20 times oversubscribed. The 3 and 5-year bonds were sold with yields only slightly higher than equivalent US treasuries. That could mean investors believe the credit quality of both nations is the same - or that investors are happy with a little more diversification.China usually holds bond auctions in Hong Kong but held this one in Saudi Arabia for the first time. This could be an effort to build closer ties with investors in the country.This bond issue was tiny compared to China’s overall funding program. But the strong demand shows that appetite for USD denominated bonds is as strong as ever.💰 Buffett’s Berkshire Is Being Packaged Into a Leveraged ETF ( Bloomberg )What’s our take?The Sage of Omaha probably wouldn’t approve.When you buy a leveraged instrument, you are effectively borrowing money to increase buying power. Since Berkshire Hathaway is sitting on a huge pile of cash, you would effectively be borrowing cash to invest in… cash.On top of that, the funding rate you would effectively be paying would be a hurdle. Unless Berkshire outperforms that funding rate, returns could end up being underwhelming.🏗️ Homebuilder deal activity is surging, fueled by major Japanese buyers ( CNBC )What’s our take?Japanese efficiency could revolutionize the homebuilder market.Record-high housing demand in the U.S. has led to a rush of M&A activity among homebuilders. What’s more interesting is that almost half the deals are with Japanese companies according to Whelan Advisory, which makes sense when you consider Japan’s low-growth environment and low cost of capital.Japanese firms like Sekisui House are making inroads by acquiring major U.S. builders such as MDC Holdings, hoping to bring their advanced value engineering and efficiency techniques to the American market. It’s likely that other Japanese companies will follow suit, which could shake up the homebuilding processes and make housing more affordable through innovations like 3-D imaging and pre-cut materials.📉 US Inflation ticks up while jobless claims fall to lowest in six months ( Reuters )What’s our take?The rate cut journey won’t be all smooth sailing. Expect a few twists and turns along the way.Stubborn inflation and a reduction in first-time unemployment benefit applications are challenging the Federal Reserve's plans for aggressive rate cuts.Economists still expect a rate cut in December, but are now expecting a shallower rate-cutting cycle heading in to 2025. It’s expected that tariffs from President-elect Trump's incoming administration will add upward pressure on inflation and complicate the Fed's decision-making process.In our view, the Fed is likely to opt for fewer rate cuts in 2025 than previously projected, carefully balancing the risks of persistent inflation against the need to support economic growth.⚖️ Meta hit with €797 million EU fine for breaking antitrust rules ( Fortune )What’s our take?Big tech income statements need a new line item: ‘EU Fines’The EU's hefty €797 million fine against Meta for antitrust violations is a huge escalation in regulatory scrutiny over Big Tech's market practices.Meta's defense - that users engage with Facebook Marketplace by choice and not compulsion - seems to overlook the EU's concern about automatic access potentially stifling competition, particularly among competitors that advertise on Meta’s platforms.EU regulators are well armed in their fight against Big Tech, with major twin laws, the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act, that carry massive financial penalties in the event of infringements.

Even when the pandemic hit, Trump’s combination of aggressive stimulus along with the Fed’s extraordinary actions resulted in a rapid recovery. 3 posted on 11/18/2024 8:43:49 AM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Lower regulations, simplified approvals, govt not making itself the center of all R&D and business activity and America First industrial and trade policies = Tech and US Economy increase way beyond (those taking foreign bribes to hold it back) can limit it. 4 posted on 11/18/2024 8:49:38 AM PST by Justa (Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people....)

That’s unusual, as gold typically outperforms during periods of uncertainty.But gold is also regarded as an inflation hedge. Now that expectations for inflation are rising again, we’ll have to see what that means for the gold price. It’s likely that investors decided to take profits on gold and put that money into more obvious short term trades. If that’s the case they have created an opportunity for gold bulls.🪙 iShares Bitcoin ETF is now bigger than its gold counterpart ( CNBC )What’s our take?This could be a sign of changing tides for cryptocurrencies.Trump’s election win has spurred on a Bitcoin rally as the cryptocurrency surged to new all-time highs. Investors were likely encouraged by expectations that the Trump administration could be crypto-friendly, given Trump himself spoke at the 2024 Bitcoin Conference.The recent surge could also be explained by investors gravitating towards Bitcoin as a hedge against the US dollar, in the event that Trump’s proposed tariffs have an inflationary effect and ultimately devalue the dollar. Interestingly, the US dollar also hit a 1-year high this week.💸 China sells USD bonds in Saudi Arabia ( FT )What’s our take?The USD remains the go-to currency for lenders and borrowers alike.An auction of $2 billion worth of government bonds by the Chinese Finance Ministry was 20 times oversubscribed. The 3 and 5-year bonds were sold with yields only slightly higher than equivalent US treasuries. That could mean investors believe the credit quality of both nations is the same - or that investors are happy with a little more diversification.China usually holds bond auctions in Hong Kong but held this one in Saudi Arabia for the first time. This could be an effort to build closer ties with investors in the country.This bond issue was tiny compared to China’s overall funding program. But the strong demand shows that appetite for USD denominated bonds is as strong as ever.💰 Buffett’s Berkshire Is Being Packaged Into a Leveraged ETF ( Bloomberg )What’s our take?The Sage of Omaha probably wouldn’t approve.When you buy a leveraged instrument, you are effectively borrowing money to increase buying power. Since Berkshire Hathaway is sitting on a huge pile of cash, you would effectively be borrowing cash to invest in… cash.On top of that, the funding rate you would effectively be paying would be a hurdle. Unless Berkshire outperforms that funding rate, returns could end up being underwhelming.🏗️ Homebuilder deal activity is surging, fueled by major Japanese buyers ( CNBC )What’s our take?Japanese efficiency could revolutionize the homebuilder market.Record-high housing demand in the U.S. has led to a rush of M&A activity among homebuilders. What’s more interesting is that almost half the deals are with Japanese companies according to Whelan Advisory, which makes sense when you consider Japan’s low-growth environment and low cost of capital.Japanese firms like Sekisui House are making inroads by acquiring major U.S. builders such as MDC Holdings, hoping to bring their advanced value engineering and efficiency techniques to the American market. It’s likely that other Japanese companies will follow suit, which could shake up the homebuilding processes and make housing more affordable through innovations like 3-D imaging and pre-cut materials.📉 US Inflation ticks up while jobless claims fall to lowest in six months ( Reuters )What’s our take?The rate cut journey won’t be all smooth sailing. Expect a few twists and turns along the way.Stubborn inflation and a reduction in first-time unemployment benefit applications are challenging the Federal Reserve's plans for aggressive rate cuts.Economists still expect a rate cut in December, but are now expecting a shallower rate-cutting cycle heading in to 2025. It’s expected that tariffs from President-elect Trump's incoming administration will add upward pressure on inflation and complicate the Fed's decision-making process.In our view, the Fed is likely to opt for fewer rate cuts in 2025 than previously projected, carefully balancing the risks of persistent inflation against the need to support economic growth.⚖️ Meta hit with €797 million EU fine for breaking antitrust rules ( Fortune )What’s our take?Big tech income statements need a new line item: ‘EU Fines’The EU's hefty €797 million fine against Meta for antitrust violations is a huge escalation in regulatory scrutiny over Big Tech's market practices.Meta's defense - that users engage with Facebook Marketplace by choice and not compulsion - seems to overlook the EU's concern about automatic access potentially stifling competition, particularly among competitors that advertise on Meta’s platforms.EU regulators are well armed in their fight against Big Tech, with major twin laws, the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act, that carry massive financial penalties in the event of infringements. Don’t expect this to be the last time a tech giant butts heads with EU regulators and has to cough up some cash.🇺🇸 The Trump 2.0 Stock MarketUS equities rallied when it became clear that Donald Trump would be returning to the White House. The market’s response was in part a relief rally after the outcome became clear early on, but some sectors certainly began to price in Trump’s pro-business stance. US Market Sector Performance 6th to 14th November - Simply Wall St As we’ve mentioned previously, elections tend to have less impact on the overall economy and stock market than leaders like to think. But, this election could be more consequential than usual for a few reasons:The result gave Donald Trump a clear mandate to govern.His campaign platform included some promises that are far more radical than prior elections.The GOP controls the White House, the Senate and the House. This will make it easier to pass legislation without votes from Democrats.This isn’t his first rodeo. Donald Trump hasn’t wasted any time nominating people for key roles, and he appears to have a plan to hit the ground running on day one.In short, the market appears to be anticipating higher growth, along with higher inflation and interest rates. The way things actually play out will depend on if, when, and how his policies are implemented.📈 Inflation and Interest RatesIn the run-up to the election, investors were aware that a Trump Presidency could lead to a rebound in inflation. The yield on 10-year treasuries rose as Trump’s poll numbers and the odds on betting platforms rose. This also occurred after the Fed cut rates by 50 basis points. US 10-year yields, US index and Trump Betting Odds - Finbold Two of Donald Trump’s biggest election promises were the mass deportation of illegal immigrants and tariffs on imports to the US. Both would probably be inflationary, depending on how or when they are implemented.💱 TariffsTrump has pledged to impose a 10% tariff on all imports, and a 60% tariff on goods from China. Tariffs would result in higher prices for US businesses and consumers. Tariffs would also incentivize local manufacturing, but it’s unlikely that prices would be competitive with low-cost manufacturing hubs, even with the tariff.Import duties result in a one-time increase in inflation, but inflation tends to ripple through the entire economy. The inflationary effect could also be offset - or amplified - by whatever happens to energy prices and the USD at the time.✨ A new round of tariffs could also result in trade partners responding with tariffs of their own. That would hurt US exporters - but could also lead to new trade deals being negotiated.🛫 Mass DeportationsIt’s estimated that there are 10 million or more undocumented immigrants in the US, many of whom are part of the labor force. Plans to deport these people at a time when the unemployment rate is historically low could result in a labor shortage. That would be good news for US workers, particularly those in low-paying jobs.However, it would also be inflationary, and could leave companies struggling to replace workers.The sectors that would be most affected include hospitality , construction , and agriculture where most undocumented immigrants work.In the case of both tariffs and deportations, the impact will depend on how far and how fast the administration implements these policies. The market will probably be quick to react, in which case implementation may be reassessed.Which companies would be shielded or benefit from these policies? Companies with little exposure to imports, and those that benefit from higher interest rates. would be best positioned. This includes smaller companies, banks and technology companies.✨ On the losing side of the equation, the valuations on growth stocks with high multiples and little to no earnings may need to adjust to higher discount rates.💰 Tax Cuts and DeficitsThe US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians. The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump’s campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let’s hope there’s still an appetite for those bonds.⚡ EnergyIt’s no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can’t be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump’s win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it’s probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It’s also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that’d actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It’s now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon’s proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. 🪙 The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it’ll probably hurt a lot of global business.✨ Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump’s election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it’s less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.💡 The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it’s worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‘time the market’ off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn’t a lot of clarity on what Trump’s second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

Don’t expect this to be the last time a tech giant butts heads with EU regulators and has to cough up some cash. US equities rallied when it became clear that Donald Trump would be returning to the White House. The market’s response was in part a relief rally after the outcome became clear early on, but some sectors certainly began to price in Trump’s pro-business stance. US Market Sector Performance 6th to 14th November - Simply Wall St As we’ve mentioned previously, elections tend to have less impact on the overall economy and stock market than leaders like to think. But, this election could be more consequential than usual for a few reasons:The result gave Donald Trump a clear mandate to govern.His campaign platform included some promises that are far more radical than prior elections.The GOP controls the White House, the Senate and the House. This will make it easier to pass legislation without votes from Democrats.This isn’t his first rodeo. Donald Trump hasn’t wasted any time nominating people for key roles, and he appears to have a plan to hit the ground running on day one.In short, the market appears to be anticipating higher growth, along with higher inflation and interest rates. The way things actually play out will depend on if, when, and how his policies are implemented.📈 Inflation and Interest RatesIn the run-up to the election, investors were aware that a Trump Presidency could lead to a rebound in inflation. The yield on 10-year treasuries rose as Trump’s poll numbers and the odds on betting platforms rose. This also occurred after the Fed cut rates by 50 basis points. US 10-year yields, US index and Trump Betting Odds - Finbold Two of Donald Trump’s biggest election promises were the mass deportation of illegal immigrants and tariffs on imports to the US. Both would probably be inflationary, depending on how or when they are implemented.💱 TariffsTrump has pledged to impose a 10% tariff on all imports, and a 60% tariff on goods from China. Tariffs would result in higher prices for US businesses and consumers. Tariffs would also incentivize local manufacturing, but it’s unlikely that prices would be competitive with low-cost manufacturing hubs, even with the tariff.Import duties result in a one-time increase in inflation, but inflation tends to ripple through the entire economy. The inflationary effect could also be offset - or amplified - by whatever happens to energy prices and the USD at the time.✨ A new round of tariffs could also result in trade partners responding with tariffs of their own. That would hurt US exporters - but could also lead to new trade deals being negotiated.🛫 Mass DeportationsIt’s estimated that there are 10 million or more undocumented immigrants in the US, many of whom are part of the labor force. Plans to deport these people at a time when the unemployment rate is historically low could result in a labor shortage. That would be good news for US workers, particularly those in low-paying jobs.However, it would also be inflationary, and could leave companies struggling to replace workers.The sectors that would be most affected include hospitality , construction , and agriculture where most undocumented immigrants work.In the case of both tariffs and deportations, the impact will depend on how far and how fast the administration implements these policies. The market will probably be quick to react, in which case implementation may be reassessed.Which companies would be shielded or benefit from these policies? Companies with little exposure to imports, and those that benefit from higher interest rates. would be best positioned. This includes smaller companies, banks and technology companies.✨ On the losing side of the equation, the valuations on growth stocks with high multiples and little to no earnings may need to adjust to higher discount rates.💰 Tax Cuts and DeficitsThe US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians. The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump’s campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let’s hope there’s still an appetite for those bonds.⚡ EnergyIt’s no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can’t be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump’s win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it’s probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It’s also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that’d actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It’s now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon’s proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. 🪙 The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it’ll probably hurt a lot of global business.✨ Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump’s election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it’s less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.💡 The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it’s worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‘time the market’ off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn’t a lot of clarity on what Trump’s second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Bon of Babble Perhaps the most contentious aspect of Trump’s economic policy was his approach to trade, particularly with China. The imposition of tariffs led to increased costs for businesses reliant on global supply chains and created uncertainty in the markets. However, many investors saw these moves as part of a broader strategy to level the playing field for American businesses. Add it all up, and this mix of lower taxes, lower regulatory burden, and America-first dynamics were a boon for corporate profits, which drive stocks. The market roared higher during Trump’s 1st term. Even when the pandemic hit, Trump’s combination of aggressive stimulus along with the Fed’s extraordinary actions resulted in a rapid recovery. 3 posted on 11/18/2024 8:43:49 AM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Lower regulations, simplified approvals, govt not making itself the center of all R&D and business activity and America First industrial and trade policies = Tech and US Economy increase way beyond (those taking foreign bribes to hold it back) can limit it. 4 posted on 11/18/2024 8:49:38 AM PST by Justa (Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people....)

We’ve had so many financial crises (2008 real estate, Asian) but we’ve weathered them. I bailed out of equities when the Internet bubble popped in 2000 (was it 2001? ‘02?) and it took me a while to get back in, so I missed the huge run-up when the market got back to normal. So, since then, it’s been steady as she goes. 9 posted on 11/18/2024 9:49:48 AM PST by ProtectOurFreedom (Republicans are the party that says ‘Government doesn’t work.’ Then they get elected and prove it.)

Plans to deport these people at a time when the unemployment rate is historically low could result in a labor shortage. That would be good news for US workers, particularly those in low-paying jobs.However, it would also be inflationary, and could leave companies struggling to replace workers.The sectors that would be most affected include hospitality , construction , and agriculture where most undocumented immigrants work.In the case of both tariffs and deportations, the impact will depend on how far and how fast the administration implements these policies. The market will probably be quick to react, in which case implementation may be reassessed.Which companies would be shielded or benefit from these policies? Companies with little exposure to imports, and those that benefit from higher interest rates. would be best positioned. This includes smaller companies, banks and technology companies.✨ On the losing side of the equation, the valuations on growth stocks with high multiples and little to no earnings may need to adjust to higher discount rates.💰 Tax Cuts and DeficitsThe US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians. The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump’s campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let’s hope there’s still an appetite for those bonds.⚡ EnergyIt’s no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can’t be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump’s win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it’s probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It’s also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that’d actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It’s now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon’s proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. 🪙 The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it’ll probably hurt a lot of global business.✨ Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump’s election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it’s less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.💡 The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it’s worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‘time the market’ off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn’t a lot of clarity on what Trump’s second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

However, many investors saw these moves as part of a broader strategy to level the playing field for American businesses. Add it all up, and this mix of lower taxes, lower regulatory burden, and America-first dynamics were a boon for corporate profits, which drive stocks.

But, this election could be more consequential than usual for a few reasons:The result gave Donald Trump a clear mandate to govern.His campaign platform included some promises that are far more radical than prior elections.The GOP controls the White House, the Senate and the House. This will make it easier to pass legislation without votes from Democrats.This isn’t his first rodeo. Donald Trump hasn’t wasted any time nominating people for key roles, and he appears to have a plan to hit the ground running on day one.In short, the market appears to be anticipating higher growth, along with higher inflation and interest rates. The way things actually play out will depend on if, when, and how his policies are implemented.📈 Inflation and Interest RatesIn the run-up to the election, investors were aware that a Trump Presidency could lead to a rebound in inflation. The yield on 10-year treasuries rose as Trump’s poll numbers and the odds on betting platforms rose. This also occurred after the Fed cut rates by 50 basis points. US 10-year yields, US index and Trump Betting Odds - Finbold Two of Donald Trump’s biggest election promises were the mass deportation of illegal immigrants and tariffs on imports to the US. Both would probably be inflationary, depending on how or when they are implemented.💱 TariffsTrump has pledged to impose a 10% tariff on all imports, and a 60% tariff on goods from China. Tariffs would result in higher prices for US businesses and consumers. Tariffs would also incentivize local manufacturing, but it’s unlikely that prices would be competitive with low-cost manufacturing hubs, even with the tariff.Import duties result in a one-time increase in inflation, but inflation tends to ripple through the entire economy.

This includes smaller companies, banks and technology companies.✨ On the losing side of the equation, the valuations on growth stocks with high multiples and little to no earnings may need to adjust to higher discount rates.💰 Tax Cuts and DeficitsThe US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians. The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump’s campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let’s hope there’s still an appetite for those bonds.⚡ EnergyIt’s no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can’t be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump’s win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it’s probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It’s also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that’d actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It’s now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon’s proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. 🪙 The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it’ll probably hurt a lot of global business.✨ Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump’s election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it’s less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.💡 The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it’s worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‘time the market’ off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn’t a lot of clarity on what Trump’s second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

The imposition of tariffs led to increased costs for businesses reliant on global supply chains and created uncertainty in the markets. However, many investors saw these moves as part of a broader strategy to level the playing field for American businesses. Add it all up, and this mix of lower taxes, lower regulatory burden, and America-first dynamics were a boon for corporate profits, which drive stocks. The market roared higher during Trump’s 1st term.

US 10-year yields, US index and Trump Betting Odds - Finbold Two of Donald Trump’s biggest election promises were the mass deportation of illegal immigrants and tariffs on imports to the US.

Both would probably be inflationary, depending on how or when they are implemented.💱 TariffsTrump has pledged to impose a 10% tariff on all imports, and a 60% tariff on goods from China. Tariffs would result in higher prices for US businesses and consumers. Tariffs would also incentivize local manufacturing, but it’s unlikely that prices would be competitive with low-cost manufacturing hubs, even with the tariff.Import duties result in a one-time increase in inflation, but inflation tends to ripple through the entire economy. The inflationary effect could also be offset - or amplified - by whatever happens to energy prices and the USD at the time.✨ A new round of tariffs could also result in trade partners responding with tariffs of their own. That would hurt US exporters - but could also lead to new trade deals being negotiated.🛫 Mass DeportationsIt’s estimated that there are 10 million or more undocumented immigrants in the US, many of whom are part of the labor force. Plans to deport these people at a time when the unemployment rate is historically low could result in a labor shortage. That would be good news for US workers, particularly those in low-paying jobs.However, it would also be inflationary, and could leave companies struggling to replace workers.The sectors that would be most affected include hospitality , construction , and agriculture where most undocumented immigrants work.In the case of both tariffs and deportations, the impact will depend on how far and how fast the administration implements these policies. The market will probably be quick to react, in which case implementation may be reassessed.Which companies would be shielded or benefit from these policies? Companies with little exposure to imports, and those that benefit from higher interest rates. would be best positioned. This includes smaller companies, banks and technology companies.✨ On the losing side of the equation, the valuations on growth stocks with high multiples and little to no earnings may need to adjust to higher discount rates.💰 Tax Cuts and DeficitsThe US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians. The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump’s campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Trump has pledged to impose a 10% tariff on all imports, and a 60% tariff on goods from China. Tariffs would result in higher prices for US businesses and consumers. Tariffs would also incentivize local manufacturing, but it’s unlikely that prices would be competitive with low-cost manufacturing hubs, even with the tariff.Import duties result in a one-time increase in inflation, but inflation tends to ripple through the entire economy. The inflationary effect could also be offset - or amplified - by whatever happens to energy prices and the USD at the time.✨ A new round of tariffs could also result in trade partners responding with tariffs of their own. That would hurt US exporters - but could also lead to new trade deals being negotiated.🛫 Mass DeportationsIt’s estimated that there are 10 million or more undocumented immigrants in the US, many of whom are part of the labor force. Plans to deport these people at a time when the unemployment rate is historically low could result in a labor shortage. That would be good news for US workers, particularly those in low-paying jobs.However, it would also be inflationary, and could leave companies struggling to replace workers.The sectors that would be most affected include hospitality , construction , and agriculture where most undocumented immigrants work.In the case of both tariffs and deportations, the impact will depend on how far and how fast the administration implements these policies. The market will probably be quick to react, in which case implementation may be reassessed.Which companies would be shielded or benefit from these policies? Companies with little exposure to imports, and those that benefit from higher interest rates. would be best positioned. This includes smaller companies, banks and technology companies.✨ On the losing side of the equation, the valuations on growth stocks with high multiples and little to no earnings may need to adjust to higher discount rates.💰 Tax Cuts and DeficitsThe US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians. The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump’s campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let’s hope there’s still an appetite for those bonds.⚡ EnergyIt’s no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can’t be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump’s win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it’s probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It’s also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that’d actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It’s now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon’s proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. 🪙 The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome.

Add it all up, and this mix of lower taxes, lower regulatory burden, and America-first dynamics were a boon for corporate profits, which drive stocks. The market roared higher during Trump’s 1st term. Even when the pandemic hit, Trump’s combination of aggressive stimulus along with the Fed’s extraordinary actions resulted in a rapid recovery. 3 posted on 11/18/2024 8:43:49 AM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Lower regulations, simplified approvals, govt not making itself the center of all R&D and business activity and America First industrial and trade policies = Tech and US Economy increase way beyond (those taking foreign bribes to hold it back) can limit it. 4 posted on 11/18/2024 8:49:38 AM PST by Justa (Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people....)

That would hurt US exporters - but could also lead to new trade deals being negotiated.🛫 Mass DeportationsIt’s estimated that there are 10 million or more undocumented immigrants in the US, many of whom are part of the labor force. Plans to deport these people at a time when the unemployment rate is historically low could result in a labor shortage. That would be good news for US workers, particularly those in low-paying jobs.However, it would also be inflationary, and could leave companies struggling to replace workers.The sectors that would be most affected include hospitality , construction , and agriculture where most undocumented immigrants work.In the case of both tariffs and deportations, the impact will depend on how far and how fast the administration implements these policies. The market will probably be quick to react, in which case implementation may be reassessed.Which companies would be shielded or benefit from these policies? Companies with little exposure to imports, and those that benefit from higher interest rates. would be best positioned. This includes smaller companies, banks and technology companies.✨ On the losing side of the equation, the valuations on growth stocks with high multiples and little to no earnings may need to adjust to higher discount rates.💰 Tax Cuts and DeficitsThe US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians. The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump’s campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let’s hope there’s still an appetite for those bonds.⚡ EnergyIt’s no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can’t be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump’s win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it’s probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It’s also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that’d actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It’s now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon’s proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. 🪙 The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it’ll probably hurt a lot of global business.✨ Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump’s election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it’s less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.💡 The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it’s worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‘time the market’ off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn’t a lot of clarity on what Trump’s second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

Plans to deport these people at a time when the unemployment rate is historically low could result in a labor shortage. That would be good news for US workers, particularly those in low-paying jobs.However, it would also be inflationary, and could leave companies struggling to replace workers.The sectors that would be most affected include hospitality , construction , and agriculture where most undocumented immigrants work.In the case of both tariffs and deportations, the impact will depend on how far and how fast the administration implements these policies. The market will probably be quick to react, in which case implementation may be reassessed.Which companies would be shielded or benefit from these policies? Companies with little exposure to imports, and those that benefit from higher interest rates. would be best positioned. This includes smaller companies, banks and technology companies.✨ On the losing side of the equation, the valuations on growth stocks with high multiples and little to no earnings may need to adjust to higher discount rates.💰 Tax Cuts and DeficitsThe US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians. The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump’s campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let’s hope there’s still an appetite for those bonds.⚡ EnergyIt’s no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can’t be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump’s win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it’s probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It’s also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that’d actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It’s now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon’s proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. 🪙 The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it’ll probably hurt a lot of global business.✨ Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump’s election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it’s less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.💡 The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it’s worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‘time the market’ off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn’t a lot of clarity on what Trump’s second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Bon of Babble Perhaps the most contentious aspect of Trump’s economic policy was his approach to trade, particularly with China. The imposition of tariffs led to increased costs for businesses reliant on global supply chains and created uncertainty in the markets. However, many investors saw these moves as part of a broader strategy to level the playing field for American businesses. Add it all up, and this mix of lower taxes, lower regulatory burden, and America-first dynamics were a boon for corporate profits, which drive stocks. The market roared higher during Trump’s 1st term. Even when the pandemic hit, Trump’s combination of aggressive stimulus along with the Fed’s extraordinary actions resulted in a rapid recovery. 3 posted on 11/18/2024 8:43:49 AM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Lower regulations, simplified approvals, govt not making itself the center of all R&D and business activity and America First industrial and trade policies = Tech and US Economy increase way beyond (those taking foreign bribes to hold it back) can limit it. 4 posted on 11/18/2024 8:49:38 AM PST by Justa (Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people....)

US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let’s hope there’s still an appetite for those bonds.⚡ EnergyIt’s no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can’t be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump’s win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it’s probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It’s also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that’d actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It’s now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon’s proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. 🪙 The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it’ll probably hurt a lot of global business.✨ Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump’s election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it’s less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.💡 The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it’s worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‘time the market’ off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn’t a lot of clarity on what Trump’s second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Bon of Babble Perhaps the most contentious aspect of Trump’s economic policy was his approach to trade, particularly with China. The imposition of tariffs led to increased costs for businesses reliant on global supply chains and created uncertainty in the markets. However, many investors saw these moves as part of a broader strategy to level the playing field for American businesses. Add it all up, and this mix of lower taxes, lower regulatory burden, and America-first dynamics were a boon for corporate profits, which drive stocks. The market roared higher during Trump’s 1st term. Even when the pandemic hit, Trump’s combination of aggressive stimulus along with the Fed’s extraordinary actions resulted in a rapid recovery. 3 posted on 11/18/2024 8:43:49 AM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Lower regulations, simplified approvals, govt not making itself the center of all R&D and business activity and America First industrial and trade policies = Tech and US Economy increase way beyond (those taking foreign bribes to hold it back) can limit it. 4 posted on 11/18/2024 8:49:38 AM PST by Justa (Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people....)

The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

The imposition of tariffs led to increased costs for businesses reliant on global supply chains and created uncertainty in the markets. However, many investors saw these moves as part of a broader strategy to level the playing field for American businesses. Add it all up, and this mix of lower taxes, lower regulatory burden, and America-first dynamics were a boon for corporate profits, which drive stocks.

The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump’s campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let’s hope there’s still an appetite for those bonds.⚡ EnergyIt’s no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can’t be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump’s win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it’s probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It’s also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that’d actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It’s now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon’s proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. 🪙 The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it’ll probably hurt a lot of global business.✨ Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump’s election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it’s less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.💡 The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it’s worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‘time the market’ off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn’t a lot of clarity on what Trump’s second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let’s hope there’s still an appetite for those bonds.⚡ EnergyIt’s no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can’t be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump’s win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it’s probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It’s also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that’d actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It’s now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon’s proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. 🪙 The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia.

OPEC members can’t be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump’s win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it’s probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It’s also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that’d actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It’s now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon’s proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators.

He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia.

Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that’d actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It’s now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety.

He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption.

Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. 🪙 The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia.

Title: Jarden Wealth Weekly: Dissecting the Trump trades

US President-elect Donald Trump. Photo / Getty Images Felix Fok is a chartered financial analyst at Jarden. OPINION Markets, by nature, are forward-looking, though they can occasionally get ahead of themselves. Following the recent United States election, stocks, bonds and currencies (crypto or otherwise) have moved in anticipation of what a second Donald Trump term could bring. Certain investments have been dubbed “Trump trades” due to their anticipated gains. However, the question remains: Do all these assets truly merit their upward momentum? The most direct link to Trump himself is Trump Media and Technology Group (DJT), a US$6.6 billion ($11.2b) enterprise majority-owned by Trump. This company, operating the social media platform Truth Social, forms a significant part of his wealth. While the digital advertising landscape remains favourable where companies like Meta, Alphabet, Bytedance, and X (formerly Twitter) have effectively leveraged — DJT’s fundamentals are weak. Last quarter, DJT reported just US$1 million in revenue and a net loss of US$19m. Additionally, they saw a 20% increase in shares, diluting existing shareholder value. Nonetheless, DJT’s market value has surged 70% this year, likely fuelled by speculation of a possible partnership with the Elon Musk-controlled X. Notably, DJT shares declined after the election win, underscoring the mixed market sentiment towards this stock. Tesla and Musk’s political leverage: Musk’s public alignment with the Republican campaign has proven beneficial. Tesla shares have rallied significantly post-election, benefitting from political factors and a rebound in profit margins in the last quarter. Musk’s new role as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (the “Doge”) grants him influence, though it’s unclear how this position will directly benefit electric vehicle (EV) sales. Musk’s political proximity could translate into ongoing incentives for EV adoption, government contracts, or lenient regulations for autonomous vehicle trials. However, the Biden-era US$7500 per car EV tax credit looks set to end based on early indications from Trump’s transition team. This would be a negative for Tesla in the near term until weaker EV competitors exit the market. Given that half of Tesla’s revenue is generated outside the US with 23% coming from China, the Shanghai manufacturing base may provide some protection against US-China tensions. Yet, broad-based trade tariffs could slow Tesla’s global growth and reduce demand for premium consumer products. Ultimately, while having the President-elect’s ear is valuable, the potential benefits may be more significant for Musk’s other (unlisted) ventures, particularly SpaceX, and with this, there could be a shift in Musk’s attention within his businesses going forward. Cryptocurrency rally and the appeal of Bitcoin: Trump’s vow to establish the US as the “crypto capital of the planet” has fuelled optimism within the cryptocurrency market, with many expecting the appointment of a pro-crypto regulator at the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Despite ongoing debates over crypto’s utility and associated risks, bitcoin’s performance can be distilled to supply and demand dynamics. Unlike DJT shares, bitcoin supply is limited by its programming, and the available supply is likely much less than stated due to early misplacing of passwords and dormant accounts. As the first cryptocurrency, bitcoin has withstood major downturns and forks (the spawning of copycat coins) over the past 15 years, and it now stands at an all-time high. Demand tends to follow price momentum, with more investors buying in as prices rise. In high-inflation environments, such as in some developing countries, there is demand for bitcoin as a digital “store of value” alternative to government-issued currencies. Although remote, a US strategic bitcoin reserve remains a blue-sky scenario, making bitcoin a highly asymmetric yet risky proposition. Domestic resilience: In the broader context, the US economy has shown resilience. Employment remains strong, with the unemployment rate in the low 4% range, and property prices have risen moderately. Domestic banks and financial services companies may gain from tax cuts, deregulation, and other policies aimed at economic growth while remaining somewhat insulated from trade tariffs and policies affecting undocumented workers. Increased government spending and domestic investment could keep interest rates higher than anticipated, supporting banks’ interest income. Additional domestic sectors, such as private prisons and transportation, may also benefit, as will the US dollar. However, certain companies may face headwinds from potential labour shortages or declining commodity prices if global growth stalls amid rising supply. Large US multinationals, particularly those with significant US cost bases, may see a mixed impact through higher US dollar and weaker global markets. Risk vs opportunity: Given the uncertainty around timing and impact, investors likely have not fully repositioned portfolios for this new landscape, leaving further upside in some Trump trades if policies and execution materialise. Ultimately, not all Trump trades are created equal: some are grounded in stronger fundamentals, while others may be fuelled by sentiment alone. Investors must weigh how much of the anticipated benefit is already priced in. In the months ahead, attention will naturally shift to cabinet and committee nominations, policy details, and a clearer assessment of value. Buyer beware.

Title: The 2 biggest stock market risks in 2025, according to Goldman Sachs

Time Published: 2024-11-18T16:00:00Z

As 2024 comes to a close, the U.S. stock market has posted considerable returns on a red-hot rally led by major technology stocks that have benefited from artificial intelligence. But Goldman Sachs (GS+2.42%) is warning of two major risks that could put a damper on the stock market party in 2025. The first big risk is the recent wave of optimism — fueled by Donald Trump’s election win, lower interest rates, and overall enthusiasm about the economy — could front-load returns and leave the market vulnerable to a correction, strategists led by Peter Oppenheimer said in a research note published Monday. Given that global equities have risen 40% since October 2023, there is much more room for disappointment and less opportunity for valuations to rise, the strategists said. There is also uncertainty around the impact of the incoming Trump administration’s policies. “There are still many unknowns around tariff risks, for example, and the impact on global growth and inflation,” they wrote. The president-elect has proposed implementing sweeping tariffs, including levying a broad 10% to 20% tariff on imports from all nations, alongside a much steeper 60% to 100% tariff specifically targeting goods from China. This could push up prices on a number of key products in the U.S. Major stock indexes, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq, all hit record highs in the days following Trump’s election win. The second risk is linked to what Goldman refers to as the “unusual degree of market concentration.” The biggest 10 U.S. stocks account for over 20% of the entire value of the global market index, according to the researchers. These companies include mega cap tech stocks like Apple (AAPL-0.19%), Microsoft (MSFT-0.42%), Amazon (AMZN-2.26%), Nvidia (NVDA+0.59%), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL-4.71%), and Meta (META-0.42%). They account for 36% of the S&P 500 index and are driving much of the returns. So far this year, these leading firms have returned almost 37%, compared with 31% for the index as a whole. This level of market concentration is associated with a number of threats to the market, particularly as the mega cap tech stocks shift from being relatively capital-light to capital-intensive, Goldman said. “The prospective return on this capital invested is likely to fade,” the researchers said. “Historically, it has been difficult for any firm to maintain high sales growth and profit margins over sustained periods of time.” Despite doubts about whether these companies will be able to sustain their current levels over the coming years, Goldman does not believe the companies to be in a valuation bubble. In an earlier note, however, Goldman warned that the era of double-digit gains in the stock market may be coming to an end. The strategists estimate that the S&P 500 will deliver an annualized return of 3% over the next decade — well below the 13% returns of the last 10 years and the long-term average of 11%. While the investment bank attributed much of that downward revision to a higher starting point going into the next decade, strategists said a large portion of the uncertainty is again due to an “extremely high level of market concentration.” Goldman said its forecast would be roughly 4 percentage points higher (7% instead of 3%) if the market were not so concentrated, with a baseline range of 3% to 11% growth instead of a possible -1% to 7% over the next decade.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Barclays analysts gave a review of the chip industry and talked about Nvidia's (NVDA, Financials) Blackwell ramp, Apple's (AAPL, Financials) plans to cut iPhone production, and wider market trends, after undertaking a trip to Asia. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NVDA. According to analyst Tom O'Malley, now roughly 50% of Nvidia's Blackwell ramp is used, and over the next few quarters it is expected to rise to 80%. With this degree of use, Nvidia's income in the January quarter may be about $6 billion. By April, the company's manufacturing capability is planned to double to 40,000 wafers monthly. By contrast, during the third quarter its Hopper products reached 600,000 units monthly manufacturing volume. Although Blackwell-Ultra solutions are not yet included into the supply chain, O'Malley pointed out that they should increase with the launch of single-die solutions early next year. While manufacture of the TPU v5 chips is likely to stall between January and April, resulting in a brief drop in numbers before a major rise in July, Google's (GOOG, Financials) TPU v6 chips are scheduled to join the supply chain by late Q2 2025. Manufacturers of application-specific integrated circuits are aiming for the 3-nanometer node in 2026 in advanced chip fabrication. O'Malley said, nevertheless, that businesses like Broadcom (AVGO, Financials) and Marvell (MRVL, Financials) are not expected to lose market share. While AMD's (AMD, Financials) AI accelerator productsthe MI300 and 325saw a rise in orders in the fourth quarter but are likely to show a sequential drop in the first quarter of 2025. Early data for AMD's Xilinx subsidiary shows double-digit year-over-year growth, but momentum may slow early next year. Premium flagship Android smartphones are doing very well in the smartphone market, which helps Qualcomm (QCOM, Financials). Although Qualcomm is also gaining from aggressive pricing in the low-end market, the company's Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 chip has proven success in fetching premium price. O'Malley also said that as Samsung Electronics (SSNLF, Financials) struggles with its own 3-nanometer ramp, Qualcomm is probably securing 100% of the Samsung Galaxy S25 CPU supply. Mid-tier smartphone weakness is predicted to affect vendors like Skyworks Solutions (SWKS, Financials) and Qorvo (QRVO, Financials). O'Malley noted conflicting indications about Apple iPhone manufacturing, with recent figures indicating a possible 10% to 15% drop in unit output for the March quarter. Featuring an Apple modem, the iPhone SE is scheduled for a late Q1 release and volumes are estimated to reach 25 million devices. O'Malley said in the memory industry that although NAND demand is still sluggish, demand for DRAM is promising; mid-to-high teens increase projected in 2025. While demand for high-bandwidth memory is surpassing previous estimates, supply limitations might help to stabilize costs. O'Malley predicts that capital expenditures for 2025 will stay flat; Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM, Financials) is focusing on moving manufacturing nodes from N5 to N3. Samsung's capacity to scale is being limited by its difficulties with 3-nanometer yields as well. With less development than expected by market forecasts, Barclays anticipates wafer fab equipment investment to reflect these constraints. Based on Barclays' research, the semiconductor sector shows mixed development possibilities with variances across businesses and sectors. This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Chair Powell’s Fed likely sees inflation as a real risk - no, a massive threat due to the possibility of persistent, sticky inflation - like the one that resulted in an almost 50% drop in S&P 500 from 1972 to 1974 (see Market Crashes Compared). Giants like Nvidia can drop even more. How much would that hurt? Well, the combined market cap of S&P 500 constituents is roughly $45 trillion. So a 50% decline in the index would mean a loss of more than $20 trillion in value. And you thought the $2 trillion-plus wipeout the benchmark index witnessed in the first three days of August was bad. To make matters worse, persistent inflation combined with high interest rates hurt smaller companies the most - magnifying the impact on the Russell 2000 small cap index. (Do you know how the Trefis HQ strategy, which has outperformed S&P, works with downside protection?) There are three ingredients: tariffs, deportations, and low taxes. In combination, this is a combustible mixture that would make it difficult for the Fed to fight an inflation spike in coming months, and running into 2025 as the Trump presidency kicks off. Of course, Trump might not implement policies around tariffs, deportations, and lower taxes that he promised. Or, let’s hope they’re not as severe as he’s promised on the campaign trail. But if he does, inflation will potentially head north in a hurry. The rules are simple. Higher tariffs would take cheaper goods out of the market. Prices would rise. Mass deportations of immigrants in the country illegally sounds reasonable - after all, they’re illegal immigrants - except it’ll make cheaper labor unavailable. On average, the price of services will go up. Now while tariffs and deportations constrain supply of goods and services to increase prices - reduction in taxes makes more cash available. So people can spend more while prices are higher. High consumer willingness to pay will lead to higher prices - fueling yet higher expectations for prices. The result would be spiking inflation. The Fed will likely pull out its 2022 playbook that it never got a chance to really put away: it’ll have no choice but to increase interest rates - not just reverting some of the recent cuts, but in fact, going beyond, to rates above 6% and even 7% or higher for short-term treasuries. Now if you can get a guaranteed 6% on a 1-year Treasury bill, or bank savings, a risk-free investment - won’t you demand a higher earnings and return from stocks as well? Of course. There will be an exodus - a massive outflow from the S&P and overall markets from risky equities into treasuries, CDs, and savings accounts. It happened in 2022 - within months, the S&P 500 tumbled by 20%. It’s easy to forget that Nvidia had lost more than 50% in 2022 alone (Can Nvidia Stock Lose 50%?), and trillions had been wiped from the market cap of Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta with each tech giant seeing a drop of 40% or more. Smaller firms, with less cash on their balance sheets did even worse. The difference is, in 2022 inflation was brought under control. Covid-related stimulus money was a transient cause of 2022 inflation. This time tariffs, tax cuts, and deportations, together are likely to prove a stronger force - a more persistent force. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon recently raised a big red flag about the now $1 trillion in annual interest payments the U.S. owes on its debt. This is unprecedented. It is uncharted territory. And a higher interest rate on Treasury securities only means even higher interest payments. The last thing investor sentiments can take during weak market conditions is a possibility of the U.S. defaulting on its debt. Things could unravel very quickly under such a situation. Market crashes typically happen because someone can’t pay back their loans. For one, commercial real estate has been suffering for a while. Covid-19’s work-from-home gift was a big curse for the retail and office real-estate sector. In addition to an altered demand landscape, commercial real estate loans maturing near-term continue to face high rates and tough refinancing conditions. Things could break - especially if the Fed is forced to hike interest rates. And then, there are consumer defaults - personal loans, auto loans, and credit card loans in particular. That makes banks like JPMorgan, Citigroup, and BofA with large credit card books vulnerable (How low can JPM stock go in a market crash?). This isn’t going to end well. When things are bad, what do you expect Trump to do? Blame everyone else, or change his course on taxes, deportation, and tariffs? There’s certainly hope that his cabinet and loyalists will be able to sway his view into easing inflationary policies in the event they create spiking inflation before the U.S. economy plunges into a recession. But if the easing does not materialize or comes into play too late, how bad can things get if there is another recession?

Title: Nvidia is having problems with its hot new AI chip as earning loom

Time Published: 2024-11-18T15:17:00Z

After facing delays for its new Blackwell artificial intelligence chips, Nvidia (NVDA+0.59%) reportedly has a new problem — one that has its customers worried. The Information, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, reports that Nvidia has repeatedly asked its suppliers to change the design of its custom-designed server racks in recent months because its Blackwell AI chips are overheating when connected. Nvidia’s customers are reportedly worried about a delay for the server racks, which combine 72 of the AI chips in hope that larger AI models can be trained faster with more chips. The redesigns are being made later than usual in the production process, The Information reports, but Nvidia could still ship the server racks on schedule, which it set at the end of the first half of next year. On Sunday, Dell (DELL+3.78%) chief executive Michael Dell posted on X that Nvidia’s GB200 NVL72 server racks are shipping, and that Dell had delivered server racks to CoreWeave. “NVIDIA GB200 systems are the most advanced computers ever created. Integrating them into a diverse range of data center environments requires co-engineering with our customers,” an Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement. “While our customers race to be first to market, NVIDIA is working with leading CSPs as an integral part of our engineering team and process. The engineering iterations are normal and expected.” Nvidia’s production and shipping delays for Blackwell were also caused by a design flaw, Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said in October, after media reports surfaced in August. The Blackwell computer involved seven new chip designs that needed to be developed and put into production simultaneously, Huang said. The chipmaker had to work with its partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM+1.62%), to resolve the engineering setback. “It was functional, but the design flaw caused the yield to be low,” Huang said. “It was 100% Nvidia’s fault.” Nvidia is set to report earnings for the fiscal third quarter on Wednesday. The AI chipmaker is expected to report revenues of $33 billion for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS+2.46%). Net income is expected to be $17.4 billion and earnings per share is expected to be $0.75. Nvidia stock was down by about 2.5% during Monday morning trading, but the shares are up about 187% so far this year.

Title: Buy, Sell Or Hold CSCO Stock?

AUSTIN, TEXAS - OCTOBER 02: Carrie Palin, Cisco speaks on stage during 2024 Texas Conference for ... [+] Women at Austin Convention Center on October 02, 2024 in Austin, Texas. (Photo by Marla Aufmuth/Getty Images for Texas Conference for Women) Note: Cisco’s FY 2024 ended July 27, 2024 Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ: CSCO), a company providing networking equipment, security, collaboration, and cloud management services, grew marginally by 0.8% on Wednesday, 13th November to $59, as compared to flat growth in the S&P 500 index. In comparison, CSCO’s peer Alphabet stock (NASDAQ: GOOG) has seen its stock down 1.5% to around $180 on the same day. The company reported $13.8 billion in revenue (in line with guidance) in the fiscal first quarter, representing a 6% decline year-over-year (y-o-y). Despite a revenue decline this quarter, the company’s stock is up 17% so far ytd. Its AI infrastructure investments and product order growth (up 20% y-o-y in Q3) are a big win for the company. Cisco’s Q1 earnings per share stood out, with a GAAP EPS of $0.68 and a non-GAAP EPS of $0.91, both surpassing earlier guidance, driven by robust gross margins and favorable tax effects. However, if you are bearish on the markets, here is a possible negative scenario: S&P To Crash More Than 40%? For the second quarter, Cisco provided a steady outlook, projecting Q2 revenue between $13.75 billion and $13.95 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $0.89 to $0.91. These numbers demonstrate expectations of a stabilization phase, fueled by recent strategic changes, with AI and security tools poised for significant growth. The company raised its full-year revenue forecast to between $55.3 billion and $56.3 billion, from $55 billion to $56.2 billion previously. It also lifted its earnings per share projection to between $2.26 and $2.38, up from $1.93 to $2.05. The increase in CSCO stock over the last 3-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 46% in 2021, -22% in 2022, and 9% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is much less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could CSCO face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump? Cisco’s Q1 segment performance was mixed, with security revenues doubling y-o-y, and networking revenues declining 23% y-o-y. Broadly, its product revenue declined 9%, while service revenue increased 6%, highlighting the industry’s shift towards service-centric solutions. Cisco’s product sales have witnessed a slowdown as customers have been focused on installing and implementing the products purchased over the last few quarters. Moreover, large companies, including cloud service providers and telecommunication players, have held back on network-related capital expenditures on account of economic uncertainty. Separately, Cisco is also facing competition from smaller networking companies and this is also impacting growth. The company’s financials revealed varied regional outcomes as well. In Q1, the company’s revenue in the Americas and EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa) declined, contrasting with APJC’s (Asia Pacific, Japan, and China) modest growth. Cisco has been making progress with gross margins in recent quarters, driven by lower freight and component costs, a favorable product mix, and overall better cost management. On a GAAP basis, CSCO’s total gross margin, product gross margin, and services gross margin were 65.9%, 65.1%, and 68.0%, respectively, as compared with 65.2%, 64.5%, and 67.3%, respectively, in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. We could see similar trends over Q2 as well. The company has been increasingly pushing toward a recurring revenue model with its software subscriptions and service contracts which could also help margins. Cisco’s recent purchase of Splunk underscores its commitment to expanding its security offerings. This move aligns with the company’s broader strategy to bolster its capabilities in AI-driven threat detection and response. The company intends to cross-sell Splunk products to drive revenue synergies, indicating that it has identified about 5,000 existing Cisco customers that could also become Splunk customers. Splunk is a software player that provides tools to analyze log files, and other data, using artificial intelligence to help companies minimize the risk of cybersecurity incidents. We believe CSCO stock is appropriately priced at current levels. The stock trades at just about 23x consensus earnings for FY’25. We think this is a reasonable valuation, even though growth for this year is likely to be muted. Cisco’s push into the recurring revenue model and its increasing focus on cybersecurity, via acquisitions, could help the stock. We also believe that the company will perform better than its big tech peers in the event of a potential economic downturn given its lower valuation and the secular spending trends on digitization and networking. We value CSCO stock at about $57 per share, which is in line with the current market price. See our analysis of Cisco Valuation for a closer look at what’s driving our price estimate for the stock.

Title: After losing 33% in the past year, Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. (NASDAQ:CBRL) institutional owners must be relieved by the recent gain
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/losing-33-past-cracker-barrel-113615439.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Significantly high institutional ownership implies Cracker Barrel Old Country Store's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions The top 7 shareholders own 52% of the company Ownership research along with analyst forecasts data help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stock Every investor in Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. (NASDAQ:CBRL) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 79% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). Institutional investors would probably welcome last week's 6.5% increase in the share price after a year of 33% losses as a sign that returns may to begin trending higher. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Cracker Barrel Old Country Store. Check out our latest analysis for Cracker Barrel Old Country Store Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. We can see that Cracker Barrel Old Country Store does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Cracker Barrel Old Country Store's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. It would appear that 9.3% of Cracker Barrel Old Country Store shares are controlled by hedge funds. That catches my attention because hedge funds sometimes try to influence management, or bring about changes that will create near term value for shareholders. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 16% of shares outstanding. With 12% and 9.3% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and Biglari Capital LLC are the second and third largest shareholders. We did some more digging and found that 7 of the top shareholders account for roughly 52% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat. Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily. The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it. Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group. We can see that insiders own shares in Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc.. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$15m. Most would see this as a real positive. Most would say this shows alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. The general public-- including retail investors -- own 10% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the 4 warning signs we've spotted with Cracker Barrel Old Country Store . But ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.

General Ekman, who oversaw the recent US withdrawal from Niger which was completed in September, said Niger’s expulsion of US forces will not change the American mission. “How we will pursue [those objectives], either together or apart, as a consequence of the withdrawal remains to be seen, but we wanted to make sure we kept all options on the table,” he said. Before the government overthrows in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger, the US had hundreds of forces in two Niger bases that served as what Washington calls counterterrorism hubs. Burkina Faso and Mali also hosted American Special Forces teams. If there was hope that the removal of US forces from these countries would lead to a rethink of the AFRICOM mission in the region, that is not coming to pass. The US is instead upping its presence in neighboring countries Ghana, Côte d’Ivoire, and Benin. “If our presence in Niger allowed us to go inside out, relative to the Sahelian-based VEO [violent extremist organization] threat, we now have to revert to going outside in,” Ekman said.

The Sahel, a vast region spanning parts of Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso, is known for its economic hardship and violence, but the new governments in these nations are taking major steps towards breaking free from foreign influence and asserting local sovereignty . There’s a lot of hope. As Stanley Kwabla Arku, a Ghanaian journalist with Pan African Television, writes: The Sahel’s recent shifts have ignited a movement against foreign military involvement, particularly French influence, which many local voices say has fueled conflict and stymied economic progress. This groundswell of anti-imperialist sentiment has resulted in what organizers describe as “patriotic uprisings,” led by popular forces and progressive alliances within state institutions like the military. These uprisings have reshaped governance in the region, as people demand sovereignty and work to assert a more independent future. These aspirations are running up against violent constraints, however, as US military officials say ‘I told you so.’ From The African: The pursuit of economic prosperity and healthy sovereignty by Burkina Faso, Niger and Mali, is likely to be waylaid as terrorism continues to undermine country and regional security and stability…The Africa Centre for Strategy Studies estimates that the 11 643 fatalities in the Sahel during 2023 represent a “near threefold increase” from levels seen in 2020 and a “record high” in militant Islamic-group violence since the “peak of the Boko Haram violence in 2015”…The road towards self-determination, sustainable development and sovereignty is potholed by persistent violent attacks by Islamic militant groups. Weakened by these constant attacks, the three junta governments are unable to get on with the business of stabilising and governing their countries. “They’re absolutely feeling [the loss of Western military personnel],” a senior US military official told VOA. A big reason why is that the US and France are helping to drive the violence, including uusing Ukraine, much the same way they do with Israel, to destabilize nations and regions that threaten Western capital. Ukraine Terrorist Inc. The US’ purported mission in the Sahel is to fight “terrorism,” which somehow always gets worse despite the American operations. The terrorists are now being assisted by the US proxy state of Ukraine. Kiev supported a July attack by Tuareg rebels in Mali that killed Malian government troops and Wagner Group mercenaries, likely with an assist from other Western governments. Some background: Since 2013, France has been assisting the Malian government in a fight against paramilitary groups. However, after the 2020 coup, Paris refused to recognise the new government and pushed the western-backed Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to impose severe economic sanctions and trade restrictions on Mali. In response, Mali expelled French forces and withdrew from ECOWAS, turning to Moscow for support. The Ukrainians are actively training and equipping terrorist groups, which means in a roundabout way that the likes of the US and France are working with the very same extremist groups they’re purportedly there to fight. Mali and Niger have since ended diplomatic relations with Ukraine, and Russia’s standing only improves in the region where it signs economic, energy, and defense deals. It’s another reminder of just how spectacularly the Ukraine gambit to isolate and collapse Russia does the opposite. France’s overseas interests have been decimated over the past few years. France got the boot from what now constitutes the Confederation of the Alliance of Sahel States ( AES – Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger). And Paris failed to get ECOWAS to militarily intervene against the AES. Desperate to reverse its downfall in the region, Paris is working with Kiev to terrorize populations and discredit governments in the Sahel. If one wonders about why France continues to pour money into Ukraine (the “Anne of Kyiv” brigade—a nod to the medieval Ukrainian princess who became Queen of France— just completed over two months of training with French military forces in eastern and southern France), the Sahel might provide some clues. The forces involved in the Mali attack were from a coalition of armed separatist groups consisting of the Cadre Stratégique pour la Défense du Peuple de l’Azawad (CSP-DPA) and the al-Qaeda-affiliated Group for Supporters of Islam and Muslims (JNIM), which reportedly received training from Ukrainian forces in Mauritania and Ukraine. A CSP-DPA spokesman downplayed any special ties to Ukraine’s intelligence services, however, saying “We have links with the Ukrainians, but just as we have with everyone else, the French, Americans, and others.” Good to know. *** Sahel states are increasingly demanding more compensation from mining operations and outright nationalizing them. Three out of four light bulbs in France were reportedly powered by Nigerien uranium. In contrast, only 10 to 20 percent of Nigeriens in urban areas have access to electricity, while roughly 3 percent do in the rural areas. That is changing. Members of West Africa’s anti-imperialist bloc – the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) – have made multiple headlines this year by taking back control of their mining resources. Burkina Faso recently nationalised two gold mines; Niger expelled French mining company Orano from its… pic.twitter.com/jeos9AE8SA — African Stream (@african_stream) September 30, 2024 Kodjovi Kpachavi, an organizer with the Black Alliance for Peace and the All-African People’s Revolutionary Party, notes the damage this is doing to Orano: In July, Orano shared that its 2024 operating income (i.e. revenue minus expenses) had decreased from $289 million in the first half of 2023 to $13 million in the first half of 2024 . This equates to a loss of 80% of their operating income compared to 2023. While publicly they have attempted to save face, Orano losing their primary supply of uranium has forced them to attempt to revive old mines near the end of their life-cycle in Canada and negotiate new deals with Kazakhstan, a country that they had been avoiding due to their relationship with Russia . In addition to enlisting to the help of Ukrainian forces to train and arm African paramilitaries, Paris and Brussels are so frustrated they’ve enlisted the dreaded special representative to the Sahel, noting that the region “is of strategic importance to the EU in terms of security and stability, international climate and sustainable development commitments and migration routes linked to Europe.” No doubt. Meanwhile, western mining firms are up in arms. From the Financial Times: John Meyer, partner at corporate advisory firm SP Angel, said the new rules represented a “significant increase in the effective taxation of miners” operating in the country. “A near worst-case scenario now appears to be evolving whereby companies are being required to hand over a further 15 per cent of their projects in Mali for very little in the way of compensation,” he said. “The situation will dissuade many companies from further investment in Mali, and we suspect all but the most essential exploration will stop.” However, Barrick is sanguine about its prospects of resolving its dispute in Mali, which accounts for 13 per cent of the company’s gold production. Since the sovereignist governments in Sahel nations got interested in obtaining more profit share of mines, the operations are coming under increasing attack: Graphs from the Global Terrorism Index 2024 report reveal non-state organizations’ interest in gold mines in the Sahel region. In addition to gold, oil, uranium, natural gas, and lithium mines are also the focus of organizations in the Sahel region. pic.twitter.com/2H3FgYPs76 — Levent Kemal (@leventkemaI) May 8, 2024 Meanwhile, imperial stooges like Mathew Edds-Reitman, a program manager at the US Institute of Peace, explain that the Sahel violence is the result of overthrowing Western-backed governments and that the “best way to protect” these states and their populations “is to buttress their democracy and resilience.” Democracy and resilience. Those are, of course, code words for Western capital interests and their governments’ forces. It’s difficult to discern how Edds-Reitman “analysis” is any different from the mafia issuing veiled threats (“shame if something were to happen”) while simultaneously offering “protection.” So what is the true AFRICOM mission? Many argue it’s to perpetuate violence in order to keep the Americans in and make nations reliant on Western military support and hardware. As Abayomi Azikiwe, the editor of Pan-African News Wire, writes: The idea behind AFRICOM and the French counterparts known as Operation Barkhane and the G5, was to train the post-colonial military forces in the ethos of imperialism. For years many of these regimes, whether bourgeois democratic or military, provided diplomatic and political cover for the continuation of the exploitation of African resources and labor. Once those same Western-trained and equipped forces threw out Western advisers and businesses (or demanded a fairer shake), the fact that Ukrainians began assisting African paramilitaries and attacks on mines jumped indicate that the governments in Paris and Washington are resorting to terrorism in an attempt to keep the Sahel states under their control as. The Incoming Trump Administration and AFRICOM As the New Not-So Cold War between Washington and Moscow spills into the Sahel, could a Trump-led detente with Russia lead to a pull back in US forces from the region. There are reasons to doubt that. AFRICOM has faced the prospect of having its operations scaled back before. As Nick Turse reported back in 2020: Facing a potential drawdown of forces, AFRICOM has been making the case that its bases and the missions run from them are integral to U.S. interests. “Strategic access to Africa, its airspace, and its surrounding waters is vital to U.S. national security,” Townsend told the Senate Armed Services Committee late last month. He and others have argued for what they contend is AFRICOM’s supposed bang for the buck. “What U.S. Africa Command accomplishes with relatively few people and few dollars, on a continent three-and-a-half times the size of the continental United States, is a bargain for the American taxpayer,” Manley told The Intercept. [1] The argument goes that African minerals are critical to US national security to reduce dependency on China – something to keep in mind with the arrival of Team Trump China hawks. Yet at the same time, Western firms have been selling off mines to China. For example, Chinese companies have spent the past decade and billions of dollars buying out U.S. and European miners in the DRC’s Cobalt belt, leading to control of 15 of 19 of the primary cobalt mines in the country. about 80 percent of the world’s cobalt processing occurs in China before being incorporated into lithium-ion batteries. The US has little business interests itself in the Sahel where French, Australian, Canadian, and UK mining companies took the lead. The US is instead turning its attention to the wealthier coastal countries of West Africa, particularly along critical Atlantic Ocean shipping lanes where the US conducts about $4 billion in two-way trade (and where reports are that China wants to eventually open its second African military base). A report from Africa Intelligence indicates that the U.S. is preparing additional military aid for several West African nations, with a particular focus on Ghana, Benin, and Côte d’Ivoire. It will be interesting to see if that fact affects the outlook of the incoming Trump administration, which could potentially be eyeing a more isolationist stance. If that’s the case, the US could leave French and other Western nations to sort out their own business in the Sahel. Director of national intelligence nominee Tulsi Gabbard is an interesting case. While she has long opposed US interventionist wars, she’s also offered complete support for Israel and is a big believer in “radical Islamic ideology” fueling terrorism. She seems to prefer to fight that ideology with small teams and Obama-style drone waves leading some to view her nomination in a negative light: I tweeted about her being in Africa’s Sahel, back in 2021 (in my lost account), when she went to supervise training of al Qaeda in Africa. Her “go after” is of course nonsense since both al Qaeda & ISIS are mercenaries led by the US She is now officially the Terrorists Big Boss https://t.co/uEGO93zhUh pic.twitter.com/TKDFAa9axE — Cindy Somemore (@cindysomemore) November 13, 2024 If the incoming administration is hyper-focused on China, which appears to be the case, it stands to reason the US will be active in Africa with one of the few tools the US has: the military. That’s because China happens to be dominating Africa. While American big tech, aspects of which are cozy with Team Trump, are competing with Chinese companies for dominance in Africa, and Exxon Mobil and Chevron have operations across Africa, US interests are mostly dwarfed by Beijing. Ken Opalo, a political scientist at Georgetown University, writes at An Africanist Perspective: Importantly, France is no longer the undisputed major power when it comes to francophone African countries’ foreign relations. The last two decades have seen China supplant France as these countries’ largest trade partner. China is now a bigger trade trade partner for francophone African states than the United States, the United Kingdom, and France combined. More recently, countries like the Central African Republic (CAR), Burkina Faso, Guinea, and Mali have forged closer security ties with Russia. France’s situation looks even worse when one considers its share of total trade to/from its former African colonies. Among these countries, French share of trade plummeted from more than a quarter in the early 1990s to just over 5%. Here’s how it looks for Africa as a whole: Source: Ken Opalo With Beijing’s heavy presence comes risk, however. And there is the line of thinking that chaos in Africa, and the Sahel in particular, damages China, which is a consolation prize for the West losing influence. For example, oil is once again flowing through a Chinese pipeline from Niger to Benin’s seaport, but it has come under attack in recent months. More from Geopolitical Futures: Beijing could, however, scale back or block unsuccessful and riskier economic projects, including those in Niger, if there is not the return of at least a modicum of stability. The African turmoil does not allow the People’s Republic to develop a true transcontinental corridor any time soon, making the creation of a military base on the Atlantic less pressing. Such a base would be a useful lookout to the west, but would remain isolated, far from the Chinese coast and Djibouti. It’s essentially a scorched earth retreat. And that decision is likely to boomerang on them like so many others. Western governments are now complaining about how Russia is allegedly helping Yemen’s Houthis close the Red Sea to western shipping. We see how France’s interests in Africa have collapsed, with Moscow potentially giving a little push to that house of cards. It was irresponsible, yet fitting, for Western governments to think they could launch a proxy war against Russia and not face some consequences elsewhere. Russia, China, and others are increasingly refusing to just sit back and be targets, but are instead harming Western economic interests in kind. And the full-fledged backing of terrorism in the Sahel is only damaging the West’s position there. Now as France is being pushed out, Washington fears the increasing presence of Russia and China. Africom’s commander Michael E. Langley has accused Russia and China of leading a disinformation campaign in the Sahel to undermine U.S. influence in West and Central Africa. As the US expands its presence in coastal west africa, analysts caution that the expanding American military footprint in West Africa could inadvertently provide terrorist groups with more fuel for the fire. Well that’s not a bad outcome if the goal is self-perpetuating conflict. It’s well-known even in the US that Indeed, a 2011 report from the US House of Representatives Homeland Security Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence tried to explain Boko Haram’s popularity. Reasons included “a feeling of alienation from the wealthier, Christian, oil-producing, southern Nigeria, pervasive poverty, rampant government corruption, heavy-handed security measures, and the belief that relations with the West are a corrupting influence.” The response? Nigeria, which had been transforming into an arm of US Africa Command ever since the dawn of the “War on Terror”, executed Boko Haram’s leader and state forces began killing or displacing thousands of Nigerian Muslims. And everything has gone pretty much according to plan since then. From MR Online: It’s not as if strategists don’t understand that violence doesn’t work. They understand that violence escalates violence which can then be used as pretexts for more violence. A U.S. Council on Foreign Relations article from 2020 notes: “the last two years have been deadlier than any other period for Nigerian soldiers since the Boko Haram insurgency began.” Hanna Eid, writing at Al Mayadeen, compares the Western-backed terror campaign to the CIA post-WWII Operation Gladio, which used fascist stay-behind armies to destabilize and discredit Socialist governments and Communist parties in Europe. The legacy of that successful operation is what we see today: a European political class that sees themselves as faithful servants to the US empire and transnational capital and have nothing but scorn for the local peasants. We’ll see if the Sahel nations fare better than Europe did. Reasons for Hope While analysts write that the US “lost” the Sahel, they also stress that Russia will not be a “savior.” This misses the fact that the people of the region are not looking for a savior but instead a fair deal for resources, as well as things like infrastructure, industry, and technology transfer. Russia and China, at least for now, check those boxes. Despite the increasing violence in the region, driven at least in part by the West, progress is evident — contrary to Western reports of oppressive autocracy — and demanding more money from the mining operations is a big part of it. In Burkina Faso, for example, “the current administration is subsidizing the cost of agricultural equipment for farmers and has set a goal to increase the productivity of irrigated areas by at least 50%.” Kpachavi writes: The [Alliance of Sahel States]’s development of roads, hospitals, health programs, agricultural programs, factories , reforestation programs , safety and security initiatives , women’s unions , and more have been deliberately ignored by western media. And more important details from Inemesit Richardson, the co-founder of The Thomas Sankara Center for African Liberation and Unity, a Pan-African library and political education center based in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso: …there is very little that has happened within the AES that did not begin first as a call emanating from the grassroots. The reason why AES leaders are so beloved by their people is because they have consistently submitted to the people’s will. There would not even be an Alliance of Sahel States in any form if the AES leaders did not listen to the cries of their people to form one. Mass mobilisations led by civil society organizations called for the removal of French troops from the soils of Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger. The leaders heard this call and followed the demands of their people. Niger was at the vanguard of calling for the expulsion of US troops as well, civilians having protested against AFRICOM’s presence for many years. …People in the Sahel today are very perceptive and understand the strategies and tactics of imperialism. They know that the current imperialist talking point is that ‘both sides are bad’ or that they need ‘neither Russia nor France’ and they don’t fall for this rhetoric anymore. People also appreciate partnerships with Iran for similar reasons. Iran is a powerful country that has a great capacity to defend itself and resist imperialist aggression. Countries like Russia and Iran are important to the people of the Sahel because, beyond collaborating within the areas of security, they offer the AES countries a pathway towards industrialization through the creation of factories, refineries, and power plants. It would seem that the new leaders, with help from “Axis of Evil” countries, are providing material benefits to the people as opposed to what came before: ever-worsening violence, brutal poverty, and off the charts corruption. Following that, Russia doesn’t have to do much to come out like a “savior.” Notes [1] Turse’s piece goes on to note an inspector general’s report examining U.S. counterterrorism efforts in Africa, which notes that “the threat posed by al Shabaab and ISIS-Somalia in East Africa remains ‘high,’ despite continued U.S. airstrikes and training of Somali security forces,” the Defense Intelligence Agency told the Defense Department’s Inspector General. The DoDIG further noted that al-Shabab not only “remains a potent threat” due to its “ability to conduct high-profile attacks, recruit fighters, and finance ongoing operations,” but that the group “appears to be a growing threat to U.S. personnel and interests in the region.” Thank you for this extensive coverage. In the bad old days of the 60s, they would use mercenaries to impose western control of African resources. So you had men like “Mad Mike” Hoare running around with their own mercenary formations. But that was then and this is now. These days mercenaries have been corporatized so you now have terrorists doing the same sort of work. Having Ukrainians there is for the purposes of plausible deniability of the US and France. I do not think that China and Russia will just sit back and take these attacks on themselves and their African allies but will leverage their extensive technical capabilities. They will use their satellite coverage to scope out the local battlefields and train the locals extensively in the use of their own drones along with battle-tested tactics. But if the US and France ups their attacks, then they may find their own bases come under attack by local proxies just to spread the joy. And it has not escaped my notice that the Sahel region cuts Africa in two on a east-west axis so a major reason for the fight for it. In a way, it is a reflection of the British trying to cut Africa in half vertically with their Cape to Cairo railway under the influence of Cecil Rhodes in the 19th century- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_to_Cairo_Railway Thank you, Rev. Your comment reminds me of the use of, ahem, contractors to guard property, either ours* or clients’, at HSBC* two decades ago. We would go to Mayfair and meet a well spoken and well to do former officer, usually foot guards, but sometimes cavalry, to discuss the transaction mechanics, operational risks and fees. The boots on the ground tended to be from the ranks with perhaps a former NCO or a former officer in charge. *Initially, we came to own property briefly when transacting under Islamic law, but later did under English law for a fee. South Africa’s Executive Outcomes has returned and operated against Boko, not BoJo, Haram in the Sahel. The UK’s Saladin has personnel from the defunct Keenie Meenie Services, involved in Sri Lanka alongside Bell Pottinger, also responsible for the White Helmets. The USA’s L3 MPRI, active in the former Yugoslavia, is now part of Engility. In the years ahead, there will be much Ukrainian muscle available. One wonders if the weaponry will also flood western markets, like it did as the Yugoslav wars petered out. So you had men like “Mad Mike” Hoare running around with their own mercenary formations. In those “heroic” times there also was the (in)famous Bob Denard. Even then, however, there was a lot of government involvement. Remember how the CIA recruited mercenaries to fight for Unita and the FNLA in Angola in 1975-6, and how Hoare and company eventually took part in the failed attempt to seize the Seychelles, almost certainly with South African backing. “We’ll see if the Sahel nations fare better than Europe did.” LOL. “Finish him!” *crude, oriental techno plays* “Hanna Eid, writing at Al Mayadeen, compares the Western-backed terror campaign to the CIA post-WWII Operation Gladio, which used fascist stay-behind armies to destabilize and discredit Socialist governments and Communist parties in Europe. The legacy of that successful operation is what we see today: a European political class that sees themselves as faithful servants to the US empire and transnational capital and have nothing but scorn for the local peasants.” Indeed. But waiting for the responses about how “complicated” it is to call a fascist when you see one. “Sahel states are increasingly demanding more compensation from mining operations and outright nationalizing them. Three out of four light bulbs in France were reportedly powered by Nigerien uranium. In contrast, only 10 to 20 percent of Nigeriens in urban areas have access to electricity, while roughly 3 percent do in the rural areas…” Which all reminds me about the history of the Volta Dam ( Akosombo Dam) in Ghana and Western mining interests. And now Ghana and West Africa are the fall back positions for Western military in the Sahel… “The Ukrainians are actively training and equipping terrorist groups…” Another example of the blowback potential from the war in Ukraine. They will also train and equip terrorists in Europe and eventually in the USA. Those Ukrainian “soldiers” will be bored once the major fighting in Ukraine is over and they will love to become “contractors” for good pay in Europe & North America just as what is happening in Israel. Armed, indoctrinated and unemployed testosterone is a dangerous thing. They will be convinced that the West used them and won’t be happy. The UAE and the Gulf in general is ripe for the disruption and some of these Uke guys have seafaring skills as well. Armed to the teeth, full of hate, and looking for work. We’re in for decades of chaos thanks to our leadership class. Aww, it breaks my heart learning that Tulsi is an Al Qaeda trainer. :-( However at the same time she is an Assad apologist because she’s against the war in Syria. I don’t get it: usually only banks or weapons dealers play both sides and she doesn’t look like one. What am I missing, provided it is not fake news? Any documentation that Tulsi is an Al Qaeda trainer? Quite curious actually. If she’s going to be Director of National Intelligence then she’ll be in charge of ISIS and al-Qaeda. Unless Trump disowns them, which is hard to imagine. I don’t think that is correct. They are run out of the CIA and even though the DNI sits over the CIA, it does not control CIA day to day ops. In fact, I have read of the DNI not wanting to be informed of stuff the CIA was up to for plausible deniability reasons. Your email address will not be published.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Quote of the Week: “Whoever undertakes to set himself up as a judge in the field of Truth and Knowledge is shipwrecked by the laughter of the gods.” – Albert Einstein (1953) Number of the Week: 2,000 years ago THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: This Week begins with a discussion by Roy Spencer on adjustments that may be needed on the record high temperature recorded in Death Valley California. Kenneth Richard suggests five papers that indicate that increasing CO2 may have an insignificant influence on global temperatures. Roger Caiazza discusses problems New York State may have in meeting its energy goals, particularly replacing fossil fuels and nuclear with alternatives. Matt Ridley points out that the recent flooding of Valencia may be the result of eliminating flood control dams. Comments on the beginning of COP-29 are presented. An article by an academic illustrates what is too frequently missed in academic analyses of energy policy. ********************* A Fallen Icon? Roy Spencer continued his essays exploring the widely accepted high temperature for the United States of 134° F (57° C) recorded at Greenland Ranch in Death Valley California (now called Furnace Creek Ranch) on July 10, 1913. John Christy prompted Spencer to look into this record. Recently, after extensive historical research, William Reidd doubted the record and suggested the new observer in 1913 was disillusioned by the low readings taken at the official weather station. He may have substituted readings from his front porch of official readings. Reid provided a photograph showing that the official station was located by an irrigated alfalfa field, which was not a typical the desert location. In the summer, irrigation in the desert lowers daytime high temperatures and raises nighttime low temperatures. So, the siting of the weather station was poor, and it probably produced high temperature readings that were too low for the area, but that is not known. Spencer states: “In my experience, unless the vegetation area is rather large, and there is almost no wind, a weather station’s daily maximum temperature will still be largely determined by air flowing from the larger-scale desert surroundings. But note… this is different from, say a poorly sited thermometer next to a brick wall or heat pump where hot air from an isolated source can elevate the daily maximum temperature recorded).” Spencer analyzes maximum temperatures for the 27 surrounding stations up to 100 miles away from Death Valley and at different elevations for the period 1935 to 1938. Then he examines the maximum temperatures for the 3 to 7 stations during 1912 to 1915 and finds significant disparity from the Death Valley records. Spencer then provides a statistical analysis based on lapse rate to adjust for the different elevations in this dry climate. He concludes: “The 134 deg. F world record hottest temperature from Death Valley is likely around 10 deg. F too high, compared to elevation-adjusted temperatures from surrounding stations. The most likely cause is that the ranch foreman’s reported measurements were (shall we say) unacademically recorded. I find it rather remarkable that the world record hottest temperature from Death Valley was not revised many years ago, since the methods for “fact checking” the record are fairly simple and based upon meteorological principles known for well over 50 years.” So, we do not know what the highest temperature recorded in the US is. It may be around 10° F, 6° C too high. Until NOAA began manipulating the US surface temperature records in the early part of the 21st century with no clear justification and no record of changes, the US record was the best in the world covering a large area. One wonders how many of the surface records used by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and its collaborators can stand up to the rigorous examination Roy Spencer did on the Greenland Ranch record. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. *************** Miniscule Effect of CO2: Kenneth Richard discusses six papers: one that asserts that CO2 is the control knob of Earth’s temperatures and five that refute that assertion. In addressing the claim that CO2’s climate effects are undetectable Richard states: “Of course, this very unfalsifiable thought experiment is what believers in the CO2-is-the-climate-control-knob narrative rest their case on. But even if we do use this imaginary-world premise, the existing models (MODTRAN, HITRAN) that allegedly support the CO2-controls-climate orthodoxy actually undermine it.” Richard then discusses five papers that contradict the CO2 controls-climate notion. He does not discuss the contradictions TWTW prefers. The papers from van Wijngaarden and Happer use the high resolution HITRAN spectroscopy as discussed in last week’s TWTW, under Updating HITRAN. In their papers van Wijngaarden and Happer have convincingly demonstrated that adding CO2 to the atmosphere has a miniscule effect on temperatures. For example, see Figure 7 in their “The Role of Greenhouse Gases in Energy Transfer in the Earth’s Atmosphere.” These estimates are well tested using satellite data over Guam (tropics), the Sahara (desert); Mediterranean (mid-latitudes) and the Antarctic (polar regions). Based on these calculations, the overall impact of CO2 at current concentrations is less than 25% of the greenhouse effect, and doubling CO2 concentration would add a mere 2%. Water vapor accounts for almost all of the effect. The one issue that is still not clear is clouds. The calculations by van Wijngaarden and Happer are for clear skies. Clouds are extremely complicated, and no one has developed an adequate theory for their formation and dissipation. However, their overall influence will reduce the warming of Earth from the greenhouse effect. This was seen during the Little Ice Age in Europe, when skies were overcast, growing seasons were short, and crops frequently did not ripen properly in the northern parts of Europe. Diseases attributed to mycotoxins formed by moldy grain were common. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy – Radiation Transfer. *************** Dreams Hit Reality: New York State has adopted an imaginative energy policy the “Dispatchable Emissions-Free Resource” – DEFR. Dispatchable means that the power source can be adjusted to match the electricity demand. Nuclear, coal, and similar power plants require time to adjust. Gas and Combined Cycle Gas Generation can be adjusted in less time. Gas turbines require little time. Wind and solar cannot be adjusted to increase output unless they are operating under capacity for current weather conditions. Large hydropower can be adjusted quickly. New York State, which has no additional hydropower practically possible, has closed all but three nuclear power plants. No one has identified a Dispatchable Emissions-Free Resource to fill increasing state needs. Given these conditions, Roger Caiazza who analyzes electricity needs for New York State discusses “Renewable Transition Raw Materials Challenge” based on the Bulletin 416 of the Bulletins of the Geological Survey of Finland, which “publishes the results of scientific research that is thematically or geographically connected to Finnish or Fennoscandian geology.” The Abstract of a paper referenced in the bulletin is “Scope of the replacement system to globally phase out fossil fuels” which states: “The task to phase out fossil fuels is now at hand. Most studies and publications to date focus on why fossil fuels should be phased out. This study presents the physical requirements in terms of required non-fossil fuel industrial capacity, to completely phase out fossil fuels, and maintain the existing industrial ecosystem. The existing industrial ecosystem dependency on fossil fuels was mapped by fuel (oil, gas, and coal) and by industrial application. Data were collected globally for fossil fuel consumption, physical activity, and industrial actions for the year 2018. The estimated sum total of extra annual capacity of non-fossil fuel power generation to phase out fossil fuels completely, and maintain the existing industrial ecosystem, at a global scale is 48,939.8 TWh. A discussion on the needed size of the stationary power storage buffer to manage intermittent energy supply from wind and solar was conducted. Pumped hydro, hydrogen, biofuels, and ammonia were all examined as options in this paper. This study uses four stationary power buffer capacities: 6 hours, 48 hours + 10%, 28 days and 12 weeks. This power buffer is assumed to be supplied through the use of large battery banks (in line with strategic policy expectations). An estimate is presented for the total quantity of metals required to manufacture a single generation of renewable technology units (EV’s, solar panels, wind turbines, etc.) sufficient to replace energy technologies based on combustion of fossil fuels. This estimate was derived by assembling the number of units needed against the estimated metal content for individual battery chemistries, wind turbines, solar panels, and electric vehicles. The majority of the metals needed were to resource the construction of stationary power storage to act as a buffer for wind and solar power generation. It was shown that both 2019 global mine production, 2022 global reserve estimates, 2022 mineral resources, and estimates of undersea resources, were manifestly inadequate for meeting projected demand for copper, lithium, nickel, cobalt, graphite, and vanadium.” Another second article referenced in the Bulletin is “Quantity of metals required to manufacture one generation of renewable technology units to phase out fossil fuel.” The abstract of that paper states: “An estimate is presented for the total quantity of raw materials required to manufacture a single generation of renewable technology units (solar panels, wind turbines, etc.) sufficient to replace energy technologies based on combustion of fossil fuels. This estimate was derived by assembling the number of units needed against the estimated metal con- tent for individual battery chemistries, wind turbines, solar panels, and electric vehicles. The majority of the metals needed were to resource the construction of stationary power storage to act as a buffer for wind and solar power generation. This study uses four stationary power buffer capacities as modelled in a previous study: 6 hours, 48 hours + 10%, 28 days and 12 weeks. This power buffer is assumed to be supplied through the use of large battery banks (in line with strategic policy expectations). Metal quantities were calculated for all four capacities and compared with mining production, mineral reserves, mineral resources, and known undersea resources. It was also assessed whether recycling could deliver this metal quantity by comparing calculations against the sum total mined metal between 1990 and 2023. The quantity of metal mined over the last 34 years was inadequate, which means recycling cannot deliver the needed capacity, and the mining of minerals would have to be the primary source of metals for at least the first generation of non-fossil fuel technology. If a metal has not yet been mined, then that metal cannot be recycled.” [Boldface added] Caiazza provides a solid analysis of this bulletin and concludes: “This is an ambitious analysis that covers the entire global energy system. As such there are bound to be oversights and limitations as well as interpretative assumptions that could be issues. In my opinion, however, the approach and assumptions are reasonable and should give a reasonable estimate of the metals needed. The mass of metals available is another challenge but I think there is better historical data available. Comparing the metals needed to the metals available leads to the inescapable conclusion that the dreams of replacing fossil fuels will be unable to overcome reality.” [Boldface added] New York State’s Dispatchable Emissions-Free Resource remains a pipedream without nuclear or hydropower additions. Both omissions will greatly increase the costs of electricity to consumers in the state. Yet, politicians continue to pretend reliable electricity is not needed.

Writing in The Spectator (UK), Matt Ridely provides a different view. He writes: In the past few years, the Spanish government has been removing dams at a furious rate. Under a European Union program to encourage the restoration of rivers to their wild state for the benefit of fish migration, Spain set about dismantling barriers of all kinds. In 2021 it got rid of 108 dams and weirs; in 2022, another 133. That year, according to Dam Removal Europe, a coalition of seven green pressure groups, it was Europe’s proud league champion at dismantling them. Last year it was second only to France. [Boldface added] Some dams were removed in the hills around Valencia but it turns out they were small irrigation dams, not reservoir dams, so they would not have made much difference last week. However, the failure to build a new dam may well be partly to blame. The Cheste dam in the Turia catchment was specifically designed to prevent flooding, to ‘regulate the flows coming from the upper basin of the Poyo and Pozalet ravines. It was approved in 2001 as part of a National Hydrological Plan. Objections from people in Aragon to separate parts of the plan that would transfer water between regions led the socialist Jose Luis Rodríguez Zapatero to promise to repeal it when running for prime minister in 2004. He kept his promise and the Cheste dam was an unintended casualty. Could it have saved Valencia? Possibly. The [capital] city of Aragon was saved last month by a dam built by the emperor Augustus.” These extreme weather events have been going on since the time of Emperor Augustus and are not the result of recent “climate change.” Instead, the high death toll is the result of destruction of the resilience provided by dams designed to prevent flooding. A similar failure to build dams recommended by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) near Ashville, NC, probably resulted in the recent flooding there. See links under Changing Weather. *************** A Circus? The 29th Conference of Parties (COP 29) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has begun in Baku, Azerbaijan, an oil and gas producing country According to reports, in his welcoming speech to the delegates and other attendees, the President of the host country declared oil and gas are gifts of God. The President of COP 29, Azerbaijan’s Mister for Ecology, demanded that climate change be treated with the same urgency as COVID-19 for which “advanced economies marshalled $8 trillion over the course of just 48 months.” Not to be outdone, Jo Nova reports that the world’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide, by far, China, wants $1.3 trillion from wealthy nations. This “backward” nation has planned 100 space launches for 2024 in its goal to put someone on the Moon by 2030. Meanwhile White House climate adviser John Podesta who is at the conference assured the attendees that the US will move forward in “combating climate change despite the election of President-elect Trump, who has long cast doubt on the science behind the issue.” In December 2023, the US State Department issued a report on the US Climate Finance Pledge which stated: “The United States is committed to exercising U.S. leadership to implement the goals of the Paris Agreement, to accelerate the global clean energy transition, and to enable vulnerable countries and communities to build resilience against the impacts of climate change. To that end, the United States will continue to support developing country partners as they pursue ambitious climate action. The United States has prioritized boosting international climate finance, as well as demanding that international financial institutions evolve to better enable emerging market and developing countries to respond to global challenges, including climate change. That is why President Biden launched the first U.S. International Climate Finance Plan in 2021 and committed to work with Congress to scale up international public climate finance to over $11 billion annually by 2024, quadrupling from the highest previous levels of climate finance provided by the United States.” Apparently, some attendees believe that believe oil and gas are “gifts of God” ignoring them is very costly. Will wealthy countries will continue with the dubious pledges of a few, now irrelevant, politicians? See links under After Paris and Below the Bottom Line. *************** Ignore the Obvious: The director of the Energy, Climate Justice, and Sustainability Lab and a research professor at New York University’s School of Professional Studies authored an essay in the Wall Street Journal that exemplifies the approach some academics take about “climate change” and the phony “climate crisis.” In “Five Ways to Disaster-Proof the Energy Grid: With extreme weather events—and power outages—on the rise, utilities and tech companies are looking at what they can do to keep the lights on in the future” the author ignores that the claim of rising extreme weather events is refuted by physical evidence. Her five approaches are: 1) Better prediction using AI; 2) Better batteries; 3) Independent microgrids; 4) Better, stronger transmission lines; and 5) Controlling demand. One, will AI allow better predictions? Utilities are well aware of the limitations of their equipment. The problem is better weather prediction. Unfortunately, with NOAA weather prediction is ignored in favor of the fantasy of climate prediction. Then there is the problem of chaos beyond two-week predictions. It may be better to just expect the worse and hope it does not happen. Two, better batteries. Storage of electricity has long been a problem for utilities. In 1907 pumped hydro storage was used on a small scale in Switzerland. In 1930 it was used in the US by the Connecticut Electric and Power Company. The largest US facility is the Dominion Electric Bath County, VA, plant. In the summer, the system needs replenishment each weekend from reliable power plants. On the utility scale, batteries remain a dream, not a reality. Three: independent microgrids. This works for hospitals etc. if they provide on-site storage of fuel needed for generation. But microgrids do not work for the general public. As seen in the last major winter storm that brought down the Texas grid, just in time delivery of natural gas does not work. The fuel must be available on site. Wind power failed and promised wind resistant solar panels are of little use at night. Four: better, stronger transmission lines: They are always a goal, but require maintenance. Environmental advocates object to cutting back vegetation to protect the transmission and distribution lines. Five: Controlling demand: This is always the favorite of authoritarians. They, not the public, will decide who will get electricity and when. It may work in an authoritarian state but not in a republic with certain personal rights enshrined in its Constitution. What the author ignores is that wind and solar are unreliable and add to the fragility of the grid making it more subject to disruption in severe weather events. See Article #2 *************** Number of the Week: 2,000 years ago. According to Matt Ridley, the city of Aragon [actually Zaragoza], Spain, was recently saved by a dam built by the emperor Augustus. Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus, also known as Octavian, reigned as the first Roman emperor from 27 BC until his death in AD 14. Apparently, the Romans knew of the dangers of flooding in eastern Spain over 2,000 years ago. And such flooding is called extreme weather brought on by recent climate change? [That was during the infamous Roman warm period, which was even warmer than the Medieval warm period, which was even warmer than today.] See links under Changing Weather.

Nov 12, 2024 The Global Carbon Budget report, produced by an international team of more than 120 scientists, provides an annual, peer-reviewed update, building on established methodologies in a fully transparent manner. The 2024 edition (the 19th annual report) will be published in the journal Earth System Science Data on November 13 as a pre-print, and later as a peer-reviewed paper. From the article: For example, India’s emissions, which are projected to be about equal to those of the EU this year, will increase by about 5 percent over their 2023 levels. And the amount of methane and carbon dioxide rising from the rest of the world — which accounts for roughly the same share of global emissions as China and the EU combined — is on track to rise by about 1 percent.

Plankton are the backbone of the ocean — and may struggle with what’s coming A pair of papers in the journal Nature shows how plankton are struggling to survive in warming seas. By Dino Grandoni, The Washington Post, November 13, 2024 [H/t Jim Buell} Links not given, one probable link: Past foraminiferal acclimatization capacity is limited during future warming By Rui Ying, et al., Nature, Nov 13, 2024 From abstract: However, when forcing the trait-based plankton model with rapid transient warming over the coming century (1.5 °C, 2 °C, 3 °C and 4 °C relative to pre-industrial baseline), the model suggests that the acclimatization capacities of all ecogroups are limited and insufficient to track warming rates. From the article: To assess future impacts of warming waters on plankton, Schmidt and her colleagues turned to ancient changes. The team analyzed an extensive fossil record of a type of plankton called foraminifera, which leave behind tiny shells that fall to the seafloor when they die. Even for those who forgo eating fish, plankton are crucial for preventing climate change from getting even worse than it is. When foraminifera form their shells, they bind carbon with calcium to make their building material. After they die, the shells fall to the seafloor, locking that carbon out of the atmosphere for eons. [SEPP Comment: The assumptions are false.

The Dutch judiciary’s scientistic tendency is extremely worrisome and does not bode well for future climate-related judgments. [SEPP Comment: Although the outcome was good, this practice is sad.

Energy Issues — US Trump Announces the Creation of the National Energy Council By Charles Rotter, WUWT, Nov 15, 2024 Elon, DOGE, and the Deep: Offshore Energy’s Role in Fiscal Recovery By Erik Milito, Real Clear Energy, Nov 11, 2024 The Gulf of Mexico oil and gas industry supports nearly 400,000 jobs, contributes almost $34 billion to the GDP, and is a key contributor to environmental conservation, restoration, and recreation programs, including virtually all funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). In 2023 alone, these activities generated over $6 billion in federal revenues, with peaks at $17 billion during high activity periods. This income stream is funded entirely by energy companies from their revenues. Currently, with only three lease sales planned for the Gulf over the next five years, we’re not optimizing our resources.

Nuclear energy has, in fact, been found to be one of the safest energy sources available. Three Mile Island Unit 1 safely operated until 2019, when it was shut down for economic reasons. Alternative, Green (“Clean”) Solar and Wind Wind Power Disappears in Germany and UK By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Nov 14, 2024 Even if we, Germany and the others triple wind capacity, it would make little difference.

November Wind Slump Has Led To A Strained Energy Supply In Germany…Bottlenecks Threaten By P Gosselin, No Tricks Zone, Nov 13, 2024 The lack of wind power last week led to a tighter energy market in Europe, particularly in central and northern regions and caused a surge in electricity prices, especially in short-term markets. Prices reached a two-year high, exceeding 800 EUR/MWh! As a result, there’s growing concern about the potential for similar price spikes in winter if wind conditions remain weak.

Five Ways to Disaster-Proof the Energy Grid With extreme weather events—and power outages—on the rise, utilities and tech companies are looking at what they can do to keep the lights on in the future By Amy Myers Jaffe, WSJ, Nov 10, 2024 TWTW Summary: Discussed in the This Week section above. “The recent flooding of Valencia, Spain . . . . In 2021 it got rid of 108 dams and weirs; in 2022, another 133. it was Europe’s proud league champion at dismantling them. Last year it was second only to France.” ________________________________________________________________________________ So far, A total of 2,119 dams have been removed in the U.S. since 1912 and more removals are planned (Google search on “dam removal in the us”) I’m waiting for the article that claims the Climate Change is causing more floods. 2,000 years ago… The sparsely populated areas like the fenland – home to the Iceni etc – underwent huge transformation. “Areas of coastal marshland formed an important and distinctive part of the landscape of Roman Britain, and current work is showing that different wetlands were utilised in very different ways. Some areas, for example in Essex and Kent, were simply exploited for their natural resources to produce salt and support seasonal grazing. Parts of Fenland were also used in this way, though the higher coastal siltlands were modified through the creation of drainage systems in order to improve agricultural opportunities within a landscape that was still liable to tidal flooding. A third strategy towards wetland exploitation is reclamation: a major transformation of the natural environment https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/britannia/article/abs/romanobritish-exploitation-of-coastal-wetlands-survey-and-excavation-on-the-north-somerset-levels-19937/5976A1159AF0585E8CF540D01AD6BD4C The autobahn were built primarily with military purposes in mind. I wonder where they got the idea? Roman roads in Britannia were initially designed for military use, they were constructed by the legions during the four centuries that Britannia was a province of the Roman Empire. Some Roman routes form part of the national road network, today. One has, I think, to reflect a little on a time when things got improved in a major way in a relatively short period of time – albeit under Roman occupation – because we are now in a period where things are going into reverse. And deliberately so. The Romans would hold games – somewhat barbaric by ‘today’s standards’ – to entertain the masses. “”“While gladiators have always captured the public imagination, their presence in Britain has been less widely understood. New research has now proven that the spectacles of Rome’s Colosseum were experienced as far away as Colchester.”” https://www.britishmuseum.org/sites/default/files/2024-08/Gladiators-of-Britain.pdf The current elites feed us a constant diet of doom and gloom throughout the spheres “”I’ve dabbled in prepping before, without really realising what I was doing. A fear in the early 2000s that Rimmel might stop making my favourite eyeliner led to me dashing to Boots to buy five. Which is fairly normal, I think? On the spectrum of normal? … The Doomsday Clock is now set at 90 seconds to midnight. Its operators, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, who monitor the combined risks of nuclear annihilation, climate disaster, biological threat and “disruptive technologies”, say we have never been closer to global catastrophic destruction. I’m finally into ‘prepping’ and ready for the apocalypse https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/nov/17/im-finally-into-prepping-and-ready-for-the-apocalypse What will Miliband do for us? To recap… The following SEPP comment is silly on a couple of counts. “There is no explanation on how the heavy CFC molecules get from the surface to the stratosphere. (CCI2F2 [Freon] has an atomic weight of about 121 atomic mass units (amu)).” Gases fill the volume of their container basically due to entropy. Refrigerants are gases. Less volatile gases will migrate (diffuse) more slowly, but mixing occurs in the atmosphere due to winds, thermals, etc. “Atomic” refers to atoms, “molecular” refers to molecules. The molecular weight of a Freon is the sum of its atomic constituents. “According to Matt Ridley, the city of Aragon [actually Zaragoza], Spain, was recently saved by a dam built by the emperor Augustus.” The ancients had good engineers. My uncle was in southern Iraq during WWII. He said he drove his jeep over a stone bridge- a sign next to it said it was built by Alexander the Great! So, why do you think NPR published this bit of news? When will greenhouse gas emissions finally peak? Could be soon “For almost two centuries, greenhouse gas emissions have climbed steadily as humans have burned increasing amounts of oil, gas and coal. Now, climate scientists believe those emissions may finally be reaching a peak…” No time to follow the link yet but I’m guessing its a combo of technologically driven energy efficiency increases, economically driven population growth decreases and wishful thinking. As to why they’d publish a “don’t worry” piece, I think they see the writing on the wall. It’s over? The current temperature spike is about over, so there’s certainly an opportunity to take credit — even is none is due. Okay started reading it… “Studies show emissions must peak and then rapidly decline to limit impacts like more intense heat waves and storms.” Stopped there. “more intense heat waves and storms” Goebbels would be proud of the Climate Fascists. “This “backward” nation has planned 100 space launches for 2024 in its goal to put someone on the Moon by 2030.” I think above words were written intending to be ironic but “Neil Armstrong famously said, “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind” on July 20, 1969, as he became the first person to walk on the moon” That was 55 years ago. The famous American astronaut has been dead for about 8 years. American businessmen have gone to space, because, why not? Going to the moon was a technology goal for days gone by, and now that most people believe it really happened 5 decades ago, the natural response would not be “wow!” but rather “why?” Pushing a rope uphill. https://www.reuters.com/technology/northvolt-files-chapter-11-bankruptcy-us-2024-11-21/ Login Become a WUWT Sponsor - click here Free signup if you want to post comments (includes ads) click here “Walk toward the fire.

Title: A stronger Ozempic is coming. What to know about CagriSema, Novo Nordisk's new weight loss drug
URL: https://qz.com/cagrisema-ozempic-weight-loss-drug-novo-nordisk-1851696433
Time Published: 2024-11-18T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
Novo Nordisk (NVO-2.50%) — the company credited with ushering in the current weight-loss drug revolution when it launched its blockbuster diabetes treatment Ozempic in 2017 — is working on its next act, a weight-loss drug called CagriSema Ozempic works by mimicking a hormone that regulates blood sugar and suppresses appetite. In recent years, it has become highly sought after for its slimming side effects. In response, the Danish pharma giant in 2021 introduced a higher-dose version of Ozempic’s active ingredient, semaglutide, for the specific purpose of weight loss. Since then, demand for these medications has turned Novo Nordisk and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY-0.48%), the maker of competing medications Zepbound and Mounjaro, into the largest pharma companies in the world — potentially paving the way for the first $1 trillion pharma firms. Morgan Stanley (MS+2.48%) analysts anticipate the global market for these highly coveted treatments will reach $105 billion by 2030. Ozempic and prescription weight-loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know Now, the company that started it all is working on a sequel: Novo Nordisk is currently developing an even more potent obesity and diabetes treatment. CagriSema is an experimental drug being developed by Novo Nordisk. It is currently undergoing late-stage clinical trials for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes. The active ingredient of Ozempic and Wegovy is semaglutide, which is known as a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RAs). That means it works by mimicking the gut hormone GLP-1, which promotes the production of insulin, regulates blood sugar levels, slows the emptying of the stomach, and affects the area of the brain that controls satiety. CagriSema combines semaglutide with a dual amylin and calcitonin receptor agonist called cagrilintide — hence the name CagriSema. In addition to mimicking GLP-1, CagriSema mimics two other gut hormones. The first is amylin, a hormone that is co-secreted with insulin in the pancreas. Amylin works a lot like GLP-1 by regulating blood sugar levels, slowing the emptying of the gastrointestinal tract, and promoting satiety. CagriSema also mimics calcitonin, a hormone that regulates calcium levels in the blood. A previous early-stage clinical trial of CagriSema found it helped patients lose an average of 15.6% of their weight over 32 weeks. For comparison, the highest dose of Wegovy led to an average of 15% weight loss after 68 weeks in clinical trials. Novo Nordisk executive president of development Martin Holst Lange recently told analysts he has “confidence” that the larger trials of the drug will show that CagriSema could help users lose up to 25% of their weight. Lange said the company used data from previous trials, including studies that tested cagrilintide on its own, to arrive at this figure. Novo Nordisk is expected to release results for its two phase 3 trials of CagriSema later this year and in the first half of 2025. Depending on the outcome of the results, Novo Nordisk could soon file regulatory applications with health agencies like the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Reviews of these application can take up to a year. In the meantime, Novo Nordisk will be working to make sure they are able to produce enough supply to meet anticipated demand for the new drug. Both Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have been struggling to produce enough of their current weight-loss drugs to meet skyrocketing demand. The pharma giants have since both invested billions to ramp up their manufacturing capacity. If everything goes according to plan, Novo Nordisk could launch CagriSema in the United States and Europe in late 2025 or early 2026.

Title: Nvidia earnings are this week. Here's what Wall Street expects
URL: https://qz.com/nvidia-q3-2024-earnings-ai-chips-blackwell-1851699350
Time Published: 2024-11-18T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
Chip design leader Nvidia (NVDA+0.59%) plans to report earnings for the fiscal third quarter on Wednesday. The chipmaker is expected to report revenues of $33 billion for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet. Net income is expected to be $17.4 billion and earnings per share is expected to be $0.75. Nvidia reported revenues of $30 billion for the second fiscal quarter. The company’s shares are up 204.7% so far this year. Despite beating Wall Street’s expectations with its second-quarter results, the company’s shares fell during after-hours trading and into the morning due to unimpressed investors who sought higher revenue guidance. Nvidia set third-quarter revenue guidance at $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2% — above the average that analysts were expecting, but below top-end estimates. “The market was clearly hoping for another blowout where expectations were pushed up yet again,” Richard Windsor, founder of research company Radio Free Mobile, said in a note. However, Windsor said “Nvidia has much better visibility than it is implying,” and said he expects around $34 billion for the third quarter. Earlier this month, Nvidia again became the most valuable public company in the world after its shares rose, pushing its market cap past Apple’s (AAPL-0.19%). The chipmaker recently announced that Japan’s SoftBank Group (SFTBY-0.25%) will be the first customer to receive its highly anticipated Blackwell artificial intelligence chips. SoftBank plans to build Japan’s most powerful AI supercomputer with Nvidia’s technology. In October, Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said the company had fixed a design flaw that caused delays with producing and shipping Blackwell. “It was functional, but the design flaw caused the yield to be low,” Huang said, according to Reuters. “It was 100% Nvidia’s fault.” The chipmaker worked with its partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM+1.62%) to resolve the engineering setback, Huang said. In August, Nvidia’s stock fell around 8% after a report said Blackwell’s production was delayed due to the flaw, possibly setting deliveries back by three or so months and impacting major customers such as Google (GOOGL-4.71%) and Microsoft (MSFT-0.42%).

Title: Nvidia's Blackwell rack design reportedly faces overheating, potentially delaying shipments
URL: https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20241118PD217/nvidia-blackwell-gpu-design-shipments.html
Time Published: 2024-11-18T08:58:50Z

Credit: Bloomberg Nvidia's upcoming Blackwell GPUs, already delayed to market, are reportedly facing severe overheating issues in high-capacity server racks, raising concerns over deployment timelines. Nvidia has requested suppliers to revise rack designs as concerns mount among data center operators over delayed Blackwell shipments amid AI accelerator shortages. Overheating issues for Nvidia's high-power NVL72 racks Bloomberg, Reuters, and Tom's Hardware, citing The Information, report that Nvidia's NVL72 racks—housing up to 72 Blackwell chips for AI and HPC—face severe overheating issues. These racks consume 120 kW per unit, risking performance degradation and hardware damage. The NVL72 rack, featuring 36 Grace CPUs and 72 Blackwell GPUs, weighs 1.5 tons and consumes up to 132 kW—setting a record for single-server power usage, Businesskorea reports. The overheating problem has reportedly raised customer concerns over disruptions to next-generation AI data center deployments. Nvidia employees, suppliers, and customers have confirmed the issue. Nvidia has requested design changes from suppliers but has not disclosed the names involved. Nvidia downplayed the issue. "Nvidia is working with leading cloud service providers as an integral part of our engineering team and process," an Nvidia spokesperson told Reuters. "The engineering iterations are normal and expected." Blackwell delays: Challenges for Nvidia's 2025 prospects Announced in March 2024 as the successor to the H100 GPUs, Blackwell promises 30x performance gains and up to 25% energy savings on select workloads. Originally set for shipment in late 2024, Blackwell's launch was delayed to early 2025 due to design flaws. These setbacks could disrupt AI data center plans for key clients like Meta, Google, and Microsoft while challenging Nvidia's AI hardware dominance. Analysts stress that Blackwell's success is vital to Nvidia's market leadership, with technical fixes and timely delivery being top priorities. This has led some Wall Street firms to take a more cautious view of Nvidia's 2025 outlook. Wccftech reports that Morgan Stanley initially projected Nvidia would ship up to 450,000 Blackwell GPUs in the fourth quarter of 2024, rising to 700,000–800,000 units in the first quarter of 2025. Raymond James, however, has revised its fourth-quarter estimate to just 100,000 units but remains optimistic about 2025, anticipating strong full-year demand for Blackwell GPUs. The investment bank Jefferies has cautioned that despite Nvidia's strong recent performance, market expectations for its future revenue and profit might be overly ambitious. The bank estimates Nvidia will ship around 6 million GPUs in 2025, below market forecasts. It also projects data center revenue of US$180 billion to US$200 billion, lower than the market average of US$205 billion to US$215 billion. Financial risks amid Blackwell's uncertainty It is still unclear if overheating issues will delay Blackwell's early 2025 launch, but Nvidia has significant stakes in getting it right. Each GB200 Grace Blackwell superchip costs up to US$70,000, while a complete server rack exceeds US$3 million. Nvidia aims to sell 60,000–70,000 servers, making further delays costly for a company now among the world's most valuable due to its dominance in AI. SiliconANGLE cites Holger Mueller of Constellation Research, who stresses that cooling is vital for AI platforms as high-powered chips risk damage at elevated temperatures. Nvidia has acknowledged the issue but has not clarified its severity. "The questions are how expensive will this be to fix, and how long will it take?" Mueller said. "Blackwell is by far the most compelling platform for generative AI, so customers have no choice but to sit tight and wait for a fix. The duration of that wait will determine if there's any impact on Nvidia's sky-high stock price." Mueller added that Blackwell remains the most compelling generative AI platform, leaving customers no choice but to wait. The length of that wait could affect Nvidia's stock price.

At the interbank foreign exchange, the rupee opened at 84.42 and touched the intra-day high of 84.37 against the greenback during the session.

This will relieve buyers in India. We are amid a wedding season, and gold buying is key to wedding celebrations. Gold prices are falling largely due to the rising inflation in the US that has dimmed hopes of a rate cut by the US Fed. Gold prices tend to rise in a low interest rate regime, hopes of a rate cut fading and a rising US Dollar is keeping prices lower. The rising US Dollar makes buying gold more expensive, thereby impacting demand. The fall in the price of gold in India has put it on par with key global markets. The prices in key Middle-East countries are elevated due to the rising geopolitical tensions between Israel, Palestine, Iran, and Ukraine, Russia. Gold prices are expected to trade at current levels in the short to medium term. Prices will eventually recover to their recent highs as geopolitical tensions fade, and interest rates are softened by the US Fed and the RBI in the first half of CY25.” Nippon India Mutual Fund has launched two new passive funds on Nifty auto and realty indices.

Market participants reacted to reports suggesting that President Biden’s administration has allowed Ukraine to use U.S.-made weapons to strike deep into Russia, in a significant reversal of Washington’s policy in the Ukraine-Russia conflict. On data front, U.S. retail sales increased slightly more than expected in October, highlighting the economy’s resilience. US headline inflation also was reported better than expectations at 2.6% raising questions over Fed’s rate cut stance ahead. Governor Powell comments and few other U.S. central bank officials are expected speak this week.

The decline was primarily attributed to a drop in Foreign Currency Assets, while gold reserves saw an increase. Despite this dip, India maintains its position as the fourth largest holder of foreign exchange reserves globally. 2)India’s retail inflation accelerated to a 14-month high of 6.21 per cent on an annual basis in October, quickening from 5.49 per cent in the previous month and breaching the central bank’s tolerance ceiling, primarily driven by persisting high food prices. Food inflation, which makes up around half of the overall Consumer Price Index (CPI) basket, surged to 10.87 per cent in October, up from 9.24 percent in the previous month. Rural inflation also quickened to 6.68 per cent, compared to 5.87 per cent in September, while urban inflation rose to 5.62 per cent from 5.05 per cent the previous month 3)India’s industrial output rebounded in September, growing 3.1%, after contracting 0.1% in August - a 22-month low - driven by a favourable base effect and pre-festive season stocking that boosted manufacturing, official data released on Tuesday showed. For the quarter ending September, IIP growth was at a seven-quarter low of 2.6% due to high base effect and weather vagaries. The growth was 4% in the first half of the current financial year, down from 6.2% in the corresponding period last year. 4)India’s Wholesale Price Index (WPI)-based inflation increased in October to a four-month high of 2.36 per cent from 1.84 per cent in September, primarily on the back of a spike in the prices of food items, particularly vegetables. Inflation in wholesale food prices increased to 13.54 per cent during the month. 5)India’s merchandise exports in Oct rose by an impressive 17.3%, highest in over two years, to $39.2 billion, while the trade deficit widened to $27.1 billion. According to govt data released on Thursday, imports increased by 3.9% to $66.3 billion in Oct compared to $63.9 billion in the year-ago period. A key highlight is the performance of non-petroleum and non-gems exports, a crucial indicator of India’s manufacturing health. These exports jumped 27.7% to $31.36 billion in October. The trade deficit (gap between imports and exports) narrowed as compared to $30.4 billion recorded in Oct last year. 6)India’s outward FDI commitments rose to $3.24 billion in October 2024, compared to $2.55 billion in October 2023 but declined from $3.77 billion in September 2024, according to RBI data. Equity commitments stood at $655.84 million in October 2024, down from $993.35 million a year earlier and $817.64 million in the previous month. Debt commitments surged to $1.24 billion, significantly higher than $248.4 million in October 2023 and $1.16 billion in September 2024. Guarantees remained steady at $1.33 billion in October 2024, compared to $1.31 billion a year ago, but were lower than $1.79 billion in September 2024. Outbound FDI includes equity, loans, and guarantees. 7)India’s merchandise exports are likely to grow 1.85% year-on-year to $107.5 billion in the third quarter of FY25, led by sustained momentum in economic activity and improving demand prospects in trading partners supported by expected global monetary easing, India Exim Bank said on Tuesday. Non-oil exports are forecast to grow 7.39% a year to $91.7 billion, while non-oil and non-gems and jewellery exports are forecast to amount $82.7 billion, with 7.8% growth. 8)India’s net direct tax collection grew 15.4 per cent year on year to Rs 12.1 lakh crore during the period April 1-November 10. Direct taxes include corporate and personal tax. It grew over 21 per cent to Rs 15 lakh crore, up 21.20 per cent, on a gross basis during the period, a statement issued by the income tax department said. This includes net corporate tax of Rs 5.10 lakh crore and non-corporate taxes of Rs 6.62 lakh crore. Other taxes worth Rs 35,923 crore were mopped up. 9)India’s Securities Transaction Tax (STT) collection has surged to ₹36,000 crore between April and November 2024, nearing 97% of the current fiscal year’s budget estimate of ₹37,000 crore. 10)Foreigners have sold 82.1 billion rupees ($973 million) of Indian government bonds, which are part of the JPMorgan index, so far in November, according to clearing house data on Thursday. A rise in U.S. yields along with a stronger dollar have driven the selling, traders and analysts said. 11)To facilitate ease of onboarding of Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) and reduce duplication, SEBI will allow FPI applicants to fill either a full Common Application Form (CAF) or an abridged version with pre-filled data from the depository system, effective three months from the circular date. Applicants must consent to use and verify the accuracy of the pre-filled data, with updates allowed as needed. This aims to streamline the process, especially for FPIs like sub-funds or schemes under Investment Managers, whose information is already in the CAF module. 12)RBI and SEBI have introduced a framework allowing Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) to reclassify their investments as Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) once they exceed the 10% ownership threshold in an Indian company. This offers FPIs the choice to either divest or reclassify their holdings, with necessary approvals. The reclassified investments will remain FDI even if the ownership falls below 10%. This change is expected to encourage foreign investments, especially in startups and mid-cap firms, while introducing tax obligations and approval timelines 13)Indian corporates, including non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), filed proposals in September 2024 to raise $4.84 billion through External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs), according to RBI data. Of the total, $3.77 billion is planned via the automatic route, while $1.06 billion is sought through the approval route. This highlights the continued reliance on ECBs for funding amid evolving market conditions. 14)Motilal Oswal Financial Services (MOSL) reported that the total number of demat accounts in India reached 179 million as of October 2024. However, new account additions experienced a dip, with 3.5 million accounts added in October 2024 compared to the average monthly additions of 3.9 million year-to-date for FY25. 15)The monthly mutual fund SIP crossed the Rs 25,000 crore mark for the first time in October and stood at Rs 25,323 crore against Rs 24,509 crore in September. The mutual fund folios were at all-time highs of 21,65,02,804 in October. The retail mutual fund folios, which include equity, hybrid, and solution-oriented schemes, were also at an all-time high at 17,23,52,296 for October as compared to 16,81,61,366 for September. 16)Moody’s Ratings on Friday forecast a 7.2 per cent GDP growth for India in 2024, saying the Indian economy is in a sweet spot, but inflation risks may prompt the RBI to retain a relatively tight monetary policy this year. Moody’s said that despite the near-term uptick, retail inflation should moderate toward the Reserve Bank’s target in the coming months as food prices ease amid higher sowing and adequate food grain buffer stocks. 17)The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation witnessed a 7.6% jump in number of contributing members in 2023-24 at 73.7million compared to 68.5 million in the preceding years while the number of contributing establishments went up by 6.6% to 0.76 million as against 0.71 million in 2022-23, shows the draft annual report of EPFO for 2023-24. 18)India’s bilateral trade with China stood at $10.7 billion during October, witnessing 0.46 per cent contraction amid a slowdown in the neighbouring country, commerce department data showed. The contraction was mainly driven by exports as outbound shipments to China contracted 9.5 per cent at $1.15 billion, even as India’s overall exports bounced back in October and saw a double-digit growth of 17 per cent. 19)State Bank of India (SBI) has increased its marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) by 5 basis points in three tenors – three months, six months and one year. With effect from November 15, the MCLR for three months and six months will be 8.55 per cent (8.50 per cent earlier) and 8.90 per cent (8.85 per cent), respectively. WORLD 1)In a monthly report on Tuesday, OPEC revised its global oil demand growth forecasts downward for 2024 and 2025, citing weaker demand in China, India, and other regions. The 2024 growth estimate was reduced to 1.82 million barrels per day (bpd) from 1.93 million bpd in October, marking the fourth consecutive downgrade. The 2025 forecast was cut to 1.54 million bpd from 1.64 million bpd. 2)In his recent speech, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated that the U.S. economy does not indicate an immediate need to lower interest rates, reaffirming the Fed’s commitment to achieving a 2% inflation target. Powell highlighted strong economic performance, a solid labor market, and the gradual normalization of housing services inflation. The Fed projects core PCE inflation to rise to 2.8% in October from 2.7% in September. He emphasized a cautious approach to policy adjustments and reiterated the Fed’s apolitical stance, stating that decisions are not influenced by political considerations. Powell also noted the Fed’s preparation to use emergency tools in case of financial instability. 3)America’s national debt has surpassed $36 trillion for the first time in its history, the US Debt Clock – a website monitoring the nation’s finances in real time reported on Friday. The figure grew by nearly 6% from January to November, increasing by $1 trillion in less than four months. In late July, the US Treasury announced that it had surpassed $35 trillion. 4)The US consumer price index increased to 315.66 points in October, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which increased from 315.30 points in September. 5)Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 217,000 for the week ended Nov. 9, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 223,000 claims for the latest week. 6)The annual inflation rate in the US accelerated to 2.6% in October 2024, up from 2.4% in September which was the lowest rate since February 2021, marking the first increase in inflation in seven months. On a monthly basis, CPI rose by 0.2%, consistent with the previous three months. The annual core consumer price inflation rate stood at a three-month high of 3.3%, unchanged from the previous month. 7)The US producer price index for final demand rose 0.2% in October after an upwardly revised 0.1% gain in September, the Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI climbing 0.2% following a previously reported unchanged reading in September. 8)October retail sales grew from the prior month, reflecting continued resilience in the American consumer. Retail sales rose 0.4% in October. Economists had expected a 0.3% rise in spending, according to Bloomberg data. Meanwhile, retail sales in September were revised up to a 0.8% increase from a prior reading that showed a 0.4% increase in the month, according to Census Bureau data. Auto sales drove a majority of the gains in October’s reading, with sales in the sector rising 1.6%. 9)The U.S. budget deficit jumped nearly four-fold to $257 billion in October, a figure inflated by one-off factors, the Treasury Department said on Wednesday in a report that started off a new fiscal year with a big hole to be turned over to President-elect Donald Trump in January. The Treasury said the October deficit was up 287% from the $67 billion deficit in October 2023, but calendar adjustments in benefit payments had cut that month’s deficit nearly in half. 10)In November, the ZEW Economic Sentiment Index for the eurozone declined from 20.1 points in October to 12.5, missing the market’s expected figure of 20.1. Similarly, views on the eurozone’s current situation fell, with the index decreasing by 3.0 points to -43.8. 11)In September 2024, the Eurozone’s industrial production decreased by 2.8% year-on-year (YoY), compared to the same month in 2023. This was more than the 2.0% drop that economist had predicted. 12)In the third quarter of 2024, seasonally adjusted GDP increased by 0.4%8 in the euro area and by 0.3% the EU, compared with the previous quarter, according to a flash estimate published by Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union. The employment *increased by 1.0% in the euro area and by 0.8% in the EU in the third quarter of 2024, after +0.9% in both areas in the second quarter of 2024. 13)The United Kingdom’s (UK) ILO Unemployment Rate ticked up to 4.3% in the three months to September, following 4.0% in August, the data published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed on Tuesday. The market expected a 4.1% reading in the reported period. 14)In September 2024, the UK’s trade deficit widened to £3.46 billion, up from £2.02 billion in August. Goods imports fell by £3.0 billion (6.3%), with declines in both EU and non-EU imports, while goods exports dropped by 5.8% to a 28-month low of £68.20 billion. Services imports rose slightly by £0.2 billion (0.8%), whereas services exports declined by £0.1 billion (0.3%), contributing to the overall trade imbalance. 15)UK gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have increased by 0.1% in Quarter 3 (July to Sept) 2024, following growth of 0.5% in Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2024. GDP is estimated to have increased by 1.0% in Quarter 3 2024, compared with the same quarter a year ago. 16)Industrial Production in the UK Decreased by 0.5% (MoM) in September. Monthly production output was estimated to have decreased by 0.5% in September 2024; this follows a decrease of 0.7% in July 2024 and an increase of 0.5% in August 2024. 17)Manufacturing Production in the United Kingdom decreased 0.70 percent in September of 2024 over the same month in the previous year. Manufacturing Production in the United Kingdom averaged 1.86 percent from 1950 until 2024, reaching an all-time high of 35.50 percent in April of 2021 and a record low of -20.50 percent in April of 2020 18)The Bank of Japan said on Wednesday the preliminary Producer Price Index rose 3.4 percent from the same month last year. That compares to a 3.1 percent increase in September. The costs of goods traded between companies in Japan were up in October. This was due mainly to higher prices of rice and copper. Monthly, producer prices rose by 0.2%, beating consensus of a flat reading and following an upwardly revised 0.3% gain in September. 19)Japan’s economy expanded by an annualized 0.9% over the July-September quarter, government data showed on Friday, slowing from the previous three months due to tepid capital spending though an unexpected pickup in consumption added a bright spot. 20)Industrial Production in China increased 5.30 percent in October of 2024 over the same month in the previous year. Industrial Production in China averaged 11.04 percent from 1990 until 2024, reaching an all-time high of 35.10 percent in January of 2021 and a record low of -21.10 percent in January of 1990. The Indian CGD sector outlook has become murkier with further APM gas allocation cut by the Government/nodal agency (GAIL). IGL/MGL has reported 20%/18% additional cuts wef 16-Nov on top of the ~20% cut earlier on 16-Oct, while Adani Total Gas (not rated) has indicated a 13% cut. While structural decline in APM allocation for the CGD sector is inevitable, the significant ~35% cut in the last one month with no proper policy communication is a negative. CGD companies highlighted post-Q2FY25 that the October cut was a major one with gradual cuts likely hereon and that prices would be hiked post-festive season to partially recover lost margins. However, no action has been seen so far and with this additional cut, the margin outlook has deteriorated with no near-term clarity on the course of action. Media reports quoting MOPNG officials have stated GoI asking for cost breakup, highlighting the high margins of CGDs vs OMCs, before green signaling them for retail price hikes (at least Rs4.5-5/kg required), which could add to negative sentiments. In the absence of price hikes, we estimate a 46%/25% hit on IGL/MGL’s EBITDA/scm vs Q2 run-rate which is Rs3.5/8 and against the latest guidance of Rs6-7/10-12, and our earlier estimate of Rs6.7-6.9/10.5-10.8. Excise duty alignment between CNG, petrol and diesel can be done to avoid CNG price hikes amid a USD70-75/bbl oil price scenario, if the current margins and return ratios of CGDs are to be protected. Due to the lack of clarity, we now assume a 14% RoE model for both IGL/MGL (in line with original open access regulations) vs 17%/18% earlier estimated for FY26-27E and cut our SA EPS by 17%/25%. Our TP for IGL/MGL reduces 18%/26% to Rs385/1,400 and we downgrade IGL/MGL to REDUCE/ADD from Add/Buy earlier. We await further commentary from companies and GoI to assume a less conservative scenario. IGL is currently trading at 2.3-2.6x FY25-26E adjusted P/B and MGL at 1.7-1.8x, which at 14% sustainable RoE and potential 7-10% volume growth seems reasonable.

The outlook for Zomato is bullish. The stock has surged over 8 per cent last week. This marks the end of the corrective fall that was in place since the last week of September this year. It also indicates that a new leg of upmove has begun. Moving average cross overs on the daily chart also strengthens the bullish case. Immediate support is at ₹263. Below that ₹255-₹250 is a very strong support zone. Zomato share price can rise to ₹300-₹310 in the coming weeks. The fall last week in the benchmark indices were more in line with our expectation. There is some support near current levels. So, the chance of a corrective bounce in the near term is a possibility. However, the trend is still down and so the upside is likely to be capped. Sensex, Nifty and the Nifty Bank index have room to fall more from here. But from a long-term perspective, the fall from here could be the last leg of this correction.

Fuel gauge's red needle indicating empty gas tank o The whipsaw action in the stock market over the past two weeks likely has some investors looking for a personal injury attorney. The strong buying after the election results confirmed the bullish intermediate trend for stock prices as the fear of missing out (FOMO) seemed to be the dominant sentiment. According to last week’s survey from the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII), the bullish % rose to 49.8% from 41.5% the prior month as the neutral camp dropped from 30.9% to 21.8%. It was interesting that the bearish % rose slightly to 28.3% from the prior reading of 27.6%. This week’s numbers will be interesting. As last week progressed and proposed cabinet members were announced the sentiment seemed to shift to one of fear as nervous investors or traders tried to hypothesize what could happen to various stocks, sectors or the economy in 2025 if the promised plans were actually implemented. The selling on Friday was led by tech shares as the six widely followed most valuable tech shares including Apple, Meta, Amazon, Nvidia, Alphabet and Microsoft lost $458 billion. Nvidia reports earnings on Wednesday. Markets For the week the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) were the weakest down 4.6% despite the inflationary fears of some economists. The small-cap iShares Russell 2000 (IWM) lost 4.1%. The Nadaq 100 Index dropped 3.4% which was 1.3% more than the S&P 500’s loss of 2.1%. The Dow Jones Utility Average was able to gain 0.2%. Even as the week started the high-margin debt, price-to-sales ratio and Bloomberg Intelligence noted that apparently, analysts are scaling back their forecasts for “earning growth over the next year.” Something they call earning-revision-momentum “has slumped to negative territory.” This is apparently based on analysts' expectations for future earnings from the company report or their commentary. This in my view is very soft data. The negative earnings forecasts in both 2023 and 2024 kept many out of the stock market. In the current quarter, S&P 500 profits are expected to be 8.5% higher, double the estimate at the start of the earnings season. The hard data numbers from last week’s trading were not as negative as some of the price action since on the NYSE there were 803 advancing issues and 2066 declining. But on Friday’s plunge, only 27% of the S&P 500 stocks closed lower while 78% were higher on November 5th. The NDX 100 numbers were more negative as 80% were down Friday with 70% higher on the 5th. There has been some weakening in both the weekly and daily advance/decline lines. However, at this point is not a sign that the bull market is ending or that a bear market is imminent. Over the next few weeks, it may have more implications for traders than investors. SPY Weekly The weekly SPY decline did overlap about 50% of the prior week’s range but that does not complete a classic top formation. The 20-week EMA is rising strongly at $552.33 and it would be expected to be flattening or declining if a significant top was being formed. The QPivot is at $552.91 and a weekly close below this level would be more negative. The September lows are in the $540 area. The S&P 500 Advance/Decline made a new high the week of October 18th and did not make a new high the week of the election. Therefore a bearish divergence has been formed but a drop below the prior low is needed to confirm the divergence. A close below its WMA will indicate that the S&P 500 is ready to move sideways to lower as we head into the end of the year. If the selling does not increase this week then the market is likely to hold the pre-election lows before turning higher. In my experience, the major trend of the stock market is like a supertanker as it takes time to change direction. Bouts of heavy selling on future expectations or concerns in a bull market are frequently later acknowledged as just corrections in the major. Brexit Decline Some of you may remember how the stock market reacted to the Brexit referendum in June 2023 as the United Kingdom voted to leave the EU. There was a panic decline for two days that dropped the S&P 5.7% as there was wild conjecture about what it might do to the EU as well as the world economy. Just eight days later the S&P had rallied to a new high as investors realized that the impact of the vote could not be a reality until the next year. The current situation shares some similarities as if the proposed cabinet members take over their departments in early 2025 their new policy will take time to be implemented. Any future changes for a company like General Dynamics (GD) that had revenue and net income growth of over 10% in its last report did not seem to warrant last week's 7% decline. I think investors who were not panicked into selling last week in reaction to the worst-case scenarios may start to consider buying. SPY Daily This does not mean that investors or traders can ignore some of last week’s warning signs. I employ a version of the weight of the evidence approach that I learned from Stan Weinstein, a legendary technical analyst, who also developed stage analysis. The daily chart of SPY has major support in the $563 area, line a, and the July high. The chart includes both the daily S&P 500 A/D line as well as the NYSE All A/D line that covers all issues traded on the NYSE. Both A/D lines have been in solid uptrend for most of the year but both made new highs on October 18th before correcting ahead of the election. The S&P 500 held above the early October lows before moving sharply higher in reaction to the election. The A/D numbers post-election were not strong enough to take the A/D lines above the prior highs. The S&P 500 Advance/Decline line failed to make a new high on November 11th and then dropped back below its EMA. This created a negative or bearish divergence, line b. This would be confirmed by a decline below the recent lows as that would start a new downtrend (lower high and lower lows) There is longer-term support at line c. The NYSE All A/D line shows a similar negative divergence, line d, even though it has different components. The late October lows in the NYSE All A/D line were a bit lower which is a negative sign that favors further weakness. Included in my weight of the evidence is also the NYSE Stocks Only advance/decline line as well as those for the Russell 2000, Dow Industrials, and the Nasdaq 100. This tech-heavy index is tracked by the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) which has been a leader for much of the bull market. Invesco QQQ Trust QQQ did close Friday below the mid-point of the prior weekly bar at $499 with the positively rising 20-week EMA at $481.43. The weekly starc- band is at $459.57. The Nasdaq 100 A/D line did make a new high a week ago so no divergences were formed. It is still in a weekly uptrend and above its WMA. The A/D line staged an upside breakout in September, line b, which was a sign of strength. The extent of the current decline may depend on the bond market which will be the focus of a new article this week. The extent of some declines last week reinforces the necessity of using stops on all trading positions. I use wider stops on existing investment positions. Those who are concerned about any trading positions after last week I would consider using stops under the most recent low if the market moves higher early in the week. A violation of last week’s lows after a bounce will increase the odds of further selling. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Banks are grappling with a scam ‘crisis’ while Facebook profits from it

The CEOs of two major New Zealand banks say Facebook is rife with fraud – and that Meta is too busy making money from scam ads to try and stop them. Duncan Greive reports. The story would have been dystopian a few years ago, but is now routine, almost unremarkable. A pensioner sees an advertisement starring prime minister Chris Luxon, encouraging investment in cryptocurrency. Within weeks she transfers over $200,000 through a series of accounts and exchanges. Only too late realising she’s been caught by sophisticated scammers, and that the money will never return. It ran on the cover of the Herald on Sunday on October 20. The victim’s name is Jill Creasy, a Taranaki grandmother. The story was broken by Lane Nichols, who has spent much of the last year detailing the excruciating impacts of the scam economy. Creasy told Nichols, “first of all I felt angry and then I felt foolish, then I felt really ashamed.” The story mentions TSB, her bank, nine times. It mentions Facebook, the platform where it all began, just once. This is a microcosm of how we view the issue as a country – it’s a problem for the person being defrauded, and for their bank. For Facebook, which ran the ads in question, it’s a profit centre. Running scams on Facebook featuring a fake celebrity has been a huge business for years – in 2018, it was often Facebook founder Mark Zuckerbeg himself with the favoured currency iTunes gift cards. Now it’s most often Elon Musk and crypto. As Dylan Reeve reported for The Spinoff in August, the decaying but still widely used platform seems to make no real effort to pull down scam ads, even when users make repeated attempts to inform the company of its dangerous, fraudulent and defamatory advertising. Reeve details dozens of attempts to report clear scams, featuring impersonations of celebrities and news sites, only to be told “the page doesn’t go against our Community Standards”. This goes for regular users, but also for banks, at least one of which spent months reporting a scam ad featuring its logo, ultimately giving up due to a lack of response from Facebook. It’s part of a vast scam ecosystem running in New Zealand, one which the government’s New Zealand Cyber Security Centre estimates costs us $3.8m per week, close to $200m per year. The rise of deepfakes, and the way generative AI has made technology far more accessible to scammers, has seen a sharp rise in both the volume and sophistication of scams. These range from simple Facebook Marketplace fraud, to elaborate cons run from offshore. And because Facebook is a place all major corporations and government departments show up for everything from advertising to customer experience, many users have trouble distinguishing advertising and legitimate communication from scammers. Those running banks in New Zealand don’t dispute that they have a crucial role to play in stopping scams. They say they have doubled investment, and introduced significant new controls and reporting channels which have helped prevent the problem from growing further. But they feel strongly that Meta, the parent company of Facebook, is completely indifferent to the harm it’s visiting upon its own users and the banks’ customers. Their statements are unusually strong, for the normally mild language of corporations – particularly those which interact with one another, on advertising or as bank clients, every day. “For a company that’s amongst the most valuable in the world, with an absolute black belt in creating algorithms that drive behaviour, I cannot for life of me understand how Meta wouldn’t be able to be amongst the most effective at blocking this type of thing,” says Kiwibank CEO Steve Jurkovich. Meta makes enormous investments in AR, VR and AI – yet banks say they cannot get a response from Meta, and claim no substantive engagement on solving scams. Westpac CEO Catherine McGrath concurs. “They’re making money out of placing the fake ads, and with all the tools and expertise and cash that they’ve got, they’re not responding to try and find the needle in a haystack. To say, ‘how do we immediately close that down?’” Meta refused to be interviewed for this story, but provided a statement. “The safety of our users is of utmost importance. We continue to invest in new ways to stop scammers and deepen our collaborative efforts with industry partners including the banks, the government and law enforcement on this important issue.” (Both CEOs I spoke to strongly reject this characterisation – they describe the relationship as essentially non-existent.) Meta also provided various information around its efforts to prevent scams, including that it is testing new technology to detect when public figures are used in advertising, though that clearly has arrived too late for many victims. It says that advertisers now “may be asked” to provide a phone number before placing an ad. The Meta spokesperson noted that it has invested US$20bn in “teams and technology to enhance safety”. It’s a large figure, but less impressive in context – since 2021, Meta has spent more than twice as much on creating its largely unused “metaverse”, and over US$90bn on stock buybacks, designed to inflate its share price. Its ability to spend on engineering to counter scams is essentially limitless – Meta’s sales increased 19% year-on-year, but profits leapt by 35% over the same period, to US$15bn for its most recent quarter. What the bank CEOs are saying is that failure to fix the issue is a choice. And that while their profits are highly scrutinised, they are dwarfed by those of Meta. To this point, there has been little pressure on Facebook for its role in the scam chain. When a customer is defrauded, news media, politicians, agencies and the public typically focus on the banks. (This is starting to change in news media – recently Nichols diligently interrogated Facebook’s role in a follow up to the original story about Creasy’s losses.) Politicians remain fixated on banks. Consumer affairs minister Andrew Bayly has largely targeted them during his first year in the portfolio. He has been withering in his criticism and firm in his expectations that they do more to prevent fraud. He wrote an open letter earlier this year, urging them “to take immediate and concerted action to enhance your processes and protections to better safeguard your customers from scams and fraud.” The banks, fighting negative publicity on multiple fronts, have heard the message, says Jurkovich. Bayly says one of his requests – confirmation of payee, which matches account holder’s name to the account number – is now being rolled out, and should be system-wide by Easter (a representative for the Banking Association says this was already in motion when Bayly made his request). Jurkovich says the big banks’ leadership now meets weekly to share information about scams, and has made significant progress over the past year, with more attempts but lower losses as a result – Westpac says it recovers $9 for every $10 either stolen or attempted. All this has come at a significant cost, according to Jurkovich. “[Kiwibank has] tripled our investment to try and lift our capabilities, from what I think were pretty good, to trying to be much better. Because, of course, the threat has gone up heaps… In terms of the dollars involved across the industry, I’ll be amazed if they haven’t doubled in the last six to 12 months.” McGrath talks about fraud and scams in terms of an on ramp and an off ramp – in business terms, you might call it the difference between lead generation and sales. “How do customers get entangled in the first place? The on ramp would tend to be social media. It could be coming through your phone in terms of text. Less often now it’s somebody approaching you in person, because we’re all quite leery about somebody doing something like that. “Banks, in my view, are the off ramp. with a payment mechanism and payment rails. The banks are doing a massive amount of work to try and find the needle in the haystack out of the millions of payments that we make every day.” What is the equivalent work being done on the social media side? It’s “almost nonexistent”, says McGrath. The CEOs of major banks are not typically sympathetic characters within New Zealand. There is currently an inquiry into banking competition before the finance select committee, in part due to record profits which seem almost impervious to the economic cycle. The AFR reported that the big four Australian-owned banks generated $7.4bn in profits last financial year, for a return on equity of 13.4% – making ours by some measures amongst the most profitable banking sectors in the world. Investment banker Andrew Body typifies the view of some that the banks are regulated into extreme conservatism and avoidance of true competition, describing the sector as an “oligopoly” mired in “stasis”. The thesis is that the status quo reduces the kind of risk tolerant lending our business sector needs, and slows the advance of competition through the likes of open banking. The fact the CEOs mention that open banking competitors would struggle to match their investment in scam detection might back up the view that they are resistant to more competition. Banks are also hardly blameless in the scam ecosystem. Nichols’ superb reporting for the NZ Herald has revealed eye-watering failures from banks, including a Westpac customer who lost $200,000 after being wrongly assured an account was in his name, and a Kiwibank customer who lost $300,000 months after an FMA warning about this type of scam. All the major banks have experienced failures of process which have seen victims lose massive sums. Given they make enormous profits, their patchy record on reimbursement makes their claims to be victims too hard to square. Still, the reason we have so much knowledge and visibility of banks’ business is that banking is one of the most regulated activities in New Zealand. Banks are overseen by the Reserve Bank at a top level, and by the Financial Markets Authority at a product level, with an Ombudsman who can be appealed to when the public is unsatisfied with the banks’ response. This is because we recognise that holding money, loaning money, investing money and earning interest on your customers’ money are all activities which require extreme levels of caution. It’s a result of decades of careful thinking – and of them being born at a time when the government had a far more muscular sense of its role in business and society. By contrast, search and social media arose during a global period in which regulation was a dirty word. There was a sincere belief that the nascent internet of the early 90s was a fragile, beautiful thing, which could be crushed by an excess of rules. Into that vacuum were born companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook. Starting small, they became leviathans. This was because they built incredible products, but also because there were no specific rules to restrain them. That remains largely true – particularly in New Zealand. One example of this is advertising, the source of well over a billion dollars in combined annual revenue for Google and Meta. Where traditional media’s clients are highly vetted, and there are significant penalties and outcry when real or perceived violation of codes occurs, there is no similar oversight or consequence for search or social media advertising. All this helps explain why we have come to accept that frauds and scams which originate through Facebook posts and advertising are a problem for banks, but a profit centre for Facebook. Last week, ASB chair Dame Therese Walsh sounded a warning during a select committee hearing on banking competition. “They are not required to fully participate in New Zealand society. Pay taxes, employ people, meet the rules and regulations, et cetera. That is actually a big concern of the way we’re going, that it’s going to be really difficult if we don’t create a level playing field.” She was talking, with some self-interest, about new entrants into the open banking sector. However what she says perfectly describes the operating conditions for giant social media companies too. Kiwibank says 40% of scams originate on social media, largely Facebook – by far the biggest single source. Westpac puts the number at 30%, though says it’s a conservative estimate, as a customer can be unaware of how they became a target, giving up their email address or phone number innocently, only to have it used for something malicious. Singapore has more specific notification requirements, and says that fully 50% of scams originate on Meta platforms. The top two scams, according to Westpac, are both relatively low dollar – “fraudulent e-commerce” is the most common, followed by “classifieds / goods / services / marketplace scams”. E-commerce fraud is in some ways the original sin of internet scams. It often involves someone misusing someone else’s credit card number to make purchases for themself. The credit card number might be obtained in bulk after a hack on the dark web, or through a fake site which convinces a user to input their credit card details, potentially through a Facebook ad. The second category is a more recent, and faster growing phenomenon. “There’s really low due diligence to sell something on Facebook Marketplace,” says Jurkovich. “So anyone can go on there and report to be selling something. And Meta’s response to it has been zero.” McGrath agrees, pointing out that this growth area impacts young people, and is likely wildly underreported. “We tend to think that scams impact older people. The Marketplace type scams more impact young people, right? And it’s for small amounts, but it’s for a higher frequency.” Marketplace is a product that competes with the likes of TradeMe in New Zealand – but lacks many of the guardrails which exist there, such as a list of feedback and transaction history. Wired reported earlier this year that it has become awash with phishing links, whereby users will send a fake link to a transfer site like Zelle in order to fraudulently capture the seller’s bank details. It also exists on the other side of the transaction – a study by Lloyds bank says Marketplace is the biggest global source of scam tickets to live events. The fact of it being small dollar amounts makes it very difficult for the bank to flag them as suspicious, as they appear indistinguishable from regular day-to-day transactions. Adding to the issue is the fact that the so-called “mule” accounts associated with the scams can have the appearance of legitimacy. McGrath says a typical source would be an international student leaving at the end of study, selling the account they have used while here to a scammer. It has a three year history of ordinary, legitimate transactions, before becoming the basis for scams. Investment scams rank fifth in Westpac’s list of the most common categories – but because of their scale can be the source of the most troubling stories, like that of Taranaki pensioner Jill Creasy I mentioned at the beginning. Jurkovich and McGrath both cite a huge acceleration in the volume and sophistication of such scams. McGrath says that what is making this more difficult is that the quality of the scammers and the digital infrastructure they deploy is increasing all the time. Where once a fake bank site or email was characterised by grainy graphics and frequent typos, now they can be near-indistinguishable from the real thing. The same goes for those who get a prospective victim on the phone – Jurkovich says they have studied the scripts of bank employees, and they will coach customers to give the right answers to bank workers questioning a transaction. “Where scams are really hard, is I can’t look for any markers that say it’s not you moving the money, because it is you moving the money,” says McGrath. “You think you’re doing the right thing. However, you’ve been bamboozled by somebody… Nobody wants to be on the receiving end of somebody saying, ‘I’ve lost my life savings’. We say, what could we have feasibly done?” For banks that have spent years trying to create strong digital products and reduce friction, they’re now contemplating introducing more of it – most prominently confirmation of payee, matching account names to numbers. This will certainly interrupt some types of fraud, but it’s common for an investment fraudster to invent a story about why a transaction needs to go into a particular account to “cool off” before reaching its destination. So no one in banking believes it to be a total solution. Social media is not the only place fraud happens. In recent years there has been a proliferation of SMS-based fraud, with messages purporting to be from banks, NZTA, Customs or the IRD, containing a short-code link to a website. For a period of time, these were arriving almost weekly. To send them, all a scammer needed was a large list of phone numbers, and use one of a number of different text marketing services or devices to widely distribute their phishing link. In this case these numbers were ultimately associated with particular New Zealand cell connections, typically with accounts at Spark, One NZ or 2 Degrees – the big three telecommunications providers. According to Jurkovich, the contrast between such companies and Meta could not be more stark. “It’s almost the complete opposite, which is a real willingness to share capability, real willingness to share knowledge. No bunfight between Spark, 2 Degrees and One NZ – they recognise that they have to lift their capability in unison.” The heads of the telecommunications companies have sometimes joined bank CEOs on their scam prevention calls, according to Jurkovich, who says it’s a clear indication of the seriousness with which they view the issue. And a stark contrast with Facebook. Like banking, telecommunications is an area in which competition, pricing and consumer outcomes are highly scrutinised, with regular market studies, and the motherlode which was the separation of Telecom from Chorus in the 2000s. Beyond the regulatory regime, Jurkovich says it’s also about how accessible the New Zealand businesses are. “​​I think it is as simple in some ways as you know, we’re on the high street and we’re easy to find. You know, where do you go to find Meta in New Zealand? They’re everywhere and nowhere.” That extends to the government too. Who exactly is charged with overseeing the social media companies? We have a minister for racing, a minister for arts, a minister for sports – even a minister for space. Yet even figuring out which minister oversees social media is difficult. A few years ago I asked then-broadcasting minister Willie Jackson who he thought was responsible for the social giants. “I guess it’s me,” he replied. Last week I asked DPMC, the all-powerful group which sits behind the prime minister and cabinet. They told me it was internal affairs minister and Act deputy leader Brooke Van Velden. I requested an interview, only to be told that “after discussions here, we’ve realised this is one for the minister of commerce and consumer affairs, Hon Andrew Bayly.” It feels telling that as far as social media goes – among the most influential developments in the history of the internet – the government still isn’t quite sure who is in charge. Bayly has only been given the specific responsibility of social media within the scams context in the last few weeks. I spoke to him for half an hour on a Friday morning, and he stressed that he had been working hard to get up to speed on its role in scams. He says his preference is for a multilateral approach, largely because he fears for our ability to legislate in isolation. “The unfortunate thing is, they are obviously a global company, and New Zealand’s a very small part of that pie.” The perception that it is too large, and New Zealand too small, is to Facebook’s distinct advantage. You detect a strain of fear when talking to politicians about large technology companies – that due to their geopolitical nature and immense entanglement with our lives, no one wants to upset them. “Everyone’s struggling with the social media platforms,” says Bayly. “It’s not just New Zealand, Australia is struggling with it, Singapore struggles with it. France and Britain. Everyone’s struggling with it.” That’s not particularly accurate. Australia has introduced legislation to fine both banks and social media companies up to $50m for failure to prevent scams. Singapore has changed regulations to require verification of sellers. Malaysia has gone step further, requiring large social platforms to apply for an annual licence to operate in an effort to curb rampant scams and cyber-bullying. Meta has criticised the law as likely to prevent “innovation” in social media. Society can decide which problem it thinks is the more egregious. What Bayly seems to be hoping is that by working closely with counterparts in Australia and Singapore, New Zealand might be able to catch up from what currently feels like a long way back on technology and scams. He says that Meta has signed with the FMA about verifying the identity of financial services advertisers as evidence of progress – though when contacted, the FMA said it was in fact Google that signed the agreement. Bayly is not currently considering a fines-based system of coercion, and wouldn’t contemplate withdrawing government advertising from social media because “some people, that’s the only place they go”. Today, at the start of ‘fraud week’, he is announcing a push to create greater co-ordination between banks, social media companies and telcos around scam activity. He says this is needed in part for fear of pulling down accounts associated with legitimate businesses. Based on Reeve’s reporting, it’s not clear that Facebook is remotely interested in pulling down the accounts of paying clients, regardless of how illegitimate their businesses are. Until it is incentivised to do so, scammers will likely continue to be a bank problem and Facebook income stream. Catherine McGrath took up her role at Westpac during the pandemic, after a long period working in the UK. She finds the level of effort and thought which has gone into social media here wholly inadequate. “In the UK, they’ve put in legislation in 2023 and that starts to put accountability around fake ads. In Australia, they’re doing some quite interesting work, particularly on scams, where the government there is intending to put onus on social media companies as well as telcos and banks – the whole ecosystem, to make culpability clear and to make sure everybody’s incentivised to protect Australians. “I would love our government here to do the same thing.” As of today, there is no momentum around that outcome. We continue to live with the consequences of a highly regulated sector abutting a completely unregulated one, with consumers the casualty in between. There is no minister wholly responsible for social media, which sits unloved among a pile of portfolios, nor any momentum building for creating one. Facebook takes the profits from selling scam ads, while banks – and ultimately New Zealanders – hold the losses. I asked McGrath why they continued to show up on Facebook at all. Whether their presence there – for customer service, for content, for advertising – both funds and legitimises a platform which has shown by its actions an indifference to banks, by being paid to run ads for criminal activity targeting bank customers. “I think it is worth contemplating”, says McGrath, of whether the bank should consider leaving Facebook. “If, as an industry, we don’t think they’re stepping up, then one of the ways to help your customers not get fooled is to say we won’t put any of our stuff on it. So if you see anything with a big red W on it, it’s definitely not us…. I think there’s an interesting principles-versus-pragmatism debate that is definitely worth exploring and thinking about.” This is not without precedent. Media giant Stuff made the decision to cease posting to Facebook entirely in 2020, while beauty giant Lush did the same in 2021, with its accounts now sitting dormant under a header reading “be somewhere else”. Jurkovich said Kiwibank had not considered the idea, but would not rule it out. Both CEOs are stunned at the way the level of scrutiny and expectation from the government towards banks is not matched by any significant effort from the social giant. Speaking to people in government, there is a sense of impotence. That New Zealand is too small to get the attention of Facebook, and that the best way to achieve change is by joining other countries in multilateral approaches. It’s true in theory, but Facebook is approaching its 21st birthday, and only speeding up. It’s to the company’s distinct advantage for legislators to hold back, and to focus their attention on companies it can control. In the meantime, Facebook will keep running whatever ads it’s paid to, and only grow larger, stronger and harder to control.

However, these choppy markets can harbor plenty of opportunities — for those who know where to look. Investors shouldn't focus too much on short-term volatility as they position their portfolios. Recommendations from Wall Street can help them make informed decisions on stocks and seek solid long-term returns. Top-rated analysts pay attention to multiple aspects when selecting stocks of companies with solid fundamentals and strong execution. Bearing that in mind, here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. We start this week with e-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon (AMZN). The company impressed investors with third-quarter beats on the top and bottom lines, fueled by strength in its cloud and advertising businesses. In reaction to the solid Q3 print, Monness analyst Brian White reaffirmed a buy rating on Amazon stock and boosted the price target to $245 from $225. While the analyst acknowledged regulatory pressures, he remains bullish on AMZN as he thinks it will continue to "capitalize on the cloud, expand its digital ad business, innovate with AI, realize efficiencies from a regional fulfillment network, and leverage a leaner cost structure." White highlighted that Amazon's revenue growth accelerated to 17%, with significant profit upside. Notably, Q3 operating profit exceeded his estimates, driving record operating margin at 11%. He also noted the sharp sequential rise in operating margins at Amazon Web Services, or AWS, and International business. Based on the solid results, the analyst raised his revenue and earnings per share estimates for 2024 and 2025. White also pointed out Amazon's focus on reducing costs via improved efficiencies and new initiatives such as regionalizing its U.S. fulfillment network. The company now aims to regionalize its U.S. inbound network and leverage advanced robotic innovations across its fulfillment network. Overall, White sees lucrative growth potential for Amazon across e-commerce, AWS, digital media, advertising, Alexa, robotics, artificial intelligence and other avenues. White ranks No. 38 among more than 9,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 69% of the time, delivering an average return of 20.4%. See Amazon Stock Charts on TipRanks. We now move to this week's second pick, ride-sharing platform Uber Technologies (UBER). The company recently delivered better-than-expected third-quarter revenue and earnings. However, it missed Wall Street's expectations for Q3 gross bookings. Nonetheless, Evercore analyst Mark Mahaney remains bullish on UBER stock. He reiterated a buy rating with a price target of $120, following a series of investor meetings with management. Mahaney thinks UBER will gain from autonomous vehicle rollouts, given its position as the largest ride-sharing demand aggregator. He added that better availability of robotaxis on the Uber platform will drive improved customer service through shorter wait times, broader ride selection and possibly lower prices. "UBER believes that the economics it can offer AV owners can be compelling, allowing them to generate very high margins and better fleet utilization than they can develop on their own," said Mahaney. Based on his discussions with management, Mahaney explained that the deceleration reflecting in Uber's Mobility bookings growth in Q3 and the estimate for Q4 is due to the negative demand elasticity caused by the surge in insurance costs and a slowdown in "party hour" bookings, or those that take place during evenings and weekends. He thinks this deceleration will moderate, given the slowdown in the rate of insurance cost increases, growth prospects of new products such as Uber for Teens and Uber for Business as well as potential improvement in consumer discretionary demand. Finally, Mahaney remains confident about Uber's ability to consistently boost its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and free cash flow margins over the next three to five years, supported by multiple measures to drive cost efficiencies. Mahaney ranks No. 34 among more than 9,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 64% of the time, delivering an average return of 28.9%. See Uber Technologies Stock Options on TipRanks. Finally, let's look at fintech giant Block (SQ). The company, formerly known as Square, narrowly beat analysts' earnings expectations but missed revenue estimates for the third quarter. Following the results, BTIG analyst Andrew Harte discussed the positives and negatives of Block's Q3 performance. He noted that the company's initial FY25 gross profit growth guidance of at least 15% almost met the consensus estimate at 14.9%. However, Q4 gross profit outlook of 14% fell short of expectations due to the shift in the timing of certain expected benefits from Q4 to next year. The analyst thinks CEO Jack Dorsey did a good job in highlighting the company's lending products and explaining how they are fueling the growth of Block's ecosystem. Despite the soft Q4 guidance and management's commentary indicating that investors will have to wait until the second half of 2025 for growth acceleration, SQ stock continues to be a top pick for BTIG. Harte cited several reasons for his bullish stance, including Block's track record of surpassing guidance and the stock's attractive valuation at 12-times FY25 EV (enterprise value)/EBITDA. He added that the company is in the early days of fueling increased product adoption in both its Cash and Square ecosystems, indicating continued growth potential ahead. "Block is just beginning to integrate its Cash App and Square ecosystems, which could create meaningful flywheel effects over time," said Harte while reiterating a buy rating on the stock with a price target of $90. Harte ranks No. 152 among more than 9,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 75% of the time, delivering an average return of 63.8%.

Title: Trump’s Election Is Also a Win for Tech’s Right-Wing “Warrior Class”

Time Published: 2024-11-17T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
© THE INTERCEPT ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Silicon Valley has successfully rebranded military contracting as a proud national duty for the industry. Donald Trump pitched himself to voters as a supposed anti-interventionist candidate of peace. But when he reenters the White House in January, at his side will be a phalanx of pro-military Silicon Valley investors, inventors, and executives eager to build the most sophisticated weapons the world has ever known. During his last term, the U.S. tech sector tiptoed skittishly around Trump; longtime right-winger Peter Thiel stood as an outlier in his full-throated support of MAGA politics as other investors and executives largely winced and smiled politely. Back then, Silicon Valley still offered the public peaceful mission statements of improving the human condition, connecting people, and organizing information. Technology was supposed to help, never harm. No more: People like Thiel, Palmer Luckey, Trae Stephens, and Marc Andreessen make up a new vanguard of powerful tech figures who have unapologetically merged right-wing politics with a determination to furnish a MAGA-dominated United States with a constant flow of newer, better arms and surveillance tools. These men (as they tend to be) hold much in common beyond their support of Republican candidates: They share the belief that China represents an existential threat to the United States (an increasingly bipartisan belief, to be sure) and must be dominated technologically and militarily at all costs. They are united in their aversion, if not open hostility, to arguments that the pace of invention must be balanced against any moral consideration beyond winning. And they all stand to profit greatly from this new tech-driven arms race. Trump’s election marks an epochal victory not just for the right, but also for a growing conservative counterrevolution in American tech that has successfully rebranded military contracting as the proud national duty of the American engineer, not a taboo to be dodged and hidden. Meta’s recent announcement that its Llama large language model can now be used by defense customers means that Apple is the last of the “Big Five” American tech firms — Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Meta — not engaged in military or intelligence contracting. Elon Musk has drawn the lion’s share of media scrutiny (and Trump world credit) for throwing his fortune and digital influence behind the campaign. Over the years, the world’s richest man has become an enormously successful defense contractor via SpaceX, which has reaped billions selling access to rockets that the Pentagon hopes will someday rapidly ferry troops into battle. SpaceX’s Starlink satellite internet has also become an indispensable American military tool, and the company is working on a constellation of bespoke spy satellites for U.S. intelligence agency use. But Musk is just one part of a broader wave of militarists who will have Trump’s ear on policy matters. After election day, Musk replied to a celebratory tweet from Palmer Luckey, a founder of Anduril, a $14 billion startup that got its start selling migrant-detecting surveillance towers for the southern border and now manufactures a growing line of lethal drones and missiles. “Very important to open DoD/Intel to entrepreneurial companies like yours,” Musk wrote. Anduril’s rise is inseparable from Trumpism: Luckey founded the firm in 2017 after he was fired by Meta for contributing to a pro-Trump organization. He has been outspoken in his support for Trump as both candidate and president, fundraising for him in both 2020 and 2024. Big Tech historically worked hard to be viewed by the public as inhabiting the center-left, if not being apolitical altogether. But even that is changing. While Luckey was fired for merely supporting Trump’s first campaign, his former boss (and former liberal) Mark Zuckerberg publicly characterized Trump surviving the June assassination attempt as “bad ass” and quickly congratulated the president-elect on a “decisive victory.” Zuckerberg added that he is “looking forward to working with you and your administration.” To some extent, none of this is new: Silicon Valley’s origin is one of militarism. The American computer and software economy was nurtured from birth by the explosive growth and endless money of the Cold War arms race and its insatiable appetite for private sector R&D. And despite the popular trope of liberal Google executives, the tech industry has always harbored a strong anti-labor, pro-business instinct that dovetails neatly with conservative politics. It would also be a mistake to think that Silicon Valley was ever truly in lockstep with progressive values. A 2014 political ad by Americans for a Conservative Direction, a defunct effort by Facebook to court the Republican Party, warned that “it’s wrong to have millions of people living in America illegally” and urged lawmakers to “secure our borders so this never happens again.” The notion of the Democrat-friendly wing of Big Tech as dovish is equally wrong: Former Google chair and longtime liberal donor Eric Schmidt is a leading China hawk and defense tech investor. Similarly, the Democratic Party itself hasn’t meaningfully distanced itself from militarism in recent history. The current wave of startups designing smaller, cheaper military drones follows the Obama administration’s eager mass adoption of the technology, and firms like Anduril and Palantir have thrived under Joe Biden. What has changed is which views the tech industry is now comfortable expressing out loud. A year after Luckey’s ouster from the virtual reality subsidiary he founded, Google became embroiled in what grew into an industry-wide upheaval over military contracting. After it was reported that the company sought to win Project Maven, a lucrative drone-targeting contract, employees who had come to the internet titan to work on consumer products like Search, Maps, and Gmail found themselves disturbed by the thought of contributing to a system that could kill people. Waves of protests pushed Google to abandon the Pentagon with its tail between its legs. Even Fei-Fei Li, then Google Cloud’s chief artificial intelligence and machine learning scientist, described the contract as a source of shame in internal emails obtained by the New York Times. “Weaponized AI is probably one of the most sensitized topics of AI — if not THE most. This is red meat to the media to find all ways to damage Google,” she wrote. “I don’t know what would happen if the media starts picking up a theme that Google is secretly building AI weapons or AI technologies to enable weapons for the Defense industry.” It’s an exchange that reads deeply quaint today. The notion that the country’s talented engineers should build weapons is becoming fully mainstreamed. “Societies have always needed a warrior class that is enthused and excited about enacting violence on others in pursuit of good aims,” Luckey explained in an on-campus talk about his company’s contributions to the Ukrainian war effort with Pepperdine University President Jim Gash. “You need people like me who are sick in that way and who don’t lose any sleep making tools of violence in order to preserve freedom.” This “warrior class” mentality traces its genealogy to Peter Thiel, whose disciples, like Luckey, spread the gospel of a conservative-led arms race against China. “Everything that we’re doing, what the [Department of Defense] is doing, is preparing for a conflict with a great power like China in the Pacific,” Luckey told Bloomberg TV in a 2023 interview. At the Reagan National Defense Forum in 2019, Thiel, a lifelong techno-libertarian and Trump’s first major backer in tech, rejected the “ethical framing” of the question of whether to build weapons.” When it’s a choice between the U.S. and China, it is always the ethical decision to work with the U.S. government,” he said. Though Sinophobia is increasingly standard across party affiliations, it’s particularly frothing in the venture-backed warrior class. In 2019, Thiel claimed that Google had been “infiltrated by Chinese intelligence” and two years later suggested that bitcoin is “a Chinese financial weapon against the U.S.” Thiel often embodies the self-contradiction of Trumpist foreign policy, decrying the use of taxpayer money on “faraway wars” while boosting companies that design weapons for exactly that. Like Trump, Thiel is a vocal opponent of Bush- and Obama-era adventurism in the Middle East as a source of nothing but regional chaos — though Thiel has remained silent on Trump’s large expansion of the Obama administration’s drone program and his assassination of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani. In July, asked about the Israeli use of AI in the ongoing slaughter in Gaza, Thiel responded, “I defer to Israel.” Thiel’s gravitational pull is felt across the whole of tech’s realignment toward militarism. Vice President-elect JD Vance worked at Mithril, another of Thiel’s investment firms, and used $15 million from his former boss to fund the 2022 Senate win that secured his national political bona fides. Vance would later go on to invest in Anduril. Founders Fund, Thiel’s main venture capital firm, has seeded the tech sector with influential figures friendly to both Trumpism and the Pentagon. Before, an investor or CEO who publicly embraced right-wing ideology and products designed to kill risked becoming an industry pariah. Today, he can be a CNBC guest. An earlier adopter of MAGA, Thiel was also investing in and creating military- and intelligence-oriented companies before it was cool. He co-founded Palantir, which got its start helping facilitate spy agency and deportation raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Now part of the S&P 500, the company helps target military strikes for Ukraine and in January sealed a “strategic partnership for battle tech” with the Israeli Ministry of Defense, according to a press release. The ripple effect of Palantir’s success has helped popularize defense tech and solidify its union with the American right. Thiel’s Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale, also an Anduril investor, is reportedly helping Trump staff his new administration. Former Palantir employee and Anduril executive chair Trae Stephens joined the Trump transition team in 2016 and has suggested he would serve a second administration. As a member of the U.S.–China Economic and Security Review Commission, Thiel ally Jacob Helberg has been instrumental in whipping up anti-China fervor on Capitol Hill, helping push legislation to ban TikTok, and arguing for military adoption of AI technologies like those sold by his employer, Palantir, which markets itself as a bulwark against Chinese aggression. Although Palantir CEO Alex Karp is a self-described Democrat who said he planned to vote against Trump, he has derided progressivism as a “thin pagan religion” of wokeness, suggested pro-Palestine college protesters leave for North Korea, and continually advocating for an American arms buildup. “Trump has surrounded himself with ‘techno-optimists’ — people who believe technology is the answer to every problem,” Brianna Rosen, a strategy and policy fellow at the University of Oxford and alumnus of the Obama National Security Council, told The Intercept. “Key members of his inner circle — leading tech executives — describe themselves in this way. The risk of techno-optimism in the military domain is that it focuses on how technology saves lives, rather than the real risks associated with military AI, such as the accelerated pace of targeting.” The worldview of this corner of the tech industry is loud, if not always consistent. Foreign entanglements are bad, but the United States must be on perpetual war-footing against China. China itself is dangerous in part because it’s rapidly weaponizing AI, a current that threatens global stability, so the United States should do the very same, even harder, absent regulatory meddling. Stephens’s 2022 admonition that “the business of war is the business of deterrence” argues that “peaceful outcomes are only achievable if we maintain our technological advantage in weapons systems” — an argument that overlooks the fact that the U.S. military’s overwhelming technological superiority failed to keep it out of Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghanistan. In a recent interview with Wired, Stephens both criticized the revolving door between the federal government and Anduril competitors like Boeing while also stating that “it’s important that people come out of private industry to work on civil service projects, and I hope at some point I’ll have the opportunity to go back in and serve the government and American people.” William Fitzgerald, the founder of The Worker Agency, a communications and advocacy firm that has helped tech workers organize against military contracts, said this square is easily circled by right-wing tech hawks, whose pitch is centered on the glacial incompetence of the Department of Defense and blue-chip contractors like Lockheed and Raytheon. “Peter Thiel’s whole thing is to privatize the state,” Fitzgerald explained. Despite all of the rhetoric about avoiding foreign entanglements, a high-tech arms race is conducive to different kinds of wars, not fewer of them. “This alignment fits this narrative that we can do cheaper wars,” he said. “We won’t lose the men over there because we’ll have these drones.” In this view, the opposition of Thiel and his ilk isn’t so much to forever wars, then, but rather whose hardware is being purchased forever. The new conservative tech establishment seems in full agreement about the need for an era of techno-militarism. Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, the namesakes of one of Silicon Valley’s most storied and successful venture capital firms, poured millions into Trump’s reelection and have pushed hard to reorient the American tech sector toward fighting wars. In a “Techno-Optimist Manifesto” published last October, Andreessen wrote of defense contracting as a moral imperative. “We believe America and her allies should be strong and not weak. We believe national strength of liberal democracies flows from economic strength (financial power), cultural strength (soft power), and military strength (hard power). Economic, cultural, and military strength flow from technological strength.” The firm knows full well what it’s evoking through a naked embrace of strength as society’s greatest virtue: Listed among the “Patron Saints of Techno-Optimism” is Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, co-author of the 1919 Fascist Manifesto. The venture capitalists’ document offers a clear rebuttal of employees’ moral qualms that pushed Google to ditch Project Maven. The manifesto dismisses basic notions of “ethics,” “safety,” and “social responsibility” as a “demoralization campaign” of “zombie ideas, many derived from Communism” pushed by “the enemy.” This is rhetoric that matches a brand Trump has worked to cultivate: aspirationally hypermasculine, unapologetically jingoistic, and horrified by an America whose potential to dominate the planet is imperiled by meddling foreigners and scolding woke co-workers. “There’s a lot more volatility in the world, [and] there is more of a revolt against what some would deem ‘woke culture,’” said Michael Dempsey, managing partner at the New York-based venture capital firm Compound. “It’s just more in the zeitgeist now that companies shouldn’t be so heavily influenced by personal politics. Obviously that is the tech industry talking out of both sides of their mouth because we saw in this past election a bunch of people get very political and make donations from their firms.” Despite skewing young (by national security standards), many in this rightward, pro-military orbit are cultural and religious traditionalists infused with the libertarian preferences of the Zynternet, a wildly popular online content scene that’s melded apolitical internet bro culture and a general aversion to anything considered vaguely “woke.” A recent Vanity Fair profile of the El Segundo tech scene, a hotbed of the burgeoning “military Zyndustrial complex” commonly known as “the Gundo,” described the city as “California’s freedom-loving, Bible-thumping hub of hard tech.” It paints a vivid scene of young engineers who eschewed the progressive dystopia of San Francisco they read about on Twitter and instead flocked to build “nuclear reactors and military weaponry designed to fight China” beneath “an American flag the size of a dumpster” and “a life-size poster of Jesus Christ smiling benevolently onto a bench press below.” The American right’s hold over online culture in the form of podcasts, streamers, and other youth-friendly media has been central to both retaking Washington and bulldozing post-Maven sentiment, according to William Fitzgerald of Worker Agency. “I gotta hand it to the VCs, they’re really good at comms,” said Fitzgerald, who himself is former Google employee who helped leak critical information about the company’s involvement in Project Maven. “They’re really making sure that these Gundo bros are wrapping the American flag around them. It’s been fascinating to see them from 2019 to 2024 completely changing the culture among young tech workers.” A wave of layoffs and firings of employees engaged in anti-military protests have been a boon for defense evangelists, Fitzgerald added. “The workers have been told to shut up, or they get fired.” This rhetoric has been matched by a massive push by Andreessen Horowitz (already an Anduril investor) behind the fund’s “American Dynamism” portfolio, a collection of companies that leans heavily into new startups hoping to be the next Raytheon. These investments include ABL Space Systems, already contracting with the Air Force,; Epirus, which makes microwave directed-energy weapons; and Shield AI, which works on autonomous military drones. Following the election, David Ulevitch, who leads the fund’s American Dynamism team, retweeted a celebratory video montage interspersed with men firing flamethrowers, machine guns, jets, Hulk Hogan, and a fist-pumping post-assassination attempt Trump. Even the appearance of more money and interest in defense tech could have a knock-on effect for startup founders hoping to chase what’s trendy. Dempsey said he expects investors and founder to “pattern-match to companies like Anduril and to a lesser extent SpaceX, believing that their outcomes will be the same.” The increased political and cultural friendliness toward weapons startups also coincides with high interest rates and growing interest in hardware companies, Dempsey explained, as software companies have lost their luster following years of growth driven by little more than cheap venture capital. There’s every reason to believe a Trump-controlled Washington will give the tech industry, increasingly invested in militarized AI, what it wants. In July, the Washington Post reported the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute was working on a proposal to “Make America First in AI” by undoing regulatory burdens and encouraging military applications. Trump has already indicated he’ll reverse the Biden administration’s executive order on AI safety, which mandated safety testing and risk-based self-reporting by companies. Michael Kratsios, chief technology officer during the first Trump administration and managing director of Air Force contractor Scale AI, is reportedly advising Trump’s transition team on policy matters. “‘Make America First in AI’ means the United States will move quickly, regardless of the costs, to maintain its competitive edge over China,” Brianna Rosen, the Oxford fellow, explained. “That translates into greater investment and fewer restrictions on military AI. Industry already leads AI development and deployment in the defense and intelligence sectors; that role has now been cemented.” The mutual embrace of MAGA conservatism and weapons tech seems to already be paying off. After dumping $200 million into the Trump campaign’s terminal phase, Musk was quick to cash his chips in: On Thursday, the New York Times reported that he petitioned Trump SpaceX executives into positions at the Department of Defense before the election had even begun. Musk will also co-lead a nebulous new office dedicated to slashing federal spending. Rep. Matt Gaetz, brother-in-law to Luckey, now stands to be the country’s next attorney general. In a post-election interview with Bloomberg, Luckey shared that he is already advising the Trump transition team and endorses the current candidates for defense secretary. “We did well under Trump, and we did better under Biden,” he said of Anduril. “I think we will do even better now.” Israel’s War on Gaza Jonah Valdez The U.S. has a long tradition of shielding Israel (and itself) from war crime allegations — and threatening The Hague. Shawn Musgrave The PRESS Act, a federal reporter shield bill, already passed the House unanimously. Trump wants it dead. Israel’s War on Gaza Noah Hurowitz Democratic support for the bill dwindled as critics warned it would let Donald Trump crack down on political foes. © The Intercept. All rights reserved
