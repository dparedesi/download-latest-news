This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Last autumn, Alibaba was rallying on China’s stimulus plans. Now, its artificial intelligence moves are powering the stock, and it looks like there will be more gains to come. Shares of Alibaba Group Holding have jumped some 77% since Barron’s recommended them last fall. While the stock might not rally at such breakneck speed going forward, it appears poised to keep climbing—especially since it doesn’t look too pricey. China’s determination to stand on equal AI footing with the U.S. is a major factor in the stock’s favor, as Alibaba is pushing to be a central player in the country’s ongoing AI and cloud adoption. On Wednesday, Alibaba released a flurry of updates that sent its American depositary shares higher. The company plans to boost its AI spending, open new data centers across Asia, Europe, and North and South America—while also unveiling its largest AI language model on record, Qwen3-Max, with more than a trillion parameters. The company is also partnering with Nvidia to integrate the superstar chip maker’s products into tools like robots and self-driving cars. Many on Wall Street like what they’re seeing, with nearly 90% of analysts tracked by FactSet bullish on Alibaba. Citigroup’s Alicia Yap reiterated a Buy rating on the stock following the latest AI announcement. She also boosted her price target for Alibaba’s ADRs to $217 from $187 to account for her more optimistic revenue estimates for its cloud division. “Being one of the five to six global super cloud platforms with full-stack AI services, we believe Alibaba is well-positioned to capture the artificial superintelligence evolution," she wrote. It’s not just that Alibaba is seeing so many technological advances. Rather, it’s becoming an integrated one-stop shop for AI and cloud services, emulating major Western players’ full-stack model, which means they’re in control of the process and development from start to finish. “Alibaba will build Alibaba Cloud into a full-stack AI service provider, similar to what we see with Amazon Web Services/Google Cloud Platform, including the compute layer to power AI training/inference and offering proprietary open-source models within its own cloud environment," writes Baird analyst Colin Sebastian, He has an Outperform rating on Alibaba, and raised his price target to $174 from $153 on Wednesday. Perhaps even more importantly, however, Alibaba’s recent winning streak and announcements show that it’s no longer on the outs with Beijing. China has shown that it is committed to rivaling the U.S. when it comes to AI capabilities. As Barron’s notes, the fact that Alibaba has been able to notch so many AI victories suggests that it has done so with the Chinese government’s blessing. Although China’s chip capabilities are rapidly advancing, Nvidia chips are still the gold standard in many cases. Therefore, Alibaba’s Nvidia partnership likely required government approval, considering the company passed over domestic semiconductor companies, Gavekal analyst Tilly Zhang noted. That suggests China potentially “has more regulatory flexibility" when it comes to promoting AI evolution, she adds, with Alibaba at the forefront. Of course, investing in Chinese companies will always take some leap of faith: Government favor can change and other corporate information may not be readily forthcoming, leading to valuation gaps. Nonetheless, with Alibaba’s ADRs changing hands for just over 17 times the next fiscal year’s expected earnings, it looks worth the risk. It goes without saying they are far less expensive than even the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven—Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms trade in the mid-20 times range. There are other legitimate worries, however. The Zephirin Group analyst Lenny Zephirin, an Alibaba bear, argues that U.S. tech companies’ spending and advancement still far outstrip those of China, meaning the upside for Alibaba has been exaggerated. Still, as long as the company is increasingly backed by Beijing—and the tech halo extends beyond the U.S.—the shares are likely to keep outperforming while the AI trade dominates. Alibaba may never be on par with U.S. tech companies in a number of metrics. Yet it doesn’t need to be for its stock to keep winning.

Irish Life Investment Managers hires BlackRock executive to run TirNua Capital Partners It is believed that TirNua Capital Partners will support Ireland’s energy transition. Stock image: Getty A major new fund to invest in ­Ireland’s energy transition infrastructure is being launched by Irish Life Investment Managers (ILIM), the Irish Independent has learned. It has established a new unit to manage the fund, called TirNua Capital Partners. The group, part of Canada’s Great-West Lifeco, has hired David O’Brien as chief executive of TirNua Capital Partners. He was previously managing director and co-head of the Evergreen Infrastructure Partners, a unit of US investment giant BlackRock. Irish Life Investment Managers declined to comment. As of the end of 2024, Irish Life Investment Managers had more than €131bn of assets under management. It is the largest life and pensions group and fund manager in Ireland. In 2023, BlackRock achieved the first close of its Evergreen investment infrastructure fund, securing almost $1bn (€856m) in commitments from its founding partners. The open-ended equity fund focuses on investments in European and North American infrastructure connected to energy transition and energy security. It has cornerstone commitments from European Italian bank Intesa Sanpaolo and Inarcassa, Italy’s national pension fund for engineers and architects. Mr O’Brien scaled multiple infrastructure fund strategies and led multiple infrastructure investments It is believed that TirNua Capital Partners will also focus on investing in infrastructure assets that will support Ireland’s energy transition. Ireland has a target of seeing 80pc of its energy needs provided from renewable sources by 2030. The Government also hopes to have at least 5GW of offshore generating capacity installed by then. By 2050, it hopes to have 37GW of offshore renewable energy capacity installed. However, the 80pc target is unlikely to be met. Industry executives point to a slow planning process, what they claim are inefficient energy capacity auctions, and the system of judicial reviews as hindering the pace of development. The target for the deployment of offshore energy capacity is also unlikely to be met. While at BlackRock, Mr O’Brien scaled multiple infrastructure fund strategies and led multiple infrastructure investments. As co-head of BlackRock Evergreen Infrastructure Partners, he led the fund’s development, fundraising and investment activities. Before joining BlackRock in 2011, he was director of corporate finance at Irish firm NTR, where he worked for six years.

Title: Top companies keep talking about AI – but can’t explain the upsides

The biggest US-listed companies keep talking about artificial intelligence. But other than the “fear of missing out,” few appear to be able to describe how the technology is changing their businesses for the better. That is the conclusion of a Financial Times analysis of hundreds of corporate filings and executive transcripts at S&P 500 companies last year, providing one of the most comprehensive insights yet into how the AI wave is rippling through American industry. Big Tech giants such as Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta have regularly extolled AI’s benefits, pledging to invest $300 billion (€254 billion) this year alone to develop the infrastructure around large language models. Large companies far from Silicon Valley, from beverages giant Coca-Cola to sportswear maker Lululemon, are also discussing AI at ever-greater length in their regulatory filings. But they also largely paint a more sober picture of the technology’s usefulness, expressing concern over cybersecurity, legal risks and the potential for it to fail. Customer service support and data-heavy businesses have found it easiest to explain their use of the technology. Paycom, a payroll services provider, reported in filings that AI is an “important differentiator” for attracting and retaining clients. The filings do reveal a number of innovative uses of the technology. Huntington Ingalls, a military supplier, is applying AI “for battlefield decisions”. Animal health group Zoetis is using the technology to speed up medical tests for horses. Dover Corporation, a manufacturer, has a new process for tracking “hail-damaged vehicles” through to their repair. But AI adoption has not necessarily led to more growth. Dover Corporation’s stock has done the best of those three companies since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, almost matching the S&P 500 Equal Weighted index. [ AI’s replacement of humans in HR is emblematic of what could happen across the workplaceOpens in new window ] This index does not allow the size of the so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks – Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla – to dominate results, and is better for comparing whether a stock has performed better than others in the index. “When it comes to AI adoption, many companies aren’t guided by strategy but by ‘Fomo’,” said Haritha Khandabattu, senior director analyst at consultancy Gartner. “For some leaders, the question isn’t ‘What problem am I solving?’ but ‘What if my competitor solves it first?’” The FT has used AI tools to identify these mentions of the technology in SEC 10-k filings and earnings transcripts, then to categorise each mention. The results were then checked and analysed to help draw a nuanced picture about what companies were saying to different audiences about the technology. SEC filings require companies to disclose risks to the businesses, and are necessarily more cautious than the sales pitches made by executives on earnings calls. But the increasing array of risks described in filings appears not to be weighing on executives in the public pronouncements. Of the S&P 500, 374 companies mentioned AI on earnings calls in the past 12 months – with 87 per cent of the calls logged as wholly positive about the technology with no concerns expressed. Over the past five years, the boom of the Magnificent Seven tech stocks has driven a large portion of the S&P 500’s growth. While non-tech companies are upbeat about AI, their filings suggest less clear upsides. During an earnings call in February, Coca-Cola was excited about the technology – even though the key use was in the production of a TV commercial. The FT sought to categorise the expected positive benefits of the technology. Most of the anticipated benefits, such as increased productivity, were vaguely stated and harder to categorise than the risks. Companies anticipated being able to optimise workflows through automation, and hope to achieve market differentiation through their use of AI. Some hoped to be able to use the technology to improve the personalisation of their products. Meta, which has spent billions of dollars to hire a team of researchers dedicated to building ‘superintelligence’, was among the Big Tech groups to warn it could incur large legal settlements over allegations ‘that we used various copyrighted books and materials to train our artificial intelligence models' Filings do reveal that the companies able to give clear AI upsides include those that serve the rising AI-driven data-centre boom. Energy companies First Solar and Entergy cited AI as a demand driver. Freeport-McMoran, which has a stockpile of copper, stated that “data centres and artificial intelligence developments” would support the metal’s price. The company also said the technology can help with material characterisation and mineral extraction. Equipment manufacturer Caterpillar reported that its energy business was benefiting from supporting “data centre growth related to cloud computing and generative artificial intelligence”. As the number of companies discussing AI has grown, fewer businesses are expressing positive views about the technology than they did in 2022. The most commonly cited concern was cybersecurity, which was mentioned as a risk by more than half of the S&P 500 in 2024. Online dating group Match warned that “the use of AI has been known to result in, and may in the future result in, cybersecurity incidents that implicate the personal data of end users of AI-enhanced services”. [ AI begins to bite: Recruiters attribute a slump in professional services hiring to job automationOpens in new window ] Companies expressed particular concern that other businesses and customers could prove to be weak links. Lululemon said it was concerned about security risks posed by advanced AI technologies, which could lead to sensitive information, such as transaction data, being compromised. Microsoft struck a dramatic tone, saying “[i]neffective or inadequate AI development or deployment practices by Microsoft or others could result in incidents that impair the acceptance of AI solutions, cause harm to individuals, customers or society, or result in our products and services not working as intended”. “Companies tend to see AI as a risk because they’re not used to having systems or processes which they can’t rely upon 100 per cent,” said Ray Eitel-Porter, an AI governance expert and author. The second-largest concern among US companies is the fear that their efforts to introduce the technology will not be successful. Recent research led by Aditya Challapally at the MIT Media Lab found 95 per cent of generative AI pilots in the workplace failed. This was because the current generation of AI tools lack features such as long-term memory and customisation, which would make them easier to plug into existing company systems. “When we spoke to executives, they would often say the internal tool was very successful,” said Challapally. “But when we spoke to employees we found zero usage.” In 174 annual reports, another common concern is the rise of regulatory and legal concerns over implementing AI. Meta, which has spent billions of dollars to hire a team of researchers dedicated to building “superintelligence”, was among the Big Tech groups to warn it could incur large legal settlements over allegations “that we used various copyrighted books and materials to train our artificial intelligence models”. Other companies with less AI exposure have raised similar worries. PepsiCo said “our use of artificial intelligence may result in increased claims of infringement or other claims, including those based on unauthorised use of third-party technology or content”. The FT’s analysis shows that companies are a lot clearer about the potential problems with AI than the upsides. “[T]here can be no assurance that the usage of AI will enhance our products or services or be beneficial to our business, including our efficiency or profitability,” Meta wrote in its 10k form last year. “We may not be successful in our artificial intelligence initiatives, which could adversely affect our business, reputation or financial results.” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025 © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: US lawmakers have questions for Big Tech and others on H-1B hiring practices
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/h1b-visa-senators-grassley-durbin-letter-big-tech-2025-9
Time Published: 2025-09-26T02:11:03Z

Two US senators have questions for Big Tech and other top companies over their use of H-1B visas amid the Trump administration's push to slow down foreign worker hiring practices. In letters sent to 10 companies on Wednesday, including Amazon, Apple, Deloitte, and JPMorgan Chase, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley and ranking member Sen. Dick Durbin said they were concerned about the use of H-1B visa workers while the tech sector experiences a "high unemployment rate." The senators cited the layoffs the companies conducted in recent years and the number of H-1B visas they applied for in 2025. In the letter addressed to Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon, the senators wrote that Amazon had laid off "tens of thousands of employees in recent years" while it was approved to hire "at least 10,033 H-1B employees" in the latest fiscal year. "With all of the homegrown American talent relegated to the sidelines, we find it hard to believe that Amazon cannot find qualified American tech workers to fill these positions," the letter said. Each letter contains eight questions regarding the company's foreign hiring practices, including whether a company has "displaced any American employees with H-1B employees." The letters were sent to Amazon, Apple, Cognizant, Deloitte, Google, JPMorgan Chase, Meta, Microsoft, Tata Consultancy Services, and Walmart. Spokespeople for these companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The probe comes just days after President Donald Trump signed an executive order that implements a $100,000 fee for each new H-1B application. The initial unveiling of the H-1B overhaul sent companies scrambling to notify their foreign employees to get back to the US in under 24 hours. The White House later clarified that it was for new visas. Some business leaders, including Netflix cofounder Reed Hastings and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, hailed the move as a necessary corrective to the existing process, while others said it could hurt smaller companies that can't afford $100,000 application fees. A JPMorgan Chase report published Tuesday said that the new fee could reduce the US work authorizations by 5,500 per month. Jump to

Title: Some Clues That a Recession Is Coming

Cardboard-box demand can be a legitimate indicator. Hemline length? Not so much. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here. Alan Greenspan knows a thing or two about underpants. American history’s second-longest-tenured Fed chairman also knows a thing or many about recessions, obviously, and the two are related: Sales of men’s underwear, Greenspan once reportedly suggested, are inversely proportional to economic anxiety. As the theory goes, men see underwear as a luxury, not a necessity. When money gets tight, boxers get holey. According to folk wisdom, when a recession is imminent, sales of snacks, cigarettes, champagne, and cardboard boxes also go down. Demand for lipstick, laxatives, instant noodles, used clothing, high heels, scary movies, and mini liquor bottles, meanwhile, goes up. Hemlines drop; law-school applications rise. Baby butts get rashy. Halloween gets less spooky. People gravitate toward public libraries and private labels. They spend less at restaurants. They stop dyeing their hair and dry-cleaning their clothes and going to the strip club, and they definitely do not buy an RV. Well, supposedly. If you ask an economist, they will almost certainly tell you that a recession is indicated by things such as mounting unemployment, falling industrial production, and short-term interest rates rising relative to long-term ones. If you ask the people working at National Bureau of Economic Research, who actually make the call about a recession, they will say it is a “significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months.” They are highly unlikely to tell you that the best way to understand the state of global markets is to take a look at your ankles. That’s not to say that pop-culture recession indicators are meaningless. A recession is a phenomenon necessarily defined in hindsight, usually long after life has changed on the ground: The Great Recession officially began at the end of 2007, but NBER didn’t announce that it had until the following December, right around when more than half a million people lost their jobs in a single month. Consumer behavior is a reactive measure of how much money people have in their pocket, which is probably why Greenspan was apparently paying attention to underwear. Many other pop-culture recession indicators—including the rise in law-school applications, the decline in demand for cardboard boxes, and the growing use of libraries and generic products—have been validated as useful signals about the health of the economy. They currently show what the more traditional indicators also show: The American economy is full of uncertainty, even though it has not yet tipped officially into recession. But taking anecdotal intuition about individual consumer psychology and extrapolating widely can lead to some odd and unhelpful conclusions. The way people spend their money is personal, and the product of a complex set of factors. It’s also sometimes illogical. Case in point: In 2008, when the Nielsen Company did an analysis of consumer behavior during a recession, the firm’s findings indicated that whereas candy is recession-proof, soda—liquid candy—is among the most recession-prone consumer goods. And societies don’t respond to crises the same way every time. The hemline index, which holds that in bad times hemlines go down and in good times they rise, is one of the most cited pop-culture recession indicators. It originated in the 1920s, when most women didn’t work outside the home, style (and society) were far more rigid, the fashion industry operated completely differently, and the miniskirt did not exist. Even if it were possible to reliably measure hemlines on a large scale, they are also influenced, in the short and long term, by trends, weather, and norms. Economic anxiety is a powerful force, but it is not the only force dictating the way people act. Here is what we know, according to Joanne Hsu, who runs the University of Michigan’s consumer-sentiment survey program. Generally speaking, the less money people feel like they have, the more likely they are to skip big expenses and to substitute cheaper, lower-quality goods where they can. (Indeed, sales of Hamburger Helper are up 14.5 percent this year, as sales of most luxury goods are down.) They seek out stress relief, good deals, and cheap indulgence. They also apparently seek out economic folk wisdom. This may not be a recession, but it is definitely a boom time for talking about being in a recession. According to various reports, people are, at this moment, listening to “recession pop,” going “recession blonde,” and getting “recession nails.” Online, the recession indicator has quickly gone from pop-economic trivium to absurdist meme. Among the supposed signs of our impending economic catastrophe that whizzed past me this spring and summer like the world’s most depressing rewrite of “We Didn’t Start the Fire”: Labubus, urban lumberjacks, messy buns, capri pants, hot women in eviction court, Hot Pockets changing its packaging, the Coachella lineup dropping early, the resurgence of frozen yogurt, a new Air Bud sequel, an American pope. Some of these are legible enough; many are ridiculous. (Recession indicator is this season’s Sir, this is a Wendy’s, the blank form through which anyone can launder a basic observation into something that sort of resembles a joke, especially if you’re not paying very close attention.) None of these meme indicators have, to my knowledge, been formally validated by the academic establishment. But I find it very telling that young people on the internet are casually invoking an arcane economic concept in order to explain the way their world feels. Maybe the ultimate recession indicator is how much people are talking about recession indicators. Not that I blame them. “Recession indicators” are appealing like the 10-day weather forecast is appealing. We turn to them not because they are accurate, but because they offer the illusion of control. Everyone gets rained on in a monsoon, but it’s still nice to know to pack an umbrella. These little predictors make the abstract feel concrete and the future feel foreseeable, maybe even manageable. They reduce the economy—sprawling, complex, scary-big—down to something as small as a tube of lipstick. And maybe most important, they’re a quasi-academic way of corroborating your own reality—a vibe check, a pat on the shoulder, a Ph.D. for your dread. Starting in 2022, as inflation surged post-lockdowns, economists have been predicting a recession. Thus far, one hasn’t officially arrived. But try saying that to people paying $8 for eggs. “People don’t feel like they’re thriving as they should be, as they might expect to,” Hsu told me. “So I think it makes sense that people are looking for things that validate their experiences.” Of all the unorthodox recession indicators, cardboard-box production is one of the most reliable, because cardboard boxes are a very straightforward proxy for the quantity of goods being shipped around the world. The outlook isn’t good: On Sunday, The Wall Street Journal reported that box shipments are at their lowest levels since 2016. All across the economy, people are buying less and doing less. They’re forgoing the things they really want because they cannot afford them, because they don’t have enough money. At a certain point, that’s indicator enough.

Costco vs. Xbox bust up reportedly confirmed, as the retailer says plans to ditch Xbox consoles was a "business decision," without providing specifics. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. What does Xbox and Ferrari have in common? Well, primarily you can say they're pretty expensive. In the United States and beyond, Microsoft has been gradually raising the price of its Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S hardware. However, United States customers are feeling the pinch the hardest, owing to President Trump's tariff blitz on foreign imports. The vast majority of Xbox console hardware is manufactured in China, which is subject to a variety of duties that impacts cost. Some types of electronics are exempt, such as traditional computers and smartphones. Video game consoles, however, are not exempt. In response, Microsoft has raised the price of Xbox Series X|S consoles not once, but twice in the United States. When importing Xbox console stock from China, Microsoft has to pay a tax to the United States government, which disrupts the wafer-thin to non-existent profit margin on console hardware. Microsoft, like most other manufacturers (PlayStation included) have been passing on the cost to consumers, leading to higher prices. Some retailers don't seem happy with the new price points. Costco is one such retailer. This week, we wrote about reports that Costco has begun removing Xbox hardware and accessories from its store shelves — not just in the U.S., but globally. Microsoft and Costco haven't really issued a statement through typical channels, but former IGN journalist and video game commentator Destin Legarie says he's managed to get a statement out of the company. Just called Costco about Xbox stock. I was told that they will no longer be carrying Xbox consoles. “We don’t have any plans going forward to carry an Xbox console.” Saying. It was a business decision.They did say they have some great deals on Switch & PlayStation, though.September 25, 2025 "Just called Costco about Xbox stock," Destin's post on X reads. "I was told that they will no longer be carrying Xbox consoles. 'We don't have plans going forward to carry an Xbox console,' saying it was a business decision. They did have some great deals on Switch and PlayStation, though." For our part, we can confirm that this isn't just a blip or typical stock shortage. Costco has indeed been removing Xbox console hardware and has them on clearance sales in certain regions. Something is definitely going on, but Microsoft has so far declined to comment. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Microsoft has had a tough generation for Xbox hardware. Still reeling from the negative reception of the Xbox One, Microsoft hasn't really ever recovered its competitive edge against PlayStation's competing solution. But, the industry has changed. Despite hardware sales being anaemic, Microsoft has found success moving its popular franchises to PlayStation and PC. Xbox Series X|S also punches well above its weight. Xbox Game Pass, which is only available within the Microsoft gaming ecosystem, is a huge driver of the business. Despite having a smaller install base on paper, Xbox users are often reported to be disproportionately engaged and spendy. Microsoft's "Everything is an Xbox" strategy has been a winner thus far, with the gaming division outpacing Windows itself as a cornerstone of Microsoft's overall business pie. Despite the hardware struggles on paper, the Xbox ecosystem arguably enjoys better support from developers than ever, with Square Enix returning to the platform with Final Fantasy, and PlayStation itself publishing Helldivers 2 on Xbox Series X|S this summer, too. Still, losing a major retailer like Costco does raise questions. Microsoft's next-gen Xbox hardware is widely expected to be Windows-oriented and PC-like, enabling OEMs like ASUS to potentially construct their own Xbox compatible PCs for the living room too. The very interesting PC handheld Xbox Ally is the first glimpse at that strategy, set to launch on October 16, 2025. It doesn't look like Costco will be part of the fun, though. There's plenty of others still willing to carry Xbox hardware, though, as you can see below.

Title: Novo Nordisk A/S Class Action: Levi & Korsinsky Reminds Novo Investors of the Pending Class Action Lawsuit with a Lead Plaintiff Deadline of September 30, 2025 – NVO

September 25, 2025 16:40 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, Sept. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in Novo Nordisk A/S ("Novo" or the "Company") (NYSE: NVO) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Novo investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/novo-nordisk-a-s-lawsuit-submission-form-3?prid=168894&wire=3 NVO investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Novo during the relevant time frame, you have until September 30, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff. NO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. There is no cost or obligation to participate.

Share this article BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, filed today for a Bitcoin premium income ETF in Delaware. The proposed fund represents a new investment product designed to generate income through Bitcoin-related premiums. The filing extends BlackRock’s crypto expansion beyond its spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), which reached $90 billion in assets under management by September 2025. The firm captured 60% of the US Bitcoin ETF market share with IBIT. BlackRock’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs generated $260 million in annual revenue less than two years after launch. The asset manager has been adding Bitcoin exposure to its in-house funds, with model portfolios allocating 1%-2% to crypto assets. The premium income structure targets income-focused investors seeking Bitcoin exposure with yield generation, differentiating it from BlackRock’s existing spot Bitcoin product that tracks the cryptocurrency’s price movements directly.

Title: Google Just Made Cipher Mining An AI-Crypto Hybrid Bet

Cipher Mining Inc (NASDAQ: CIFR) just landed one of the most eye-catching endorsements in crypto infrastructure: Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG). Google took a 5.4% stake in the Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) miner, securing roughly 24 million warrants as part of a 10-year, $5 billion AI hosting deal. The structure effectively backstops $1.4 billion in financing tied to Cipher's Texas data center buildout. For investors, that transforms Cipher from a niche miner into a leveraged bet on the AI-crypto convergence. Read Also: Cipher Mining (CIFR) Stock Hit 52-Week Highs Today: What’s Going On? The timing couldn't be better. OpenAI, SoftBank and partners just unveiled a $400 billion Stargate data center initiative spanning nearly 7 GW, with two of its newest Texas sites landing right next to existing mining hubs. Shackelford County sits near IREN Ltd's (NASDAQ: IREN) 2 GW Sweetwater facility, while Milam County neighbors Riot Platforms Inc's (NASDAQ: RIOT) 700 MW Rockdale complex. SoftBank already owns ~2.65% of Cipher, tying another thread between AI buildouts and crypto infrastructure. This geographic clustering matters. Texas offers cheap power, a deregulated grid and a political climate welcoming to both AI and crypto. The overlap could create operational synergies and capital flow tailwinds for miners like Riot, IREN and Cipher as investors begin to view them less as pure bitcoin proxies and more as energy-intensive infrastructure players. What sets Cipher apart now is credibility. Google's equity exposure isn't just financial — it's a vote of confidence Cipher can deliver reliable hosting capacity at scale. That separates it from peers, giving the company access to long-duration capital while positioning it as a dual-track play: Bitcoin upside on one side, AI infrastructure on the other. For a stock that's often traded in lockstep with Bitcoin price swings, this marks a potential rerating catalyst. Cipher Mining is no longer just a high-beta Bitcoin miner — it's a call option on AI infrastructure growth in Texas. With Google and SoftBank on the cap table, and Stargate bringing massive data centers into the same energy ecosystem, the stock sits squarely at the intersection of two of the market's hottest narratives. Investors betting on Cipher Mining aren't just buying crypto exposure — they're buying into the AI-energy land grab. Read Next: Photo: Shutterstock © 2025 Benzinga.com.

Title: ‘I was hoping for Paul Mescal,’ tourist says after meeting Jim Gavin on campaign trail

Full Content:
Jim Gavin chatted to Canadian couple Maja Crawley and Colin Landrie during a short Dart journey between Blackrock and Dalkey in South Dublin on Thursday. The pair seemed somewhat bemused to have come upon the Fianna Fáil presidential election candidate’s large entourage during their journey. An Irish Rail staff member kept a close eye to make sure there was no canvassing on board as this is a no-no for the transport company. Team Gavin told him they were only on board to “get from A to B” and the candidate was on safe ground talking to the Canadian pair who do not have a vote in the election. Dún Laoghaire TD Cormac Devlin told the tourists that Taoiseach Micheál Martin was in Canada to meet their prime minister Mark Carney. So did the couple from Winnipeg, Manitoba, expect to encounter a presidential election candidate on their trip to Ireland? “I was hoping for Paul Mescal or Dermot Kennedy,” Ms Crawley said. Mr Gavin does not have the same kind of star power as the actor or the singer-songwriter, but who does in fairness? The former Dublin GAA manager, a newcomer to politics, does enjoy some fame due to his multiple All-Ireland winning efforts and there was the odd ‘Up the Dubs’ as he canvassed in the South Dublin suburbs. He met footballers Paul Mannion and Con O’Callaghan in Dún Laoghaire. The pair later featured in a campaign video backing him. But what is Mr Gavin telling voters regarding his plans for the presidency? Voters Anne O’Leary and Rimiko Ogata got the pitch in a Blackrock cafe. They got a technical explanation of the powers of the presidency, such as scrutinising Bills and appointing taoisigh and ministers after elections. He also said the office had “the power to highlight things” like disadvantage and “those who mightn’t have a voice” and to “shine a light on people who provide services”. This would be a “big part” of his presidency, he told them. Ms O’Leary asked for an example and Mr Gavin mentioned the kind of places he visited while canvassing in Navan, Co Meath, the previous day including a childcare centre. “It’s about highlighting the really good things in the country,” he said. Speaking afterwards, Ms O’Leary and Ms Ogata said they had not been Fianna Fáil supporters in the past, but would consider voting for Mr Gavin. Ms O’Leary said that with Mr Martin as leader she was more open to the party. Ms Ogata agreed. Mr Gavin, of course, is the person the Taoiseach backed to be Fianna Fáil’s candidate. He held off Ireland South MEP Billy Kelleher in the internal parliamentary party vote to select a candidate, but by a thinner margin than many expected. One of Mr Kelleher’s supporters in that contest, Dublin MEP Barry Andrews, was on the canvass with Mr Gavin. Is he ruing the fact that it is Mr Gavin rather than Mr Kelleher pounding the pavements on the campaign trail? “It’s ancient history,” Mr Andrews said. “We had a great contest and are delighted that Jim is our candidate. “We’re very lucky. His record of service is really unbelievable. I came across him in humanitarian work when I was in [aid agency] Goal and he was in the Air Corps. “In the next four weeks he’ll grow as a candidate and get to know the people.” More importantly, does he believe Mr Gavin can stay ahead of the Fine Gael candidate, Heather Humphreys, when it comes to first preference votes? “I think so, yeah,” Mr Andrews said. A widely held view among commentators is that whichever Coalition party candidate is ahead – Mr Gavin or Ms Humphreys – will benefit from transfers from the other, propelling them to the presidency over left-wing Independent Catherine Connolly, who is backed by Opposition parties. Mr Andrews said “the concentration on first preference will be the main thing here” and “that’s why he’s working as hard as he is”. “He’s an amazingly energetic candidate,” he said. “People are really responding to him well on the road.” In Blackrock, Eugene Kenny, from “a Fianna Fáil house”, said he would vote for Mr Gavin as “he seems to be the best of the three at the moment”. He described him as a “middle-of-the-road kind of guy” who is “able to speak pretty well”. Another voter in the village, Jane McGauran, told Mr Gavin how Ms Connolly was particularly vocal on the horror of the war in Gaza. Dr McGauran is a volunteer with the Children Not Numbers charity and is a member of Irish Healthcare Workers for Palestine. She is in contact with families in Gaza who have “very sick children” including some with injuries from explosives. She asked if Mr Gavin would speak out about the war and advocate for injured children to come to Ireland. He told her what was happening in Gaza was “genocide” and said he would “speak out against that”. “The fighting needs to stop, the hostages need to be handed back by Hamas and we need to get aid into Gaza and to get those women and children and people out,” he said. “So I will champion that.” She later said she was impressed with Mr Gavin’s answer. “I hope he follows through.” Would she vote for him? “I’ll read his manifesto and I’ll have a think about it. I haven’t decided,” said the doctor, who is also considering voting for Ms Connolly. In these early days of the campaign, Dr McGauran was not alone during the canvass in being in the “thinking about it” category when it comes to Mr Gavin.

World WASHINGTON: US lawmakers asked major companies including Apple, Amazon and JPMorgan on Thursday (Sep 25) to explain why they continue to hire thousands of foreign workers on H-1B visas while laying off American staff. The letter follows the Trump administration’s plan to impose a new US$100,000 annual fee on H-1B visas and rework the program to favor higher-paid and higher-skilled applicants. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley and Democratic Senator Dick Durbin wrote to 10 major employers demanding details on the number of foreign workers they employ, their wages and whether US workers have been displaced. "With all of the homegrown American talent relegated to the sidelines, we find it hard to believe that Amazon cannot find qualified American tech workers to fill these positions," the senators wrote to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy. The Wall Street Journal first reported the letter. Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and other firms investing heavily in artificial intelligence have all announced layoffs this year. Yet they remain among the largest users of the H-1B program, which allows businesses to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations. Amazon and its cloud unit AWS received approval for more than 12,000 H-1B visas in the first half of 2025, while Microsoft and Meta had more than 5,000 approvals each, according to government data. India accounted for 71 per cent of approved H-1B beneficiaries last year, with China second at 11.7 per cent. Deloitte, Alphabet’s Google, Walmart, Cognizant and Tata Consultancy Services were also among the recipients of the lawmakers’ letter. Microsoft declined to comment, while Walmart, Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Meta and Cognizant did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.

Title: Is XRP Finally Coming To BlackRock? Ripple Drops Bombshell Announcement

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ripple has unveiled a partnership that places its RLUSD stablecoin at the center of tokenized finance involving BlackRock and VanEck. The announcement, which was shared on the company’s official X account, connects Ripple directly to tokenized versions of institutional funds and sets the stage for deeper integration between the XRP Ledger and some of the largest names in asset management. Ripple confirmed that it is working with Securitize,the world’s largest tokenization platform, to bring in real-time liquidity for institutional assets provided by BlackRock and VanEck. Through this arrangement, holders of BlackRock’s $BUIDL and VanEck’s $VBILL can instantly convert their fund shares into RLUSD, allowing them to retain access to on-chain yield. With the partnership, BUIDL and VBILL holders will now be able to instantly exchange their shares for RLUSD 24/7. Acording to the announcement, Securitize is also expanding integration with the XRP Ledger. Considering Securitize is one of the largest tokenization platform, this move increases the XRP ecosystem’s exposure to tokenized assets and strengthens Ripple’s push to imporove its on-chain financial infrastructure. “Making RLUSD available as an exchange option for tokenized funds is a natural next step as we continue to bridge traditional finance and crypto,” said Jack McDonald, SVP of Stablecoins at Ripple. “ Speculation around Ripple’s relationship with BlackRock has been building for months, and many in the industry have linked Ripple’s cross-border settlement technology to the asset manager’s vision for tokenization. The company is now working to tokenize $2 trillion worth of assets on the blockchain. BlackRock launched its first tokenized fund, BUIDL (BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund), in March 2024, doing so through Securitize’s infrastructure. Securitize serves as the platform that tokenizes BlackRock’s fund, issuing digital tokens that represent ownership of the underlying real-world assets. The implications are significant. Ripple has managed to secure a foothold in the conversation by tying RLUSD to tokenized funds. Ripple’s RLUSD is now linked not only to BlackRock’s BUIDL but also to VanEck’s VBILL fund. This creates a direct link between Ripple’s stablecoin ecosystem and products from two of the world’s biggest asset managers. The partnership can be viewed as an important step that could eventually pave the way for XRP itself to be tied into BlackRock’s tokenization efforts. This partnership also speaks to Ripple’s strategy of expanding the utility of RLUSD. Since its launch, the stablecoin has steadily grown in adoption, reaching a market capitalization of about $742 million. The collaboration with Securitize, and through it with BlackRock and VanEck, also improves XRPL’s presence in the real-world asset (RWA) tonization sector.

IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR NOVO NORDISK INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On July 29, 2025, Novo Nordisk cut its previously issued fiscal year 2025 guidance, lowering sales growth from 13-21% to 8-14%, and operating profit from 16-24% to 10-16%. The Company cited lower growth expectations for both Ozempic and Wegovy on the back of a slowdown in market expansion, competition, and the alleged continued use of compounded GLP-1s. On this news, Novo Nordisk’s stock price fell $15.06, or 21.8%, to close at $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, thereby injuring investors. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Novo Nordisk repeatedly ignored and minimized the significance of the personalization exception for GLP-1 compounding, greatly overestimated its ability to capture patients coming off of compounded treatments, and was ultimately ill equipped to capitalize upon the purported significant unmet patient population; and (2) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.

Title: Kraken quietly closes $500M round as its unusual CEO pushes toward the IPO finish line
URL: https://fortune.com/crypto/2025/09/25/kraken-ipo-ceo/
Time Published: 2025-09-25T17:38:45Z
Full Content:
Jeff John Roberts is the Finance and Crypto editor at Fortune, overseeing coverage of the blockchain and how technology is changing finance. “My neighbors think I’m under house arrest,” observes Arjun Sethi. It’s not hard to see why. On the driveway of Sethi’s comfortable Menlo Park home, located a few miles from Stanford University, sits a black Cybertruck that rarely leaves. Meanwhile, various figures stream in and out of a wide open garage anchored by a table littered with electronics. Inside, there are no pictures on the walls and the domicile’s only personality is supplied by a large German shepherd patrolling the backyard. Sethi is no criminal, though, and the house is not just his home. It is also the prime outpost for Kraken, the longtime cryptocurrency exchange where Sethi, who draws few lines between his personal and professional life, is co-CEO. The gray-flecked 42-year-old, who favors plain T-shirts, may not be concerned about what his neighbors think of him. But he does have to care about the opinions of another group: Kraken’s investors, who are expecting big things in the near future. Founded in 2011, Kraken has long flown under the radar compared with its bigger competitor Coinbase, but has always commanded the respect of traders and crypto veterans. In the past year, the company has reached for a bigger share of the spotlight with high-profile acquisitions and product launches ahead of an IPO planned for next year. All of this will test whether Kraken can meet the lofty $15 billion valuation that came with a new funding round it closed this month. Meeting that challenge will fall to Sethi who, despite an official title of co-CEO, is very much calling the shots at Kraken. An executive whose experience lies primarily in venture capital, he is an unusual choice to lead a company on the cusp of going public, but one very much in keeping with Kraken’s history as an unconventional company. Sitting at a large desk plunked in the center of his sparse living room one August afternoon, Sethi patiently replies to my questions as random figures pop in and out of the garage. He has a wide range of intellectual interests—he dabbled in journalism in college and has read extensively on major religions—but for Sethi nearly everything comes down to data. After founding a pair of startups and working as a senior product manager at Yahoo, Sethi cofounded the venture capital firm Tribe Capital. Even more than its peer VC firms, Tribe has a reputation for data-based decision-making, which led to bets on Kraken, as well as on Carta, which makes cap-management software, and the cloud computing firm Docker, among others. If the unsentimental Sethi has a passion, it is the idea of using blockchain technology to fix obstacles in the financial system that prevent people from tapping into collateral they own. He cites, for instance, the common conundrum faced by employees who leave a startup and must exercise their stock options and pay related tax within 90 days—resulting in many of them simply walking away from their equity. The solution, Sethi says, is tapping into the modular stack of services offered by decentralized finance (DeFi), which promises to give consumers an unprecedented degree of control over their assets, and let them lend or securitize them like never before. “My hope with crypto is to distribute those benefits more evenly. We’re not all the way there, but the first steps are happening—stablecoins, then tokenized assets, and now tokenized equities,” said Sethi. His vision is for Kraken to be a hub for all of these things, bringing the best elements of crypto and the traditional financial stack under one umbrella. To that end, the company spent $1.5 billion this spring to buy NinjaTrader, a platform for professional asset traders, in a move that boosted Kraken’s customer base by 2 million and represented, in Sethi’s words, the “largest-ever deal combining TradFi and crypto.” Coinbase is the dominant player in retail crypto, but Kraken’s bread-and-butter has always been professional and institutional customers. Lately, though, Kraken has been pushing to expand its presence in retail, including with the launch of xStocks, which are shares of popular companies like Apple and Tesla, wrapped in crypto and tradable on blockchains. The concept of blockchain-based stocks may seem exotic or downright unnecessary, but look closer and the early response to xStocks appears to validate Sethi’s views on where finance is going. He notes that xStocks, which the company hopes to offer in the U.S. next year, are taking off in markets like South Africa where the fees to purchase traditional stocks from brokerages can still be over 10%. By offering shares on a decentralized blockchain platform—xStocks can even be traded outside of Kraken’s exchange—there is less opportunity for middlemen like brokerages to exact high fees. Kraken is one of a handful of trading firms, including Robinhood, that are offering tokenized assets, and some big Wall Street names like BlackRock are doing the same. If this is indeed where the world is heading, it will be the latest instance of Kraken being ahead of the curve; previous examples include the exchange being one of the first to list Ethereum and to offer crypto derivatives. Unlike most startups, Kraken made it this far with very little in venture capital funding, raising only $27 million from its founding until this year. That recently changed, however, as the company decided to raise a $500 million round as part of its final gear-up for an IPO. The Information reported in July that the company was seeking to raise that amount; this week Fortune learned, from a person who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, that it successfully closed the round this month. The round featured no primary investor with Kraken itself setting the terms, including the $15 billion valuation, said the person. Contributors included investment managers and venture capitalists, as well as Sethi’s Tribe Capital and Sethi in a personal capacity. The investors are pouring money into a thriving business that pulled in nearly $80 million in post-Ebitda earnings, and over $411 million in revenue in the second quarter, according to figures published by Kraken. Those numbers, along with the firm’s longevity and strong reputation in the industry, put it in position to be one of the strongest of the crypto firms entering, or on the cusp of entering, public markets. If there is a wild card, though, it may be the firm’s senior leadership. Following our sit-down interview, Sethi and I take a turn around his Menlo Park neighborhood, and return to his house for dinner with a member of his team and a cousin who has turned up. The meal is delicious but unusual. The cousin has arrived with coolers full of stone crabs, which he and Sethi scatter on plates of ice around the kitchen. There is a shortage of crab utensils, but since this is Silicon Valley, Sethi punches an order into an app and more appear at the door in a matter of minutes—a trick he performs several times over the course of my visit. The main course comes in the form of thin, marinated fillets of something (Sethi won’t say what) that have arrived in a same-day delivery from Wyoming. Sethi artfully grills the stack of fillets in his backyard, serving them with a nice California red, and that’s all. The dinner was par for the course for how Kraken operates more broadly. For its first decade, Kraken was defined by its cofounder Jesse Powell. A soft-spoken philosophy major and self-described introvert, Powell steered the company through various crises that buffeted the crypto industry. At some point along the way, he took on a more abrasive persona on X, posting comments on topics like gender and pronouns that made him a villain among certain mainstream media outlets. A working-class kid from Sacramento, Powell has also been game to spar with San Francisco liberals, including by suing a co-op he says denied his bid to buy a unit on grounds of his politics. (The case is ongoing.) In 2022, Powell stepped down as CEO amid a federal investigation into his role at a Sacramento arts nonprofit he had founded. The probe created a multiyear legal ordeal for Powell, including an FBI raid of his house that was leaked to the New York Times. The Justice Department this summer acknowledged Powell had done nothing wrong, but the three-year legal cloud resulted in tumult at the top of Kraken. On stepping down, Powell named longtime lieutenant Dave Ripley as CEO, but last year the company announced Sethi had taken on the role of co-CEO. A co-CEO arrangement is unusual at the best of times, and according to multiple people with ties to the company, it is basically a fiction in the case of Kraken. One former executive, who asked not to be named in order to speak candidly, said that on a Zoom call shortly after the co-CEO announcement, an employee asked Powell who would be making decisions; the founder stated definitely that Sethi would decide everything—even as Ripley, the now co-CEO, sat nearby. That same person praised Sethi’s command of product, but also complained that the new leader appeared indifferent to staff morale, and has run Kraken more like a venture capital firm than a company, relying on outside associates more than longtime staff. The person added that Sethi’s ongoing ties to Tribe Capital, where he is chairman, pose a conflict of interest. “Arjun is chairman of Tribe Capital, but doesn’t run [Tribe’s] business day to day. This arrangement was approved by both the Kraken board and his LPAC [limited partner advisory committee] at Tribe,” said a Kraken spokesperson. Sethi’s arrival also roughly coincided with the departure of a number of senior executives, including Kraken’s CTO, COO, senior sales staff, and longtime lawyer. While executive turnover occurs at every organization, the scope of change at Kraken has likely contributed to the company’s IPO bid getting pushed to 2026 even as a spate of other crypto firms have gone public this year. The Kraken spokesperson addressed the turnover by pointing to an October blog post by Sethi and Ripley titled “A New Day,” which notes: “We made a number of changes to the organization to eliminate layers and make the organization leaner and faster.” She acknowledged the shake-up had affected morale, but added that employees are now “energized and excited” as Kraken’s pace of shipping products picks up. Another former executive contacted by Fortune, who asked not to be identified owing to legal constraints, also made the case that Sethi’s disruptive management style was necessary to prepare the company for its IPO push. The person added that Kraken’s many years in business had resulted in more pre-IPO regulatory and operational issues than other firms, and added that the co-CEO role has served the company well, with Ripley excelling at internal operational issues and Sethi handling sales and public-facing roles. For his part, Sethi described his co-CEO as a “multiplier of the strategy because Kraken has so many products” and said he is seeking to build a management structure similar to what Mark Zuckerberg has done at Meta, where dedicated teams serve each of the company’s discrete brands. Following a period of investor exuberance that peaked in 2021, the window for new companies to go public all but closed as investors came to see startup valuations as overly inflated. That finally changed this year, and for crypto companies, a new appetite for public companies combined with regulatory tailwinds has led to an IPO bonanza. In the past few months, stablecoin issuer Circle enjoyed one of the biggest same-day IPO pops in corporate history, while lesser lights of the crypto scene like Gemini and Bullish also made successful public debuts. For Kraken’s investors, the company’s decision to wait until 2026 to list publicly is likely a source of frustration and anxiety. Will the market still be eager for another crypto IPO? There is cause for concern on this front. There are a growing number of indicators that current stock prices are overvalued, and in the case of the newly listed crypto firms, their business prospects appear tenuous. In Circle’s case, declining interest rates are a direct drag on the firm’s stablecoin revenue, while both Bullish and Gemini have far fewer customers than the likes of Kraken and Coinbase. If the current crypto bull run is followed by a crash, as has happened in numerous previous cycles, these firms’ share prices risk being clobbered. All of this increases the pressure on Kraken to hasten its IPO. But if the bottom falls out of the market before it has time to list, Kraken investors can take comfort that—far more than most other crypto firms—it has a sound business model and multiple revenue streams. The company is also seeing growth in numerous key markets outside of its longtime strongholds of Europe and the U.K. This means Kraken, regardless of how its IPO plans shake out, is built to play the long game. “Our model’s built around pro traders and institutions,” says Sethi. “Features like Kraken Pro, our robust API, and advanced interfaces make us a destination for funds and high-volume clients—they use our exchange not because it’s flashy, but because it works and the liquidity is deep.” In the future, Kraken will be in an even better position if Sethi’s vision of a total convergence of traditional finance and crypto comes to pass. If it does, the company’s investors and executives—especially Sethi—stand to make a tidy bundle. So much so that Sethi will have the resources to easily fund a charm offensive to win over his suspicious neighbors—provided, of course, that he cares about such things. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

September 25, 2025 23 min read Computer Punch Cards, Coding Pipeline Problems, and the Future of Women in AI Carla Brodley, founding executive director of the Center for Inclusive Computing at Northeastern University, explains how to make computer science education more accessible to everyone By Katie Hafner, Laura Isensee & The Lost Women of Science Initiative Lily Whear (composite) In high school, Carla Brodley was almost shut out of computer science when boys took over all the computers. But she rediscovered her love for the field in college and has made it her mission to open doors for others. She became founding executive director of the Center for Inclusive Computing, which now partners with more than 100 institutions to make computer science more accessible, at Northeastern University, where she also served as dean of Northeastern’s Khoury College of Computer Sciences from 2014 to 2921. As a result of Brodley’s work, including her push to introduce more flexible degree programs, more women—and especially, more women of color—have not only enrolled but also stayed in the field. Now, with support from Pivotal, a group of organizations founded by Melinda French Gates, Brodley is aiming to scale up her efforts. Today she joins Lost Women of Science host Katie Hafner to share her journey, new paths to computer science and the way artificial intelligence fits in.

TRANSCRIPT Carla Brodley: It turns out that because of the way our systems have worked in this country, that the people most often who've not had access to computer science in high school are the people that would, if we could make it so that they enjoyed and persisted in computer science would change the demographics. Katie Hafner: I am Katie Hafner, and welcome to the latest episode of Lost Women of Science Conversations where we talk with authors, artists, and others who've discovered and celebrated female scientists in books, poetry, film, and the visual arts. Today I'm joined by Carla Brodley. She's a computer scientist and the founding Executive director of the Center for Inclusive Computing at Northeastern University in Boston. Carla has led the center to impressive success, not only to draw more women and women of color into the study of computer science, but to retain them. The center partners with more than a hundred universities and institutions across the United States. And at those partner institutions, the number of women and people of color studying computer science who complete their degrees has increased dramatically. Today we're going to learn what's behind this success, what's next for inclusive computing and why it's all very personal for Carla Brodley. Carla, thank you so much for joining me today. Actually, in person at WBUR in Boston, one of my favorite radio stations that I grew up with, I hasten to add. Carla Brodley: I'm delighted to be here, Katie, and to talk about a subject that I love. Katie Hafner: I have to say, Carla and I go pretty much way back. We've been talking about this intractable, uh, I don't know if you'd agree with me that it's still an intractable problem of women in computing for a while. I've been writing about it for a long time, actually, since my daughter was born 32 years ago. This problem of attracting women to, and mostly retaining them. Computing and I wanted to start out by asking you your story and how you became a computer scientist. Carla Brodley: I always loved as a kid playing with blocks and building things, and I think my parents thought I was gonna be an architect because I loved math and I loved making things with my hands. And I went to high school in Bloomington, Indiana and I took a computer science class 'cause my father suggested it. And I was in ninth grade and this was a huge high school, 2000 people. And I had gym right ahead of my computer science class and. The gym was about as far from the math department as you could possibly get in this large sprawling, you know, rural high school. And I would run and I would get to the class and both computers would already be taken and there were nine other students in the class, and they were all boys and perhaps they hadn't gone through puberty yet and understood the value of the nerd girl in their future, and they did not allow me to touch the computer. And so I talked to the teacher who was a math teacher and mostly just sat there and let us do what we wanted to do, and he said I needed to work it out with the kids. So I wrote my programs by hand and I debugged them by hand and it was fun, but it was fairly discouraging and I didn't go on. Katie Hafner: Just to be clear, you wrote them and debugged them by hand and you still got an A, right? Carla Brodley: Correct. I got an A. And at that point, frankly, computer programs were fairly simple and the ones that they would have you write in grade nine were very simple. So you could do that and. We moved to Boston when I was 16. I went to a wonderful, more liberal arts focused high school, and I've always loved to read. So when I headed to McGill University, I decided to major in English and my parents rolled their eyes and tried to suggest that I do math. Katie Hafner: What a reversal that you, it's not like you wanted to do something in science and they said, no, no, no. A girl doesn't belong in science. You headed to English. Right? And they said … Carla Brodley: And they just rolled their eyes and said, you're not very good at English, you're much better at math. What are you doing? And I was rebelling as 17 year olds do. And that comes to one of the principles that I've always said as part of the work that I do. Now, why do we let 17 year olds decide who goes into tech? A 17-year-old often is making decisions that are not the best for their future. So I got to McGill and I was in my English classes and I love to read, but I don't really like to write that much. And so I didn't do very well, so I thought, well, this isn't very practical. I think I'll be an econ major. And then my roommate, who was a metallurgical engineering student, came home one day and she threw this pack of cards down on the table and she looked at me and she goes, Ugh, you would like computer science? And I thought, huh. I don't know. Maybe I would Katie Hafner: You mean a pack of computer punch cards? Carla Brodley: Yes. Uhhuh. I am that old. And for those who are much younger, a little bit about punch cards. So back when your grandparents were, um, studying computer science, the way that, um, computers worked was you had these punch cards and each row, or each column, I've forgotten now, which it was, uh. You could punch out one little part of it and then that would be. Like a letter and you'd have a whole bunch of letters, and that would be a computer instruction on each card. And then you'd have a stack of these and you'd feed them through a card reader that would look for the holes, translate that into the electrical impulses of zeros and ones, which is the language that computer understands, and from that execute the code. Katie Hafner: So punched or not punched. Punched or not punched. Mm-hmm. Carla Brodley: Now interestingly enough, if you dropped those cards on the floor, you spent a long time reordering them. Katie Hafner: Uhhuh. I can imagine. Yeah. So imagine, Carla Brodley: You know, an analogy would be you've written a paper and you've got words, and then you accidentally drop them on the floor, all the words individually, and now you have to put them back into the sentences. Not fun to drop those cards. Katie Hafner: So your roommate, whose name was. Carla Brodley: Paula Magdi. Katie Hafner: So Paula, this metallurgical engineering student, she throws these computer cards on the kitchen table and says, okay, this is something you, Carla would like, and you then Carla Brodley: It was not a compliment. Let me just make that very clear. So I thought, huh, that's interesting. So I signed up to take Fortran programming. We were on terminals. Mm-hmm. So I didn't have to do the cards. I'm not sure I would've loved computer science, had I had to do the cards, but I was able to program. By the second program, I still remember the second program was Newton's method, which is a way of mathematically solving integration. I was hooked. I was like, this is so much fun. And by the end of the semester, and it was my second semester of my second year of university, I remember calling my mother and saying, I really think I should change my major to math and computer science. And my mother was like. Well, why do you think that? I'm like, it's so exciting. It's so fun. I can't wait to do the assignments. She says, it's a no brainer. You should do this. Oh, and so I did, and it was the best decision I ever made. Now I had straight A's in everything. Katie Hafner: Okay, so this is so great hearing your story. Clearly you were inspired to use that inspiration that you had to become an educator and build an education program and a curriculum that makes computer science more inclusive and supportive. Uh, so is that correct? Carla Brodley: It is correct. When I became Dean of Cory College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern, and now I had the ability to work with the university, work with the faculty to think about how do we make it such that everybody could discover, have a sense of belonging and persist in computer science. And in particular, I also wanted to think deeply about the problem of what if I hadn't discovered computer science? What if I'd graduated with that degree in economics? But then later I discovered computer science. And that was the birth of really thinking about the Master's in computer science for people who didn't study computer science as undergraduates. And the program had already had a nascent start at the university before I got there, and they were thinking about this program as a way for people to switch fields in STEM. When I took over, I changed it to be, you could be from any field, you could be a theater major, you could be a dance major, you could be a business major. And how would we prepare you to join the direct entry Master's students? Those that came with an undergraduate degree in computer science to thrive, persist, and graduate with a master's and go work in industry. Katie Hafner: And what year was this? Carla Brodley: This was in 2014. Katie Hafner: Oh, so relatively recently. Yeah. Carla Brodley: So we started small because I wanted to make sure that companies were gonna like this type of graduate Katie Hafner: Companies, meaning those who would be hiring. Carla Brodley: Yeah. And it turned out they were more popular with companies than the students who had done computer science throughout. Katie Hafner: This is reminding me so much of kids who major in something else and then go on to get a post back for going to medical school. My own daughter majored in religious studies and went on to go to medical school and they loved her application because she had this sort of very rich different background. Do you think that's part of it? Carla Brodley: Very much so. The industry loved the diversity of thought that came from these students. This program is called the Align Masters in Computer Science at Northeastern University, and I spoke to one of our biggest employers, which was Amazon and they told me that when you have an employee who maybe majored in English or history or something in the liberal arts and then gets a computer science degree, that their ability to think about the problems and their ability to talk about the problems is at a whole other level than someone who's just studied computer science. And then if you think about the students that maybe had an undergraduate degree in biology and chemistry, and now they have a master's in computer science with a specialty in data science. You know, who does the biotech company or the pharmaceutical company wanna hire is the person who can understand both sides of what it is they're trying to do. Katie Hafner: The very human side, and I think this is actually a good time to interject with an experienceI had recently where I gave a commencement speech at San Francisco State University to the computer science department. And when I was preparing it, I had long conversations with the chair of the department who was so kind of down in the dumps about his graduates four years ago. They enter computer science with just such high hopes and enter AI into the equation. So now these kids are having trouble finding jobs because of AI. And I said to him, should I even mention AI in the speech? He said, better not. Carla Brodley: First of all, I think that it's not clear to me that AI is what's taking the jobs, even though that makes a fancy headline. I think that we're in an interesting time where there was a lot of hiring during COVID in tech because the whole world thought we were just gonna be all tech all the time. So, I think some of the layoffs that have happened are corrections of the over hiring. And second, I think there's a lot of uncertainty in the business world right now with high interest rates and an inability to know exactly what's gonna happen with the economy. And so companies are not hiring a lot. I think that there will still be jobs. I think we're in a somewhat unique place where AI is happening at the exact same time as all of these economic factors. Katie Hafner: Interesting. Carla Brodley: And I don't think we're gonna know for another year or two whether it's actually the business environment that we're in right now, and the uncertainty around the future of business and how we're gonna proceed as a country versus how AI is impacting the workforce. So I, I think that it's an interesting time, but I do think very much so that the student that is trained in computer science and another field is gonna be the most desirable on the market. Katie Hafner: So let's talk more about that training and how CIC is changing how students are learning computer science. What do you see as the biggest barrier? When you look at a traditional computer science degree program, Carla Brodley: The number one biggest barrier for a student who's new to computer science, and that is more often women or people from races and ethnicities that have been historically minoritized in tech and students of all genders, races, and ethnicities from high schools that don't have computer science. And only 56% of our schools nationwide in the United States offer computer science in high school. And it's often an elective. And my own sons told me, taking computer science in high school was social suicide. So the only way we're gonna change who goes into computer science in high school is if it's required for all students. Katie Hafner: That's a classic pipeline problem. Carla Brodley: That is a classic pipeline problem. So now fast forward and students are in university and maybe they're interested in computer science and they walk into the class and maybe they're part of the majority group, maybe they're not, in terms of demographics and there's people that are in that classroom that are talking about, you know what they got on the AP Computer Science. They're asking questions like, is that a Boolean? Is that an inherited class? And the student who's new to computer science is sitting there and saying, “a Boolena”, what’s an inherited who? And the analogy I like to use is, imagine you're 18, you've gone to university, and you decide to take Japanese or French or Spanish, and you walk into the classroom and you look different than everybody in the classroom, and everybody else is already talking in that language. Katie Hafner: So this seems to go straight to the heart of your philosophy, which is this idea that it's not the person who's the problem, that it's the curriculum that's too rigid. That, that whole idea of a flexible curriculum, is that right? Carla Brodley: It's the system. It's the way the institution has decided to offer computer science. There are several ways to take that feeling out of the classroom. One way is to just make multiple sections of your first class. Let's call that CS one and have students self-select whether they would like to be in a class with true beginners or in a class with more experienced students. And then the key is that they learn the same things. They have the same assignments and the same exams. All you've done is remove the stress of sitting in a room with a bunch of know-it-alls. And there's a few other solutions to this problem of having this distribution of prior experience with some people having quite a bit of experience and some people completely new to coding. We have about five different approaches for universities to take. And when we work with universities, we try to figure out what's gonna work for them in terms of the approaches. Katie Hafner: Yes, because every university has its own individual sort of set of problems Carla Brodley: And what language they use and how that impacts what the AP computer science test is in, and whether they have a lot of transfer students from community college. So every university context is really important, but the principle is the same: Don't lump them all together. Katie Hafner: Right. And don't just assume everybody does the same thing. I have actually watched you in action. I followed you once to one of these universities where you met with the computer science department and you're just so good at listening. You're almost like a therapist in a way. Let's talk about required classes. Just an example: calculus for a lot of students, myself included, that class can feel incredibly intimidating. It's like organic chemistry from pre-med. It isn't essential for every computer science career, but it is required to complete the degree, and in your research, it shows up as one of the biggest roadblocks as. Especially for women. Let's not forget, we're talking here about women and the retention of women. So why is that, and what do you think could make this hurdle a little less intimidating? Carla Brodley: Only 20% of high school graduates have taken calculus, which means that the majority of people heading to university have not taken calculus. They may not even be what's called calculus ready, which means they've taken pre-calc, and so that means that students come to university. With various levels of prior math exposure and the biggest mistake the computer science department can make, whether or not they require calculus, that's not the biggest mistake. The biggest mistake is tying progression in the computer science classes to progression in the math classes. Let me be more specific, requiring calc one before they can take the first computer science class or the second computer science class as a prerequisite. As a prerequisite, that's a mistake because it's not relevant to the first class and it's maybe not that much fun versus the first computer science class which is unbelievably fun if you're gonna like computer science, Katie Hafner: Right? Carla Brodley: Not all computer scientists like calculus. Katie Hafner: Right. Yeah, that's such a good point. Like it's, so there's this really special switch that gets switched on when you are turned on a computer science. I think that's absolutely right. More after the break. Katie Hafner: Okay, so here we are talking about curricula and formal teaching. Carla, I can't do this whole episode with you without asking you about figures in history. Uh, women in computer science, in the history of computer science. For instance, one of the women we featured was Klára Dán von Neumann who knew nothing about computing because it kind of didn't even really exist when her husband, John von Neumann, sort of taught her. She did some of the very first modern style code on a computer in the 1940s. But she'd never been able to do what she ended up doing if she'd gone through all that calculus rigamarole, or she never even learned any of that. And there's another figure in history who I just found out about named Sharla Perrine Boehm. So you can tell me, have you ever heard of Sharla? Carla Brodley: I don't think so. Katie Hafner: Thank you. That's my point exactly. It turns out that she was instrumental in developing packet switching, and her name is on some of the early packet switching papers. Uh, so, excuse me. Like it was somebody who brought her to our attention. And do you think that there are a lot of women out there like her, like Klára, who did important things in computing early on, who we still need to dig and find? I would imagine so Carla Brodley: Given that I didn't know who this person was. Katie Hafner: Right? And you look so sort of chagrined and contrite, like, I'm sorry, I don't know. But of course you shouldn't be chagrined and contrite because I didn't know, and I wrote a whole book about it. And I love discovering them; and talk about persevering. I mean, these women must have done something really, um, what's the word? Uh, unusual to achieve what they achieved. And I think that what you are doing with CIC is just smoothing the way. Would you agree with that? Carla Brodley: I think that I'm helping make sustainable systemic change in the institutions themselves so that the barriers that they've unwittingly and unknowingly constructed. So, not intentionally. I don't think so. In fact, when it's explained to them why having calc one as a prereq for the first computer science class as a mistake, they get it. They just hadn't thought about it. They did not do it on purpose. So an example of a barrier is you all can try CS one and CS two, the first two classes, and you should take calc one and calc two. And then depending on your GPA, you can get the golden ticket of being the computer science major. And that's biased toward people who've already had computer science in high school and who's already had computer science in high school Katie Hafner: Boys, Carla Brodley: Asian boys in particular. Katie Hafner: Oh, interesting. Yeah, of course. The very ninth graders who wouldn't, those ninth graders Carla Brodley: That wouldn't let me touch the computer. Katie Hafner: Uh, okay. So I hear you wanna make a sustainable, inclusive computer science program at institutions all over the country. What real world results have you seen so far? Carla Brodley: So there are 50 universities offering or about to offer the bridge to the Master's program for people who didn't study computer science. And so that means that those people will be new to computer science and they will come from all, you know, demographic identities, and that's really exciting. And at the undergraduate level, at the schools that we've worked with for long enough to be able to have measurable results, which are, uh, 21 of our 35 schools that we've worked deeply with at the undergraduate level, we have seen incredible increases in groups that have been historically underrepresented in tech and in particular, one of my favorite statistics is African American women from fall of 19 to fall of 2023, have gone up by 136% and yet wait 136. And you could say, well, that's because maybe the number was very small, but that's 455 net new Black women in computer science at these 21 universities. Katie Hafner: That's pretty incredible. Yeah. So hats off to you. So what are some other new initiatives that you're working on that you're excited about? Carla Brodley: I'm super excited about two new initiatives, and both of them are really designed to make people versatile in today's world. There are also ways to help students discover computer science because if I hadn't had that experience where my roommate insulted me into trying it, I would've never discovered it. Katie Hafner: Shout out to Paula. Thank you, Paula. And so I started thinking about this, and when I got to Northeastern there was this idea of a combined major. And when I looked at this, we had 12 of them when I joined as Dean in 2014. And they were all the things that computer scientists thought made sense. And I was like, such as? Physics and computer science, electrical engineering and computer science. Math and computer science. And then there was this one design and computer science in our college of arts, media and design. And I saw that all the demographic diversity was in that one, especially the gender diversity. And I thought about it and I'm like computer sciences for everyone and everything. And so during my time as Dean, I added 36 more, like English and computer science, cybersecurity, criminal justice, data science in every field of stem. And now, fast forward to today, these programs kept growing. We have 46 different interdisciplinary majors. Katie Hafner: Really Carla Brodley: Over 50% of our students are now pursuing these interdisciplinary degrees. They're very popular with industry. Again, these students get hired at the juncture of their fields or in one or the other of their two fields. I wanted to take this idea out to other universities to show that it could be done at large, complicated public universities of all sorts. So we created a portfolio of universities. We have eight of them in the portfolio. They're in different parts of the country. They're different types of universities. Some are top ranked universities in computer science, some are flagship, some are more open access, and we're working with them to do all of the work under the hood to enable these interdisciplinary majors. And we have several of these universities starting offering this fall and others are on track for next fall. And offering these interdisciplinary majors like computer science and neuroscience, um, psychology and computer science. Katie Hafner: That's fascinating. So tell me about the second initiative you're excited about. Carla Brodley: Well, I think it's on everybody's lips right now: AI Katie Hafner: uhhuh Carla Brodley: And thinking about how do we make sure that women are going into technical AI education, or all people are going into technical AI education. Some of the things we're thinking about are: can we create specialized math classes for AI that don't take the same amount of time as going through the topics sequentially in the math department. To really do machine learning, you need to have ideas from calc one, from calculus two, from linear algebra and probability and statistics. Katie Hafner: But not everything. Carla Brodley: But not everything. And not necessarily the way the math department would teach them with the proofs. We need to know how to apply them and to understand them in computer science. And so we're starting to think about an initiative where people create math for CS, math for AI classes as part of this initiative otherwise students can't take their first AI class until their fifth, sixth, or seventh semester in university, and that's too late. We're also thinking about how do you bring AI into the very first courses so people can see the applicability of machine learning algorithms perhaps in medicine. Or in science or in the digital humanities, Katie Hafner: And you just got a really wonderful, large investment. Tell us about that. Carla Brodley: We just received a wonderful gift to support our initiatives both around the systemic change in undergraduate programs and in particular around the systemic changes needed to be made in AI from Pivotal, which is Melinda French Gates's organization, where they've really, really invested in women in, in innovation and tech. Katie Hafner: Shout out to Melinda French Gates and Pivotal, for doing that. I mean, she has done tremendous work in helping women thrive in the workplace, right? Carla Brodley: She's one of my heroes. We have been very fortunate to get an investment substantial enough that we'll be able to move the needle in AI across many universities in this country. Katie Hafner: That is amazing. I don't wanna be a Debbie Downer here, but it does make me sad to think about other sources of funding that have been drying up. I don't think we can have this conversation without talking about that. So many of these publicly funded initiatives are suffering. What are your thoughts on not just that in general, but about the backlash against diversity and equity efforts? Carla Brodley: I think that it, there are many ways to achieve diversity and equity in terms of initiatives, and the CIC has always focused on fixing the system rather than doing things around individuals. And it turns out that when you fix the system, you often get the results that you're hoping for. We didn't do anything specific for black women and yet they went up by 136%. We just stopped doing things that don't work for true beginners. And true beginners can be white men as well. And so it benefits everybody. So there's things that we can be doing that are not program or individual demographic specific that will change it and make it better. Katie Hafner: Have you had to go back as so many others have and scrub out some of this language on your website? Words like inclusive, and obviously you can't because it's in your name. Carla Brodley: We kept inclusive because we really mean inclusive in its largest sense. We include everybody. We include white men from every state in this country. Right? It really is inclusive. We always had the mission that we wouldn't work with any particular group. That was always my desire. It was to open up new pathways so that people who had felt excluded could come in, but people who didn't feel excluded but just hadn't noticed it yet could come in as well. Katie Hafner: So to wrap up, I wanted to ask you to give advice to educators at all levels, whether it's primary education all the way up to advanced degrees. What would be your best advice when it comes to opening up young minds? Carla Brodley: I would say look at the systems and the regulations and the way in which you're offering your programs, and think about whether you really have a door that's open to everybody to explore, to discover, and to persist in whatever makes their heart sing, and to make no assumptions that someone who's new to a field isn't good at the field. Katie Hafner: Well, Carla Brodley, I would like to thank you so much for coming on to lost Women of Science Conversations to talk to us about this extremely important topic and all that you're doing. Carla Brodley: Katie, it's been my pleasure to be here with you. And I just wanna share a little personal anecdote that last night my book group met and because I told them you were interviewing me, we decided to listen to the very first season of Lost Women of Science as our book for this session. And we spoke about it last night and oh my God, two of us are scientists that are in the group, and we talked about Rachel Maddow's you know dude Wall and and the two of us that were scientists who had leadership positions shared that we weren't on the dude wall and had to advocate for ourselves to get up there. And I just wanted to say thank you, not only for today, but for the wonderful discussion that we had last night at my book group. Katie Hafner: That's so nice to hear. And just to clarify, the dude wall refers to all the portraits that you see when you go into, say, a museum or a university or a medical school of all the basically white men who are up on the wall. And thank you so much. What a very nice thing that your book group did that. And with that, I would like to thank you for that and also so much for coming on Lost Women of Science Conversations.

Title: Senators Want Answers From Big Tech on H-1B Workers, Layoffs

Posted on 09/25/2025 9:52:42 AM PDT by marcusmaximus Big U.S. companies are facing heightened scrutiny from Capitol Hill over their use of foreign employees on H-1B visas, with lawmakers raising concerns about layoffs and slumping job prospects for Americans. On Wednesday evening, Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) and Ranking Member Dick Durbin (D., Ill.) sent letters to the country’s largest users of H-1B visas—including Amazon, Apple and JPMorgan Chase—asking them to explain why they continue to hire thousands of H-1B visa holders while also cutting other jobs. The senators asked for detailed information on how many H-1B workers the companies employ, what wages they are paid, and whether American workers have been displaced in the process. The letters cited reporting by the Journal about the weak tech job market. The move comes less than a week after President Trump announced an overhaul of the H-1B program, including a new $100,000 fee for companies sponsoring foreign workers. That move caused panic for some companies worried they could retroactively be on the hook for fee payments. They mobilized HR teams and lawyers to address employee concerns and ensure compliance. The H-1B system, created in 1990, is the primary pathway for foreign professionals to work in the U.S. Roughly 700,000 people currently live in the country on H-1B visas, according to a National Foundation for American Policy analysis of government data, with technology firms among the biggest users. Most H-1B holders are from India and China. Amazon, the largest H-1B sponsor in the U.S., won approval for more than 14,000 new hires on the visa in fiscal 2025—the most of any company—even as it has announced layoffs affecting tens of thousands of jobs in recent years.

The senators asked for detailed information on how many H-1B workers the companies employ, what wages they are paid, and whether American workers have been displaced in the process. The letters cited reporting by the Journal about the weak tech job market. The move comes less than a week after President Trump announced an overhaul of the H-1B program, including a new $100,000 fee for companies sponsoring foreign workers. That move caused panic for some companies worried they could retroactively be on the hook for fee payments. They mobilized HR teams and lawyers to address employee concerns and ensure compliance. The H-1B system, created in 1990, is the primary pathway for foreign professionals to work in the U.S. Roughly 700,000 people currently live in the country on H-1B visas, according to a National Foundation for American Policy analysis of government data, with technology firms among the biggest users. Most H-1B holders are from India and China. Amazon, the largest H-1B sponsor in the U.S., won approval for more than 14,000 new hires on the visa in fiscal 2025—the most of any company—even as it has announced layoffs affecting tens of thousands of jobs in recent years.

Title: Opendoor Stock Jumps as Trading Giant Jane Street Discloses Stake

Full Content:
Trading giant Jane Street now owns 5.9% in Opendoor Technologies, the online real-estate platform that has become a favorite of retail traders. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday, Jane Street said its stake in Opendoor (OPEN) amounted to around 44 million shares, translating to a value of roughly $362 million based on Wednesday’s closing price Jane Street is known for its sophisticated high-frequency trading systems. It's unclear if the investment is a bet on the company or marks a hedging position. Opendoor has become a meme stock, bought by retail investors on the back of social media hype, while Jane Street is a big institutional firm famed for its sophisticated trading systems. Jane Street's investment shows the home-buying firm is on the radar of large investors. Opendoor shares were up more than 8% in recent trading. They have been on a tear since July as retail investors piled in and have gained 450% so far this year. Its shares soared earlier this month after the company brought in former Shopify (SHOP) COO Kaz Nejatian as its new CEO, brought its founders onto the board, and got an infusion of cash. Like most of its meme stock peers including GameStop (GME), the video-game retailer that defined the craze in 2021, Opendoor is unprofitable and is also heavily shorted by hedge funds. Wall Street is broadly negative on Opendoor, with four of six analysts tracked by Visible Alpha issuing "sell" ratings and the other two with "hold" calls. The mean price target of analysts surveyed by VA is $1.02, versus its share price close yesterday of $8.23.

Title: U.S. lawmakers seek answers from Apple, other major U.S. firms about H-1B visa use amid layoffs

Update font size. Reset U.S. lawmakers have asked major U.S. companies including Apple, Amazon, and JPMorgan on Thursday to explain why they are hiring thousands of foreign workers on H-1B visas while cutting other jobs. Reuters: ‎ The letter comes after the Trump administration announced last week that it would ask companies to pay $100,000 per year for H-1B visas, which allow businesses to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations. The U.S. has also released a proposal that would rework the H-1B visa selection process to favor higher-skilled and better-paid workers. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley and Senator Dick Durbin, a Democrat, asked 10 major employers for detailed information on the number of H-1B workers they employ, the wages they are paid, and whether American workers have been displaced in the process. “With all of the homegrown American talent relegated to the sidelines, we find it hard to believe that Amazon cannot find qualified American tech workers to fill these positions,” the senators wrote to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy. India was the largest beneficiary of H-1B visas last year, accounting for 71% of approved beneficiaries, while China was a distant second at 11.7%, according to government data. ‎ MacDailyNews Take: India will come to the table on trade and this will be the bargaining chip that swings the deal. ‎ Please help support MacDailyNews — and enjoy subscriber-only articles, comments, chat, and more — by subscribing to our Substack: macdailynews.substack.com. Thank you! Support MacDailyNews at no extra cost to you by using this link to shop at Amazon. If a company is firing more than 2-3% of their workers in any sector, they should not get H-1B visas for that sector. (Fire all the HR, marketing, and advertising execs you want, but not highly trained, experienced positions.) H-1B visa workers should be guaranteed at least a median wage for that position. Maybe the government should insist that H-1B visa holders are always in the 80th percentile or something. H-1B visa workers should be guaranteed third party mediation if they suspect their wages aren’t competitive. H-1B visa workers should be guaranteed some kind of freedom of movement if they can show their compensation is not competitive. Companies shouldn’t be able to kick H-1B workers to the curb if they point out any kind of exploitation. Any company accepting H-1B workers in any department, can’t fire or “retire” workers in that department for 2-3 years. $100K seems excessive–after all, we do want the best and brightest to come to the USA—but in no way should H-1B visas be allowed to artificially depress workers compensation. No company should be able to have more than 5% of its employees on H-1B visas. Companies asking for H-1B visas must offer significant scholarships, apprenticeships, or work-study programs to American employees to acquire the education/training/degrees necessary in those areas which they claim lack qualified American workers. Companies asking for H-1B visas must donate significant resources to local schools to enhance or kick-start programs in those fields which they claim lack qualified American workers and work closely with those schools to provide apprenticeship programs. Also this: In a 2011 interview with biographer Walter Isaacson, Jobs revealed that he had met with US President Barack Obama, complained about the nation’s shortage of software engineers, and told Obama that he was “headed for a one-term presidency”. Jobs proposed that any foreign student who got an engineering degree at a US university should automatically be offered a green card. After the meeting, Jobs commented, “The president is very smart, but he kept explaining to us reasons why things can’t get done … It infuriates me” The $100K fee should be yearly.

September 25, 2025 11:20 ET | Source: Faruqi & Faruqi LLP Faruqi & Faruqi LLP Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP Securities Litigation Partner James (Josh) Wilson Encourages Investors Who Suffered Losses In Novo To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you purchased or acquired securities in Novo between May 7, 2025, to July 28, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310). [You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, Sept. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) and reminds investors of the September 30, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Novo’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the Novo Nordisk class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/NVO or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

Title: Intel Shares Jump 6% After Reportedly Approaching Apple For Possible Investment

ByTy Roush, Forbes Staff. Intel has held talks with Apple about a possible investment, Bloomberg reported Thursday, the latest effort by the beleaguered chipmaker to reinforce its business in recent weeks with funding from Nvidia, SoftBank and partial ownership by the U.S. government. Discussions between Intel and Apple are at an early stage and include talks about the two companies working together more often, though it’s not clear whether an agreement will be reached, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Apple and Intel partnered for years as Intel provided chips for Apple computers, though their cooperation was cut after Apple announced in 2020 the company would produce its own processing units, and Apple has since unveiled a second iteration of its chip, the M2, which is manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. Intel shares rose by nearly 6% to just below $33 as of around 11:10 a.m. EDT, following an earlier premarket rally, while Apple’s stock ticked slightly higher (0.3%). Neither Apple nor Intel immediately responded to requests for comment from Forbes. Intel has reached out to other unspecified companies about potential investments and partnerships, according to Bloomberg. Intel’s shares have rebounded in recent months after the Trump administration signaled support for the chipmaker. President Donald Trump earlier this year called Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan “highly CONFLICTED” and urged Tan to resign, following his alleged ties to Chinese firms and a criminal case involving Cadence Design, where Tan previously served as CEO. Tan and Trump appeared to mend their relationship, however, after Tan visited the White House in August. Following the visit, SoftBank announced it would invest $2 billion in the company as part of both firms' “investing in advanced technology and semiconductor innovation” in the U.S., ranking SoftBank as Intel’s fifth-largest shareholder. Trump announced in late August that Intel agreed to give the U.S. a 10% stake in the company, making the federal government one of its largest shareholders behind BlackRock and Vanguard. Earlier this month, Nvidia said it would acquire $5 billion worth of Intel’s shares and announced the two companies would collaborate on developing custom data center and personal computer products.

Title: Trump's new H-1B visa fee could cost companies a lot more than $100K. Here's the potential impact across industries.

Hello, and RIP to Instagram (sort of). The app is testing out a new feed that opens right into its Reels feature. BI's Katie Notopoulos has more on the change. In other tech news, OpenAI's Sam Altman (yes, the Sam Altman) stopped by the Berlin headquarters of our parent company, Axel Springer. He chatted with the father of quantum computing, and they agreed on a Turing Test 2.0. In today's big story, we're looking at how President Donald Trump's new H-1B visa fee will impact Big Tech, startups, consulting, and Wall Street. What's on deck: Markets: The future of trading is … doing it in person. Wait, what? Tech: The startups making big money by training AI with humans. Business: Costco's new exclusive hours are proving to be a boon for the business. But first, the price of hiring just went up. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. The dust is still settling on President Donald Trump's new H-1B visa fee, but one thing seems clear: Corporate America is in for a shake-up. Late last week, Trump sent businesses into a bit of a tailspin when he announced that each H-1B visa, which allows companies to hire foreign skilled workers for specialized roles, would come with a $100,000 fee. There was some initial confusion about whether that fee applied to current visa holders (it doesn't). But even with the focus only on new visa applicants, the impact is still expected to be big. JPMorgan economists predict the US will see work authorizations drop by 5,500 a month. Business leaders continue to weigh in, with reactions ranging from optimism to concern. And while a lot still remains unknown, we're getting a sense of what it means for different industries. Here's a breakdown on how the new fee could impact some of the industries that rely on the H-1B visa the most. Big Tech: Tech giants are some of the biggest users of H-1B visas, so you'd think the new fee would hurt them the most. But size matters. When your company is worth more than $1 trillion, an extra $100,000 won't move the needle. In fact, you could argue that Big Tech would welcome the fee if it served as a deterrent to smaller competitors going after the same talent. Still, it's not all good news. The scale at which Big Tech companies hire workers on H-1B visas means the costs could eventually add up to billions of dollars for top sponsors. Startups: It's easy to think of startups as high-flying companies with lofty valuations, but the vast majority of them are simply small businesses. And without the deep pockets of their larger peers, startups could be left scrambling in the all-important war for talent. Even if a startup is willing to pay the $100,000 fee, it will almost certainly only do it for the most senior-level employees who have the skills and salary to justify the cost. You could argue that was the original intent of the visa, but the change could also upend the pipeline of young talent working at startups. Consulting: When it rains, it pours. Consultants aren't in a position of power, as we've covered here before, and the fee certainly won't help things. Simply put, consulting is experiencing a talent crisis, and any additional hurdle is likely to make it worse. In some cases, like data scientists and other highly technical roles, the competition for talent will just increase. However, building out offshore hubs in places like India, Mexico, the Philippines, and Argentina, which was already a trend, could be another option to bypass the visa issue entirely, analysts told BI. Wall Street: Financial firms aren't too far behind Big Tech when it comes to using H-1B visas. JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Citigroup each have more than a 1,000 certified H-1B filings. However, the calculation of H-1Bs on the Street is different than in Big Tech. A majority of financial firms' H-1B visa roles are focused on technology. And as much as banks and investment firms value their digital transformations, techies aren't as high in the hierarchy as money makers like traders, investment bankers, and wealth managers. Still, the visa feel will be felt on the Street, especially when it comes to Wall Street's junior banker hiring. 1. This retail investing platform wants to take trading IRL. Moomoo is opening a physical retail store in 2026, located in NYC's Herald Square. With human employees there to help, its CEO sees the storefront as an opportunity to increase brand trust and community engagement. 2. The US economy's greatest strength could turn out to be investors' biggest weakness. America's economic resilience has allowed it to escape many recession forecasts over the years. But that could create a blind spot, financial pros told BI. One strategist said investors' complacency is reminiscent of the 1990s. 3. This lowkey billionaire is the real winner of the new iPhone launch. Wang Laisheng's company, Luxshare Precision Industry, started out making accessories for Apple. Now, it assembles iPhones — and the recent iPhone 17 launch sent its stock spiking 32% and Laisheng's net worth to $14.3 billion. The success has even OpenAI knocking on its door. 1. AI companies are shelling out for human trainers. Companies are raising billions to recruit humans to teach chatbots everything from Japanese to finance to memes. Workers can earn hundreds of dollars an hour at some of these companies. See which startups are cashing in. 2. Post-IPO is not the time to rest on your laurels. As Klarna's staff celebrated its $15 billion IPO at its employee conference in Stockholm, CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski shared a stark text he received from chairman Michael Moritz: Klarna was still "10 years behind" a competitor. 3. Keep your friends close. Abridge became a $5.3 billion darling of healthcare tech with the help of medical records giant Epic. Now, Epic is releasing its own tech to compete with Abridge's AI medical scribe. It shows how partners and former shareholders can quickly become competitors. 1. Where does Trump vs. Kimmel go next? It's possible that the president will simply move on from his beef with Kimmel. But regardless of the aftermath, we should still take the whole ordeal seriously, writes BI's Peter Kafka. It's also shown Corporate America that there's one line it can't cross when it comes to free speech. 2. Costco is proving the haters wrong. Some employees were concerned that Costco's plans to open stores early for its executive members would backfire. Foot traffic data from Placer.ai says otherwise. The data indicates that the extended hours are getting customers to shop faster and more frequently. 3. Trump's economic holy trinity is a tough nut to crack. The president has three economic goals: boost US manufacturing, crack down on immigration, and keep prices low. These work fine on their own, or even in pairs, but many economists and trade experts say Trump can't accomplish all three at once. Here's why. Luigi Mangione's federal judge orders DOJ to stop making prejudicial pretrial statements after Trump retweets. Jimmy Kimmel's comeback show reached 6.26 million viewers, Disney says. Sean Combs launched a jailhouse 'Free Game with Diddy' course to teach fellow inmates business skills: lawyers. Disney investors demand internal records on Jimmy Kimmel's suspension, say the board may have breached duties. Honda ends production of its Acura EV in the US, citing 'market conditions.' Nexstar says it's 'engaged in productive discussions' with Disney but won't show Jimmy Kimmel yet. Dan DeFrancesco, deputy executive editor and anchor, in New York.

InfoQ Homepage Presentations Panel: Next Generation Inclusive UIs The panelists discuss creating inclusive XR environments. They explain how to prioritize accessibility in user testing, the importance of designing for diverse users from day one, and how team culture and modular UIs can foster innovation. They also highlight the business case for making accessibility a core part of an MVP to avoid technical debt. Erin Pañgilinan is Spatial Computing, AI Leader and author of "Creating Augmented and Virtual Realities: Theory and Practice for Next-Generation Spatial Computing". Colby Morgan is Technical Director @Mighty Coconut. Dylan Fox is Director of Operations @XR Access, previously UC Berkeley researcher & UX designer, expert on Accessibility for Emerging Technologies. Software is changing the world. QCon San Francisco empowers software development by facilitating the spread of knowledge and innovation in the developer community. A practitioner-driven conference, QCon is designed for technical team leads, architects, engineering directors, and project managers who influence innovation in their teams. Doyle: We're going to do a Q&A panel. We're going to dig in a little bit more on how augmented, virtual, and extended, and mixed reality unlock the ability to integrate the power of computers more seamlessly into our physical three-dimensional world. Designing that user experience of these next generation UIs to be as inclusive as possible comes with a lot of challenges. We're going to sit down and talk about what are some of the insights and strategies for creating more inclusive and accessible XR environments. Our speakers today, we have Colby Morgan, we've got Dylan Fox, and Erin Pañgilinan. How does the process of user testing differ when accessibility is a priority, and what are some best practices? Erin Pañgilinan: My friend, who's a co-founder of my previous non-profit that I co-founded with her for women that were working in ARVR, it was called ARVR Academy, Suzanne Leibrick, who used to actually be in Mixed Reality at Intel at the time, she talks about the concept of gameplay testing. If you really think about even in like AI development, you're not going to start with the most gigantic foundation model and the most amount of data. You're going to start off with something really small and simple and test it on 10 people. What I always encourage people to do since 2016 is to try as many different VR or AR, XR, demos as much as possible. When you're actually developing for a single experience, you're going to start with maybe just a few interactions at a single level and see if it works with actual people. If you get more than 60%, maybe you're in a good range. A lot of the time you'll actually try it in a bunch and you'll realize, this actually doesn't work. That way you're saving a lot of time when you're gameplay testing. That's the first thing I would say. It's pretty easy. It's just most people who haven't developed for games before, like I said in the background, but it's also in AI, in that space that haven't done it, I think you're going to always rapidly prototype the smallest MVP possible. Dylan Fox: I think for me, one of the challenges that we see with XR, as opposed to more mobile and desktop technology, is that it generally assumes that most people have either a desktop or a mobile phone at home, and that they are able to turn these on and operate them and use the application, often remotely, without necessarily needing any external help. If you want to have inclusive XR experiences, the unfortunate reality right now is that there are a lot of people who would be interested in using these, but may not have a headset at home, and even if they did have a headset at home, may not be able to take it out, get through the setup process, and put it on themselves and activate your application independently. Something that I noticed when I was running the experiments we did at UC Berkeley on using the HoloLens for low vision folks, is that these systems were not necessarily created with the idea that the person who is in the experience may not be the one who is operating the experience. I would love to see more support for experimenters, more support for caretakers. There's a lot of times, especially with new technology like XR, where you want to empower the person who is wearing the headset to just focus on the experience, and you want to offload some of that setup and execution to somebody who is helping them on the side. Making sure that you have those good tools, so that if I'm trying to run an experiment or user test for somebody who is totally blind, I can hand them the headset, they can put it on, and then I can get them into the application, get them set up, and monitor their progress. That's something that's not super well supported right now. It would be lovely to see better support for it. Colby Morgan: Especially when it comes to accessibility, I think that trying to get that early in your process, so as you're developing those features, it's part of your design process early on as well. Again, you're having opportunities to develop or solve issues before they become issues, especially when it comes to accessibility. I think a lot of it is just that early mindset, too. Accessibility and inclusive design is really about good design in general, so just really trying to make good products and good experiences that have a lot of that baked in. Again, you're reducing the amount that you have to do later on down the pipeline. I think, especially for user testing, obviously it's a really critical part of that, and so I think as much as possible trying to work with your users or the communities, people that can really give you the solid feedback about the accessibility tools that you may be working on or integrating. I think the big thing I always think about, too, is it's really easy to check a box or just get a feature in that it checks the box and does the bare minimum of it, but a lot of times finding what's giving users value is really critical to that step, and especially with XR in general. Again, it's such an immersive technology, and so you just want to make sure that the tools that you're putting in actually provide value for users. Erin Pañgilinan: My friend Nathan Ventura, who co-founded a company called Vinci Games, so he's YC backed. He's doing VR basketball. His game, Blacktop Hoops, when I first tried it, it was literally just like, here's the environment and shoot a basketball. He didn't have characters yet, which is now tied to a lot of IP and film, but I actually had, it was a demo at the Philippine Consulate, so he's Filipino, I'm Filipino. One of our other friends, he's number two in the world at combat design for Street Fighter, but he's a combat designer in most games. He probably played everything on every console, X-Men. I asked him, I was like, how was it? Did you break presence when you tried this? He's like, I didn't, but when I actually tried it, second time, I broke presence, which is something really common when you have VR, is like, I feel like I'm really in this environment, but it skips too much, or it'll have the most buggy things. You'll do a ton of work, but in practice, when you find out, I've spent maybe hundreds of hours developing this game, and find out it doesn't work. Another one I'll mention is a friend, Jazmin Cano, who actually has a chapter in my book. She's a technical 3D artist and an accessibility products manager. Her game, which was from Owlchemy Labs, so they were acquired by Google. If you've ever played Vacation Simulator or Job Simulator, this was their latest version. We tried it at Meta Connect, and most basic thing, Wi-Fi doesn't work. When we think about design, obviously Dylan's work focused a lot on differently-abled or disabled folks, and you're trying to expand the amount of diverse content creators, trying to get as inclusive as possible with your design. When it comes right down to it, it's not just good design, it's just basic engineering and functionality of Wi-Fi is not working at Meta, and so when I'm playing in this headset, I hear voices of other headsets being mixed together in a multiplayer environment with only less than 10 people. I'm like, that's pretty bad. That's not the fault of Owlchemy. It might have been the event people who were organizing at this conference. I like to think of gameplay testing in every type of environment, no matter how big or small. It's the one thing I'll say lastly, too. With Horizon, if you thought about during the pandemic, you're watching Meta Connect in VR, you could probably have hundreds of voices, but once you scale to thousands of people attending, couldn't really do that. Same idea. It's also just basic engineering when you think about latency and functionality at the end of the day, not just good design, but basic practices, and like, does this work or not? Doyle: How do we ensure that inclusivity and accessibility are integral parts of the UI design process from day one rather than add it on later when we maybe find it in testing? Colby Morgan: I think part of that is, it touches back to the culture of a team and just making sure that the team behind it, the team behind the designs, the UI, the concept, the development, have a lot of those concepts. Part of their workflows, and everyone's on the same page as far as what you're working towards. The culture is part of that. For me, XR is such an immersive technology, and the social presence and the connection is such a huge part of that, and so you want to make that as inclusive as possible and as easy as possible to get into. I think for a lot of people, XR is just a lot. It can be a cognitive overload of trying to get into an experience. Obviously, it takes over your vision and all that. I think just, again, leaning back to just good XR design to make things simple and easy to operate and easy to get people in regardless of their experience level, because I think with every new technology there's always going to be people that are new to it, and there's always going to be that struggle. Again, just relying on those designs that make it really easy to get people in and participating. Dylan Fox: I think the single biggest thing in my mind to make sure that you have accessibility on the radar from the start is simply to have folks with disabilities on your team. If you're part of an organization that has a lot of folks with disabilities, then it's naturally going to be a part of the conversation, because you aren't going to ship something that doesn't work for your own people. Failing that, making sure you have people with disabilities in the loop as early and as frequently as possible way before you get to the alpha, like part of the design process, is just going to be really important. I think another thing that we often talk about when it comes to just the cold, hard cash of development is that it is far cheaper to build something in than to retrofit it. If you get to launch, you get to beta testing, and then you find out, actually, it's not accessible, we need to do this screen reader, or we need to be able to scale our UI. That is way easier to do when you're first building it out than after you have a million interconnected systems that it breaks. If you ever think accessibility is going to be an issue for your game, your app, your organization, which it probably will be if you ever get successful enough, then it's better to think about it from the start and save yourself a whole lot of time and headache and money and have just a better product right from the get-go. Erin Pañgilinan: I put Dylan on all of those points when you think about the end user itself, and thinking about different senses we're targeting. We saw a talk with Google AR, like how do visually impaired people see and not see. If you're mute, that's completely different. If you're someone that does not have an arm, you're not going to have a hand controller or a hand. These are really difficult challenges. Something really basic which I opened in my talk was with avatars. I was actually talking with Jazmin about the entire process of the app. She's like, what? You skipped over my entire part at the very beginning of like, create an avatar. I started off as a bald, it looked like a Nigerian man. I remember the very early prototypes for Oculus, by default, I was a very tall golden man. It was only metallic colors. I was like, I don't really identify with this, but it's really cool. I love Jeremy Bailenson's work, but it is a little problematic to say like, I can achieve empathy because now I can have blackface on. I'm like, that's not what this is for. To be culturally relevant I want an avatar or an agent that looks like me. One of the other user tests I've actually been doing at Meta, I can't say too much about it, but they ask you about skin color. I was like, that's really new and interesting. They never have asked that before. I think they are, at least some of the market leaders in headsets and manufacturing, just trying to think of, how are we being inclusive of more people that are end users, not just the people creating the products? That was never thought of I think five years ago, it was just like, that was a throwaway and a nice to have. Now it's like, we're actually thinking about this first. That wasn't the case. Also, in the game for Owlchemy Labs that we played at Meta Connect, I was talking to her about like, teleporting is really different. Previously you had to have a controller, whether you're using HTC VIVE or anything in the Oculus and Meta ecosystem, now it was all hands. It made me think like, but I don't naturally teleport by putting my hand out to go to the next portal. Is that the most inclusive UI if you don't have a hand? It really depends who you're targeting. I think you need to think about, who is that type of user? What senses do they have and prefer? I wouldn't say there's just flat-out bad design. There's just different points of accessibility that people identify with. The last thing I'll mention to you from the AI community is for black women or brown folks like myself. I'm a light-skinned, privileged Filipino woman. I will say, people don't trust AI that are black. Straight up, why? Because the algorithms, if you look at it, basic recognition for imaging on skin. It's why I'll go to the bathroom and my air blow dryer will work or water, but that won't work previously. This is because accessibility is not thought of. It's the last thing on the list for AI developers. For XR it was a little bit better. It still was at first. We weren't design inclusive by default. I think that's now changing. It's going to take a lot more work, I think, to be much more inclusive. Not just the content and the people developing it. Thinking on base level, what is the data and input that a machine is taking in? What's the sensory input that I'm receiving? You're thinking about I/O. What's the input and output on each end, inputting and receiving? I don't think that was thought of very critically before. It's definitely transformed and changed over a number of years. Doyle: What role does team culture play in building these accessible UIs? How do we foster a culture that values feedback and diverse perspectives? Colby Morgan: I think part of that is really focusing on getting a diverse team, so you have a diverse set of backgrounds and experiences to pull on from your team. As Dylan was pointing out, it's like, if you have a lot of different perspectives on your team, you can identify a lot of those things. It becomes easier, even as a culture element, if you have just a diverse team, to keep that top of mind with a lot of those different aspects. I'd say the diverse teams. Dylan Fox: I think in addition to the team, one thing you can do is spotlight your users and other stakeholders that are of different backgrounds, different abilities. We had a project with XR Access called the Stories Project, where we interviewed a number of disabled folks that had used XR, had an interest in it, enjoyed it, but obviously ran into challenges in using it. One thing we wanted to do was just spotlight those experiences. Because I think it's very easy for people to assume that everyone who uses a certain app is like themselves. I think we don't tend to think about people that aren't like ourselves unless we see some evidence that they exist. If you can spotlight those people that exist outside the norm and help to normalize that, this is for everybody. It's not just for your standard, usually in tech it's the standard cishet white dude. Then that can also be really helpful in making sure that your team doesn't just see this diversity of opinion in the team, but also in the people that you're creating for. Erin Pañgilinan: Outside of the obvious ones like race, gender, class, ethnicity, language, region is really important. In any application, interface is to me web development, not even XRs. It's like, how many different types of phones are there in the Philippines, for example? How many different screen sizes do I need to design for? I'll never be an Android developer, that's like too many. I was hardcore iOS for a really long time for a lot of different reasons. I think when you're thinking about targeting, accessibility, by default, it's a population and region. Outside of that, I also consider the type of discipline on the team. For a really long time with game design, it was only people who were AAA developers can be in XR. That was highly biased, especially for third-party independent developers like myself. I did not have that experience. I had a previous life in another career. There's a lot of bias there. Outside of non-traditional backgrounds, what I would say is it's actually not engineers to me that made the best experiences in VR in particular, it was architects. People who actually have an understanding of 3D space. When you think about AI, it's not necessarily machine learning engineers that have a statistics PhD and background. That used to be the case. I actually think psychologists have a lot to say. Cognitive scientists, anyone who actually works in real science and in the brain in life sciences, there's a lot that's to be worked on there if you're trying to achieve, to me, AGI or consciousness, when you think about presence in VR. I like to think of not just explicit insert my XYZ race, that they say, insert your identity here. I also think diversity and discipline of what you focus on is actually really valuable. That's now changing. The barrier to entry for people is also dropping. A lot of the classes I did teach from 2016 and on was everything from K-12 of students using Google Cardboard to employees at Cisco that were developing early prototypes for enterprise. We weren't getting people who were core C# developers. They were just anyone that worked as an engineer that was trying to think about, how do I think about networking and learning from first-person shooter games, but applying it at game design that's essentially B2C in a B2B environment. There's a lot of things that are cross-disciplinary by default that can make things more inclusive and new ways that you can put a lot of things together intersectionally that will create new and exciting experiences and that will actually be more inclusive. Not just, who's creating it because you're a cis straight white man and you're overrepresented. Instead of like, I think about Dylan as his expertise being like, you're focusing on populations that typically you wouldn't think of, or would be playing in an experience that is the most cutting edge and new that is by default much more human and accessible. Whether it's speech, voice, NLP, whether it's sensory, touch, gesture, get to the lowest common denominator of who cannot access those things. By targeting those audiences, I'm not going to say it's because it's a queer, trans black woman that is disabled. It's like, that's who you should target. I'm saying, if you actually support and target those things and put those people on your teams, they're probably going to have ten times richer the amount of experience, not because of who they are, but because of the disciplines that they have to think about and how they design, how they interact with the experience. Then on top of that, they're going to layer, here's my knowledge and statistics about why this doesn't work for this population and why that's not culturally relevant for my community, and why it does or does not work. It's actually multilayered. It isn't just straight up like, I'm going to hire a woman. Because of that, automatically it's going to be more diverse and automatically it's going to be a great experience. No, you can't take it at face value. It is much more deeper and multilayered in this process when we think about the words diversity. Diversity, not just like token Asian face, or token affirmative action card. It's really about like, what are you bringing to the table that is different and new and a different paradigm that you're contributing to innovation? Colby Morgan: One of the things I think I'll add too, with that, I think the other element of getting your team, but also just making sure that there's opportunities and everyone feels empowered to have a voice on your team, too. That's one thing, especially with new people on our team, we have to go through a phase of getting them really comfortable with giving feedback and feeling empowered to give feedback. Especially so you have a team where, again, I feel like a lot of projects and early in a project, it can be really easy to fall into a design hole or code silo where you're really focused and you almost don't want to get feedback because you're like, I'm really focused on this. I don't want to get some of that feedback. A big part of just having that culture that is open to feedback and everyone's empowered to give feedback on each of those steps, because I think there's a lot of those friction points that people run into that they just don't say anything. It's really easy, especially when you're working on XR experiences or features, it's really easy just to gloss over, it's like, that was hard, but I'm not going to really pay attention to it. Just making sure that everyone can call those things out, and really, it's like, yes, everyone was having a really hard time with this. We should actually try to make this better. Doyle: Then, how do you design UIs that adapt to individual users' needs and preferences? What are the current limitations you're seeing and where do you see this heading? Dylan Fox: I think the number one rule in my mind that I discussed earlier is that principle of modularity. You should have interfaces where the different inputs and the different outputs can all be done in multiple different ways. To our really great example of this, you can look at "The Last of Us Part II", which had an incredible suite of accessibility functions where people could do en masse, give me the hearing suite, give me the vision suite, but then tweak individual things. They would have any key thing, let's say there's like a scrap of material on the ground you can use to scavenge and use in crafting. If you turn the accessibility feature on, it wouldn't just light up, it would also make a sound, or the controller would vibrate. There is any number of ways where you could get that multi-modal feedback. I think making sure that your systems are modular like that, that you're thinking about things, and even things that maybe not what necessarily you think of as something that needs that. Things like eye contact in social VR, if I can set it so that I can literally feel everybody's eyes on me if they're all watching me, that could be a really powerful thing. This is also an area where I'm really excited for AI, because the ability for people to just say to the machine, make this thing bigger, or, can you outline X for me, and just adjust their experience on the fly, would be incredibly powerful. I think that is something that we're just barely starting to see, but will be very interesting to see if we can have systems that can accompany those types of requests in the near future. Erin Pañgilinan: Something really basic I mentioned earlier was your headset of choice is maybe informed by your "ethical moral values" of, I blame X about privacy, so I'm not going to use Meta. That's something I hear a lot. Or it's the same thing for Google. It's really tough because most of the companies that are developing these things do have legitimate privacy concerns with AI. Something really basic that they are doing right, which I think is great. I know if it's a Scarlett Johansson, but I actually had my mom pick, I was like, which ChatGPT voice do you want? It's like customize your version of Siri. I thought, that's a cool user choice. We didn't have that before. Being able to customize to the user based on a set of preferences, it's like, I didn't have it before that my avatar by default wasn't a man. If you think about cars, my brother's a big AZN racer, so we think about customizing, modifying the car constantly. Since the era of the '90s, it's a big thing. For Asian people, this is like the rice rocket movement. How would I customize my computer? Like CarPlay, take out the screen, put in your own screen, modify the UI. This is my custom window, and listen, now that's going to match the color of my car. Think about, what if you could customize the headset so that it would be much more accessible? Here's one thing when I think about more than just ergonomics. I love the Apple Vision Pro. It isn't great for accessibility with people with long hair. It's terrible. No one's gotten makeup right. Jazmin and I actually talk about this a lot, like, what eyeliner can you wear? Something really basic. People don't think about these things. Definitely not because there weren't that many women on these teams. If you think about even the car, how do we design a seatbelt? That was meant in terms of safety primarily for cis straight white men that were over 6 feet tall. I'm 4'10". When we think about accessibility, it's not just like, what is my programming language of choice as a developer? What is my headset choice? I was really excited about Apple. I'm like, you can customize the different type of colors of your computer. This is in the late '90s. There's so much more choice that we have now. There's still a lot of things that we don't have choice in. Part of the reason I'm so excited for Meta, and they haven't done this yet, they haven't open sourced their SDKs and APIs for anything with AR glasses. Many people are trying to hack them. It kind of works, and it kind of doesn't. I did talk with the director of product at Llama because they had shown some videos at Meta Connect about how they're using Llama 3, their latest model, with VR. Is it very accessible when you're talking about multi-modal models, but you're not open sourcing really basic stuff for people who are not doing model development to just basic software engineers? I think part of that problem is just because there's so much work to do within the ecosystem first before you open source something to that level of standard. Optionality and picking the different types of models, even the size of it, so that it's more affordable. It's the same thing for headsets. If I could have a cheaper option than an Apple Vision Pro where most of my community cannot afford a $3,500 headset, can they just get something as cheap as a Meta Quest S? That's probably like a $500 price point, would open up the doors for not only more consumers to enter but also designers and developers from the independent developer and third-party community that doesn't work at a big AAA game company or any of the other headset manufacturing companies. Colby Morgan: I think about adapting users and features and experiences for like specific users. Obviously, there's a lot of different things that you could do and handle. One of the powerful things I really like to rely on as much as possible is just finding tools and systems that can really just adapt to users. Trying to find those broad tools and systems that have a level of dynamic adaption to a player to more seamlessly meet some of their needs, to open up the experience. I want to just create more of a seamless experience that takes more of that friction out of there. Again, I think there's identifying some of those tools and systems that you get a lot of value out of for a lot of different users. One, how you identify those. Then, how you can make those as dynamic as possible. Dylan Fox: The more you can embrace users creating their own adjustments in terms of things like mods, things like 3D printing, custom controllers, or custom headbands, there's a lot of things you can do as a developer to embrace that and support that. Doyle: What about balancing simplicity and feature depth in the user interfaces, especially in the more immersive environments like VR and AR? Colby Morgan: Yes, especially XR, it's definitely a balancing act because it's really easy to go ham. As an XR developer, it's really exciting to make things. It's really exciting to add a bunch of features and effects and different things. I think just as good product design, I always really try to think of how do you focus your product? How do you focus your designs, and really think about your user's focus? What do you really want them to see? What do you want them to look at? What are you going to focus on? I think it's the balance back and forth of, how do you keep a real focused experience for the user, but how do you add more engaging features for users that have been using a product for longer? I think that's the balance of keeping it simple early on for a user, but then just having a clear path for a user to get more exposed to that depth and complexity. Also, any XR application lets users have the choice of, they want to keep the simple core experience. They don't necessarily want to try to get too deep with the features or anything like that. They have that opportunity to participate at the level in the experience they feel comfortable with. Dylan Fox: Some examples to look at are like Google Tilt Brush. You can start off in the simple mode, there's only a few tools on each of your little tool palettes. Then, when you're ready, open up the complex mode and get a bunch more controls, a bunch more customization. Thinking about things like that, thinking about when it comes to design for neurodiverse folks, having the option to turn off distractions, to really bring things down to the barest elements. You'll see that as well with some low vision support, things like, again, The Last of Us will have high contrast mode where it strips it down such that the player is in blue, the enemy is in red, new items are in yellow, and everything else is in gray. You get this extremely different aesthetic style. It becomes very minimalist. Then it makes it so that even if you're heavily visually impaired, you can still get that core sense of what's happening. I think thinking of ways that you can do that, of letting people scale their experience up and down is really good design philosophy. Erin Pañgilinan: Something I started off with when I was transitioning from frontend and mobile, thought about data science, this is probably like 10 years ago, but I was reading a book on microinteractions. I actually like to borrow a lot from even just really basic web devs. I was at WWDC's equivalent of ALT Conf. A bunch of the mobile iOS developer community always has a side conference that watches WWDC every year, which is Apple's developer conference. My friend Gary was actually trying to create this application where you're doing a lot of R&D in a lab, so you're looking at chemistry, beakers, and how you would actually do a bunch of different stuff. It was really cool. I said, but I can't tell what you're paying attention to, so reference the paper, 'Attention is All You Need', what do you focus on? I suggested to him, I was like, I think you need to use something equivalent to CSS and hover, really basic stuff, not a button, but on the actual objects themselves. Lo and behold, that day, Apple announced like, we now have hover effects. I was like, here, this is what you should use. Really basic stuff like that. I think WWDC has some basic standards, like WebXR, it takes a while, and it hasn't completely transferred into native yet just because it's so early in its development process. There's a lot of different microinteractions and paradigms that have been established already and tried and true, between responsive web and mobile development that do transfer over. Then, there are some principles that don't transfer. While I love Apple Vision Pro, a lot of it's very flat design, it actually doesn't optimize all the 3D space. Not everything should be a 2D visualization of the stock market, and, it's in VR, so I'm going to play it in Google Cardboard. This was an experience I tried way back in the day, it doesn't work very well. It was like, and now I can ride through the stock market like a rollercoaster. I'm like, this is horrible. I was really excited when I did a different conference, this was at Bloomberg Tech conference, and there was a demo for stock trading apps and database. I was super excited, it looked exactly the same as what you would have on a mobile app. I was like, this defeats the whole purpose of having it in Apple Vision Pro. There are some applications that can be transferred over, but, again, the chapter in my book is on data and machine learning, visualization and design and development, and it's about 3D in context of the environment, of how you would use that. We also have to think about, what can we borrow from tried-and-true principles of design and development from the web and mobile? Then, what makes it unique that it's in XR, or even adapting some things, not everything, with AI as well, that makes it much more inclusive, accessible, and something that users actually want. Participant 1: When we talk about in the planning phase, how much weightage should we give for introducing accessibility into our user experience? Do you think it's fair to say that the MVP, maybe that shouldn't be part of the MVP, or is it like, let's cater to the majority of the audience first. Then, as a second phase, we should be looking at the accessibility part, or it should be a discussion since day one? How do we balance out the fact that the majority of your audience, in a way, would be linked to the majority of the revenue for the product? How do we justify that accessibility should be part of the MVP, without that direct correlation to the revenue associated with that? Doyle: The question is, do you try to push for meeting accessibility requirements and standards in your MVP, or should that be a follow-up? If it should be part of the MVP, how do you push for prioritizing and arguing for the importance of baking accessibility in to that first version versus waiting later? Erin Pañgilinan: It really depends on your audience, it's very relative. I'm trying to create a productivity app, this is like a selfish dream, for myself, and so I conducted maybe 30 user research interviews since the end of last year. They were primarily women who were neurodivergent with ADHD, that were product managers, designers, and developers, that worked on open source, AR, VR, AI, and crypto, so very similar to me. I'm designing, essentially, for myself. That's a very specific audience, and even within that audience, there's a level of richness that I didn't expect. I was like, so some of you use paper planners, some people use mobile apps for planning, some people don't use anything at all, and they just look at their Google Calendar, and maybe they would love all of it if it worked in their Apple Vision Pro, or they'll only use it and pay for something if it also works in Android and on Linux, like every platform. It's really hard to satisfy people. Even in a target market of something that I thought was really small and specific, it comes down to user segmentation and that feature, and then, who is willing to pay for it? Take this quote from YC, Y Combinator, (make something people want) and we'll pay for it. While I like to think, yes, accessibility, design, inclusive design, and everything should be able to target this type of users or this population first. I really have to be honest with you, some people don't have the budget for that and won't prioritize it because it isn't a part of the bottom line. What it comes down to is like, what set of initial users for that problem are you solving? Then, within that set of users, what are the top three? Really narrow it down. Who are willing to pay for this price for that set of features that should be the real core of your product that is a part of the bottom line? Identifying that, what I realized was like, this is going to take some time. I thought I was trying to be even more narrow and specific, and even then, it's really hard and difficult. Again, it's all relative. If you are a B2B SaaS enterprise app that wants to do telepresence, this is a case for like Cisco or for a client I had in education, like we want hundreds of students to be in XR. We want them to also be able to design fashion and play fitness games and be safer. Two totally different use cases. I'm like, some of that is Meta Quest suite and some of that is Apple Vision Pro. Whatever you think you can prioritize, even just three things, it might be too much. You got to really chunk it down and get really specific, and even then, it still might be too much. Just get very granular to what that MVP is and who will pay for it so that you continue development. Unless you have endless amounts of money you can like self-fund. Like a lot of my friends in crypto who retired, they can just play computer all day and gameplay tests on all the things. Most people in reality can't do that. I would just get super specific and think about the context of who your customers are or who your investors are. I'm like, what is it that they want and what is it that you want? Were you willing to meet people in between for your users? Dylan Fox: These things are generally worth trying to make part of your MVP, and here's why. It's because something like a fully-fledged screen reader system or scalable UI or captions, if it's not 100% perfect right off the bat, that's fine. We all know MVPs can be very rough around the edges sometimes. The trap that I see people falling into over and again is they brainstorm a big list of features, they pick some as MVP, and then they build out something as fast as they possibly can that meets all of those MVP features. That decides the course of development. There's a lot of decisions that are made when it comes to developing during that MVP phase that become set in stone and very hard to change after the fact. If scalable UI is part of your MVP, then you will be building towards that from the start. You'll be making those choices for your development infrastructure that take that into account. If it's slated for your 1.1, what might happen is you develop to get something out the door and then you realize, actually, if we wanted this, we would have needed to develop the core engine and core aspects differently. Which means now it's much more work to do, so maybe it gets shifted from 1.1 to 1.2, and you just start accruing technical debt that if you ever then want to get some of these features in, you'll need to have a big effort. Because, again, a lot of these accessibility features come down to modularity. That is the type of thing that you really want to build in at the start. Do you need to have everything ready to go? Not necessarily. Think about localization. Yes, obviously, if our main user base is in English, then we're just going to focus on English for v1. If you're thinking about localization as part of phase one, then I guarantee you when it comes time to record all your lines in Spanish, in Chinese, in whatever else, it's going to be like a few lines of code to change all those out, instead of, "Our text is hard baked into the game. We can't change it at all. This is going to be a mess". For that reason, I would say, yes, at least some of these accessibility features should be in the MVP. Colby Morgan: Echoing both those points, and I think just to add, especially for Mighty Coconut, I think for us, in that early planning phase, it's important that we have that accessibility mindset of just how we're identifying the friction point, as I think the friction points or the potential friction points, are the really big piece for us. Just knowing what those friction points are, you can better tackle those down the road if you can plan for those of knowing what's coming or anything like that. Erin Pañgilinan: I was developing a productivity app with AI, and I literally was like, this is so fun. Then, I realized this is really broad. You do anything in AI, you think about, the first thing, if you've done any workshop with AWS, this is the amount of money I have for compute and spend. Early in the planning process, through user research, before I even build anything, I'm just trying to extrapolate that list of features and narrowing it down to the smallest possible thing. Because even if you think like, I can make this part of the prototype, it's still a lot of work, so before you spend any money, I would do a good amount of user testing before you build. Then when you actually spend, you'll realize whether or not it was a waste of money or not. Participant 1: Actually, one point that stands out, you mentioned, it collects as a technical debt. I think that's part of that culture. Because this whole accessibility and inclusion bit, I come from the financial industry, it's just in the start. My engineers have raised a lot of technical debt, but accessibility is not something that has anybody raise their hand that we should have this. We now have it as an organizational principle that it should be there, but, as an engineer, nobody has raised that. Maybe that's like, start from that culture, saying that, we need to start looking at this thing. Even if it's not part of the MVP, maybe if it comes up, if people are raising that this is a technical debt, then maybe towards the course of action, it might get an action done. Erin Pañgilinan: You do have a designer in the room at all when you're doing this? Participant 1: Yes. Erin Pañgilinan: I just think about Apple, it's like, when a designer comes in the room, somebody would say, they're like God, I'm like, it helps. Participant 1: Yes, that helps. Again, the designer is also, as you said, like a phone, where this phone has been two centuries old, to understand that, where we come from. It's like, that kind of thought process takes a bit of time to come, but it does come in. You mentioned we attended Bloomberg conference, so there should be a difference between the Bloomberg version versus any of the Meta conferences, and things like that. That mentality is still growing. I think that was a good test, that if engineers start thinking that way, that this is a technical debt, then, at some point in time, it's going to have to be introduced. Erin Pañgilinan: Technical debt and financial debt, like my cost of computing, we used to say, this is saving developers this amount of time and spend, and to talk really less on productivity, and developer experience, DevEx. It's like, if I can identify the amount of time and money saved for an engineering team because we included design first, and it affects the amount of compute that we're going to spend and the amount of time we're going to spend engineering this feature or product line, then I think it's easier to make that call. Harder to do for something like a newer problem, because you mentioned MVP, but if it's for an existing legacy system, that's how I would quantify it, to be able to get a little bit more buy-in, to include it as more first principles earlier on. Doyle: If you had to pick one piece of advice, what would you tell newcomers to the field who want to make inclusiveness a core focus? Colby Morgan: I think I would tell newcomers to the space, one, really look at your user base, look who your target audience is. Find ways to connect more with them directly. Just identify the needs of that audience. Dylan Fox: If you're looking for problems to solve that actually mean something, look to disabled communities, because there's a lot of places in the more privileged parts of the world where we've started to invent some bullshit problems. There's also a lot of people out there who have real problems that, with just a little bit of design thinking and actually listening to the people with those problems, and off-the-shelf XR AI technology, I think there's a ton of stuff that could be made that just hasn't been yet. There's a ton of low-hanging fruit and unsolved problems that really affect people's day-to-day lives. Please do think about that. We have a lot of resources at XR Access that talk about how to design and develop accessibly, so check those out. Try to make sure that what you're doing is really going to be making a difference in people's lives and not just something shiny and novel because the technology is there for it. Erin Pañgilinan: Be open. Try everything, at least once. Expect the unexpected. There are so many new developments. Some of my friends, they clairvoyantly predicted this was going to happen in XR, and I was like, no. Some of that was Michael Abrash, and we always knew glasses were going to come out and things of that nature. Look to history, so what you're thinking is going to come in the future. Also, there are things that are popping up now that I did not expect, so in any new emerging technology, that's going to happen, be really open-minded. When I say try everything, that's because I literally have probably tried every headset and experience I could get my hands on, because you'll find a bunch of stuff that works and a bunch of stuff that doesn't. I don't just say that for developers and designers, I say that for consumers because that's a really good way to, one, do user research. Then, basically testing of like, yes, that did not work at all, we're not going to spend any more engineering hours, or time, or money on this because we assumed this would work functionally, and it actually didn't. We expected something that works in principle, is like, the PowerPoint slides or the video, should work. It did not work, even though I gameplay tested it about 10 times over and over now. Yes, be open, try everything, and expect the unexpected.

Title: How To Earn $500 A Month From Costco Stock Ahead Of Q4 Earnings

Time Published: 2025-09-25T14:10:58Z
Full Content:
Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST) will release earnings results for the fourth quarter, after the closing bell on Thursday, Sept. 25. Analysts expect the company to report quarterly earnings at $5.81 per share, up from $5.29 per share in the year-ago period. COST projects quarterly revenue of $86.06 billion, compared to $79.7 billion a year earlier, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Costco has beaten analyst estimates for revenue in two straight quarters and in five of the last 10 quarters overall. With the recent buzz around Costco, some investors may also be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends. Currently, Costco offers an annual dividend yield of 0.55%, which is a semi-annual dividend amount of $1.30 per share ($5.20 a year). So, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly? To earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $1,090,842 or around 1,154 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $218,357 or around 231 shares. To calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($5.20 in this case). So, $6,000 / $5.20 = 1,154 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $5.20 = 231 shares ($100 per month). Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time. How that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock’s current price. For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40). Similarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield. COST Price Action: Shares of Costco rose 0.2% to close at $945.27 on Wednesday.

Title: Jim Gavin ‘didn’t see’ bullying or sexism during Defence Forces career

Fianna Fáil presidential election candidate Jim Gavin has said he did not see bullying or sexism during his military career but he praised the Women of Honour group for highlighting abuse in the Defence Forces. A tribunal was established following allegations of widespread abuse and misconduct made by the group. Mr Gavin, a former Defence Forces member and Dublin GAA manager, visited Blackrock and Dalkey in south Co Dublin on Thursday to canvass voters. During a press conference, he said the Women of Honour had “done the State some service by stepping forward” and that “we need to learn from what happened”. He said that during his time in the military he served “with pride” and “to the highest standards” and he “set a very high standard for those people who I led and who I followed”. “I had a really positive experience in Óglaigh na hÉireann,” he said. “It gave me great opportunities. It shaped the person who I am.” Pressed on whether he has seen examples of bullying or sexism during his time in the organisation, Mr Gavin replied: “I didn’t see any of that.” He added: “That’s not everyone’s experience and I understand that. I championed those who have put their name forward and I think they’ve done the State a great service.” The former Air Corps member said he was “very proud” of what the Women of Honour did in stepping forward and that he was fully behind them and “really keen to see what comes out of this inquiry”. [ Presidential candidate Jim Gavin says online claims about him are ‘obvious lies’Opens in new window ] Mr Gavin, who is on leave from his role as chief operations officer of the Irish Aviation Authority for the duration of the campaign, was also asked if he was satisfied about a secret arrangement dating back to the Cold War era that allowed the UK to police the State’s airspace. “You mentioned that word secret so obviously one can’t comment on that,” he said, adding that “these are matters between the Irish Government and any other particular state”. Mr Gavin said he welcomed planned Government’s investment in the Defence Forces arising from proposals from the Commission on the Defence Forces. Separately, asked whether he felt people need help with the cost of living with the budget approaching, Mr Gavin said: “I think cost of living, housing, homelessness, these are challenges of our time and our Government will be defined by them. “The Taoiseach and the leaders in Government have said that there is more work to do, and I accept that. “And as president, though you are non-political, I will, without fear, nor favour, highlight issues that are important to Irish people and represent them to the best of my ability.” [ Presidential election: Meet the three hopefuls who will be on the ballot paper next monthOpens in new window ] Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Listen to our Inside Politics podcast for the best political chat and analysis Get the Inside Politics newsletter for a behind-the-scenes take on events of the day Our politics team's behind-the-scenes take on events of the day.

Title: Intel Approached Apple For Possible Investment, Report Says
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/tylerroush/2025/09/25/intel-approached-apple-for-possible-investment-report-says/

ByTy Roush, Forbes Staff. Intel has held talks with Apple about a possible investment, Bloomberg reported Thursday, the latest effort by the beleaguered chipmaker to reinforce its business in recent weeks with funding from Nvidia, SoftBank and partial ownership by the U.S. government. Discussions between Intel and Apple are at an early stage and include talks about the two companies working together more often, though it’s not clear whether an agreement will be reached, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Apple and Intel partnered for years as Intel provided chips for Apple computers, though their cooperation was cut after Apple announced in 2020 the company would produce its own processing units, and Apple has since unveiled a second iteration of its chip, the M2, which is manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. Intel shares rose by nearly 6% to just below $33 as of around 11:10 a.m. EDT, following an earlier premarket rally, while Apple’s stock ticked slightly higher (0.3%). Neither Apple nor Intel immediately responded to requests for comment from Forbes. Intel has reached out to other unspecified companies about potential investments and partnerships, according to Bloomberg. Intel’s shares have rebounded in recent months after the Trump administration signaled support for the chipmaker. President Donald Trump earlier this year called Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan “highly CONFLICTED” and urged Tan to resign, following his alleged ties to Chinese firms and a criminal case involving Cadence Design, where Tan previously served as CEO. Tan and Trump appeared to mend their relationship, however, after Tan visited the White House in August. Following the visit, SoftBank announced it would invest $2 billion in the company as part of both firms' “investing in advanced technology and semiconductor innovation” in the U.S., ranking SoftBank as Intel’s fifth-largest shareholder. Trump announced in late August that Intel agreed to give the U.S. a 10% stake in the company, making the federal government one of its largest shareholders behind BlackRock and Vanguard. Earlier this month, Nvidia said it would acquire $5 billion worth of Intel’s shares and announced the two companies would collaborate on developing custom data center and personal computer products.

Securitize, a platform for tokenizing real-world assets, is expanding to the Sei blockchain with the tokenized Apollo Diversified Credit Fund (ACRED) the first to debut on the network. The move introduces tokenized private credit to Sei for the first time, the firm said. ACRED, which has $112 million in total value according to RWA.xyz, acts as a feeder into Apollo’s private credit strategy, which includes corporate lending, asset-backed deals and dislocated credit. Only qualified investors can participate, and the tokens are interoperable across blockchains via Wormhole, a cross-chain messaging protocol, allowing easier movement between networks and improving liquidity. Tokenized private credit is part of a broader shift in financial markets in which traditional instruments are represented on blockchain systems to speed up settlements and cut out intermediaries. The real-world asset market is now above $30 billion, RWA.xyz data show. "ACRED’s expansion to Sei further demonstrates how blockchain infrastructure can unlock new pathways for investor participation in private credit and accelerate digital innovation,” said Christine Moy, a partner at Apollo and the head of digital assets, data and AI strategy, in a press release shared with CoinDesk. Other funds will hit Sei in the near future, Securitize said. Securitize has already tokenized over $3 billion in assets, including offerings from BlackRock, KKR, and VanEck, the release said.

Title: Why Is AXON Stock Falling?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/25/why-is-axon-stock-falling/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Axon Enterprise’s stock dropped 10% on September 24th following the announcement of its acquisition of Prepared, an AI-powered 911 communication company. This decline was likely fueled by investor concerns regarding the acquisition's price and its potential impact on Axon's increasing expenses. Although Axon has demonstrated strong revenue growth, its operating margin has recently been on a downward trend. In light of this recent stock performance, we will now analyze how Axon compares to its peers in the industrial sector in terms of size, valuation, growth, and margins. For context, Axon Enterprise offers conducted energy devices and hardware-software solutions for law enforcement agencies worldwide to capture, store, manage, share, and analyze digital evidence. Why is this important? AXON recently dropped 10.2% in a single day - comparing it to its peers contextualizes stock performance, valuation, and financials - indicating if it is genuinely outperforming, lagging, and most importantly - will this trend persist? Read Buy or Sell AXON Stock to determine if Axon Enterprise is indeed a falling knife. Sharp declines frequently present rebound opportunities - observe how the stock has retreated and rebounded previously through AXON Dip Buyer Analysis. While comparing peers is essential, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio assesses much more and is structured to minimize stock-specific risks while providing potential upside exposure. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; providing less of a roller-coaster experience, as illustrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Stock futures are lower after two straight days of declines for major indexes as investors await key economic data; Costco Wholesale (COST) is scheduled to report earnings after the closing bell; Intel (INTC) shares are rising on a report it is seeking an investment from Apple (AAPL); and Starbucks (SBUX) is laying off workers and closing stores as it continues to restructure. Here's what you need to know today. Stock futures are pointing a lower open for major indexes after two days of declines as investors prepare for the release of key economic data reports to finish off the week. Futures tied to the benchmark S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq were recently down 0.4% and 0.6%, respectively, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slipped 0.2%. Gold futures edged higher to $3,785 an ounce to stay near record highs, while bitcoin (BTCUSD) was at $111,500, little changed from yesterday afternoon. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects mortgage rates and a variety of other consumer borrowing costs, edged higher to 4.16%. Costco Wholesale (COST) will release its fiscal fourth-quarter results after the closing bell today, with some analysts expecting volatility in the stock. The update comes after some investors were shaken in the spring by signs that sales growth had decelerated. The company has already reported that fourth-quarter sales rose 8% compared with the year-ago quarter. Analysts tracked by Visible Alpha expect the retailer to report that profits grew to $2.6 million in the fourth-quarter, up from $2.4 million a year ago. Costco shares, which have gained 3% since the start of the year, were slightly higher in premarket trading. Data on economic growth, jobless claims and housing sales are in focus this morning ahead of a highly anticipated inflation report that's set to be released Friday. The jobless claims numbers, which are expected to show a slight increase, are being closely watched by investors after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates last week amid signs that the labor market is weakening. Revisions to second-quarter gross domestic product are expected to show that growth held steady at 3.3%, while existing home sales are estimated to have declined slightly. Several Fed officials are scheduled to speak today, ahead of the release tomorrow morning of the Fed's preferred measure of inflation. Shares of Intel (INTC) continued gaining ground this morning following a report the chipmaker is seeking an investment from Apple (AAPL). Intel shares rose more than 6% on Wednesday after Bloomberg News reported on talks between the companies, which also centered on other ways that Apple could help the beleaguered chipmaker. The report comes after Nvidia (NVDA) last week agreed to invest $5 billion in Intel as part of a deal that will see the two companies co-develop chips for data centers and PCs. Intel shares were up nearly 2% in recent premarket trading. The stock has gained more than 50% year-to-date, but remain well off its historical highs. Apple shares were little changed ahead of the bell. Starbucks (SBUX) is laying off around 900 employees in its corporate offices and closing some stores as CEO Brian Niccol continues to implement his “Back to Starbucks” turnaround plan. Niccol said in an update Thursday that the total number of stores was expected to decline by about 1% in 2025 after the closures. He said that laid-off employees in corporate offices would receive severance packages, while employees at closed stores could also receive severance if they are not transferred to other nearby stores. The moves come as analysts have praised the coffee chain’s efforts to revive sales amid sluggish customer traffic. Starbucks shares were flat in premarket trading.

Title: Banks retreat from climate change commitments – but it’s business more than politics

View all partners https://doi.org/10.64628/AAI.jhmy3ce5q Share article Print article Another business-led effort to fight climate change is unraveling. On Aug. 27, 2025, the Net-Zero Banking Alliance suspended its activities after several major U.S. and European banks backed out. While most observers are blaming the strong political backlash in the U.S. against climate change action and sustainable investing, we believe the banks didn’t need much of a push: These net-zero alliances never made much business sense and were not particularly effective at fighting climate change. Indeed, for us the puzzle was why they had flourished in the first place. To examine their rise and fall, we recently conducted a research project that encompassed interviews with more than 80 executives from various financial institutions, activist organizations and oil and gas companies. The Net-Zero Banking Alliance was founded in 2021. Members agreed to limit lending to carbon-intense sectors so that total greenhouse gas emissions from companies in the banks’ loan portfolios are close to zero by 2050. This target aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement but was not binding and lacked clear shorter-term targets and plans. Similar net-zero networks were established for insurance, asset management and other financial areas, all under the umbrella of the United Nations Environment Program’s Finance Initiative. Over the past 16 months, the insurance and asset managers’ alliances have also suspended their activities. These net-zero alliances were built on the premise that climate risk equals financial risk and that the challenge requires a collective response. Their goal was to leverage the power of finance to push companies to decarbonize their products and processes. Key financial regulators, central banks and a few of the largest asset managers propelled these alliances because they perceived that climate change poses serious long-term systemic risks to markets and economies around the world. Influential figures such as Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, and former Bank of England head Mark Carney, now the prime minister of Canada, lent legitimacy to these initiatives. Some environmental groups also supported these alliances as a smart strategy to pressure companies on climate. Many other financial institutions then joined the net-zero bandwagon, but our research revealed that they didn’t do so because of concern about climate-related financial risks. Rather, they felt an array of pressure from peers, investors, activists, regulators and even their families. Many people we interviewed mentioned reputational risk as a key driver and saw a low-carbon transition as inevitable, driven by regulation, technological innovation and consumer demand. This was the Biden era, with billions of dollars flowing to clean energy through the Inflation Reduction Act. The burgeoning field also spawned a specialized but lucrative industry of data providers and consultants who actively marketed carbon management, disclosure and broader sustainability services. The global market for sustainability data and software was estimated at more than US$1 billion in 2024 and growing rapidly. Climate strategy and sustainability reporting was the fastest-growing business sector for accounting and consulting firms. And asset managers were happy to collect higher fees for funds screened for sustainability – even though these funds have not outperformed the broader market. These vested interests spurred continued expansion of net-zero networks. Indeed, at its peak in 2024, the Net-Zero Banking Alliance included over 140 members globally with $74 trillion in estimated total assets, representing over 40% of global banking assets. Given the size and scope of these net-zero networks, what triggered their rapid collapse? One major factor, of course, was the political backlash against anything connected with climate action and sustainable investing following the 2024 election of President Donald Trump. Finance officials in more than 20 U.S. states have demanded that major asset managers restrict the use of environment, social and governance benchmarks, accusing them of eroding “traditional fiduciary duty” and claiming they hurt investors. In August, 23 Republican attorneys general accused organizations created to set standards for corporate climate disclosures of operating an anticompetitive “climate cartel” and violating antitrust laws. While the political pressure in the U.S. has indeed been intense, the collapse of net-zero networks and the broader corporate retreat from climate commitments is largely due to the continued profitability of fossil fuels and the high costs and risks of deep decarbonization. Investors and banks, of course, want to keep on financing profitable companies and avoid pressuring their clients to take risky measures. Oil companies such as BP and Shell that had relatively strong climate targets suffered financially as a result, prompting them to retreat from these targets and shift capital from renewable projects back toward fossil fuels. High energy prices in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine war made the sector even more lucrative. Low-carbon fuels and processes for industries such as aviation, steel and cement are still very expensive. Moreover, the Trump administration is abolishing most subsidies for clean energy and freezing permits for offshore wind, while easing regulations and opening more land for oil and gas exploration. These economic incentives made it hard for the banking alliance to reduce financing for fossil fuels – and the money has kept on flowing into oil and gas projects. European banks that sharply cut funding to fossil fuel companies saw their business diverted to other banks and to private, nonbank sources of finance, which has soared in the past two years. Facing this loss of business, major banks’ lending to oil and gas companies surged in 2024, driving loans to a three-year high of $869 billion. The costs of membership in the net-zero alliances also increased over time, with the adoption of stricter standards that called for specific plans and timelines for ending fossil fuel financing entirely. The new standards also required loan recipients to disclose Scope 3 emissions, which include emissions from a company’s suppliers and customers. Managers in financial institutions told us that the increasingly complex and demanding requirements were generating strong pushback from their clients. We also heard that membership was turning from a reputational asset to a liability, as activist organizations called out the hypocrisy of continued fossil fuel lending despite their commitments to phasing it out. Although banks are rushing back to finance fossil fuel projects, these loans typically have long terms of 10 to 25 years. This means they carry the risk that an eventual transition to clean energy will make these projects worthless, “stranded assets.” One study estimates that investors are currently exposed to more than $1 trillion in potential losses. Why do banks often ignore these risks? Our interviewees mentioned the organizational silos that separate analysts who assess climate risks from the loan originators. In other words, the employees deciding where to lend money may not be talking to the team that best understands the long-term risks. Moreover, current risk assessment tools are quite crude and don’t generate the quantitative metrics that loan underwriters want. Finally, loans are increasingly repackaged and sold, or securitized, into the larger corporate debt market, obscuring the risks. The Net-Zero Banking Alliance isn’t disappearing entirely. The group is currently deciding on whether to restructure into a much weaker “framework initiative” that provides voluntary guidance instead of binding commitments. And some banks leaving the alliance have stated that they will maintain their climate goals and sustainability policies. But climate risks are real and growing. The Boston Consulting Group recently estimated that just the physical risks – floods, drought and wildfires – could cost companies up to 25% of their profits by 2050 and substantially cut global GDP. A transition to a low-carbon economy will cost trillions of dollars and create massive disruption – as well as opportunities – as new technologies and companies emerge. The longer that action is delayed, the greater the risks to the planet – and of more drastic shocks to the global economy and financial system.

Zilch, the London-based fintech transforming the way people pay, today announces the appointment of Boriana Tchobanova as its Chief Operating Officer (COO) as it continues to strengthen its world-class management team. 0 25 September 2025 Be the first to comment This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra. It expresses the views and opinions of the author. Tchobanova joins from American Express Global Business Travel, where she served as Chief Transformation Officer, leading the business’ post pandemic recovery and industry transforming M&A, and paving the way for its successful multiple billion-dollar IPO in 2022. Prior to this, Boriana spent almost 15 years with American Express across multiple senior roles in strategy, transformation and operations, including as COO of the company’s digital business. This appointment comes on the heels of Zilch doubling revenues to £110 million for the year ending March 2025 - marking a fourth straight year of 100% growth - with gross profit surging 143%. Zilch was recently recognised as EMEA’s fastest-growing tech unicorn by Deloitte and ranked the UK’s fastest-growing $1bn+ fintech by both the Financial Times and The Sunday Times. This impressive growth trajectory has seen the business attract a wide range of industry leading talent to turbocharge the next stage of its journey. Tchobanova’s appointment follows the appointment last year of Mark Wilson, BlackRock main Board Director and former CEO of FTSE 100 insurer Aviva, to the Board. Tchobanova will work closely with the CEO and business line leaders to drive operational excellence, transformational change and strategic delivery. Bringing her two decades worth of Fortune 100 experience, she will work with the team to deliver major initiatives that will support the organisation’s growth, unlock new revenue opportunities and improve efficiencies. Philip Belamant, CEO and Co-Founder of Zilch, said: “Zilch has achieved exponential growth over the past five years by pioneering a model that delivers better outcomes for consumers while building very strong operating leverage. This puts us in a powerful position as we enter the next phase of our journey, scaling a business built to stand among the most significant players in global finance. Attracting leaders from major incumbents is always a positive sign, but the real test is finding those who can bring deep institutional knowledge without being held back by the cultures, technologies or beliefs of those very institutions. We believe Boriana is one of those rare people, and I’m delighted to welcome her as we shape the future of Zilch.” Commenting on her appointment, Boriana Tchobanova said: “Zilch’s mission to eliminate the high cost of consumer credit for the mass-market and accelerate financial inclusion through advanced technologies is deeply meaningful to me. In just five years, the company has delivered record-breaking growth and is now building a category-defining business. The next phase - launching bold, customer-centric product innovation, pursuing transformative M&A and preparing for a potential listing - will demand operational excellence at scale. I’m supercharged to join Phil and his exceptional team for the road ahead.”Zilch has also appointed industry leading, full-service communications agency, MHP Group, who will deploy its specialist advisors across strategic communications, public affairs, creative campaigning and capital markets advisory. Its Financial Services team has supported fast-growth, pre-IPO fintechs on their journeys to going public, including Coinbase and Airwallex, with its Capital Markets and Corporate Advisory team ranked as one of the leading communications advisers. Alex Bigg, CEO of MHP Group commented: “We couldn’t be more excited to be working with Zilch, the UK’s fastest growing fintech unicorn. The business is on an extraordinary growth trajectory with ambitions of becoming a listed business. MHP Group has a long history of working with some of the most exciting high-growth private businesses and major listed brands, and our unrivalled depth of expertise and specialisms will see us support Zilch as it continues to build something truly powerful.”

Title: Why Shopify Stock Could Drop 50% Despite Strong Growth?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/25/why-shopify-stock-could-drop-50-despite-strong-growth/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Shopify (NASDAQ: SHOP) allows businesses to build and operate online stores. Their clients include Skullcandy, Daily Harvest, and Carrier. The stock has soared approximately 85% over the previous year, significantly outpacing the S&P 500’s 16% rise, and is currently trading at $149, just short of its September 2025 high of $157.12. While the growth is robust and recent results are encouraging, Shopify’s track record of volatility serves as a reminder to investors that there is a tangible downside risk. Also see Buy or Fear Shopify Stock? The company has aggressively expanded into Europe, where gross merchandise volume (GMV) has increased sharply, and is making substantial investments in AI and technology to enhance search capabilities for merchants. These efforts bolster long-term growth potential, but the stock is currently trading at very high multiples, suggesting that the market might already be factoring in flawless performance. Historical fluctuations indicate that Shopify can experience significant declines if growth or profit margins fall short — in a downside scenario, shares could realistically drop by as much as 50% from current levels. We analyze three essential factors that could lead to downside: revenues, margins, and valuation. Find out more in What’s Behind IONQ Stock’s Winning Streak? That being said, investing in a single company involves significant risk. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio is designed to mitigate stock-specific risk while providing upside exposure. It has significantly outperformed its benchmark—a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has posted returns exceeding 91% since its inception. What accounts for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; providing less of a roller-coaster experience, as illustrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Shopify’s revenue has increased at an average of 26% over the past three years, rising from $7.8 billion to $10 billion in the last year. The most recent quarter saw a 31% year-over-year rise in revenue. However, several data points indicate potential downside risk: Shopify is presently reporting an operating margin of 15.3% and a net margin of 23.4%, generating nearly $1.8 billion in operating cash flow during the past year. While these figures are robust for a high-growth platform, several factors could impose pressure on profitability and amplify downside risk: Shopify’s present valuation heightens the downside risk. The stock is trading at a price-to-sales ratio of 19.5, a price-to-earnings ratio of 83.1, and a price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of 107.3, significantly above S&P 500 averages. These multiples suggest that the market is anticipating continued robust growth in revenue and margins. By factoring in revenue deceleration, margin pressures, and multiple contractions, Shopify shares could realistically endure a decline of up to 50% from current levels in a situation where growth slows, margins compress, and sentiment changes. Shopify is a strong company with significant growth, global reach, AI-driven innovation, and solid profitability, but the timing is uncertain, and downside risk persists if sales slow, margins compress, or competitors gain market share. You may want to look into the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to deliver strong returns for investors. What accounts for this? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a proactive way to capitalize on favorable market conditions while minimizing losses when markets decline, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: The Financial Sector Was Tottering Even Before Trump
URL: https://newrepublic.com/article/200901/financial-sector-tottering-private-equity
Time Published: 2025-09-25T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
I’ve written a good bit about the economic wreckage wrought by President Donald Trump’s economic policies—tariffs, manipulation of the Federal Reserve, a deficit-doubling tax cut for the rich—and how these might tank the economy. Today let’s consider how, even if Trump weren’t president, the finance sector could tank the economy all by its lonesome through shadow banking, most especially in the private equity industry. The term “shadow banking” was coined in 2007 by a money manager named Paul McCulley to describe financial institutions that mimic what commercial banks do—money markets, mortgage companies, investment banks, hedge funds, and, yes, private equity—but are not regulated like banks. It’s called shadow banking because these firms lack banks’ transparency. Shadow banks furnish a higher return than banks typically do, but their investments are much riskier and lack government protections for investors. Much of the mischief in the 2008 financial crisis was caused by shadow banks, whose combined assets were as large or perhaps larger than those of commercial banks. Five years later, shadow banks’ holdings represented nearly 80 percent of global gross domestic product. Nobody disputes this makes the global financial system less secure. Even those parts of the financial system that would seem to have nothing to do with you and me can disrupt our lives. I’d never even heard of “family offices” until I read Chuck Collins’s excellent 2021 book, The Wealth Hoarders: How Billionaires Pay Millions to Hide Trillions. (Clearly, I don’t hang with the right crowd.) Family offices are organizations set up by very rich people to preserve their wealth over multiple generations; they’re more or less Thomas Jefferson’s worst nightmare. Although family offices have been around a long time—the Cabots and the Lowells had them in the nineteenth century—more than half of those now in existence, per Collins, were created in this still-young century. Jeff Bezos’s dad just expanded his. Sometimes family offices combine into multifamily offices, or family funds. Vacationing in Nassau last year, I drove past what looked like a Walmart or Costco; on closer inspection, it was a big-box family fund. (It won’t surprise you to learn that family funds flourish in tax havens like the Bahamas.) Family offices and family funds are perhaps the most blatant engines of what Thomas Piketty calls “patrimonial capitalism.” That makes it tempting to greet the prospect that they might collapse with a hearty, “Good riddance!” And yes, if they declined in some gradual, stately manner like the Magnificent Ambersons, that’s what I’d say too. The trouble is that they’re at least equally likely to decline abruptly, taking the rest of us down with them. As The Economist observed in 2018, “Family offices could endanger the stability of the financial system. Combining very rich people, opacity, and markets can be very expensive.” When the family fund Archegos went bust in 2021, it cost Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley more than $10 billion, with ripple effects in the stock market of $33 billion. If your retirement fund held stock in CBS or Discovery then it was hard cheese for you. The corner of shadow banking that appears shakiest today is private equity, which is what we called leveraged buyouts before the convicted junk-bond king Michael Milken gave them a bad name in the late 1980s. Private equity firms use debt to buy existing firms; manage them to be more profitable, typically through layoffs; then take them public. Defenders of the practice used to say this made the target companies more efficient. But today almost everybody who doesn’t work in private equity hates private equity for loading up companies with insurmountable debt and raking in so much money on fees that private equity firms don’t have to care all that much whether this or that company survives. Another common criticism is that private equity puts the squeeze on certain enterprises—hospitals, retirement homes, even hospice providers—that were never intended to be profit-maximizers, weakening the quality of the vital social services they provide. Can’t afford to buy a house? In his latest book, Burned by Billionaires: How Concentrated Wealth and Power Are Ruining Our Lives and Planet, Collins demonstrates various ways in which private equity drives up housing costs. One Ohio firm invests in short-term and vacation rentals—Airbnb, Vrbo, etc.—to the tune of $1.5 billion, with capital from the Blackstone Group and other 800-pound gorillas in private equity. Lately I’ve had trouble reconciling two story lines in the financial press about private equity. One story line is that private equity is taking over the world. The other is that private equity is on the verge of extinction. Bethany McLean, the superb financial reporter who last week started a column in The Washington Post, squared the circle in her inaugural essay by explaining that private equity is swallowing up everything in sight precisely because it’s in financial trouble. McLean’s piece was about President Donald Trump’s executive order last month directing the Labor Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission to ease fiduciary requirements to encourage people to invest their 401(k)s in private equity and other “alternative assets,” by which Trump meant shadow banks. As it happens, Blackstone’s chief executive, Stephen Schwarzman, gave $37 million to Republican and conservative groups in the last election cycle. I’m sure that’s just a coincidence. Trying to herd grandma into private equity is insane. The rationale for private equity going unregulated is that the customers are either rich people or investors for giant pension and other funds who are savvy enough to take risks you and I shouldn’t, and rich enough that, should the risk go sour, no great harm is done. That’s the precise opposite circumstance from defined-contribution pensions, which until now have been regulated to the hilt to protect grandma from getting swindled. McLean doesn’t put it as bluntly as I do here, but her bottom line is that while you don’t particularly need private equity, “it is absolutely clear that private equity needs you—or rather, the trillions of dollars Americans have in our retirement accounts. Without our money, the industry is slamming into a brick wall of its own making.” I phoned McLean to ask her whether that brick wall is something that you and I need to worry about. Might private equity take us down with it? Absolutely, she replied. “Private equity has become too big to fail,” she said, “which raises a whole question of whether it should be private at all.” The solution, McLean said, is to regulate private equity as we do commercial banks and public corporations, with comparable transparency and legal limits on what it can do with our money. Private equity started to falter around the time Lina Khan became chair of the Federal Trade Commission, because any limit on mergers is a limit on how private equity firms reassemble the companies they acquire. Rising interest rates dealt another blow. Mostly, though, private equity was a victim of its own success. It ran out of things to buy and bid up the price of whatever was left. Default rates for private equity–backed companies, McLean pointed out, hit 17 percent during the previous three years, more than double the rate for companies not backed by private equity. By 2022, nearly half of all the supposedly slimmed-down and tuned-up companies exiting private equity firms were sold to other private equity firms, prompting one investor to tell The Financial Times, “This is the start of, potentially, I’m saying ‘potentially,’ a pyramid scheme.” In January, the FT columnist John Plender, writing about systemic risks in private equity, concluded: “No prizes for guessing where the next financial crisis will emerge from.” Of course, Trump doesn’t help matters by urging us all to throw our money into private equity and other risky shadow banks. But barring strict regulation of this sector to a degree that seems politically impossible at the moment, these outlaw financial institutions are fully capable of crashing the economy on their own.

Booking is one of my favorite companies in the world: they are a textbook Aggregator. And, in a fascinating twist, they are also among the best at managing Google, the biggest Aggregator of them all. In this interview we discuss both dynamics, starting from Priceline’s acquisition of Booking, the evolution of their business model, and where the company is going in the future. Along the way we discuss network effects and just how powerful they are, the challenges of building customer loyalty and being a destination site, and how AI might finally fulfill the longstanding dream of recreating the travel agent experience.

On to the Interview: This interview is lightly edited for content and clarity. Topics: Glenn Faujelle, welcome to Stratechery. Glenn Fogel: (laughing) Fogel is the name but I will accept. I asked you and you said you wish you had what the French call you. GF: My wife would change the name if it was Faujelle, instead she doesn’t. She goes by her maiden name. Well, it’s appropriate because given Booking’s European roots, but we can get to all that in a moment. I’m very excited to talk to you, I love Booking, I feel like it’s a company I should have written about more. There’s just never been that right moment to really nail it, but you mentioned that you’re a reader, it fits so well with so many things that I’ve written about, all which I want to get to in this interview. But before we get to Booking and get to why I’m interested in it, I do want to start with you and your background, where you grew up, what you thought you would be, and if it would be someone who wants to make his name French because he’s such a big deal on the European continent. GF: Yeah, so I’ll be brief. I grew up outside New York City in the suburbs, very nice suburbia growing up. I have parents who were very into education, they didn’t have college degrees, but they believed the importance of going to school, so I worked very hard. I was 17, a junior in the spring and I was looking forward to in the fall applying to colleges and I had unfortunately a very serious stroke, paralyzed me on my right side, wiped out all my language capabilities, and spent some time coming back up and ended up going to college. How long did that take to recover from? GF: Well, actually because it was the spring of my junior year, I was able to go to college in a year from the following fall so it was a year and some months, I did go. But I worked extremely hard there, I got a degree in finance at what was the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School as an undergraduate, graduated actually early to save some money for my folks. Started working but not in finance, I was working in IT, I was at Morgan Stanley in what was then called MIS, it was their IT shop and that in 1984, but we still had punch card machines. We didn’t use them, but they were there. My first job was putting tapes on drives. Memory used to be in tapes — many of your listeners do not know anything I’m talking about — turned out, ended up doing coding, wasn’t great at it, said I should do something else. It’s the ’80s, M&A was booming, I said, “Well, I’d like to go over to the other side at Morgan Stanley where all those merger and acquisition bankers were making good money”. Can’t just jump from being an IT guy even though I had the finance degree, so I went and got a degree at Harvard Law School. Came out, no intention of being a lawyer, started right at an investment bank called Kidder, Peabody & Co. Rode it into the ground, went eventually went to nothing, got sold to Paine Webber, at which point they let go most of the bankers. So I lost my job, and while was not fun, it did give me the experience of having been let go. Right. GF: So I have that credential. Something you had to be the other end of many years later. GF: Right. Met a woman and eventually she said, “If this relationship’s going to go on, you should get a job”, so I end up being a trader at Morgan Stanley and I did that for a couple years in the late ’90s and the Internet’s booming and I’m saying, “Wow, that seems a lot more exciting”, and I have a background in IT, I got a background in finance, and there was this job at a company called Priceline.com, which was really the darlings of the Internet bubble, so to speak. Right, one of the most insane IPOs at that time. GF: Exactly. It went public in the spring of 1999, right away over a $30 billion valuation, which back then was real money. I didn’t join until February of 2000, I had gotten the job at the end of ’99 and I said, “Listen, I’ll come over, but I just want to get my bonus for Morgan Stanley, they don’t pay you until February, so I got to stay until February”. They said, “No problem”, so I leave my trading job end of February, one week before the NASDAQ peaks, thereby proving that I should not be a trader, having just top ticked the Internet, gone long Internet. So I did that, and the company’s worth about $15 billion at the time and we went down over towards the end of the year to just a couple hundred million dollars market cap. Stock eventually went down to a dollar a share, had to do a reverse split to get it up. Was it a good thing you got that bonus to sort of carry you through? GF: Yeah, it certainly, certainly was. Turns out your stock grant wasn’t worth very much! GF: But imagine what my wife was saying to me. “Let me get this straight now, you left a great paying job, a real good job at Morgan Stanley to this high-flying company?”, but it worked out okay. So the stock on reverse split, $6 a share, way back then, I’ve been there now 25 years and while we’re not quite up to $6,000 a share yet, it’s not far. So easy math almost 1,000 times in 25 years, so it’s worked out okay. Yeah, you’re still married, so I think that’s the biggest endorsement that it all worked out. You’ve talked in other interviews about that stroke and how it grounded you through difficult times and to your point, Booking’s had a few of them. You go back through the Dot Com crash — well, I guess Priceline I should start out with, we’ll get to the Booking portion in a moment. The Dot Com crash, obviously there was 9/11 shortly thereafter, not great for travel, there’s the Great Recession, COVID-19, I mentioned the layoffs bit before, Google’s SERP changes. Okay, maybe that one doesn’t quite fit with the other one, so we can get to that one another time. GF: No, it does. But how did that shape you? And balance, clearly you wanted to chase the big thing, you want to take some risks. What benefit did that bring to you in your leadership style? GF: Well, you listed a bunch and there were so many other very trying moments, many of which we’d have to fill up the entire discussion to go through all of them. But the one thing that’s consistent among all these things is, and it’s the idea that if you’ve been through a crisis, you’re better prepared to deal with the next one. Having actually been in the arena in fighting the fight helps you understand that when you’re in the next one, stay calm, understand what your options are, how to play it. Minimize where there’s potential losses, try and see what other avenues can you go down, maintain flexibility. So again, it’s one of those things when things seem to go all to hell to say, especially the most recent, that pandemic, and there were a lot of people in panic. I’m like, “Hey, been there before, let’s not panic”. In fact, we’ve been through that whole COVID thing, the SARS-1 issue back in 2003 and we’d actually seen the effect of that before. So it was like, “Been there, no, it’s okay, we’ll be fine”. Yeah, that’s a great perspective. I mean it’s funny because I was in Taiwan, went to Taiwan in 2003, and so I was aware of that at the time, it had sort of died down at that point, but it’s interesting to tie it back to that. You’d seen major disruption, people scared to travel. I did want to ask about Priceline, the initial model of which was, “name-your-own-price“, how insane was that in retrospect or do you still think it was a good idea? GF: Well, so the idea of coming up with an opaque process, meaning opaque, you don’t really know what you’re buying, but you’re willing to do it to save a lot of money. Right away that’s not a bad thing. Now if we look in economics, the idea of consumer surplus or supplier surplus, and you see what you end up where you have people, consumers, who either are getting a benefit — they’d be willing to pay more for something, but the price is not at that level. The idea was trying to match up, capture what the person was willing to sell it for, is very good when you have a product you’re selling with very, very low marginal costs. Yep, and somebody needs to stay at a hotel, or they’re not going to make anything. GF: Or an airline, it much more was the airline. So that airline seat, the marginal cost of that seat is essentially zero. Right. GF: So if the airline can fill that up with something without impacting its regular distribution channels because you don’t want to have any type of price cannibalization, and the way that it came out wasn’t a bad idea at all. The problem really was is there aren’t a lot of verticals that that really worked for, and people, for whatever reason, they just don’t like the idea as much about putting in a bid with whether you get no chance to back out. If you put that bid in and somebody accepts it, you got to pay that amount and you’re on and there’s no refund. That’s really interesting because I would think that a big problem with that is it’s offloading a lot of burden onto the customer. It feels very weighty. “Did I put the right price?”, “What do I do?”, “Should I be too high?”, “Should I be too low?”, or is that part and parcel of the fact you can’t back out, you’re locked in once you commit? Or are those two different threads? GF: Well, I think there are two things, but I think they go to the same point. Right, it’s too much cognitive weight on the customer. GF: It’s tremendous. And the thing is, human beings are odd. It’s interesting, one of the things that bothers people almost as much as overpaying is not overpaying but paying more — even though they’re comfortable paying it — more than what somebody else got. The sense of fairness, it permeates everything. GF: But it does because when somebody says, “What is being rich?”, being rich is having more money than your brother-in-law. It’s all relative, and that’s one of the issues too. So in the end, the idea of bidding, not great, but the idea of having opaque pricing with some type of trade-offs is still used a lot. We still have those types of things and people are willing to do it and let’s say we see it in many different instances where people are willing to take a trade-off in terms of what the quality of what you’re buying to get a better price. So we’re going to get to AI in a moment, but as long as we’re here, would AI have made that work better by reducing the cognitive load? Or maybe another way to ask this is will AI-driven variable pricing work in the future in a way that makes customers feel good? And not feeling like, “They know who I am and so they’re screwing me”? GF: It’s very interesting to think, “How will the world of the future be if everybody has an agent and the agent is able to instantly be always checking for prices?”. And at the same time, the seller also has an agent that’s always looking at what is the current price and how does that work? As markets get very, very transparent, it’s going to be very interesting. Now the topping of all this though will be regulations because it’s also interesting where again, this idea of fairness, and which is an interesting concept, of regulators coming out and saying, “Well, is that fair or not?”, where you could have two parties, the seller and the buyer, both feel it’s fine and they’re happy. But the regulator says, “That’s not a fair market”, and starts putting in rules. So I can’t predict really what’s going to happen, but I agree with you, it’s going to be very interesting how it plays out. So when you bought Booking in 2005, what was your mindset when you bought the company? And the reason I asked, did you just think you were expanding internationally buying another travel site? Both you and Expedia were being very aggressive at that time, or did you realize you were buying an entirely different business model? I’d love for you to explain to me the difference in how Priceline acquired rooms back then and what Booking did and why that ended up being a big deal? GF: Yeah, it’s a shame we don’t have enough time to really go into all the nitty-gritty. Oh, no, I actually think this part is super, super interesting. So spend as much time as you want. GF: Okay, so we have the name-your-own-price product at Priceline, and I come in and I’m corporate development and we want to expand internationally with name-your-own-price. So we’re doing it throughout the world, different ways we create different structures and one structure was we set up this joint venture type operation in Europe, it’s Priceline Europe. Terrible timing, 9/11, and then you have recession and we pull back, etc. so it’s a very, very small operation now in Europe and we let go a lot of the people and I am now actually in charge of that. And I’m saying, “This is the craziest thing in the world”, because the idea of name-your-own-price to get a flight from London to Paris when you can go on Ryanair and EasyJet and pay five pounds, you’re going to save 50%, so it’s £2.50, really? Who’s going to do that? You end up with Frankfurt. You go London, Frankfurt, Paris, nobody’s going to do that. We got to do stuff the old fashion way, in addition, hotels. So we stopped the flight stuff, that’s ridiculous, but the hotel thing is okay. Name-your-own-price for hotels, but still people like to know the price and they like to know what they’re getting exactly. So I’m looking around, who knows how to sell like that around here? And find a little company called Active Hotels in the UK. Meet up with the people, we end up buying that in 2004, $165 million US dollars with an earn out for the founders who I want to stay on because the real value in anything is the people, it’s not like a coal mine where you’ve got coal underground, this is the people, and so we create a structure that gives them the upside if we’re really successful. So that happens in, when did that happen? 2004, in the summer of 2004, we end up in the fall of 2004, I am introduced to the people at Booking.com who are based in Amsterdam. They have almost the exact same model as Active Hotel, they’re disclosing everything just like you normally would by hotels but both Active and Booking have something slightly different than how the really big player, Expedia back then was the big player, and some of the other ones are. The difference is if you went to Expedia, you put your credit card in and you are essentially being charged right there. Merchant model, it’s called. Expedia is acquiring the room and you’re buying it from Expedia. GF: Well no, they’re not actually. Legally, they don’t actually own the room. In fact, what they have is the money in their bank account. Oh, so they get float along the way. GF: Which they are not planning to pay the hotel until after the person actually stays in the hotel and back then it would’ve been like a month afterwards. Really bad for cash flow for the hotels, really good cash flow for Expedia. Active had a different way of doing it called the agency model, which was, we’ll take the credit card, but that’s only to guarantee that you’ll actually show up. We’re not actually taking the money, the money was not run, the credit card was not run. So essentially, when you showed up at the hotel under Active Hotels, you paid the hotel at the desk with your credit card, or cash, or whatever, then Active sent afterwards an invoice to the hotel to pay the commission on it, totally reverse in the way the cash flow works. Booking had the exact same model as Active Hotel. So the issue was the more business you did, the faster you grew, especially with Booking because they had to pay Google up front in that month, but they weren’t going to get paid for months later, the hotel was going to pay him months later. The faster you grew, the worst your negative cash flow can get worse, worse, worse, worse, worse. So that’s one of the reasons we were able to convince them to join our little band. So Booking came into, and we combined Active and Booking to one company, and we threw in Priceline Europe too. But Booking’s a better name, so we kept it as Booking.com, and that’s the story. But here’s the question, though. You’re able to buy them because they have this problematic cash cycle. GF: And we bought them because they were totally European base, pretty much, Active was mostly the UK, so they could share and we put the inventory together, so now they’re both better off. And look, you spend a lot of time talking about network effects, etc, well here where you really have a great benefit by being able to add a lot more of the inventory to show to a particular traveler. That’s one of the big benefits. For sure, we’re definitely going to get to all that, but I’m very curious about this because from my perspective, the agency model is a critical component of what makes Booking what it is, into the behemoth that it has become. I talk about Aggregation Theory, and one of the things is the scalability aspect, all aspects need to be scalable and with this model, you have more from a hotel perspective, more scalability, more ability to come on, and you don’t need these custom integrations or whatever it might be. To me, that seems essential, so you acquiring the agency model seems super important to me, and it’s really striking to hear actually you talk about the real downsides of it, and the reason why it was a struggle for these companies. GF: Well back then that was certainly one of the ways we were able to grow rapidly was because go to a hotel and say, “Listen, just give us your content, just give us your photos, just tell us the prices, we’ll put it on”. We don’t need to make a business deal, yeah. GF: Yeah, and then if somebody shows up, we’re going to send you an invoice, and please pay us. Now part of the problems in that model for a lot of people who tried that in the past, was the hotels didn’t pay. So in the US for example, the actual collection rate for a travel agency was very bad, hotels would just ignore the commission letter, say, “Who cares about them?”, so that was a critical part too was collections, having a system to be able to collect the commissions. That was critical, and one among many different things that was done at the time that really made it different than a lot of other companies that historically had always done the commission-based agency model. What I’m curious about is did you go in thinking, “Okay, Booking has this, we’re going to change it to our model”? And then was there a point where you realized, “No, actually for all the challenges that this model presents, it’s actually better”. Why is it better? Why did that matter? GF: What’s good is having both models, Priceline was always the merchant model starting out. When we went into Asia, and we have the agency model at Booking.com, I was concerned, “Would it still work there?”, so we also looked at another company, very, very small company called Agoda. And Agoda based in Bangkok, they had the merchant model, and we ended up buying Agoda too, and now we keep them separate brands, separate things. Now, both have agency and merchant in different ways at different places, and the consumer gets to chose and there are many reasons people choose one versus the other. But having more choice is really an important benefit when you’re going to a customer. And I’ll go on, it’s now in terms of the way people pay, it’s incredible. So I think we’re over 40 maybe now, different ways a consumer can pay us, and we take the money and send it to the hotel, which is really important. If you are a consumer in Shanghai, and you’re going to show up at a small little hotel in the South of France, and you want to show up at the desk and use your whatever, Alipay or your WeChat Pay, that French hotel’s going to say, “What are you talking about? Please give me euros”, and that’s not it, but we are in-between it. We will take the Alipay or WeChat Pay, and we will then put euros in the bank account of the French hotel. And by the way, it’ll be a lot cheaper for the French hotel than if they had gotten a credit card from the traveler, because the interchange is much higher than us putting money into their bank account. So the answer to your question is payments is really important it’s the reason why we do a tremendous amount of our business is now done in the merchant model, not the agency model. Interesting. GF: There are a lot of benefits to it. So the agency model got all these folks on board, and then over time once you had that relationship built in, you could circle back to the merchant model. That makes a lot of sense. GF: Right. Exactly. Going back to this buildup aspect, another critical piece of Booking from my perspective is that the hotel market in Europe, particularly 20 years ago, was far more fragmented. You just have a lot more independent hotels as opposed to the US being more chains and things along those lines. This seems to me to cut in multiple dimensions. First to the agency model point, that scalability bit and it being super easy to get linked up seems really important. And second, this really just landed you right in the sweet spot of an aggregator, where consumers see way more hotels than they would anywhere else. And from a hotel, you suddenly are seen by way more customers than anywhere else. This seems obvious now, I guess I’m stating things that seem clear about network effects, but did you realize this when you bought Booking — I’m just really curious, because the Booking acquisition was such a home run. One of the things you did as CEO was change the name, “Okay, we’ve held on to Priceline for too long, we are Booking”, again, it’s not a home run, it’s a grand slam. I’m just curious how much of this did you learn along the way versus, “Oh, this is how it’s going to happen”? GF: No, these are all well understood concepts long before we started buying hotel agencies, like Booking.com. I had studied network theory long before that and I mean the basis of the Internet, or even going either further back, and there’s the famous when you’re in school you learn about, “Well, one telephone has a value of nothing”. Metcalfe’s law, yeah. GF: Of course it is. Right, exactly. You start getting into, “Well what is the value of a network?”, Ii it the square of the number of nodes, or how do you want to figure out the math of what is? But sure, of course that was all well understood and recognized why it would be such a valuable, valuable thing to have. But everybody knew that, and didn’t matter whether we were agency or merchant, everyone has built a network as quickly as possible, as fast as possible. What’s interesting, of course, is why did some of the networks that were out front, they got really good, but then they die out where others continue? We don’t have time to go into that, and theories of why did MySpace die but Facebook lived? Well let’s do it in travel. Why did Booking, why did you pass Expedia? Why did you become the top dog? GF: There are a lot of reasons that go into a question, and here we go into the idea of coming up with the narrative fallacy, which it’s a famous saying. Where we’re going to create a story about why the world is the way it is today, it’s not provable. You’re tapping into what I keep trying to pry around the edges of, because I know the story you tell. There’s a story I look backwards and see, and this is all straightforward, and I’m just so curious about how you actually navigated this story way back then, when it’s, again, it’s really easy to look backwards and everything seems so obvious. GF: Of course, that’s the issue of the narrative fallacy. And I can tell my story, and you have your story, many people have many stories about it, but there’s no way to actually prove out what is true and what is not true. I do know that I have a belief of certain things that are very critical. I also know, and this is really important for anybody who’s in a business with anything in life really, is that so much of the ultimate results are going to be determined by things you have zero control over. I can’t control what our competitors do, I can’t control what governments do in terms of economics, I can’t control issues like natural disasters, and so many things are going to impact your business. In our business, my Lord, things hit us all the time, and the only thing we can do is control ourselves. So try and improve the products, improve the services, so that both sides of our marketplace, our travelers and our partners, both see value in participating at our business, at their free will and that’s very important for us is that look, no hotel in the world has to work with us, they do it because we give them value to do it. And by the way, some hotels don’t. I even stay at hotels that are not on our network, because they don’t want to be on our network, but I want to stay in that hotel. There’s a place in Lake George in upstate New York— That’s a lot of throat-clearing, though. So what is your narrative that you’re going to give my audience? What is the key thing why you surpassed everyone? GF: I won’t do that, and here’s why, because I give it, and then it gives it more weight, and more credence, and more belief that was the truth. There is no truth. The only thing I can say is part of the reason is we worked damn hard, part is we had really smart driven people who wanted to succeed. Part of it is they came up with ways to provide more service, more value to both sides than other players did and being a friendlier partner, being better customer service, really focusing on it, customer centricity, those things were really, really important, but that’s kind of like table stakes for a lot of companies do that. All right, fair enough. I’ll let you off the hook. Tell me about your relationship with Google. I don’t know if it’s still the case, I know for a long time you were the biggest Google ad spender and I believe that really happened around sort of the tail ends of the 2000s, early 2010s, when that really ramped up. Was that driven by Google’s change of the SERP and moving away from ten blue links into their own travel product, and you realized, “Hey, game’s changed, we have to approach this differently”? What was the process there, and how has that evolved? GF: Interesting, so when we were about to buy Booking.com, and we already owned Active Hotels, Active Hotels was very into SEO, all free search, very into that and they also had a lot of affiliates that were really bot farms, they were all farms, and we got a lot of business from them. Booking, on the other hand, and this is another reason we wanted to combine them both, is Booking was really into SEM [Search Engine Marketing], they were paying, and they really became really one of the first players that I’m aware of that did really big A/B testing, really interesting science going into that stuff. Right before we buy Booking, Google does a giant change in the algo, and we drop so much business on all the free clicks, it was like, “Wow, what’s happened?”. That’s when we really tilted more, “Okay, so we just have to keep paying more and more into Google”, and optimizing it so we actually have a good ROI, which we did, and continued to work on that. That was before 2010, that was 2005, 2006, 2007. Then of course, you have the financial crisis, etc., but we still power through that. And that’s it, now I have no idea who the biggest spenders are with Google now, Google does not disclose, we do spend a heck of a lot of money with them, it’s a very good relationship, we’re good partners. We have a similar goal, and that is to get customers to get what they want as soon as they can. I think that your approach to Google, for me, is a big part of the narrative story, and in two respects. Number one, there are other people in this space who got very large on SEO that basically their response to Google’s changes was to whine and whine incessantly for years and years and years and I feel there’s a very sort of pragmatic approach from Booking for years that, to your point, you can’t control what happens around you. You sort of play the hand that you’re dealt, and you dealt that by we’re going to pay. What I’m curious about is, and this is sort of part two, is there an aspect where you’re dealing with Google, the ultimate aggregator, gave you more sympathy for the hotels, and dealing with you and knowing how to deal with them since you’re sort of sitting on top of them in that role? Or was there the opposite where just shit flows downhill sort of as it might be? I’m just curious, you’re in a unique position of clearly being an aggregator, one of the most textbook aggregators ever, and yet also you have to be aggregated by Google, and sort of navigate that, and figure it out. GF: I do talk about this sometimes, it comes up. So we’ll have a hotel here, and let’s say we’re charting a 15% commission, and they’re not thrilled with having to pay 15% to us. Of course, we have to pay a big amount to Google to get the traffic to us, right? And so, you’re right, there is this relationship, and the big overall point is nobody likes to pay for marketing or distribution. Everybody would like all their business to come to them free, direct, loyal, again, and again, and again. People being people, that’s not exactly how the world works, so you do have to pay. Then the next thing is you want to at least make sure that it’s a fair relationship and that’s really critical with our hotel partners, is saying, “Yes we are charging 15%, but we are getting you incremental demand”, and you understand this very well from your points earlier about understanding what’s the incremental cost to that hotel, so a hotel room that goes empty that night, that’s zero revenue, zero profit. However, you fill that up at $100, well what’s the real cost to that? Well, the incremental cost is essentially nothing, you already paid for the mortgage. You’re just fighting over margin. GF: Exactly! So we take 15% out of 100%. It’s actually a very good deal for them, which is why they do it so it’s all fine. With us and Google is if we didn’t think we were getting a good ROI, we wouldn’t be spending it. Come on, it’s not just Google, well, whether it be Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, pick your channel, we are always looking to get the ROI, always looking, “Where can we optimize?”, and that’s one of the benefits we get to our hotelier friends, partners, is the idea is make sure that we are giving them a good ROI, and helping them out. Because if we don’t, they can go to Expedia more, there’s so many different ways they can distribute their rooms, because they want to maximize their bottom line. I mentioned how your position might give you more sympathy for your suppliers in this regard. Now that you’re, I think, are you still the only European company that’s been designated as a gatekeeper by the EU? GF: There are seven companies in the world that have been designated by the EU as gatekeepers. Unbelievably so, six of the seven are American, we’re one of them. We’re an American company, Booking Holdings is incorporated in the US, we are headquartered in the US. Booking.com is a subsidiary of Booking Holdings. Right. GF: The seventh company that’s a gatekeeper that’s not the US, though, maybe it will be very shortly is TikTok. So, there is no European company. Does that give you more sympathy for Google now that you’re feeling some of their pain? (laughing) GF: This is one of the things that I talked to the EU about, I talked to many people about this. I absolutely believe, I absolutely believe that the DMA, the way to set up its gatekeepers is not set up correctly. The idea that we, in one of the most competitive industries in the world, and I had a good headline quote in the Financial Times in London once, I said, “We have to fight for a booking every day”, because it’s true. You’re just one click away from somebody choosing somebody else, it is incredibly competitive. So, the idea to put us in the same bucket as trillion dollar businesses like Google and Amazon? That’s absurd, it’s absolutely absurd. And yet what it does, it creates the costs, and the things we have to deal with that are much more difficult, thereby making it actually, we have a lot of European employees, so it actually makes it more difficult for European employees there, it has to be able to expand, etc. To me it just baffles the mind and I believe somebody said, “Well, you want to talk about reason to stories? My story in this is it’s politics.” Well, all the hotels, to your point, they want all the customers you deliver them, and they don’t want to pay for them. GF: Of course not. They’ve complained about it. GF: Exactly. That’s absolutely right, and I understand that. Listen, that’s part of a free world, if you can lobby better than we can lobby, I guess it’s not good for economics, it’s not good for society, but it’s good for an individual player. I do have a bone of contention to pick with you, and you referenced it earlier. I, like many other professionals my age, was an extremely loyal Starwood member back in the day. It breaks my heart to see how Marriott has diminished those brands after acquiring Starwood in 2016 and the reason I’m blaming you, laying it at your feet, is it seems hotels realize that to avoid the way around you, or the way around aggregation in general is you need these super good loyalty programs and a good way to have that is to have the most hotels. So, I’m asking you, are you the reason why I now get crappy plastic cups, and uncomfortable pillows in Westin’s when that wasn’t the case before? Because you made all these guys consolidate, and try to get out from your fees? GF: So, I’d first like to say that I am also very fond of Marriott at all of their brands. (laughing) Of course you are! GF: And Hilton, and I can go through the entire list… That was on me, Glenn was grimacing the whole time for those that are listening. GF: (laughing) Right, right. Look, here’s the thing I believe that- I’m actually asking you in general about the hotel’s response to getting larger and things like that. GF: It’s not just hotels. Look, everybody’s trying to come up with, “How can I get the customers to be more loyal?”, I mean, American Express just sent out the bill, if I want to have a platinum card, it’s going to cost $895. Meanwhile, Chase Sapphire, they’re being the cheap guys at $795, and I think there’s a Capital One that I know, $495, whatever. Everybody’s playing the loyalty, trying and bring more benefits, and they all show that if you pay this yearly fee, look at all the great benefits you’re going to get for it, it’ll actually pay more. There’s nothing wrong with people coming up with new ways to try, and combine things to create more value and I have nothing against it. By the way, and I’ve been talking with all the big chains about this stuff. We need to have a relationship where I know they feel that if somebody booked with us who is a high status loyalty member, their company is saying, “Gee, is it fair for them to pay us the same amount of money they paid us somebody who’s never visited their hotels before?”, and I do agree with that, and we need to come up with a way that actually, while I’m not sure one will make any more money, or they’ll make any more money, but at least it’ll be a fair, and we used the word fair before, it’s a fair transaction. If we could imagine a model where the commission is different if they’ve put in their loyalty number, or something along those lines. GF: Totally, totally like that. Exactly. And by the way, and while we don’t do this, I mean look, some of these giant chains as big as they are, they don’t market to certain parts of the world. We market to people in Turkistan, or pick a place they don’t and we do things in over 40 languages, we have customer service for over 40 languages, they don’t. So, we are rolling benefits to them, that’s the thing they want is the incremental customer. I put that list of crises earlier. Was Airbnb a crisis when it came along, or do you feel like in the end they just actually expanded the market, more places to stay, more types of trips, whatever it might be? Or was it actually — what was your process of facing this orthogonal competitor? You still talked on your last earnings call about alternative bookings, is it still a real center of focus for you? GF: So, alternative accommodations in the last call, we talked about it over, I think it was 37% of our total room nights. Now when you add up what that number means, that’s almost a little under almost three quarters of the total number of room nights that Airbnb did, and we’ve outgrown them, 16 of the last 17 quarters we’ve grown faster. So, I’d say it’s a pretty big deal for us and it has been for some time. So one of those things that seemed like a crisis, and has actually turned out to be a huge opportunity. GF: It never was a crisis, it was just another area where we need to build, and we didn’t have the right processes, we didn’t have the right platform, we weren’t necessarily doing things as well as we could have. And by the way, I said this in my last call, I said, there’s still a lot of things we can improve in that product for our customers and our hosts in a way that they will prefer to use us more and that’s something which is good. That actually means there’s actually a lot of upside left for us, and I believe that, I really believe that. Is your key advantage just the fact that if I’m searching, if I search on Airbnb, it’s only Airbnbs. If I search on Expedia, I can see both then compare, or is there more that goes into it? GF: Well, I’d say that’s a big one right from the beginning and I’ve said this so many times that one of our advantages was that I did notice that [Airbnb CEO] Brian [Chesky] recently was talking about how they’re going to be in a lot more hotels. I’ve been saying that for years. Airbnb, I mean obviously it was a great idea, could create an entirely new market. There’s a lot of strategic decisions they’ve made in the last X number of years that I don’t completely get. GF: Well, so, I imagine that we will be seeing more of that competition coming from that area. But look, it’s all good. I like competition, it helps us all do a better job for both sides of the marketplace. So, something you’ve championed for a long time, well before AI, is this idea of delivering a Connected Trip, you bought OpenTable, and you’ve bought lots of other companies along the way. What is that? Explain, give me the high level thesis. How have you approached it? This feels a little like, “Let’s put ourselves in a pre-AI mind”, because I’m going to ask you how AI changes that. I’ll give you a preview of the next question. Is this a bit where it sounds good in theory, but it’s not actually the way customers operate? GF: So, a couple ways to approach this. One way I always like to explain it is when I was younger, much, much younger, and my family would set up a trip somewhere. There is a thing called a travel agent that was a human being, many times was a woman, and she knew a lot about our family, and what we liked, and how much we could afford and she’d come up with some ideas, and my parents would have conversation with her, and such, and then she’d come up with a couple things, and we’d buy it, and we had everything, all the things we needed, the flights, how to get to the airport, the hotels, what to do there, all that stuff, and we give her one check, my mother would write a check to her and be done. God forbid anything went wrong, we just called her, and she would fix it all. Magically it would all get fixed, it’ll all be fine. Now technology should be able to recreate that only much, much better, because the database doesn’t forget like I imagine the travel agent human probably did occasionally. Well, that, and it’s much more accessible. GF: It’s 24/7, 24/7, and in addition, which is really good, it has an ability to know so much more about what’s happening at the exact time, or in the future. So, for example, the human travel agent never would’ve been able to, when the plane is delayed by four hours to send out a text, and say, “Excuse me, Mr. Fogel, your plane right now will be late by four hours, but we have a different flight for you, would you like to change it? In addition now because you’re going to still arrive two hours late to your destination, we’ve already rearranged the car service for you, and in addition, so you’ll no longer make your dinner reservation, we’ve already tried to move that to a different time, but that restaurant doesn’t have availability at that later time, however, we have looked at three other restaurants that are in the near vicinity. Would you like to choose one of those instead, which has availability, and we’ll notify your partner so that person knows we’ll be there.” What I want is I want to have a third spouse in our, my wife, and relationship who does all of this for us. Only it’s not going to be human, it will be done digitally. Right. This all sounds amazing. But you launched the Connected Trip idea a long time ago, and in retrospect, particularly when you look at AI, and how AI can potentially do this, were you just way too early, and this sounds good in theory, but actually there’s so many difficulties in pulling this off? Where actually we just have a holding company of a bunch of different companies that in theory work together, but it’s not a doable project? GF: I do not disagree with you on your point that it’s taking a long time. Agree totally, but you have to think where we came from, all we had were hotels. We didn’t have a flight business at all, we really started that 2019, just started it. So, five years later, let’s round off, call it five years later, we now sell more airline tickets than any other third party distributor in the world except for China, a little different, so we’ll do it ex China. That’s amazing in just five years to do that. In addition, the increase our Attractions now, we had no attraction business at all, now we doubled the last quarter, we doubled the number of Attractions. Our car rental business continued to grow. Rides, instead of renting a car, you just get a ride service from the airport, or to the airport, insurance, so many things. We had to build all these different verticals, and now having done that now, bringing it together, using science, using data, analyzing it, making sure we are putting up the right offers at the right time with the right value to the right person so they get the best experience they can. And God forbid anything goes wrong, we as the person who actually has put it all together, with the relationship with everyone, we can fix it. Now that’s for the traveler. On the partner side, the supplier side, we’re giving incredible number of different opportunities for them to provide, get incremental demand by providing different values, different things. We have a thing called our Genius program where primarily the supplier fund discounts, because we’re giving it to certain customers who pay more, who are willing to do it more often, so we give more value to our supplier partners. Combining those two things, using again all the data analytics, it’s going to be wonderful. Now you’re right with generative AI, it may be easier to do all this stuff, don’t disagree with that. Your point, it’s hard is very correct, which is good, because if it was easy, there’d be a lot more people doing it. What’s more important? Is it the demand side, or the supplier side? And I know the answer is both. They’re both really important, or does it matter in different stages of the evolution of your company? For example, I thought it was really interesting, you made the point that agency model was important to get that demand, but over time, merchant actually lets you deliver a better experience for both sides, and so you’ve seen some transition there. Is that the case different when you’re building a network effect, which one comes first if you want to add on a connected experience? GF: I think the problem is when you’re overweight one side of that type of equation, you end up with real big problems and whether, I know you did a recent, it was very interesting interview with [Uber CEO] Dara [Khosrowshahi], shout out for the interview you do with Dara because I thought it was fascinating, but it’s very similar network effect. If you have too many drivers, you’ve got a problem. If you don’t have enough drivers, and a lot more people want rides, you’ve got a problem. Same thing for us. If we have too much demand, and there is no supply, we’ve got a problem, the customer’s unhappy. Similar the other way, if a supplier puts out a line, they’re not getting any business, they get tired, and they stop working with you. Right. It’s like, “What’s the point of paying this 15%? I thought that I was supposed to be getting lots of customers”. GF: Well, no, don’t forget about they only pay the 15% if they get the demand. That’s a very important point to make out, which I continue to make to anyone who is interested in the issue of what value do we provide, I say, “Look at what we do here, we’ll take all the inventory, we’ll take the content, we’ll take the photos, we’ll give suggestions how to do things better, we will translate it into forty-something different languages, we’ll go out, and get demand, and we’ll make sure that your property is shown to the right customers. We do all of that, and I’m not going to charge you a thing, it’s free, absolutely free. The only thing I ask is if, if you get a customer who stays in your hotel, would you please pay us a fair commission?” That’s it, it’s a great deal. It’s a great deal for everybody, and for everybody who comes out, and says, “Oh, well they have too much power, or whatever”, people come out and say — I say, “What are you talking about? You don’t like it? Don’t join!”. Something Booking is hailed for, we were talking about this before in your story. I appreciate that I don’t want to land a specific narrative, it is what it is, we work hard, all those bits and pieces, just between you and I, however, is the actual answer to Booking’s durability, is it really just a network effect thing? This ties into what’s more important, demand or supply? The answer is both, they’re both important and you have both. Are network effects still underrated in terms of how you survive through paradigms? How do you avoid disruption? And the answer is if you have a network effect, you have the time and space to figure it out, and that’s okay because to your point, you’re motivated and you have the business model where both sides benefit. But do we still underrate these concepts you’ve been studying for so long? GF: I go the other way. I’d say that the network effect is overrated. Interesting. GF: Terribly overrated. Well, tell me why. GF: And a lot of antitrust people think that, and you can go back to the A&P cases way back, I don’t know how long, 50 years ago, 60 years ago, probably more actually maybe 70 years ago. The fact is that there are lots of very similar networks out there. You mentioned Bonvoy and Marriott, huge network effects there. Tremendous. All the airlines, tremendous. All our competitors, similar. Trip.com, they actually do more total travel value than we do probably. I tell you this idea that there’s some sort of lock-in effect, which is really what people start talking when they start networks, they start going to this idea of some sort of lock-in, there is no lock-in and I have the proof of so many of our customers do not spend a lot of their travel budget with us entirely. They use lots of different ways throughout the year, they’ll use us for some other times. They’ll go direct to the hotel, sometimes they’ll go to a tour operator, there’s so many different things. The data proves really that at least in travel, I won’t try and go beyond my expertise, in travel, the network effects are very low. There is incredible competition and those that say otherwise are ignoring the facts and the data and the science. I’m going to disagree with you slightly, but not completely, in that my contention is that the network effects enjoyed by your service, the aggregators, is because by definition you’re delivering value. To your point, hotels get free marketing until they actually make money and then you’re taking a commission on that. It’s not like they’re paying to get on there because you’re not the only way to reach customers, you have to earn it, quite literally. You have to actually deliver a booking. GF: Yeah, exactly. In fact, here’s the thing. Do you know in terms of Europe, our biggest market, we only have a single teens percentage of the market of hotels? That means 85% or roughly somewhere in that neighborhood of hotels that are being booked are not going through us. So anybody come up and say, “You have a 15% share, but you’re a dominant player”, is that not one of the craziest things you’ve ever heard? I mean, don’t get me started on European craziness, but I think the reason I’m pushing on this is network effects are a good thing. Being able to find any hotel in one place is convenient and it’s great. Being able to acquire more customers is convenient and great. GF: I agree. So that’s why I push back, I think there is network effects. GF: No, I agree. I’m saying not as big. So we’re just sort of arguing semantics. It’s not railroads, it’s not cables, that’s the problem. GF: I agree, totally. I’m saying it’s not as powerful as some people think it is. It definitely is, there’s value definitely, it’s just to my thing and there are a lot of others who have the exact same type of network. Where is Booking, when you look forward 5 to 10 years, is it still the arc we’re following? It’s this Connected Trip, we can tell, to your point, I think the problem with a lot of these Connected Trips ideas, particularly before, is it’s a good narrative. It sounds great, I’m going to have the travel agent deliver it and the number of edge cases and complexity in the real world is just so large, it’s never been doable. But is this a bit where actually, that’s probably right, but all that investment was worth it because suddenly it is doable. Did I just summarize what’s the next decade for you? GF: Well, I think you did. I mean our goal is to get that Connected Trip really in a way that a lot of people really see the values. I’m going to go to Booking because I get a lot more value through the Connected Trip and we’re seeing a little, like we did announce in our earnings call, how the growth of people who are buying more than one vertical in a trip has gone up. I believe it was over 30% is what we said a couple months ago. I just read it about an hour ago, so I remember that. GF: Okay, good, so my memory isn’t gone. If you notice, it broke into the double-digit percentage of our total amount of transactions, so it’s showing it is growing, but we are still so early. I believe this is one of these things where you do hit a phase transition, you build up the verticals, you start going, but then at some point, instead of it going linearly, you get exponential growth as people really catch on. This really is much better. Is this going to have to be a product-led growth strategy? Can you SEM yourself into this or is that you almost have to build a new muscle in that regard? GF: I think the marketing of it will be important to help get people aware of it, but I don’t want to put on a firehose of marketing until it’s really good. That makes sense. This is the other interesting point where you can have sympathy for hotels, you have your own loyalty program, you want people opening Booking first thing instead of going through Google to get there and you mentioned the Genius program and how your suppliers will help fund that because you’re consistently delivering more people. Is that a big focus going forward? Do you feel good about that? Is that going to be critical to getting the Connected Trip working? GF: What I really want to be able to do is help our partners do better, I want them to make more money than they would otherwise, I want them to have happier customers than they would otherwise. One of the ways that we’ll be able to do that is by providing them incremental demand right away. That’s great and all that, and I understand where somebody say, “I wish I didn’t have to pay a commission for that customer”, but I want to help make sure they understand that they wouldn’t have gotten that person. But there’s more. We know technology is now coming forward so rapidly, so many of these hotels, they don’t have IT departments, they don’t understand, they don’t know how to deal with this. We will do it for them for free. Again, all the things we do for them, and believe me, this is not dissimilar when you go back to the mid to late ’90s when hotels didn’t have websites, they didn’t know what to do or how to do this or whatever, somebody did it for them. Well that’s kind of now in this new world with all this new technology, we were able to provide the service to them again in a way that they will be better off, their bottom line’s improved. Do you think there’s a shift where you keep talking about, “You’re really valuable, people shouldn’t be mad at us, we’re providing incremental revenue to assets that are already there”, but there’s one thing that I think is interesting about the ultimate aggregators is in some respects they create their own supply and maybe this is where Airbnb was really interesting and got there first, and you’ve done a very good job catching up to them, but creating their own supply of rooms that only exist because Airbnb. I talk about Facebook creating an entire universe of e-commerce retailers that basically exists because of Facebook, that gives them real durability. What market can you create as opposed to servicing hotels that exist and we’re going to give you incremental revenue there or has that already happened? GF: I think you’re right. In both examples you gave, they did create new blue ocean markets that did not exist previously and more power to them for having done that. We, as you point out, we are basically making a markets more efficient, providing more value to people who are already into the marketplace. So for us to create a new market, we’d have to be going on to something that is not currently being done. Now, if we have such a thing, I would not be disclosing it right now. Right, fair enough. But it’s fair to say, and if you were to even do the Connected Trip, but most of the stuff, you’re not talking about Airbnb, Airbnb is still like, “We’re going to create experiences X, Y, Z”, you’re like, “No, you can get your car and then get your hotel and get your restaurant, that’s what Booking does, it makes it more efficient”. GF: And very important. But services, what we call Attractions, are very important because nobody goes on a trip to hang out in the hotel room, you go to do stuff. So whether it be the scuba trip, the snorkeling, the museum, the theater, whatever it is, we want to be able to provide that to them too. One of the examples of the Connected Trip, I always give an example that I love, which is you go to Amsterdam, the two things most people want to do, they want to take a canal boat ride in Amsterdam and they want to go to the Rijksmuseum because it’s very famous museum, great things. Now the thing is though, we want to be able to provide, which we can now, we provide it to both tickets for both things. Imagine you have booked the Thursday for the boat trip and the Friday for the museum. On Tuesday, however, we notice, we obviously see what the weather is and we come back say, “You know something, the rain is coming for your boat ride day and it’s going to be sunny the other day, so why don’t we switch them around for you and we can do it all. Would you like that? Press yes.” And we will do it all for you, that kind of convenience and that looking forward to provide what could be a problem beforehand, that’s real value. Those are the type of things absolutely a part of the Connected Trip. Is that another advantage of Booking in particular’s European roots? It always strikes me, all these European sites have their own technology stack from like 25 years ago, whereas U.S. is just like, “Yeah, that’s fine, we don’t want to do that, we’ll jump on sort of something else”. Is that a real opportunity to go in and provide a brand new technology stack for all these experiences telling them this is the advantage you’ll get? GF: So we have a company that’s the leader in the space, FareHarbor, which we own, which works for us and provides the backend ticketing and reservations for a lot of small and medium-sized Attraction players. We are the biggest player in the world in that, so that is our stack that we do provide, free again, to things and think of it as like OpenTable, which we also have only, FareHarbor’s for attractions, OpenTable for restaurants, etc. But you’re right, there are a lot of different backend systems, but the wonderful world of APIs, you can tie to anybody. Got it. Well, I could talk about Booking forever. Like I said, it’s such a textbook example and it’s so interesting that it’s on both sides of this equation, but did we get what you wanted to cover? GF: Yeah, it has been really fun, really interesting. I mean, it’s fascinating. As you’ve done in many of your interviews, you just scratch the surface because there’s so many interesting things in the topics that you cover, but this certainly is one, and today with Gen AI coming down the pike for all of us, how will the world change? It’s going to be a very interesting thing Google — are they going to be your most important channel forever? GF: Who knows, right? Who knows about that? And I would even more so are the big societal issues and these are the issues not so much about how we do our business, but how do all of us do our business and what are the impacts going to be in terms of employment, in terms of jobs? These are interesting things that I wish our government friends would spend a lot more time on that as opposed trying to guess what’s happening in small vertical areas. Do you think you might see a fork in the road where you want to deliver this experience in Booking and be that destination and tie it all together, but actually the ChatGPT’s of the world might actually be where all trip planning happens and you’re just going to have to, like you did with Google back in the day, accept that and be the best at that? GF: It’s certainly a possibility, we’ll see how it plays out. We are currently and have announced many relationships, many deals with many of the players in the space, and there’ll be many more in the future. Look, there are going to be people I absolutely know are going to go to a large language model provider and want to start their trip planning discovery there and I’m going to lament and say, “Why did they start with us first?”, it’ll be just like hotel, “Why didn’t they come direct?”, it’ll be the same thing, but I like to believe that we will create things that are so great the same way we have over 60% of our customers currently come to us direct. When you X out the B2B business, you go just the B2C business, over 60%, it’s mid-60s actually come to us direct. They’re not going to Google first, they’re not going to anybody. I would like that to actually be even a higher number down the road and they’re coming at the very beginning of their discovery area. But if they don’t, you’ll figure it out and be there. GF: If they don’t, we catch them later in the funnel and we’re still able to be able to get paid well, it’s all good. Glenn Fogel, thanks for coming on. GF: Thank you very much for having me.

Booking is one of my favorite companies in the world: they are a textbook Aggregator. And, in a fascinating twist, they are also among the best at managing Google, the biggest Aggregator of them all. In this interview we discuss both dynamics, starting from Priceline’s acquisition of Booking, the evolution of their business model, and where the company is going in the future. Along the way we discuss network effects and just how powerful they are, the challenges of building customer loyalty and being a destination site, and how AI might finally fulfill the longstanding dream of recreating the travel agent experience.

On to the Interview: This interview is lightly edited for content and clarity. Topics: Glenn Faujelle, welcome to Stratechery. Glenn Fogel: (laughing) Fogel is the name but I will accept. I asked you and you said you wish you had what the French call you. GF: My wife would change the name if it was Faujelle, instead she doesn’t. She goes by her maiden name. Well, it’s appropriate because given Booking’s European roots, but we can get to all that in a moment. I’m very excited to talk to you, I love Booking, I feel like it’s a company I should have written about more. There’s just never been that right moment to really nail it, but you mentioned that you’re a reader, it fits so well with so many things that I’ve written about, all which I want to get to in this interview. But before we get to Booking and get to why I’m interested in it, I do want to start with you and your background, where you grew up, what you thought you would be, and if it would be someone who wants to make his name French because he’s such a big deal on the European continent. GF: Yeah, so I’ll be brief. I grew up outside New York City in the suburbs, very nice suburbia growing up. I have parents who were very into education, they didn’t have college degrees, but they believed the importance of going to school, so I worked very hard. I was 17, a junior in the spring and I was looking forward to in the fall applying to colleges and I had unfortunately a very serious stroke, paralyzed me on my right side, wiped out all my language capabilities, and spent some time coming back up and ended up going to college. How long did that take to recover from? GF: Well, actually because it was the spring of my junior year, I was able to go to college in a year from the following fall so it was a year and some months, I did go. But I worked extremely hard there, I got a degree in finance at what was the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School as an undergraduate, graduated actually early to save some money for my folks. Started working but not in finance, I was working in IT, I was at Morgan Stanley in what was then called MIS, it was their IT shop and that in 1984, but we still had punch card machines. We didn’t use them, but they were there. My first job was putting tapes on drives. Memory used to be in tapes — many of your listeners do not know anything I’m talking about — turned out, ended up doing coding, wasn’t great at it, said I should do something else. It’s the ’80s, M&A was booming, I said, “Well, I’d like to go over to the other side at Morgan Stanley where all those merger and acquisition bankers were making good money”. Can’t just jump from being an IT guy even though I had the finance degree, so I went and got a degree at Harvard Law School. Came out, no intention of being a lawyer, started right at an investment bank called Kidder, Peabody & Co. Rode it into the ground, went eventually went to nothing, got sold to Paine Webber, at which point they let go most of the bankers. So I lost my job, and while was not fun, it did give me the experience of having been let go. Right. GF: So I have that credential. Something you had to be the other end of many years later. GF: Right. Met a woman and eventually she said, “If this relationship’s going to go on, you should get a job”, so I end up being a trader at Morgan Stanley and I did that for a couple years in the late ’90s and the Internet’s booming and I’m saying, “Wow, that seems a lot more exciting”, and I have a background in IT, I got a background in finance, and there was this job at a company called Priceline.com, which was really the darlings of the Internet bubble, so to speak. Right, one of the most insane IPOs at that time. GF: Exactly. It went public in the spring of 1999, right away over a $30 billion valuation, which back then was real money. I didn’t join until February of 2000, I had gotten the job at the end of ’99 and I said, “Listen, I’ll come over, but I just want to get my bonus for Morgan Stanley, they don’t pay you until February, so I got to stay until February”. They said, “No problem”, so I leave my trading job end of February, one week before the NASDAQ peaks, thereby proving that I should not be a trader, having just top ticked the Internet, gone long Internet. So I did that, and the company’s worth about $15 billion at the time and we went down over towards the end of the year to just a couple hundred million dollars market cap. Stock eventually went down to a dollar a share, had to do a reverse split to get it up. Was it a good thing you got that bonus to sort of carry you through? GF: Yeah, it certainly, certainly was. Turns out your stock grant wasn’t worth very much! GF: But imagine what my wife was saying to me. “Let me get this straight now, you left a great paying job, a real good job at Morgan Stanley to this high-flying company?”, but it worked out okay. So the stock on reverse split, $6 a share, way back then, I’ve been there now 25 years and while we’re not quite up to $6,000 a share yet, it’s not far. So easy math almost 1,000 times in 25 years, so it’s worked out okay. Yeah, you’re still married, so I think that’s the biggest endorsement that it all worked out. You’ve talked in other interviews about that stroke and how it grounded you through difficult times and to your point, Booking’s had a few of them. You go back through the Dot Com crash — well, I guess Priceline I should start out with, we’ll get to the Booking portion in a moment. The Dot Com crash, obviously there was 9/11 shortly thereafter, not great for travel, there’s the Great Recession, COVID-19, I mentioned the layoffs bit before, Google’s SERP changes. Okay, maybe that one doesn’t quite fit with the other one, so we can get to that one another time. GF: No, it does. But how did that shape you? And balance, clearly you wanted to chase the big thing, you want to take some risks. What benefit did that bring to you in your leadership style? GF: Well, you listed a bunch and there were so many other very trying moments, many of which we’d have to fill up the entire discussion to go through all of them. But the one thing that’s consistent among all these things is, and it’s the idea that if you’ve been through a crisis, you’re better prepared to deal with the next one. Having actually been in the arena in fighting the fight helps you understand that when you’re in the next one, stay calm, understand what your options are, how to play it. Minimize where there’s potential losses, try and see what other avenues can you go down, maintain flexibility. So again, it’s one of those things when things seem to go all to hell to say, especially the most recent, that pandemic, and there were a lot of people in panic. I’m like, “Hey, been there before, let’s not panic”. In fact, we’ve been through that whole COVID thing, the SARS-1 issue back in 2003 and we’d actually seen the effect of that before. So it was like, “Been there, no, it’s okay, we’ll be fine”. Yeah, that’s a great perspective. I mean it’s funny because I was in Taiwan, went to Taiwan in 2003, and so I was aware of that at the time, it had sort of died down at that point, but it’s interesting to tie it back to that. You’d seen major disruption, people scared to travel. I did want to ask about Priceline, the initial model of which was, “name-your-own-price“, how insane was that in retrospect or do you still think it was a good idea? GF: Well, so the idea of coming up with an opaque process, meaning opaque, you don’t really know what you’re buying, but you’re willing to do it to save a lot of money. Right away that’s not a bad thing. Now if we look in economics, the idea of consumer surplus or supplier surplus, and you see what you end up where you have people, consumers, who either are getting a benefit — they’d be willing to pay more for something, but the price is not at that level. The idea was trying to match up, capture what the person was willing to sell it for, is very good when you have a product you’re selling with very, very low marginal costs. Yep, and somebody needs to stay at a hotel, or they’re not going to make anything. GF: Or an airline, it much more was the airline. So that airline seat, the marginal cost of that seat is essentially zero. Right. GF: So if the airline can fill that up with something without impacting its regular distribution channels because you don’t want to have any type of price cannibalization, and the way that it came out wasn’t a bad idea at all. The problem really was is there aren’t a lot of verticals that that really worked for, and people, for whatever reason, they just don’t like the idea as much about putting in a bid with whether you get no chance to back out. If you put that bid in and somebody accepts it, you got to pay that amount and you’re on and there’s no refund. That’s really interesting because I would think that a big problem with that is it’s offloading a lot of burden onto the customer. It feels very weighty. “Did I put the right price?”, “What do I do?”, “Should I be too high?”, “Should I be too low?”, or is that part and parcel of the fact you can’t back out, you’re locked in once you commit? Or are those two different threads? GF: Well, I think there are two things, but I think they go to the same point. Right, it’s too much cognitive weight on the customer. GF: It’s tremendous. And the thing is, human beings are odd. It’s interesting, one of the things that bothers people almost as much as overpaying is not overpaying but paying more — even though they’re comfortable paying it — more than what somebody else got. The sense of fairness, it permeates everything. GF: But it does because when somebody says, “What is being rich?”, being rich is having more money than your brother-in-law. It’s all relative, and that’s one of the issues too. So in the end, the idea of bidding, not great, but the idea of having opaque pricing with some type of trade-offs is still used a lot. We still have those types of things and people are willing to do it and let’s say we see it in many different instances where people are willing to take a trade-off in terms of what the quality of what you’re buying to get a better price. So we’re going to get to AI in a moment, but as long as we’re here, would AI have made that work better by reducing the cognitive load? Or maybe another way to ask this is will AI-driven variable pricing work in the future in a way that makes customers feel good? And not feeling like, “They know who I am and so they’re screwing me”? GF: It’s very interesting to think, “How will the world of the future be if everybody has an agent and the agent is able to instantly be always checking for prices?”. And at the same time, the seller also has an agent that’s always looking at what is the current price and how does that work? As markets get very, very transparent, it’s going to be very interesting. Now the topping of all this though will be regulations because it’s also interesting where again, this idea of fairness, and which is an interesting concept, of regulators coming out and saying, “Well, is that fair or not?”, where you could have two parties, the seller and the buyer, both feel it’s fine and they’re happy. But the regulator says, “That’s not a fair market”, and starts putting in rules. So I can’t predict really what’s going to happen, but I agree with you, it’s going to be very interesting how it plays out. So when you bought Booking in 2005, what was your mindset when you bought the company? And the reason I asked, did you just think you were expanding internationally buying another travel site? Both you and Expedia were being very aggressive at that time, or did you realize you were buying an entirely different business model? I’d love for you to explain to me the difference in how Priceline acquired rooms back then and what Booking did and why that ended up being a big deal? GF: Yeah, it’s a shame we don’t have enough time to really go into all the nitty-gritty. Oh, no, I actually think this part is super, super interesting. So spend as much time as you want. GF: Okay, so we have the name-your-own-price product at Priceline, and I come in and I’m corporate development and we want to expand internationally with name-your-own-price. So we’re doing it throughout the world, different ways we create different structures and one structure was we set up this joint venture type operation in Europe, it’s Priceline Europe. Terrible timing, 9/11, and then you have recession and we pull back, etc. so it’s a very, very small operation now in Europe and we let go a lot of the people and I am now actually in charge of that. And I’m saying, “This is the craziest thing in the world”, because the idea of name-your-own-price to get a flight from London to Paris when you can go on Ryanair and EasyJet and pay five pounds, you’re going to save 50%, so it’s £2.50, really? Who’s going to do that? You end up with Frankfurt. You go London, Frankfurt, Paris, nobody’s going to do that. We got to do stuff the old fashion way, in addition, hotels. So we stopped the flight stuff, that’s ridiculous, but the hotel thing is okay. Name-your-own-price for hotels, but still people like to know the price and they like to know what they’re getting exactly. So I’m looking around, who knows how to sell like that around here? And find a little company called Active Hotels in the UK. Meet up with the people, we end up buying that in 2004, $165 million US dollars with an earn out for the founders who I want to stay on because the real value in anything is the people, it’s not like a coal mine where you’ve got coal underground, this is the people, and so we create a structure that gives them the upside if we’re really successful. So that happens in, when did that happen? 2004, in the summer of 2004, we end up in the fall of 2004, I am introduced to the people at Booking.com who are based in Amsterdam. They have almost the exact same model as Active Hotel, they’re disclosing everything just like you normally would by hotels but both Active and Booking have something slightly different than how the really big player, Expedia back then was the big player, and some of the other ones are. The difference is if you went to Expedia, you put your credit card in and you are essentially being charged right there. Merchant model, it’s called. Expedia is acquiring the room and you’re buying it from Expedia. GF: Well no, they’re not actually. Legally, they don’t actually own the room. In fact, what they have is the money in their bank account. Oh, so they get float along the way. GF: Which they are not planning to pay the hotel until after the person actually stays in the hotel and back then it would’ve been like a month afterwards. Really bad for cash flow for the hotels, really good cash flow for Expedia. Active had a different way of doing it called the agency model, which was, we’ll take the credit card, but that’s only to guarantee that you’ll actually show up. We’re not actually taking the money, the money was not run, the credit card was not run. So essentially, when you showed up at the hotel under Active Hotels, you paid the hotel at the desk with your credit card, or cash, or whatever, then Active sent afterwards an invoice to the hotel to pay the commission on it, totally reverse in the way the cash flow works. Booking had the exact same model as Active Hotel. So the issue was the more business you did, the faster you grew, especially with Booking because they had to pay Google up front in that month, but they weren’t going to get paid for months later, the hotel was going to pay him months later. The faster you grew, the worst your negative cash flow can get worse, worse, worse, worse, worse. So that’s one of the reasons we were able to convince them to join our little band. So Booking came into, and we combined Active and Booking to one company, and we threw in Priceline Europe too. But Booking’s a better name, so we kept it as Booking.com, and that’s the story. But here’s the question, though. You’re able to buy them because they have this problematic cash cycle. GF: And we bought them because they were totally European base, pretty much, Active was mostly the UK, so they could share and we put the inventory together, so now they’re both better off. And look, you spend a lot of time talking about network effects, etc, well here where you really have a great benefit by being able to add a lot more of the inventory to show to a particular traveler. That’s one of the big benefits. For sure, we’re definitely going to get to all that, but I’m very curious about this because from my perspective, the agency model is a critical component of what makes Booking what it is, into the behemoth that it has become. I talk about Aggregation Theory, and one of the things is the scalability aspect, all aspects need to be scalable and with this model, you have more from a hotel perspective, more scalability, more ability to come on, and you don’t need these custom integrations or whatever it might be. To me, that seems essential, so you acquiring the agency model seems super important to me, and it’s really striking to hear actually you talk about the real downsides of it, and the reason why it was a struggle for these companies. GF: Well back then that was certainly one of the ways we were able to grow rapidly was because go to a hotel and say, “Listen, just give us your content, just give us your photos, just tell us the prices, we’ll put it on”. We don’t need to make a business deal, yeah. GF: Yeah, and then if somebody shows up, we’re going to send you an invoice, and please pay us. Now part of the problems in that model for a lot of people who tried that in the past, was the hotels didn’t pay. So in the US for example, the actual collection rate for a travel agency was very bad, hotels would just ignore the commission letter, say, “Who cares about them?”, so that was a critical part too was collections, having a system to be able to collect the commissions. That was critical, and one among many different things that was done at the time that really made it different than a lot of other companies that historically had always done the commission-based agency model. What I’m curious about is did you go in thinking, “Okay, Booking has this, we’re going to change it to our model”? And then was there a point where you realized, “No, actually for all the challenges that this model presents, it’s actually better”. Why is it better? Why did that matter? GF: What’s good is having both models, Priceline was always the merchant model starting out. When we went into Asia, and we have the agency model at Booking.com, I was concerned, “Would it still work there?”, so we also looked at another company, very, very small company called Agoda. And Agoda based in Bangkok, they had the merchant model, and we ended up buying Agoda too, and now we keep them separate brands, separate things. Now, both have agency and merchant in different ways at different places, and the consumer gets to chose and there are many reasons people choose one versus the other. But having more choice is really an important benefit when you’re going to a customer. And I’ll go on, it’s now in terms of the way people pay, it’s incredible. So I think we’re over 40 maybe now, different ways a consumer can pay us, and we take the money and send it to the hotel, which is really important. If you are a consumer in Shanghai, and you’re going to show up at a small little hotel in the South of France, and you want to show up at the desk and use your whatever, Alipay or your WeChat Pay, that French hotel’s going to say, “What are you talking about? Please give me euros”, and that’s not it, but we are in-between it. We will take the Alipay or WeChat Pay, and we will then put euros in the bank account of the French hotel. And by the way, it’ll be a lot cheaper for the French hotel than if they had gotten a credit card from the traveler, because the interchange is much higher than us putting money into their bank account. So the answer to your question is payments is really important it’s the reason why we do a tremendous amount of our business is now done in the merchant model, not the agency model. Interesting. GF: There are a lot of benefits to it. So the agency model got all these folks on board, and then over time once you had that relationship built in, you could circle back to the merchant model. That makes a lot of sense. GF: Right. Exactly. Going back to this buildup aspect, another critical piece of Booking from my perspective is that the hotel market in Europe, particularly 20 years ago, was far more fragmented. You just have a lot more independent hotels as opposed to the US being more chains and things along those lines. This seems to me to cut in multiple dimensions. First to the agency model point, that scalability bit and it being super easy to get linked up seems really important. And second, this really just landed you right in the sweet spot of an aggregator, where consumers see way more hotels than they would anywhere else. And from a hotel, you suddenly are seen by way more customers than anywhere else. This seems obvious now, I guess I’m stating things that seem clear about network effects, but did you realize this when you bought Booking — I’m just really curious, because the Booking acquisition was such a home run. One of the things you did as CEO was change the name, “Okay, we’ve held on to Priceline for too long, we are Booking”, again, it’s not a home run, it’s a grand slam. I’m just curious how much of this did you learn along the way versus, “Oh, this is how it’s going to happen”? GF: No, these are all well understood concepts long before we started buying hotel agencies, like Booking.com. I had studied network theory long before that and I mean the basis of the Internet, or even going either further back, and there’s the famous when you’re in school you learn about, “Well, one telephone has a value of nothing”. Metcalfe’s law, yeah. GF: Of course it is. Right, exactly. You start getting into, “Well what is the value of a network?”, Ii it the square of the number of nodes, or how do you want to figure out the math of what is? But sure, of course that was all well understood and recognized why it would be such a valuable, valuable thing to have. But everybody knew that, and didn’t matter whether we were agency or merchant, everyone has built a network as quickly as possible, as fast as possible. What’s interesting, of course, is why did some of the networks that were out front, they got really good, but then they die out where others continue? We don’t have time to go into that, and theories of why did MySpace die but Facebook lived? Well let’s do it in travel. Why did Booking, why did you pass Expedia? Why did you become the top dog? GF: There are a lot of reasons that go into a question, and here we go into the idea of coming up with the narrative fallacy, which it’s a famous saying. Where we’re going to create a story about why the world is the way it is today, it’s not provable. You’re tapping into what I keep trying to pry around the edges of, because I know the story you tell. There’s a story I look backwards and see, and this is all straightforward, and I’m just so curious about how you actually navigated this story way back then, when it’s, again, it’s really easy to look backwards and everything seems so obvious. GF: Of course, that’s the issue of the narrative fallacy. And I can tell my story, and you have your story, many people have many stories about it, but there’s no way to actually prove out what is true and what is not true. I do know that I have a belief of certain things that are very critical. I also know, and this is really important for anybody who’s in a business with anything in life really, is that so much of the ultimate results are going to be determined by things you have zero control over. I can’t control what our competitors do, I can’t control what governments do in terms of economics, I can’t control issues like natural disasters, and so many things are going to impact your business. In our business, my Lord, things hit us all the time, and the only thing we can do is control ourselves. So try and improve the products, improve the services, so that both sides of our marketplace, our travelers and our partners, both see value in participating at our business, at their free will and that’s very important for us is that look, no hotel in the world has to work with us, they do it because we give them value to do it. And by the way, some hotels don’t. I even stay at hotels that are not on our network, because they don’t want to be on our network, but I want to stay in that hotel. There’s a place in Lake George in upstate New York— That’s a lot of throat-clearing, though. So what is your narrative that you’re going to give my audience? What is the key thing why you surpassed everyone? GF: I won’t do that, and here’s why, because I give it, and then it gives it more weight, and more credence, and more belief that was the truth. There is no truth. The only thing I can say is part of the reason is we worked damn hard, part is we had really smart driven people who wanted to succeed. Part of it is they came up with ways to provide more service, more value to both sides than other players did and being a friendlier partner, being better customer service, really focusing on it, customer centricity, those things were really, really important, but that’s kind of like table stakes for a lot of companies do that. All right, fair enough. I’ll let you off the hook. Tell me about your relationship with Google. I don’t know if it’s still the case, I know for a long time you were the biggest Google ad spender and I believe that really happened around sort of the tail ends of the 2000s, early 2010s, when that really ramped up. Was that driven by Google’s change of the SERP and moving away from ten blue links into their own travel product, and you realized, “Hey, game’s changed, we have to approach this differently”? What was the process there, and how has that evolved? GF: Interesting, so when we were about to buy Booking.com, and we already owned Active Hotels, Active Hotels was very into SEO, all free search, very into that and they also had a lot of affiliates that were really bot farms, they were all farms, and we got a lot of business from them. Booking, on the other hand, and this is another reason we wanted to combine them both, is Booking was really into SEM [Search Engine Marketing], they were paying, and they really became really one of the first players that I’m aware of that did really big A/B testing, really interesting science going into that stuff. Right before we buy Booking, Google does a giant change in the algo, and we drop so much business on all the free clicks, it was like, “Wow, what’s happened?”. That’s when we really tilted more, “Okay, so we just have to keep paying more and more into Google”, and optimizing it so we actually have a good ROI, which we did, and continued to work on that. That was before 2010, that was 2005, 2006, 2007. Then of course, you have the financial crisis, etc., but we still power through that. And that’s it, now I have no idea who the biggest spenders are with Google now, Google does not disclose, we do spend a heck of a lot of money with them, it’s a very good relationship, we’re good partners. We have a similar goal, and that is to get customers to get what they want as soon as they can. I think that your approach to Google, for me, is a big part of the narrative story, and in two respects. Number one, there are other people in this space who got very large on SEO that basically their response to Google’s changes was to whine and whine incessantly for years and years and years and I feel there’s a very sort of pragmatic approach from Booking for years that, to your point, you can’t control what happens around you. You sort of play the hand that you’re dealt, and you dealt that by we’re going to pay. What I’m curious about is, and this is sort of part two, is there an aspect where you’re dealing with Google, the ultimate aggregator, gave you more sympathy for the hotels, and dealing with you and knowing how to deal with them since you’re sort of sitting on top of them in that role? Or was there the opposite where just shit flows downhill sort of as it might be? I’m just curious, you’re in a unique position of clearly being an aggregator, one of the most textbook aggregators ever, and yet also you have to be aggregated by Google, and sort of navigate that, and figure it out. GF: I do talk about this sometimes, it comes up. So we’ll have a hotel here, and let’s say we’re charting a 15% commission, and they’re not thrilled with having to pay 15% to us. Of course, we have to pay a big amount to Google to get the traffic to us, right? And so, you’re right, there is this relationship, and the big overall point is nobody likes to pay for marketing or distribution. Everybody would like all their business to come to them free, direct, loyal, again, and again, and again. People being people, that’s not exactly how the world works, so you do have to pay. Then the next thing is you want to at least make sure that it’s a fair relationship and that’s really critical with our hotel partners, is saying, “Yes we are charging 15%, but we are getting you incremental demand”, and you understand this very well from your points earlier about understanding what’s the incremental cost to that hotel, so a hotel room that goes empty that night, that’s zero revenue, zero profit. However, you fill that up at $100, well what’s the real cost to that? Well, the incremental cost is essentially nothing, you already paid for the mortgage. You’re just fighting over margin. GF: Exactly! So we take 15% out of 100%. It’s actually a very good deal for them, which is why they do it so it’s all fine. With us and Google is if we didn’t think we were getting a good ROI, we wouldn’t be spending it. Come on, it’s not just Google, well, whether it be Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, pick your channel, we are always looking to get the ROI, always looking, “Where can we optimize?”, and that’s one of the benefits we get to our hotelier friends, partners, is the idea is make sure that we are giving them a good ROI, and helping them out. Because if we don’t, they can go to Expedia more, there’s so many different ways they can distribute their rooms, because they want to maximize their bottom line. I mentioned how your position might give you more sympathy for your suppliers in this regard. Now that you’re, I think, are you still the only European company that’s been designated as a gatekeeper by the EU? GF: There are seven companies in the world that have been designated by the EU as gatekeepers. Unbelievably so, six of the seven are American, we’re one of them. We’re an American company, Booking Holdings is incorporated in the US, we are headquartered in the US. Booking.com is a subsidiary of Booking Holdings. Right. GF: The seventh company that’s a gatekeeper that’s not the US, though, maybe it will be very shortly is TikTok. So, there is no European company. Does that give you more sympathy for Google now that you’re feeling some of their pain? (laughing) GF: This is one of the things that I talked to the EU about, I talked to many people about this. I absolutely believe, I absolutely believe that the DMA, the way to set up its gatekeepers is not set up correctly. The idea that we, in one of the most competitive industries in the world, and I had a good headline quote in the Financial Times in London once, I said, “We have to fight for a booking every day”, because it’s true. You’re just one click away from somebody choosing somebody else, it is incredibly competitive. So, the idea to put us in the same bucket as trillion dollar businesses like Google and Amazon? That’s absurd, it’s absolutely absurd. And yet what it does, it creates the costs, and the things we have to deal with that are much more difficult, thereby making it actually, we have a lot of European employees, so it actually makes it more difficult for European employees there, it has to be able to expand, etc. To me it just baffles the mind and I believe somebody said, “Well, you want to talk about reason to stories? My story in this is it’s politics.” Well, all the hotels, to your point, they want all the customers you deliver them, and they don’t want to pay for them. GF: Of course not. They’ve complained about it. GF: Exactly. That’s absolutely right, and I understand that. Listen, that’s part of a free world, if you can lobby better than we can lobby, I guess it’s not good for economics, it’s not good for society, but it’s good for an individual player. I do have a bone of contention to pick with you, and you referenced it earlier. I, like many other professionals my age, was an extremely loyal Starwood member back in the day. It breaks my heart to see how Marriott has diminished those brands after acquiring Starwood in 2016 and the reason I’m blaming you, laying it at your feet, is it seems hotels realize that to avoid the way around you, or the way around aggregation in general is you need these super good loyalty programs and a good way to have that is to have the most hotels. So, I’m asking you, are you the reason why I now get crappy plastic cups, and uncomfortable pillows in Westin’s when that wasn’t the case before? Because you made all these guys consolidate, and try to get out from your fees? GF: So, I’d first like to say that I am also very fond of Marriott at all of their brands. (laughing) Of course you are! GF: And Hilton, and I can go through the entire list… That was on me, Glenn was grimacing the whole time for those that are listening. GF: (laughing) Right, right. Look, here’s the thing I believe that- I’m actually asking you in general about the hotel’s response to getting larger and things like that. GF: It’s not just hotels. Look, everybody’s trying to come up with, “How can I get the customers to be more loyal?”, I mean, American Express just sent out the bill, if I want to have a platinum card, it’s going to cost $895. Meanwhile, Chase Sapphire, they’re being the cheap guys at $795, and I think there’s a Capital One that I know, $495, whatever. Everybody’s playing the loyalty, trying and bring more benefits, and they all show that if you pay this yearly fee, look at all the great benefits you’re going to get for it, it’ll actually pay more. There’s nothing wrong with people coming up with new ways to try, and combine things to create more value and I have nothing against it. By the way, and I’ve been talking with all the big chains about this stuff. We need to have a relationship where I know they feel that if somebody booked with us who is a high status loyalty member, their company is saying, “Gee, is it fair for them to pay us the same amount of money they paid us somebody who’s never visited their hotels before?”, and I do agree with that, and we need to come up with a way that actually, while I’m not sure one will make any more money, or they’ll make any more money, but at least it’ll be a fair, and we used the word fair before, it’s a fair transaction. If we could imagine a model where the commission is different if they’ve put in their loyalty number, or something along those lines. GF: Totally, totally like that. Exactly. And by the way, and while we don’t do this, I mean look, some of these giant chains as big as they are, they don’t market to certain parts of the world. We market to people in Turkistan, or pick a place they don’t and we do things in over 40 languages, we have customer service for over 40 languages, they don’t. So, we are rolling benefits to them, that’s the thing they want is the incremental customer. I put that list of crises earlier. Was Airbnb a crisis when it came along, or do you feel like in the end they just actually expanded the market, more places to stay, more types of trips, whatever it might be? Or was it actually — what was your process of facing this orthogonal competitor? You still talked on your last earnings call about alternative bookings, is it still a real center of focus for you? GF: So, alternative accommodations in the last call, we talked about it over, I think it was 37% of our total room nights. Now when you add up what that number means, that’s almost a little under almost three quarters of the total number of room nights that Airbnb did, and we’ve outgrown them, 16 of the last 17 quarters we’ve grown faster. So, I’d say it’s a pretty big deal for us and it has been for some time. So one of those things that seemed like a crisis, and has actually turned out to be a huge opportunity. GF: It never was a crisis, it was just another area where we need to build, and we didn’t have the right processes, we didn’t have the right platform, we weren’t necessarily doing things as well as we could have. And by the way, I said this in my last call, I said, there’s still a lot of things we can improve in that product for our customers and our hosts in a way that they will prefer to use us more and that’s something which is good. That actually means there’s actually a lot of upside left for us, and I believe that, I really believe that. Is your key advantage just the fact that if I’m searching, if I search on Airbnb, it’s only Airbnbs. If I search on Expedia, I can see both then compare, or is there more that goes into it? GF: Well, I’d say that’s a big one right from the beginning and I’ve said this so many times that one of our advantages was that I did notice that [Airbnb CEO] Brian [Chesky] recently was talking about how they’re going to be in a lot more hotels. I’ve been saying that for years. Airbnb, I mean obviously it was a great idea, could create an entirely new market. There’s a lot of strategic decisions they’ve made in the last X number of years that I don’t completely get. GF: Well, so, I imagine that we will be seeing more of that competition coming from that area. But look, it’s all good. I like competition, it helps us all do a better job for both sides of the marketplace. So, something you’ve championed for a long time, well before AI, is this idea of delivering a Connected Trip, you bought OpenTable, and you’ve bought lots of other companies along the way. What is that? Explain, give me the high level thesis. How have you approached it? This feels a little like, “Let’s put ourselves in a pre-AI mind”, because I’m going to ask you how AI changes that. I’ll give you a preview of the next question. Is this a bit where it sounds good in theory, but it’s not actually the way customers operate? GF: So, a couple ways to approach this. One way I always like to explain it is when I was younger, much, much younger, and my family would set up a trip somewhere. There is a thing called a travel agent that was a human being, many times was a woman, and she knew a lot about our family, and what we liked, and how much we could afford and she’d come up with some ideas, and my parents would have conversation with her, and such, and then she’d come up with a couple things, and we’d buy it, and we had everything, all the things we needed, the flights, how to get to the airport, the hotels, what to do there, all that stuff, and we give her one check, my mother would write a check to her and be done. God forbid anything went wrong, we just called her, and she would fix it all. Magically it would all get fixed, it’ll all be fine. Now technology should be able to recreate that only much, much better, because the database doesn’t forget like I imagine the travel agent human probably did occasionally. Well, that, and it’s much more accessible. GF: It’s 24/7, 24/7, and in addition, which is really good, it has an ability to know so much more about what’s happening at the exact time, or in the future. So, for example, the human travel agent never would’ve been able to, when the plane is delayed by four hours to send out a text, and say, “Excuse me, Mr. Fogel, your plane right now will be late by four hours, but we have a different flight for you, would you like to change it? In addition now because you’re going to still arrive two hours late to your destination, we’ve already rearranged the car service for you, and in addition, so you’ll no longer make your dinner reservation, we’ve already tried to move that to a different time, but that restaurant doesn’t have availability at that later time, however, we have looked at three other restaurants that are in the near vicinity. Would you like to choose one of those instead, which has availability, and we’ll notify your partner so that person knows we’ll be there.” What I want is I want to have a third spouse in our, my wife, and relationship who does all of this for us. Only it’s not going to be human, it will be done digitally. Right. This all sounds amazing. But you launched the Connected Trip idea a long time ago, and in retrospect, particularly when you look at AI, and how AI can potentially do this, were you just way too early, and this sounds good in theory, but actually there’s so many difficulties in pulling this off? Where actually we just have a holding company of a bunch of different companies that in theory work together, but it’s not a doable project? GF: I do not disagree with you on your point that it’s taking a long time. Agree totally, but you have to think where we came from, all we had were hotels. We didn’t have a flight business at all, we really started that 2019, just started it. So, five years later, let’s round off, call it five years later, we now sell more airline tickets than any other third party distributor in the world except for China, a little different, so we’ll do it ex China. That’s amazing in just five years to do that. In addition, the increase our Attractions now, we had no attraction business at all, now we doubled the last quarter, we doubled the number of Attractions. Our car rental business continued to grow. Rides, instead of renting a car, you just get a ride service from the airport, or to the airport, insurance, so many things. We had to build all these different verticals, and now having done that now, bringing it together, using science, using data, analyzing it, making sure we are putting up the right offers at the right time with the right value to the right person so they get the best experience they can. And God forbid anything goes wrong, we as the person who actually has put it all together, with the relationship with everyone, we can fix it. Now that’s for the traveler. On the partner side, the supplier side, we’re giving incredible number of different opportunities for them to provide, get incremental demand by providing different values, different things. We have a thing called our Genius program where primarily the supplier fund discounts, because we’re giving it to certain customers who pay more, who are willing to do it more often, so we give more value to our supplier partners. Combining those two things, using again all the data analytics, it’s going to be wonderful. Now you’re right with generative AI, it may be easier to do all this stuff, don’t disagree with that. Your point, it’s hard is very correct, which is good, because if it was easy, there’d be a lot more people doing it. What’s more important? Is it the demand side, or the supplier side? And I know the answer is both. They’re both really important, or does it matter in different stages of the evolution of your company? For example, I thought it was really interesting, you made the point that agency model was important to get that demand, but over time, merchant actually lets you deliver a better experience for both sides, and so you’ve seen some transition there. Is that the case different when you’re building a network effect, which one comes first if you want to add on a connected experience? GF: I think the problem is when you’re overweight one side of that type of equation, you end up with real big problems and whether, I know you did a recent, it was very interesting interview with [Uber CEO] Dara [Khosrowshahi], shout out for the interview you do with Dara because I thought it was fascinating, but it’s very similar network effect. If you have too many drivers, you’ve got a problem. If you don’t have enough drivers, and a lot more people want rides, you’ve got a problem. Same thing for us. If we have too much demand, and there is no supply, we’ve got a problem, the customer’s unhappy. Similar the other way, if a supplier puts out a line, they’re not getting any business, they get tired, and they stop working with you. Right. It’s like, “What’s the point of paying this 15%? I thought that I was supposed to be getting lots of customers”. GF: Well, no, don’t forget about they only pay the 15% if they get the demand. That’s a very important point to make out, which I continue to make to anyone who is interested in the issue of what value do we provide, I say, “Look at what we do here, we’ll take all the inventory, we’ll take the content, we’ll take the photos, we’ll give suggestions how to do things better, we will translate it into forty-something different languages, we’ll go out, and get demand, and we’ll make sure that your property is shown to the right customers. We do all of that, and I’m not going to charge you a thing, it’s free, absolutely free. The only thing I ask is if, if you get a customer who stays in your hotel, would you please pay us a fair commission?” That’s it, it’s a great deal. It’s a great deal for everybody, and for everybody who comes out, and says, “Oh, well they have too much power, or whatever”, people come out and say — I say, “What are you talking about? You don’t like it? Don’t join!”. Something Booking is hailed for, we were talking about this before in your story. I appreciate that I don’t want to land a specific narrative, it is what it is, we work hard, all those bits and pieces, just between you and I, however, is the actual answer to Booking’s durability, is it really just a network effect thing? This ties into what’s more important, demand or supply? The answer is both, they’re both important and you have both. Are network effects still underrated in terms of how you survive through paradigms? How do you avoid disruption? And the answer is if you have a network effect, you have the time and space to figure it out, and that’s okay because to your point, you’re motivated and you have the business model where both sides benefit. But do we still underrate these concepts you’ve been studying for so long? GF: I go the other way. I’d say that the network effect is overrated. Interesting. GF: Terribly overrated. Well, tell me why. GF: And a lot of antitrust people think that, and you can go back to the A&P cases way back, I don’t know how long, 50 years ago, 60 years ago, probably more actually maybe 70 years ago. The fact is that there are lots of very similar networks out there. You mentioned Bonvoy and Marriott, huge network effects there. Tremendous. All the airlines, tremendous. All our competitors, similar. Trip.com, they actually do more total travel value than we do probably. I tell you this idea that there’s some sort of lock-in effect, which is really what people start talking when they start networks, they start going to this idea of some sort of lock-in, there is no lock-in and I have the proof of so many of our customers do not spend a lot of their travel budget with us entirely. They use lots of different ways throughout the year, they’ll use us for some other times. They’ll go direct to the hotel, sometimes they’ll go to a tour operator, there’s so many different things. The data proves really that at least in travel, I won’t try and go beyond my expertise, in travel, the network effects are very low. There is incredible competition and those that say otherwise are ignoring the facts and the data and the science. I’m going to disagree with you slightly, but not completely, in that my contention is that the network effects enjoyed by your service, the aggregators, is because by definition you’re delivering value. To your point, hotels get free marketing until they actually make money and then you’re taking a commission on that. It’s not like they’re paying to get on there because you’re not the only way to reach customers, you have to earn it, quite literally. You have to actually deliver a booking. GF: Yeah, exactly. In fact, here’s the thing. Do you know in terms of Europe, our biggest market, we only have a single teens percentage of the market of hotels? That means 85% or roughly somewhere in that neighborhood of hotels that are being booked are not going through us. So anybody come up and say, “You have a 15% share, but you’re a dominant player”, is that not one of the craziest things you’ve ever heard? I mean, don’t get me started on European craziness, but I think the reason I’m pushing on this is network effects are a good thing. Being able to find any hotel in one place is convenient and it’s great. Being able to acquire more customers is convenient and great. GF: I agree. So that’s why I push back, I think there is network effects. GF: No, I agree. I’m saying not as big. So we’re just sort of arguing semantics. It’s not railroads, it’s not cables, that’s the problem. GF: I agree, totally. I’m saying it’s not as powerful as some people think it is. It definitely is, there’s value definitely, it’s just to my thing and there are a lot of others who have the exact same type of network. Where is Booking, when you look forward 5 to 10 years, is it still the arc we’re following? It’s this Connected Trip, we can tell, to your point, I think the problem with a lot of these Connected Trips ideas, particularly before, is it’s a good narrative. It sounds great, I’m going to have the travel agent deliver it and the number of edge cases and complexity in the real world is just so large, it’s never been doable. But is this a bit where actually, that’s probably right, but all that investment was worth it because suddenly it is doable. Did I just summarize what’s the next decade for you? GF: Well, I think you did. I mean our goal is to get that Connected Trip really in a way that a lot of people really see the values. I’m going to go to Booking because I get a lot more value through the Connected Trip and we’re seeing a little, like we did announce in our earnings call, how the growth of people who are buying more than one vertical in a trip has gone up. I believe it was over 30% is what we said a couple months ago. I just read it about an hour ago, so I remember that. GF: Okay, good, so my memory isn’t gone. If you notice, it broke into the double-digit percentage of our total amount of transactions, so it’s showing it is growing, but we are still so early. I believe this is one of these things where you do hit a phase transition, you build up the verticals, you start going, but then at some point, instead of it going linearly, you get exponential growth as people really catch on. This really is much better. Is this going to have to be a product-led growth strategy? Can you SEM yourself into this or is that you almost have to build a new muscle in that regard? GF: I think the marketing of it will be important to help get people aware of it, but I don’t want to put on a firehose of marketing until it’s really good. That makes sense. This is the other interesting point where you can have sympathy for hotels, you have your own loyalty program, you want people opening Booking first thing instead of going through Google to get there and you mentioned the Genius program and how your suppliers will help fund that because you’re consistently delivering more people. Is that a big focus going forward? Do you feel good about that? Is that going to be critical to getting the Connected Trip working? GF: What I really want to be able to do is help our partners do better, I want them to make more money than they would otherwise, I want them to have happier customers than they would otherwise. One of the ways that we’ll be able to do that is by providing them incremental demand right away. That’s great and all that, and I understand where somebody say, “I wish I didn’t have to pay a commission for that customer”, but I want to help make sure they understand that they wouldn’t have gotten that person. But there’s more. We know technology is now coming forward so rapidly, so many of these hotels, they don’t have IT departments, they don’t understand, they don’t know how to deal with this. We will do it for them for free. Again, all the things we do for them, and believe me, this is not dissimilar when you go back to the mid to late ’90s when hotels didn’t have websites, they didn’t know what to do or how to do this or whatever, somebody did it for them. Well that’s kind of now in this new world with all this new technology, we were able to provide the service to them again in a way that they will be better off, their bottom line’s improved. Do you think there’s a shift where you keep talking about, “You’re really valuable, people shouldn’t be mad at us, we’re providing incremental revenue to assets that are already there”, but there’s one thing that I think is interesting about the ultimate aggregators is in some respects they create their own supply and maybe this is where Airbnb was really interesting and got there first, and you’ve done a very good job catching up to them, but creating their own supply of rooms that only exist because Airbnb. I talk about Facebook creating an entire universe of e-commerce retailers that basically exists because of Facebook, that gives them real durability. What market can you create as opposed to servicing hotels that exist and we’re going to give you incremental revenue there or has that already happened? GF: I think you’re right. In both examples you gave, they did create new blue ocean markets that did not exist previously and more power to them for having done that. We, as you point out, we are basically making a markets more efficient, providing more value to people who are already into the marketplace. So for us to create a new market, we’d have to be going on to something that is not currently being done. Now, if we have such a thing, I would not be disclosing it right now. Right, fair enough. But it’s fair to say, and if you were to even do the Connected Trip, but most of the stuff, you’re not talking about Airbnb, Airbnb is still like, “We’re going to create experiences X, Y, Z”, you’re like, “No, you can get your car and then get your hotel and get your restaurant, that’s what Booking does, it makes it more efficient”. GF: And very important. But services, what we call Attractions, are very important because nobody goes on a trip to hang out in the hotel room, you go to do stuff. So whether it be the scuba trip, the snorkeling, the museum, the theater, whatever it is, we want to be able to provide that to them too. One of the examples of the Connected Trip, I always give an example that I love, which is you go to Amsterdam, the two things most people want to do, they want to take a canal boat ride in Amsterdam and they want to go to the Rijksmuseum because it’s very famous museum, great things. Now the thing is though, we want to be able to provide, which we can now, we provide it to both tickets for both things. Imagine you have booked the Thursday for the boat trip and the Friday for the museum. On Tuesday, however, we notice, we obviously see what the weather is and we come back say, “You know something, the rain is coming for your boat ride day and it’s going to be sunny the other day, so why don’t we switch them around for you and we can do it all. Would you like that? Press yes.” And we will do it all for you, that kind of convenience and that looking forward to provide what could be a problem beforehand, that’s real value. Those are the type of things absolutely a part of the Connected Trip. Is that another advantage of Booking in particular’s European roots? It always strikes me, all these European sites have their own technology stack from like 25 years ago, whereas U.S. is just like, “Yeah, that’s fine, we don’t want to do that, we’ll jump on sort of something else”. Is that a real opportunity to go in and provide a brand new technology stack for all these experiences telling them this is the advantage you’ll get? GF: So we have a company that’s the leader in the space, FareHarbor, which we own, which works for us and provides the backend ticketing and reservations for a lot of small and medium-sized Attraction players. We are the biggest player in the world in that, so that is our stack that we do provide, free again, to things and think of it as like OpenTable, which we also have only, FareHarbor’s for attractions, OpenTable for restaurants, etc. But you’re right, there are a lot of different backend systems, but the wonderful world of APIs, you can tie to anybody. Got it. Well, I could talk about Booking forever. Like I said, it’s such a textbook example and it’s so interesting that it’s on both sides of this equation, but did we get what you wanted to cover? GF: Yeah, it has been really fun, really interesting. I mean, it’s fascinating. As you’ve done in many of your interviews, you just scratch the surface because there’s so many interesting things in the topics that you cover, but this certainly is one, and today with Gen AI coming down the pike for all of us, how will the world change? It’s going to be a very interesting thing Google — are they going to be your most important channel forever? GF: Who knows, right? Who knows about that? And I would even more so are the big societal issues and these are the issues not so much about how we do our business, but how do all of us do our business and what are the impacts going to be in terms of employment, in terms of jobs? These are interesting things that I wish our government friends would spend a lot more time on that as opposed trying to guess what’s happening in small vertical areas. Do you think you might see a fork in the road where you want to deliver this experience in Booking and be that destination and tie it all together, but actually the ChatGPT’s of the world might actually be where all trip planning happens and you’re just going to have to, like you did with Google back in the day, accept that and be the best at that? GF: It’s certainly a possibility, we’ll see how it plays out. We are currently and have announced many relationships, many deals with many of the players in the space, and there’ll be many more in the future. Look, there are going to be people I absolutely know are going to go to a large language model provider and want to start their trip planning discovery there and I’m going to lament and say, “Why did they start with us first?”, it’ll be just like hotel, “Why didn’t they come direct?”, it’ll be the same thing, but I like to believe that we will create things that are so great the same way we have over 60% of our customers currently come to us direct. When you X out the B2B business, you go just the B2C business, over 60%, it’s mid-60s actually come to us direct. They’re not going to Google first, they’re not going to anybody. I would like that to actually be even a higher number down the road and they’re coming at the very beginning of their discovery area. But if they don’t, you’ll figure it out and be there. GF: If they don’t, we catch them later in the funnel and we’re still able to be able to get paid well, it’s all good. Glenn Fogel, thanks for coming on. GF: Thank you very much for having me.

Title: Opendoor Hits Pause After Massive Rally—Here’s Why

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Opendoor Technologies (NASDAQ: OPEN) has experienced an exhilarating journey this year. The stock has skyrocketed by 345% year-to-date, only to fall by 21% over the past week, serving as a strong reminder to investors that growth stocks seldom move in a linear fashion. Opendoor’s significant surge is indicative of robust growth in its key iBuying sector. In 2024, the company handled over $12 billion in home transactions, a rise from roughly $7 billion in 2023, as it ventured into new markets and enhanced its pricing algorithms. Revenue has consistently increased, anticipating an estimated $4.05 billion in 2025, while operational advancements have modestly decreased average holding times for homes, from 45 days in 2023 to around 38 days in 2024. If you are looking for an upside with reduced volatility compared to holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. This portfolio has notably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—achieving returns of over 91% since its inception. Additionally, see – Can Uber Stock Grow $2x? The 21% decline last week seems primarily linked to profit-taking following the substantial year-to-date gains, along with immediate concerns regarding the overall housing market. Increasing mortgage rates and affordability challenges could temporarily reduce transaction volumes, causing investors to pause and reevaluate. Despite the recent downturn, Opendoor continues to be a key player in the tech-oriented real estate sector. The company is still operating at a loss—projected to be about $234 million in 2025—but is progressively enhancing its unit economics. Its combination of technology, market expansion, and transaction volume positions it for potential profitable scaling as housing market conditions normalize. The recent decline could represent a purchasing opportunity for long-term investors who believe in Opendoor’s business model. Its revenue growth, enhanced operational efficiency, and market share increases indicate that while volatility may persist, the long-term narrative of digitizing the home-buying process remains strong. In summary, Opendoor is a stock suited for those willing to navigate the ups and downs, supported by genuine growth metrics rather than mere hype. Investors must be ready for considerable volatility and the possibility of significant losses if market conditions worsen or if the company does not successfully implement its ambitious growth objectives. Although the 2x upside potential appears mathematically plausible based on forecasted revenues, it necessitates impeccable execution in a rapidly changing and competitive market landscape. Now, we apply a risk assessment framework while constructing the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which, consisting of 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last four years. Why is that?Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded superior returns with decreased risk compared to the benchmark index; providing less of a roller-coaster experience as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Can XRP extend its recovery after Ripple-BlackRock partnership?

XRP defended $2.7 support, but a bearish pattern could derail the recovery Fund holders of BlackRock’s BUIDL can redeem the shares to RLUSD for fast and efficient on-chain liquidity. The update did not stir XRP as the altcoin under the whims of the broader market sentiment. Ripple [XRP] has announced off-ramp support for BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, allowing fund holders to swap 1:1 with its stablecoin RLUSD. A similar feature will be enabled for VanEck’s tokenized product, VBILL, in the coming days. According to Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, the move was a ‘real utility’ for users to have on-chain liquidity on the go. He added that the swap feature will be available on Ethereum [ETH] but will be expanded into the XRPL ecosystem. Source: X The off-ramping will be achieved through a partnership with Securitize, the real-world asset tokenization powering the VBILL and BUILD products. Conventionally, the off-ramping for these two tokenized treasury funds involves off-chain through bank transfers or equivalent cash via Securitize. This could take more time for settlement, hence the on-chain exit like RLUSD can be more efficient. But RLUSD isn’t the first one to offer this feature. Circle made the first move in April 2024, allowing BlackRock’s BUIDL fund holders to cash out via USDC. As of writing, RLUSD had a market cap of $742 million, with an 8% growth in the past month. Circle’s USDC, on the other hand, had a $73.6B market size and ranked second only to Tether’s USDT. Source: DeFiLlama Some notable rival stablecoins that posted double-digit growth over the same period were Ethena’s [ENA] USDe and PayPal’s PYUSD. For Ethena, its high yield has been a key selling point, while PYUSD has scored several partnerships on top of its 4% yield rate. However, RLUSD was launched last December, so the current pace of growth was commendable too. In fact, its aggressive expansion towards institutional clients could fuel its growth. For Jack McDonald, SVP of stablecoins at Ripple, the latest partnership will be a ‘natural step’ to bridge traditional finance and crypto. For his part, Carlos Domingo, CEO of Securitize, said the integration will help ‘automate liquidity for tokenized assets.’ That said, XRP, like the rest of the market, was barely holding itself together after the recent liquidation cascade. It was down about 10% from its September high of $3.2 but defended the H2 support at $2.7, raising recovery hopes. But price action formed a bearish descending triangle pattern, which could drag it lower if validated.

Title: AIL season preview: Clontarf looking strong but back-to-back titles a tall ask
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/09/25/ail-season-preview-clontarf-looking-strong-but-back-to-back-titles-a-tall-ask/

Rarely has a new All-Ireland League campaign been so generously sprinkled with stardust. Most notably, of course, Carlos Spencer has pitched up as the new head coach at Terenure College, but it doesn’t stop there. There are also strong rumours of Cian Healy and Keith Earls making prodigal returns for Clontarf in 1A and Thomond in 2C, and there’s been a wide influx from the Ireland Sevens squad, the schools and abroad to augment the presence of provincial academy players. Nenagh Ormond also provide some novelty value as the first club from Tipperary to play in the top-flight while there’s also been plenty of player movement during the summer. Jordan Coghlan has made a return home to Clontarf, with his relocation to Malahide outbidding even the pull of his Terenure friends and King Carlos. The champions have also acquired a host of talent from UCD, including Ireland under-20s lock Alan Spicer, while backrower Richie Whelan has returned from his stint in La Rochelle and Angus Lloyd is back again. After last season’s trophy-laden season, and despite losing John Vinson to Australia, ‘Tarf look strong once more, although no team has retained the title since Shannon in 2006. Cork Constitution were the latest to come up just short, and last season’s beaten finalists have lost two of the star turns in their 2024 success (outhalf James Taylor and winger Matthew Bowen) to Australia, as well as John Forde and Daniel Hurley to Blackrock. But they have again recruited well from UCC, while another of that title-winning side, Rob Hedderman, and Munster academy outhalf Dylan Hicks, have both rejoined. And Con are, well, Con. St Mary’s, who host Clontarf on opening day, were the first newly promoted side to make the playoffs and have retained all their key men, while UCD/Leinster academy prop Andrew Sparrow and former Ireland under-20 prop Oisín Michel look like good signings. After their Bateman Cup win, Lansdowne were the form team in the second half of the season. Along with Coghlan, their acquisition of Bobby Sheehan looks like one of the signings of the summer. Ditto former Connacht centre Tom Daly, the ex-UCD captain James Tarrant and Leinster academy scrumhalf Tadhg Brophy from Naas. Inspired by Marks, newly installed as captain, they beat Clontarf in a full-on Leinster Senior Cup semi-final and host Con for their opener. But last season’s top four will be hounded by the chasing pack. Ahead of welcoming Young Munster on opening day, Ballynahinch, fifth in three seasons running, had a low-key summer featuring a June trip to Boston. Aaron Sexton has returned from his NFL sortie, and they’ve signed the captain of Wallace High School’s historic Ulster Senior Cup breakthrough, John Rodgers, and his outhalf team-mate Quinn Armstrong, albeit influential centre George Pringle has moved to Australia. Despite losing Coghlan, Harrison Brewer is back in Terenure from Japan, as is Conall Boomer from the MSL. Despite earning a senior contract at Connacht, John Devine has joined, as has scrumhalf Griffin Culver from Manawatu, lock Sean Rigney, and 22-year-old Argentinian outhalf Julian Leszczynski. Terenure beat St Mary’s and Lansdowne to win the Leinster Senior Cup, thanks to a hat-trick by under-20 winger Dan Martin and an eye-catching debut by Ben Blaney (last season’s captain in the school’s run to the final) in Spencer’s first official game at the helm. They start with three away games as their refurbished clubhouse won’t be open for business until the second half of the season and there’s a new gym coming on board. They ought not to be dull. Limerick club rugby is struggling, witness Garryowen and Shannon propping up on the top two flights, yet Young Munster defy this trend and could well be dark horses again despite losing Rigney and Leszczynski. As usual, they’ve cast their net far and wide. The 28-year-old former PBC, UCC and Cork Con scrumhalf John Poland has returned from the New England Free Jacks, Connacht duo Harry West and Orin Burke have joined, and so too has a 20-year-old Kiwi lock AJ Henson, on the recommendation of Lifeimi Mafi. “I’m very happy with what we’ve brought in,” says head coach Ger Slattery. “Hopefully we can gel them into a team to give us a successful season.” UCD head coach Emmet McMahon is sufficiently buoyed by the talent coming through and some shrewd acquisitions to target a quicker start than last season, avoiding the playoffs on the last day by a point. Old Belvedere, runaway 1B champions, have recruited heavily and in acquiring Hugh Hogan as head coach, the Irish women’s loss is surely their gain. After their dramatic playoff final win over UCC, Nenagh Ormond will bring boundless enthusiasm and several returning sons to supplement a home-grown core. Former Cresent Comprehensive and Munsters’ outhalf Oscar Davey returns from the USA to offset Ben Pope’s return to New Zealand. The 41-year-old player-coach Derek Corcoran will occasionally don his boots, and they’ve enjoyed a Donnacha Ryan-arranged preseason in La Rochelle. Nenagh’s first game in the top-flight at home to Old Belvedere on Saturday (kick-off 4pm) will be streamed live on IrishRugby+.

Outs: Ben Pope (returned home to NZ). Of the relegated duo, City of Armagh looked better equipped to bounce back than Garryowen on the basis of last season’s points tallies. Yet Garryowen were well beaten by Clogher Valley and Instonians in the Ulster Senior Cup. But City of Armagh have had a poor Ulster Senior Cup campaign, losing heavily to Instonians and Clogher Valley. By contrast, although relegation was compounded by departures, Garryowen’s Munster academy players have been swelled by the signing of Crescent and Irish schools fullback Fionn Rowsome. And after finishing last season strongly, Mike Sherry’s sky blues have had promising Munster Senior Cup wins away to Old Crescent and UCC. Having missed out in last season’s playoff semi-finals to Nenagh, Blackrock are strongly expected to mount another big promotion push under James Blaney. They’ve signed a couple of Leinster academy players in the powerful young Roscrea centre Jack Deegan and hooker Lee Fitzpatrick from Newbridge, as well as Connacht hooker Eoin de Buitléar. In Tomás O’Leary’s second season, UCC look less equipped after their late drive to last season’s promotion final having lost a few players to Con. Local rivals Highfield only just avoided a relegation playoff last season but good Munster Senior Cup wins over Cashel and Young Munster augur well. Morgan Lennon’s Old Wesley have been consistent contenders in recent seasons, although Reuben Pimm has moved to the Netherlands and they’ve lost Dan Campbell and Cronan Gleeson to UCD and Nenagh respectively. As was the case last season, Queens look like they’ll be heavily dependent on the availability of their sizeable Ulster academy contingent. As ever, Johne Murphy’s Naas will play some of the division’s best rugby, with Charlie Sheridan in midfield, although Leinster academy scrumhalf Tadhg Brophy has moved to Lansdowne. With James Cronin at the helm as player-coach, Highfield’s powerful maul and Ireland Sevens outside back Nicky Greene have shown up well in preseason and they could also be in the mix. Trinity, after Matty Lynch’s last-day dramatics against Cashel averted a second successive relegation, should be a year older and wiser after keeping their team largely intact, starting their campaign at home to Blackrock. Centre John O’Sullivan has joined from the ‘Rock’s Schools Cup-winning side, as has his team-mate Russian lock Artur Smykovskiy. Ambitious Instonians, with the Whitten brothers still in situ and Craig Gilroy a summer signing, will be seeking a fifth promotion in succession. Following a second successive relegation, nine-time champions Shannon have installed former captain Lee Nicholas as Director of Rugby to plot a return to the second tier, and the preseason form (featuring a 27-22 win away to Bruff) has been encouraging. Cashel will be itching to do likewise after their late mugging in the promotion final, although they look a little undercooked after a 32-12 loss in the Munster Cup at home to Highfield. The youthful, entertaining Corinthians set the early 2A pace last season but Connacht demands and midwinter triggered a fall-off and they missed out on the playoffs on points difference. Jim Harding has departed as head coach, and ex-Ireland under-20 centre John Devine has moved to Terenure. However, former Connacht and Terenure centre Colm de Buitléar has moved in the opposite direction, and under new coach Ambrose Conboy they’ve beaten Buccaneers (38-11), Galwegians (27-19) and Sligo (24-19) to win the club’s first Connacht Senior League crown since 1995. There’s a trio of Ulster sides in Banbridge, Ballymena and Dungannon (promoted via the playoffs). With Rob Lyttle in their ranks, Banbridge look the pick of the three. MU Barnhall beat Greystones, as they did in the playoff semi-finals last season, in the Leinster League final a fortnight ago to lay down a marker as both look like contenders again. Old Crescent will need to improve significantly as they were well off the pace last season, while newly promoted Wanderers, who had a poor Leinster League campaign, have enrolled Sean Skehan on a consultancy basis. On foot of the recent AIL survey, the main recommendation the IRFU has adopted is something they had wanted to do – regionalise Divisions 2B and 2C, in large part to save on travel expenses. This will not be popular with some clubs, who will understandably feel that the regionalisation of the lower two divisions will detract from the appeal of their campaigns and make them glorified junior clubs. This being the 11th season of the current format of five divisions of 10 teams apiece, it is also yet another redrawing of the AIL map. Depending on the make-up of the regions, it could also remove much of the jeopardy this season. After their relegations last season, Buccaneers (who have lost 33 of their last 36 AIL matches to suffer successive demotions) and Navan (who lost to Trinity and Greystones in the Leinster League) have had difficult starts to their campaign. So opportunity could knock again for Clogher Valley, who were denied a potential third successive promotion by their 23-22 semi-final playoff defeat to Dungannon but had good wins over Ballymena and City of Armagh in the Ulster Senior Cup before losing to Instonians. Nine of Galwegians’ 10 defeats last season were by a single score before they lost away to Navan in a playoff semi-final. With Stephen Mannion pulling the strings, Niyi Adeolokun has joined Brendan Guilfoyle’s ticket as attack coach. After encouraging Connacht League wins over Sligo and Buccs, they should be in the mix for promotion again and so avoid the IRFU’s expanded trapdoor. Ditto for Rainey Old Boys and UL Bohemians, while Malone’s early season form looks on a par with the former. After last season’s narrow escape, Sligo have hired former Connacht coach Grant Ross as their new Director of Rugby and have brought in four new forwards in Evan Ballantyne, Pat Lynch, Max O’Hehir, and Argentinian number eight Facundo Dellamea. Under New Zelander Ross their Connacht League form improved, beating Buccs and pushing Corinthians. Skerries, who survived via the playoffs, lost to MU Barnhall and Naas in the Leinster Senior league, but did have an encouraging win over Wanderers, whereas newly promoted Enniscorthy cancelled two of their Leinster League games and lost to Trinity in the other. After a seven-year absence and many near misses Bective Rangers are back in the senior ranks after a thrilling 39-34 win over Thomond in the playoff final augmented their first All-Ireland Junior Cup success. They’ve added to that momentum by beating Malahide, relegated to 2C from 2B, and Monkstown to claim the Leinster Shield and, as others have done upon emerging from the junior ranks, could even push for promotion. Thomond should also hold their own after their victory away to Omagh Academicals in the promotion/relegation playoff final ended their six-year absence from the AIL. They join fellow Limerick club Bruff, who gave Shannon a run for their money in the Munster Cup. Dolphin (who were a 1A club 11 years ago) were well beaten by Con in the Cup. They and Ballyclare lost in the playoffs last season, and the latter look likelier contenders than Belfast Harlequins, a 1A club 12 seasons ago, or Clonmel, beaten 60-0 by Young Munster in the Munster Cup.

Title: How a Billion Dollar Buy of Tesla Stock Set up a Trillion Dollar Vote

On September 15, 2025, Elon Musk filed a disclosure with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) indicating that he had acquired approximately 2.57 million shares of Tesla Inc. in open-market transactions on September 12, at a cost of nearly $1 billion. This represented his first meaningful open-market purchase of Tesla stock since 2020. Most of his holdings had come through exercising options granted under earlier compensation arrangements. According to the filing, the purchase prices averaged just under $390 per share. The market responded swiftly: Tesla’s stock surged to an intraday high of $425.70 before closing at $410.04. For a company with a market capitalization of roughly $1.4 trillion, such a reaction, amounting to more than a 5 percent move, was remarkable. Almost all major news outlets interpreted Musk’s purchase as a signal of renewed confidence in Tesla and, perhaps more importantly, of his willingness to devote more time and energy to the company amid his many competing ventures. That confidence proved contagious: Investors embraced the signal by imputing to the company nearly $70 billion of additional market value on the basis of the CEO’s $1 billion outlay. What the purchase does for Musk himself, however, runs deeper. First, there was a fortuitous coincidence: September 15, 2025, the date Musk’s purchase was disclosed, was also the record date for Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting scheduled for November 6. In practice, this means that all share acquisitions settling on or before September 15 are eligible to vote at the meeting. Purchases made on Friday, September 12, settled just in time under the new T+1 rule (excluding weekends) to be included on the record date. CEOs are generally predisposed to selling shares in their own companies, as they receive a ton through compensation, both to meet personal consumption needs and to diversify their portfolios. However, our prior research paper[1]discovered that when a contested voting event, such as a proxy contest, is on the horizon, CEOs slow their selling and may even accumulate additional shares to strengthen their voting and control power. In separate research, one of us documented record-date vote-buying by investors when controversial issues are on the meeting agenda.[2] This pattern maps exactly onto Musk’s behavior: He had been a consistent seller of Tesla stock in recent years, including liquidating tens of billions of dollars’ worth to finance ventures such as the acquisition of Twitter (now X), but in 2025 he made no sales, and, on the deadline for the record date, he executed a sizable purchase. So, what will be voted upon in the November shareholder meeting? At the center of the agenda is the proposed $1 trillion notional-amount compensation package for Elon Musk, a performance-based award of historic scale in corporate America. While the headline figure of $1 trillion has captured public attention, the actual realizable value will depend on whether an array of milestones are met, including market capitalization in multi-trillion-dollar increments, breakthroughs in full self-driving and robotics, and sustained profitability targets. What is clear, however, is that the vote will determine whether Musk receives the proposed package upon delivering the company’s most ambitious aspirations. At present, Musk beneficially owns 19.7 percent of shares outstanding (the percentage of votable shares could be a bit lower[3]) and other insiders such as his brother and board members hold an additional 0.2 percent.[4] For context, the largest outside shareholders are the usual “Big Three,” Vanguard (6.9 percent), BlackRock (5.7 percent), and State Street (3.5 percent). Put differently, Musk’s voting bloc by itself outweighs that of any single institution by a wide margin and is large enough to neutralize the combined opposition of two, or even three top outside investors. Tesla’s latest proposal may give some shareholders a sense of déjà vu. In 2018, they were asked to endorse what was then the most generous CEO pay deal in corporate history, an option grant nominally valued at $56 billion. That vote was advisory, a “say-on-pay” resolution that received about 73 percent support from unaffiliated shareholders (i.e., excluding Musk), allowing the board to justify implementing the plan. Yet in 2024, the Delaware Chancery Court voided the arrangement, faulting the board’s process and independence. Perhaps to avoid a repeat, the 2025 proposal has been structured differently on three key ways. First, the vote is binding (not “advisory”), i.e., approval by a majority of the shares present, and voting at the annual shareholder meeting is required for Musk to receive the award, ensuring that it has more legal force. Second, unlike in 2018 when Musk’s own shares were excluded, this time his stake will be included in the tally. This is perhaps because the current proposal has not been designated as a related-party transaction but instead as a board-approved employment agreement amendment, such that under the Nasdaq rule, Texas law, and Tesla’s bylaws all outstanding shares are entitled to vote. Musk needs about 40 percent of the outside votes to be cast in his favor. Given that 73 percent of more or less the same external shareholder base supported the 2018 package, achieving this threshold should not pose a significant challenge. Third, by disclosing the additional ownership, Musk was accidentally or effectively conducting an experiment that calibrates how the market would respond to a deeper personal commitment when concerns have been raised about the distractions faced by an unusually versatile CEO. Against that backdrop, a relatively small increase in his exposure, about 0.6 percent of shares outstanding, or $1 billion, triggered a nearly $70 billion rise in Tesla’s market capitalization. The leverage was striking: For every dollar Musk added, investors received seventy more. The implication is that if a marginal outlay can move the firm’s value so dramatically, then a fully focused CEO, dedicating his time and mind to Tesla’s most ambitious goals, could plausibly generate more in shareholder wealth over the next decade in $1 trillion units. Pope Leo has already expressed deep misgivings about the scale and symbolism of the package,[5] but much to his dismay, institutional investors may well vote it through.

Title: Ripple Powers New Offramp For BlackRock, VanEck Tokenized Fund
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-new-offramp-blackrock-vaneck-tokenized-fund/
Time Published: 2025-09-25T04:00:37Z

Ripple has added another institutional rail to its stablecoin strategy: through an integration with Securitize, holders of BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) and VanEck’s VBILL tokenized US Treasuries can now redeem fund shares for Ripple USD (RLUSD) around the clock—initially on Ethereum, with support for the XRP Ledger (XRPL) in the pipeline. In a press release dated September 23, Ripple and Securitize said a new smart-contract flow “would allow holders of BlackRock’s BUIDL and VanEck’s VBILL to exchange their shares … for Ripple USD (RLUSD),” describing the mechanism as “an additional stablecoin off ramp for BUIDL and VBILL tokenized short term treasury funds.” The companies emphasized continuous availability—“24/7”—and framed the upgrade as programmable liquidity for compliant, on-chain investment products. Securitize also confirmed it is integrating with the XRP Ledger “to expand access and bring new utility to the XRPL ecosystem.” Jack McDonald, Ripple’s SVP of Stablecoins, positioned the move as a bridge between tokenized funds and transactional money: “RLUSD is for institutional use, offering regulatory clarity, stability, and real utility. As adoption grows, partnerships with trusted platforms like Securitize are key to unlocking new liquidity and enterprise-grade use cases.” On X, McDonald distilled the news for market participants: “RLUSD is now a key stablecoin offramp for BlackRock’s BUIDL and VanEck’s VBILL tokenized fund holders. The integration is starting with ETH, though Securitize is planning to integrate with the XRP Ledger.” Ripple President Monica Long linked the Securitize integration to a broader RLUSD tokenization push announced the prior week with DBS and Franklin Templeton, where RLUSD serves as a “liquid, stable and compliant exchange mechanism for tokenized assets in lending and trading use cases.” “This week, Securitize added RLUSD as a new offramp for BlackRock and VanEck’s tokenized funds,” she noted. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse underscored the 24/7 redemption promise and the XRPL roadmap: “Very excited to share that BlackRock’s BUIDL and @VanEck_US’s VBILL tokenized fund holders can redeem shares for RLUSD/ETH 24/7 365 through Securitize, and soon to come RLUSD/XRPL. Enterprise-grade instant onchain liquidity at your fingertips. That’s real utility.” The companies framed the design as explicitly regulatory-first. Ripple said RLUSD is issued under a New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) trust charter, with “1:1 USD backing by high-quality liquid assets, strict reserve management and asset segregation, third-party attestations and clear redemption rights.” Ripple added that since launch in late 2024, RLUSD has integrated into DeFi and cross-border payment flows and surpassed $700 million in market capitalization. For tokenized funds, the off-ramp matters because it stitches together yield-bearing on-chain treasuries with settlement-grade stablecoin liquidity. BlackRock’s BUIDL and VanEck’s VBILL are tokenized short-term US Treasury strategies issued through Securitize on public blockchains; the new workflow lets qualified holders convert fund shares into RLUSD without banking hours friction, potentially improving collateral mobility for trading, lending, repo and treasury operations. The development also follows Ripple’s tie-up with DBS and Franklin Templeton, which is listing Franklin’s sgBENJI token on the DBS Digital Exchange alongside RLUSD to enable swapping between the tokenized fund and the stablecoin, and to explore using tokenized fund units as repo collateral—an example of how banks envisage tokenization rails meeting institutional liquidity needs. While the initial redemption path is live on Ethereum via Securitize, both firms signaled that XRPL integration is next, aligning with Ripple’s push to make RLUSD natively useful across multiple venues. If executed, XRPL support would extend the same institutional redemption mechanics to a different settlement environment—one that Ripple and parts of the treasury-tokenization market already touch via custody, payments, and prior Franklin Templeton XRPL issuance plans. Notably, BlackRock will be represented at Ripple Swell 2025 in New York on November 4–5 at Convene Hudson Yards. Maxwell Stein, BlackRock’s Director of Digital Assets, is slated to speak in a session titled “The Impact of Tokenized Financial Assets on Capital Markets,” alongside Rory Callagy of Moody’s.

The labour cost is still lower in India | Photo Credit: DEEPAK KR Much before US President Trump’s decision to increase H-1B visa fees to $100,000 from the existing fees ranging between $2,500 and $5,000, the red line was drawn when he hosted 33 Silicon Valley leaders (including five Indian-origin top executives such as Sundar Pichai and Satya Nadella) at the White House. Although the meeting was about artificial intelligence and US investment, behind the scenes the talk was about a paradigm shift — how AI programming tools can now generate thousands of lines of code quickly, reducing demand for junior software engineers. This may explain why major US tech companies such as Amazon, Intel, Meta and Microsoft, have been consistently laying off workers in recent times, particularly before the hike in H-1B visa fees. In fact, the US-based IT firms are more dependent on H-1B visas than Indian IT firms. Even in India, the top six IT firms added just 3,847 employees in Q1FY26, a 72 per cent drop from Q4FY25. TCS made national headlines for laying off 12,200 employees, which is about 2 per cent of its global workforce. Although we are worried about the fate of around 400,000 Indian IT workers whose H-1B visas may not be renewed in the event of this fee hike, such a thing was bound to happen. Region-wise, India was the largest beneficiary of H-1B visas, accounting for 71 per cent of 3,99,395 in H-1B visas 2024, while China was a distant second at 11.7 per cent. Market participants had anticipated a sharp fall in stock prices of Indian IT companies heavily reliant on the US market when the stock market opened on Monday after the announcement. By the end of trading day, these stocks declined an average of 3.4 per cent. AI, automation, and cloud computing are changing the face of tech hiring, something which came too quickly, especially when there is a growing pool of computer science graduates specialising in coding that has been growing over the years. Graduating with a degree in computer science became a fad, with top tech executives, billionaires, and even US presidents promoting the field and encouraging students to learn coding. Throughout the past decade, a degree in computer science was yielding results, with fresh graduates in the US starting off with salaries exceeding $100,000 plus substantial bonuses and stock grants. Same trends were noticed in India and elsewhere across the globe. Like in the US, in India, there is a craze for admitting students to computer science programmes, with recent estimates suggesting India is producing in excess of one million engineering graduates every year. This has led to excess supply, particularly in the age of AI driven technological change. This is akin to the cobweb model in economics, where farmers grow a particular crop in response to higher price signals in the present period, only to realise there is excess supply in the next period. We are witnessing a similar event now but spread across a longer time horizon to adjust for the technological change. Entry-level hiring by Indian IT firms has dropped sharply from pre-Covid levels. The same can perhaps be said of employment generation, generally speaking, in the organised sector. India (like elsewhere in the world) is slowly transforming into a gig economy where the labour market is increasingly characterised by the prevalence of short-term contracts or freelance work. Private studies have shown that over half of Indian companies have more than 20 per cent of their workforce as contingent workers. The Periodic Labour Force Surveys corroborate this trend. In fact, most of the hiring in manufacturing, whether by the government or by private corporate enterprises, is now being increasingly outsourced to private contract suppliers. That things change so rapidly, requiring adjustments from both industry and the education system, is not new. Even the advent of computers and technology that marked the rise in productivity during the last century required adjustments. Alongside computers, electricity, combustible engines and refrigeration aided economic growth through a more productive labour force and necessary training. This has led to the creation of thousands of jobs in manufacturing. In the age of big data analytics, machine and deep learning, there is an apprehension that machines are increasingly taking over jobs performed by humans. But that is not entirely true. Newer types of jobs are opening up and it is in this transition phase that things will be little difficult. According to an August 2025 report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, among college graduates ages 22 to 27, computer science and computer engineering majors are facing some of the highest unemployment rates, ranging between 6.1 per cent and 7.5 per cent, respectively. That is more than double the unemployment rate among recent biology and art history graduates, which is just around 3 per cent. In an ironic twist, job applicants leverage AI tools such as Simplify to mass-customise their resumes and applications, only to have companies use similar AI technology to automatically screen them out. The silver lining for India is that irrespective of Trump’s hike in visa fees, it will lead to more offshoring. The labour cost is still lower in India, which has a high number of STEM graduates. It will only bolster investment in Global Capability Centres (GCCs). India accounts for 55 per cent of the world’s GCC centres (according to IBEF), employing around 1.9 million people. For the existing talented Indian IT workers other opportunities are opening up, for instance, China now announced issuance of K visa after Trump announced a hike in visa fees. Middle-East countries and the UK are other places waiting to welcome these skilled workers from India.

Title: Candidates begin canvassing in Presidential Election

Independent presidential candidate Catherine Connolly has described America as an "imperial power" contributing to current volatility. "We have a very volatile situation in the world. We have imperial powers. America is one of those imperial powers. As a neutral country we have a duty [to] use our neutrality to call out the abuse of power, no matter where that is, whether by Russia or America," she said. Ms Connolly was asked about her comments at UCD last night drawing parallels between the current increase in military spending in Germany and its rearmament during the 1930s. She said that more and more there was a "profitable military industrial complex" that was heading in one direction rather than putting the money into peace. "After the Second World War, we said no more wars. And more and more, we have a more profitable military industrial complex that's heading in one direction. It's very hard to keep figures in my head. We're not putting that money into peace," she said. Last night, Ms Connolly contended that there are "parallels" between the rearmament policies of Nazi Germany in the 1930s and the recent decision by Chancellor Friedrich Merz to substantially increase military spending. She was outlining her concerns to UCD's Politics and International Relations Society, and remarked: "They're absolutely championing the cause of the military-industrial complex in Germany, as a booster for the economy ... Seems to me, there are some parallels with the ’30s." When the German Chancellor successfully campaigned in the Bundestag to boost defence spending earlier this year, he justified the move by citing the threat posed by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the inauguration of Donald Trump as US president, saying: "We have for at least a decade felt a false sense of security." Around the same time, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said governments should be able to draw on €150bn in loans over the next five years, adding this would allow them to "massively step up their support to Ukraine". In her conversation with UCD students, Ms Connolly said she didn't want to "depress" them by referencing the "spend all over Europe on the military industrial complex", but added: "There is hope. And we have voices. And we can use them."

Ms Connolly, who is backed by the left-leaning parties in the Oireachtas, attended a meeting of the Dáil Public Accounts Committee this morning in her capacity as a TD for Galway West. Afterwards, and as a presidential candidate, she campaigned in the capital and is due to attend a rally in Harold's Cross this evening. Fine Gael candidate Heather Humphreys started her campaign today in Laois, with a lunchtime canvass in Portlaoise. Speaking in Portlaoise before travelling on to Limerick, Ms Humphreys said she's enjoying meeting people on the campaign trail and wants to be a president who focuses on the themes of "opportunity, unity and community". After canvassing in Limerick City, Ms Humphreys attended a Fine Gael rally in Patrickswell. Earlier, Ms Humphreys said housing supply is "the biggest challenge" facing the country and "very tough", but stopped short of agreeing with outgoing President Michael D Higgins that it has become a "disaster". Speaking this afternoon, Ms Humphreys said her focus is on securing 'number one' votes in the Presidential Election. Asked if she will be seeking Fianna Fáil 'number 2s', she said, "Regarding where people want to give their numbers twos, it’s a bit early at this stage. "My focus is going to be on looking for their support for me because if you don’t get enough votes, you don’t get elected," she said. Gavin had 'positive experience' in Defence Forces Fianna Fáil candidate Jim Gavin was in the capital this morning, with a canvass in Dalkey, Blackrock and Dún Laoghaire. Speaking in Dalkey, Mr Gavin said the Women of Honour, a group formed by current and former female members of the Defence Forces, have done a great service to the State by stepping forward and that lessons needed to be learned. When asked if he had witnessed any bullying or sexism in the Defense Forces, Jim Gavin said he did not. "I had a really positive experience in Defence Forces but I understand not everybody had that, and that's why I'm very proud of what they did, those women, they stepped forward. I'm fully behind them, and I'm really keen to see what comes out," he said. When asked if he would, as president, greet US President Donald Trump if he visited Ireland, Mr Gavin said: "Any elected head of state that comes, comes to the country that the president has to meet, I will meet them." Mr Gavin said he is looking forward to taking part in the upcoming presidential debates. "I'm really looking forward to it and enthused by it. I'll do my preparation as best I can and to represent my candidacy and what I'm going to offer and bring to the presidency of Ireland," he added. Yesterday, barrister Maria Steen failed to secure enough support to join the race, securing 18 Oireachtas nominations when 20 was required. After her campaign ended yesterday morning, Ms Steen told the media that "rarely has the political consensus seemed more oppressive or detached from the public's wishes". However, Taoiseach Micheál Martin rejected suggestions that the failure of Ms Steen to secure a nomination was "anti-democratic". Voting takes place on 24 October. With just three candidates, it is the smallest field in a Presidential Election since 1990. © RTÉ 2025. RTÉ.ie is the website of Raidió Teilifís Éireann, Ireland's National Public Service Media.

Title: Could Intel's Next Big Investment Come From Apple?

Time Published: 2025-09-24T22:51:16Z
Full Content:
Intel has reportedly set its sights on a deal with Apple, a move that could further boost the struggling chipmaker. Shares of Intel (INTC) surged over 6% Wednesday following a Bloomberg report that it's solicited support from the iPhone maker. Neither company responded to Investopedia's request for comment in time for publication. Shares of Apple fell less than 1%. Wall Street analysts broadly believe Intel likely needs more funds and foundry commitments from customers to succeed with its turnaround plan. Investments from Nvidia and the U.S. government have helped that process along, and one from Apple would mark another step. The stock has clambered higher this year, but it's well off past highs, a reminder that there's plenty of work yet to do. With Wednesday's gains, Intel's stock has added a quarter of its value in the week since Intel announced a $5 billion investment from and chip-development partnership with AI chip leader Nvidia (NVDA). The raft of events have excited investors, with the Nvidia news seen as a vote of confidence from the world's most valuable company. Still, the stock remains well off its highs, with most Wall Street analysts tracked by Visible Alpha sticking by "hold" ratings while waiting for evidence of more business for Intel's foundry, which makes chips for other firms and which is central to maintaining support from the U.S. government—itself now a major shareholder. A deal with Apple could help Intel's case, particularly if it came with foundry commitments. Nvidia's did not, raising speculation about whether a foundry deal could come later or whether the lack of one underscored Intel's challenges in convincing customers. "If Intel can prove they can deliver they will have customers lined up around the block," Bernstein analysts wrote last week. "If they can’t, no customer in their right mind will put any meaningful volume there." New partners might also see a deal with Intel as a way to gain political goodwill, Bernstein said. That may hold some appeal to former Intel customer Apple, which has shown some signs of inroads with the Trump administration, last month winning pledges of tariff exemptions based on its recent investments in U.S. manufacturing.

Reduced forecasts for copper and gold sales weighed on a big mining stock, while shares of a semiconductor giant made another push higher after an industry peer offered a bright outlook. Major U.S. equities indexes lost ground for a second consecutive session Wednesday, reflecting pressure on the tech sector and despite outperformance from energy names. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq lost around 0.3%, while the Dow ended 0.4% lower. Read here for Investopedia's comprehensive market coverage. Intel (INTC) stock jumped 6.4%, lifted by an afternoon report from Bloomberg that the company had discussed Apple (AAPL) buying a stake. The latest move higher for shares of the chipmaking giant also came after Micron Technology (MU) raised it outlook for PCs and traditional servers, two of Intel's key markets. Intel stock has gained more than 25% over the past month amid a string of high-profile investments from the U.S. government, SoftBank (SFTBY), and Nvidia (NVDA). Micron's stock fell nearly 3%, while Apple's was off less than 1%. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) shares tumbled 17%, more than any other stock in the S&P 500 on, after the mining giant lowered its forecasts for quarterly copper and gold sales. Issues at Freeport's Indonesia unit weighed on its outlook; .the company declared force majeure at its Grasberg mine after a mud flow partially blocked access to the underground facility, resulting in fatal injuries to two workers. Shares of Axon Enterprise (AXON) fell 10% after the provider of less-lethal weapons and other law enforcement technology announced the acquisition of Prepared, an emergency communications platform powered by artificial intelligence. Needham analysts reiterated their "buy" rating on Axon stock but noted the complexities involved in a potential return to the computer-aided dispatch market. Piper Sandler initiated coverage of Axon stock with a bullish "overweight" rating. Xcel Energy (XEL) said it agreed to settle litigation related to the devastating 2021 Marshall Fire in Colorado. Although the electric utility reaffirmed its belief that its equipment did not cause the fire, it will pay roughly $640 million to settle lawsuits involving more than 4,000 plaintiffs who sued for damages. Xcel Energy shares rose 6.7%, logging the benchmark index's top performance in the midweek trading session. Shares of health insurer Centene (CNC) gained 5.8%. Centene's managed health subsidiary Meridian Health of Illinois said it paid providers $15 million in value-based care incentives for improving health outcomes for its Medicaid members. Reductions in emergency room visits and inpatient readmissions under this initiative bode well for Centene's goal of reining in medical costs. Makers of agricultural chemicals received a boost following reports that a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers is pushing for a resolution that could stabilize fertilizer markets. More than 60 members of Congress reportedly signed a letter requesting that Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum add phosphate to the U.S. Critical Minerals List, a move that could help bolster domestic production of key crop nutrients. Shares of Mosaic (MOS) and CF Industries Holdings (CF) were up 5.8% and 5.2%, respectively.

Title: Longevity At Work: Why The Retirement Crisis Is A Unique Opportunity

ByJulian Hayes II, Contributor. For decades, 65 has been treated as the finish line of work. But that age marker signaling retirement was never designed for today's world. It originated in 19th-century Europe, when reaching the age of 70 was still a statistical rarity. Today, with people regularly living into their 70s, 80s, and 90s and thriving, the framework is becoming obsolete. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink underscored this in his 2024 annual letter to investors. He noted that if people are living longer and healthier lives, then the model of retirement must evolve in tandem with them. The old assumptions no longer fit. By mid-century, one in six people globally will be over the age of 65, according to Fink's letter. In the U.S., there's a high probability that the Social Security Administration program will be unable to pay full benefits by 2034. These demographic and financial pressures are often described as the core of a looming retirement crisis. But there's another issue that isn't readily discussed. Too many organizations still assume careers wind down at 65 and treat older employees as liabilities. In reality, longevity is extending careers by decades. Some countries are already adapting. The Netherlands, for instance, links its retirement age directly to life expectancy, acknowledging the current demographic reality and resetting expectations for both citizens and employers. The conversation typically comes to a halt at the point of system strain. However, another story is hiding in plain sight: older employees are staying in the workforce at record levels. A 2025 Newsweek survey found that 51% of adults nearing retirement age now expect to work indefinitely. That same report showed the share of Americans 65 and older in the workforce grew by 33% from 2015 to 2024, compared to less than 9% growth in the labor force overall. Among small businesses, the share of employees aged 65 and above has increased by 50% since 2019, according to Gusto's 2025 labor report. The drivers are financial—rising healthcare costs, disappearing pensions, shifting Social Security rules—but also deeply human. Many older workers mention purpose, mental stimulation, and social connection as reasons for staying employed. For organizations, this is a potential opportunity and can serve as a dividend for retention: experience, judgment, and cultural stability that compound over time. Workers who’ve weathered multiple business cycles bring perspectives and mentorship that younger teams can't replicate. With flexible arrangements, phased retirement, or hybrid roles, CEOs can leverage decades of knowledge and loyalty that might otherwise be lost. For much of the 20th century, the deal was straightforward: work 40 years, retire at 65, and rely on a pension. That contract has dissolved as careers now stretch six or seven decades, pensions are rare, and Social Security is under strain. Retirement is shifting from a hard stop to a glide path. Instead of abrupt exits, older employees are transitioning into flexible roles, project-based work, and different career arcs. For many, it is less about a paycheck than about relevance, stimulation, and purpose. Forward-thinking companies will design new principles and compacts that include: Longevity has already created a new class of late-career professionals. Companies that design and optimize for them will hold a distinct competitive advantage. Longevity is no longer a future variable; it is a present reality. The real question for leaders is whether they will treat it as a cost to contain or as capital to deploy. That requires a shift in both mindset and structure. CEOs and organizational leaders must: The retirement age of 65 may have been fitting for a different century, but today it is a relic of the past. What was once described as an impending retirement crisis can, in the hands of forward-thinking leaders, become a source of resilience and a unique competitive advantage.

Title: An ETF For Crypto Treasury Firms Could Launch Soon—Here’s What To Know

ByKirk Ogunrinde, Former Contributor. GSR Markets, a crypto trading firm, has filed to launch a new ETF that bundles a number of crypto treasury companies’ shares into one single fund, allowing investors to easily gain exposure to firms buying up crypto tokens. GSR's Digital Asset Treasury Companies ETF would bundle companies that buy and hold cryptocurrencies on their balance sheets—known as digital asset treasury firms—into one single fund that investors can buy. The ETF would also allow private investments in public equity (PIPE) deals—deals that allow investors to purchase equity directly from a publicly traded company—according to the filing. While other ETFs offer crypto exposure, GSR's fund is the first to offer exposure to the select group of crypto treasury companies. The ETF is expected to launch pending regulatory approval by the Securities and Exchanges Commission, but a date has not been given. GSR trades crypto tokens and provides venture funding for over 300 companies, according to its website. What Is A Digital Asset Treasury Company? Digital Asset Treasury Companies are firms raising capital through various measures to fund and hold significant portions of cryptocurrencies on their balance sheets. MicroStrategy , a software enterprise company turned crypto treasury, was the first to adopt this tactic in 2020 with bitcoin and crypto companies like Upexi Inc, Sharplink Gaming, and Bitmine Immersion Technologies have followed. Crypto ETFs, similar to stock ETFs, allow investors to invest in cryptocurrencies without directly owning them. These funds are overseen by professional fund managers and are under regulatory guidance. Investments can be managed through traditional brokerage accounts, without investors having to manage digital wallets or secure storages. Firms including BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale manage crypto ETFs across tokens like bitcoin, Ether, and Solana. Tangent The crypto treasury trend gathered steam this year, as companies rushed to take advantage of a crypto spike amid bitcoin's all-time high in August. According to crypto tracker bitcointreasuries.net, the 194 bitcoin treasury companies hold more than $117 billion worth of the token.

ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Nvidia's $100B investment in OpenAI, linked to $350B in chip sales, raises circular financing concerns, drawing parallels to Cisco's risky dot-com era vendor lending.OpenAI's $1 trillion data center ambition heavily relies on Nvidia's investment, securing vital chip supplies for AI growth, though potentially at lower margins for Nvidia.The AI hardware sector, led by Nvidia, is experiencing a significant boom, with its segment of the Generative AI Stock Index surging 403%, driving overall market growth. Nvidia shares are up 29% this year and 1,124% since the beginning of 2023. The company’s $100 billion investment in OpenAI raised questions about whether that rally would continue, according to the New York Times. The most fundamental question is this: Is Nvidia using its own money – investments in Open AI, CoreWeave and others – to fuel growing demand for the company’s graphics processing units? This brings back memories of the dot-com boom when Cisco Systems provided financing to startups to fuel growth in demand for the company’s networking equipment. Through its Cisco Capital arm, the company lent billions to money-losing telecom firms to buy Cisco’s products. In the late 1990s, Cisco regularly reported 40% to 60% revenue growth and by 2000, 10% of the company’s $20 billion in revenue was attributable to such financing and leasing deals. When the dot-bubble burst in 2001, Cisco set aside $900 million in reserves for bad loans to those customers, reported the Los Angeles Times, and tightened its lending standards. To be sure, if Nvidia's investments do not pay off, the GPU designer will not need to write off bad loans as Cisco did – but it could mark down the value of those investments on its balance sheet. In the meantime, all of these investments make Nvidia and Open AI the lead companies in a V-shaped forward migration of AI technology providers. Other segments of the industry – including chip makers and their suppliers, data center technology and energy providers, database companies, and many others, noted my book Brain Rush – are benefiting from this ongoing boom as evidenced by the 157% rise in my Generative AI Stock Index (compared to a 116% rise in the Nasdaq). OpenAI is planning to build $1 trillion worth of data centers – $300 billion worth will be supplied with help from Oracle and another $100 billion from the Nvidia deal, reported the Wall Street Journal. "Everything starts with compute," OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement. "Compute infrastructure will be the basis for the economy of the future, and we will utilize what we're building with Nvidia to both create new AI breakthroughs and empower people and businesses with them at scale." If OpenAI – which last fall said it expected to lose $44 billion through 2029, noted the Journal – can find the cash to finance these data centers, the industry will keep expanding. That may keep shares of Nvidia, Oracle, and many other participants in the AI ecosystem rising. If not, look out below. An Nvidia spokesperson declined my request to comment. Nvidia plans to invest $100 billion in OpenAI in $10 billion chunks. For every gigawatt of Nvidia-supported data centers OpenAI builds, Nvidia will invest $10 billion. For every $10 billion Nvidia invests, OpenAI will spend $35 billion on Nvidia chips, according to New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu whose work was featured in The Economist. OpenAI will pay for the chips through a blend of 71% in cash and 29% stock, noted NewStreet Research. One worrisome aspect of this deal is its lower margins for Nvidia. “That arrangement reduces Nvidia’s typical margins for cutting-edge chips,” wrote the Journal, while the chip designer will benefit from ensuring steady GPU demand. This deal also lowers OpenAI’s cost of capital due to Nvidia’s relatively sterling credit rating. Prior to this deal, OpenAI bought thousands of Nvidia’s chips through cloud service providers and neo-clouds – which buy chips and develop data center clusters – “renting them out at a premium,” the Journal reported. These data center builders borrow money to finance their operations. Data center deals associated with money-losing companies such as OpenAI were financed at interest rates as high as 15%; whereas the interest rates for deals backed by Microsoft ranged from 6% to 9%, the Journal wrote. Nvidia – which generated $72 billion in free cash flow over the last four quarters – seems to have ample interest free funds for financing its Open AI deal. It remains to be seen whether the chip designer will fund all $100 billion of its OpenAI commitment. Mark Twain reportedly said history does not repeat itself, but sometimes it rhymes. Will Nvidia’s huge bets on money-losing companies such as OpenAI rhyme with Cisco’s aggressive lending to unprofitable telecom service providers? It is too early to tell. However, Cisco’s lending during the dot-com boom “highlights the lengths to which one of the darlings of Wall Street would go to keep reporting revenue increases,” noted the Los Angeles Times. For Cisco, a key question was whether the company booked revenue for these financing deals too soon. In some of the company’s deals, such as those of American Metrocomm and Digital Broadband Communications, Cisco recorded sales only when the customers began repaying the loans, the Los Angeles Times wrote. In other cases, such as Rhythms NetConnections – an Englewood, Colo. based Internet access provider owned by a then-major Cisco shareholder Bill Stensrud – “Cisco booked sales at the outset -- even before a penny had been collected and even when the customers were teetering toward a bankruptcy filing,” reported the Los Angeles Times. Rhythms was unprofitable – reporting a loss of $36 million on $1 million in 1998 sales. But Cisco shipped $20 million of its equipment to Rhythms prior to the company’s April 1999 IPO. By August 2001, Rhythms had filed for bankruptcy leaving $30 million in unpaid debt to Cisco, according to the Los Angeles Times. By 2003, Cisco was chastened. “Cisco recognized that there were risks involved” in its earlier strategy, the company said in a statement to the Los Angeles Times, “but the decision to proceed was made for sound business reasons and based on analysis of the facts that existed at the time.” An economist who studied the telecom industry and reviewed documents about Cisco’s lending practices reached a sobering conclusion. By making loans to so many distressed companies, “these guys were operating under a fallacy,” Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Jerry Hausman told the Los Angeles Times. For a company to increase sales this way, he added, it’s like “you’re pumping yourself up on steroids,” Hausman added. The takeaway? Investors should keep a close watch on how much of Nvidia’s revenue is coming from customers in which the chip designer has invested. Moreover, it’s worth investigating the accounting policies for recognizing revenue from such deals and quantifying their value on Nvidia’s balance sheet. When Nvidia announced its investment in OpenAI, shares in other technology providers rose as well. Other stocks – notably Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, memory supplier SK Hynix, STMicro, Infineon and BE Semiconductor – gained ground, reported CNBC. My Generative AI Stock Index, about which I wrote in a June 2014 Forbes post, aims to capture the stock market performance of companies in the following industry segments: Overall, the GAISI has risen 157% between the beginning of January 2023 – the month ChatGPT reached 100 million subscribers – and September 24, 2025. Here is the average return for the four segments of the industry value network during that period: The top performing industry segment was generative AI hardware – of which Nvidia (+1,124%) and liquid cooling provider Vertiv (1,012%) – were the leading stocks. The worst performing sector was AI consulting – of which Gartner dropped most – down 23%. Analysts gave mixed opinions about Nvidia’s investment. The good news is the investment assures things get built; the bad news is 'circularity’ – which I interpret to mean Nvidia is buying its own products through a third-party. “On the one hand this helps OpenAI deliver on what are some very aspirational goals for compute infrastructure, and helps Nvidia ensure that that stuff gets built,” Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon told Reuters. “On the other hand the 'circular’ concerns have been raised in the past, and this will fuel them further,” Rasgon added. Several analysts see the deal adding between $400 billion and $500 billion to Nvidia’s revenue. For example, “We estimate this deal ultimately translates into ~$400B of NVDA revenue over a multi-year period,” UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri said in a note Monday, reported Barron’s. Another analyst shares Rasgon’s concerns about circularity and sees both Nvidia and OpenAI being better off. “So Nvidia has the demand for the chips, but are also investing, hoping that OpenAI itself becomes a good investment,” Creative Strategies CEO Ben Bajarin told the Times. Circularity has led to problems in prior tech booms. If OpenAI can keep convincing investors to provide more capital, Nvidia has a chance of reporting better-than-expected results. Otherwise, AI could become a bubble that bursts.

Title: Estée Lauder heir William Lauder quietly sold a prized NYC home for $37.5M — as he seeks to downsize

William Lauder, the ousted executive director and longtime chairman of Estée Lauder Companies — and a scion of the cosmetics empire — has sold his prized co-op at 998 Fifth Ave. for $37.5 million in an off-market deal. News of that transaction was first reported by the Real Deal. And it comes as the billionaire is looking to shed some homes from his portfolio. The buyer for the 998 Fifth residence is Evan Cheng, the co-founder and CEO of Mysten Labs, a blockchain infrastructure firm. Cheng, a former senior engineering executive at Meta, paid a significant premium over the $23.5 million Lauder spent on the unit in 2017 — netting the cosmetics heir a $14 million gain over eight years. The apartment, Unit 6W, is located in one of the most storied buildings along Fifth Avenue, a limestone landmark completed in 1912. The unit has four bedrooms and five bathrooms, with a gracious eat-in kitchen and oversize windows framing views of Central Park and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The sale marks the latest move in a broader property reshuffling for Lauder, who has been quietly trimming his property portfolio. He is currently marketing a 12th-floor apartment at 778 Park Ave. — once owned by former Revlon chief Ronald Perelman — for $25 million, a slight drop from the $27 million asking price he initially set last year, StreetEasy shows. He’s reportedly looking to sell it in a downsizing effort. Lauder acquired that unit for $24 million in 2023 and also owns another apartment in the same building, purchased in 2008 for $27.5 million. That home was once listed for $45 million, but failed to sell. Outside of Manhattan, Lauder is eyeing a record-breaking sale in Palm Beach. There, he had reportedly found a buyer in recent months for a $178 million pair of oceanfront parcels, but it’s not immediately clear if the deal fell through. If those properties ultimately sell for anywhere near asking, the deal would set a new residential sales benchmark for Florida. Lauder purchased the adjacent estate from the estate of conservative broadcaster Rush Limbaugh in 2023 for $155 million. Advertisement

Solana continues to prove the power of utility-driven projects over hyped ones. Its tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) have soared to a record $671 million, setting a new all-time high and cementing Solana’s status as a hot blockchain. 🚨BREAKING: The total value of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) on @Solana has surged to $671M, a new all-time high. The surge came after over $150M of inflows into @BlackRock’s $BUIDL fund on Solana. pic.twitter.com/51pkm0tFrA — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) September 24, 2025 The milestone comes after $150 million in new capital poured into Solana via BlackRock’s BUILD fund. That confirms robust interest from institutional players. Such breakthroughs indicate a key shift, with Solana’s low fees and speed now attracting massive on-chain transfers. Indeed, BlackRock’s fund has ignited Solana’s RWA marketplace, as anticipated. BREAKING: BLACKROCK BACKED BY SECURITIZE HAVE INTEGRATED WITH SOLANA TO EXPAND TOKENIZED REAL WORLD ASSETS ( RWAs ). TRILLIONS ARE COMING INTO MARKET pic.twitter.com/uuZCcOnzWN — Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) January 30, 2025 BUILD focuses on tokenizing traditional assets and money market funds. Thus, the massive injection into the SOL network signals is a significant vote of confidence. Besides boosting numbers, institutional inflows bring attention, credibility, and liquidity. These factors are crucial for any project’s growth. It is not only the project’s dollar value that’s soaring. Solana has exhibited a healthy ecosystem lately. Its RWA transfer volume increased by roughly 23% to $12.19 billion in the past month. Moreover, RWA holders jumped 17% to 77,982 wallets. That confirms new participants joining the network as institutional players lead the charge. Also, stablecoin transfer volume surged 26.23% in the last 30 days to $318.99 billion. The $12.37 billion stablecoin market cap and 11.43 million holders affirm Solana’s position as a go-to platform for on-chain settlement. Growing grassroots activity amid increasing institutional inflows indicates a healthy ecosystem flourishing on all fronts. Solana sees activity from day-to-day users and wealthy financial institutions. The RWA breakthrough comes as institutional investors continue to transform Solana’s long-term narrative. Galaxy Digital-linked Forward Industries holds SOL worth approximately $1.63 billion. Also, Pantera Capital has invested over $1 billion, signaling trust in Solana’s long-term potential. Moreover, Helius Capital added over 760K SOL tokens to its treasury, with plans to scale using a significant $335 million cash reserve. 🚨 Breaking: Helius Medical has stacked 760,190 $SOL and is gearing up to scale with a massive $335M cash reserve! Extremely Bullish For Solana!! pic.twitter.com/SQ9To3Oc42 — Crypto Elias (@ItsCryptoElias) September 22, 2025 Solana’s native token performed well in the past few sessions, rallying to $250 monthly highs. However, the upside steam weakened, and bears seem to control the short-term trajectory. SOL is trading at $214 after losing 8% and 2% the past week and day. The altcoin’s underperformance is likely anticipated as prices cool down after the latest rally from around $150 in early August. Also, the downward trajectory coincides with broader market dips. Analysts remain bullish on Solana, citing bullish fundamental and technical factors. The digital asset is holding the key support zone at $210. Validating it could catalyze short-term gains toward the $250 target.

Title: ‘Shot in the foot’: Indians are outraged over Trump’s H-1B move

Families rushed off flights from New York to New Delhi. Ticket prices for India–US routes soared overnight. WhatsApp calls buzzed with panic as Indian professionals in America tried to make sense of what had just happened. When US President Donald Trump announced a staggering $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa applications, the shock rippled instantly through Indian communities on both sides of the ocean. For many, the American dream they had spent years building seemed to collapse in a single press release. One of them was Suman (name changed), 39, a healthcare worker in New York. After three years of living apart from her husband and sending money home to support her elderly parents and sister, she sat in her apartment staring at her phone in disbelief. “I am on a H-1B visa, and I have been so stressed since then that my life seems like it will go upside down,” Suman told RT over a WhatsApp call from her apartment in New York. “I’ve been working here for the last eight years, and I have taken loans and mortgages. Everything felt like it was coming crashing down on me.” For families across India, Trump’s sudden move upended their daily life. Muhammad Anas, 62, from the southern state of Telangana, said his family was devastated. “My daughter is working in the US and teaches social science at a college. She is on a H-1B visa. We all felt very distressed, and she was crying on the call. She has two children, and her husband is pursuing a PhD there. The whole family feels the pain of what is going on,” he told RT. “The Indian government should take up the case with the US so that our children have some kind of certainty.” Back in India, the announcement also rattled young professionals who had been preparing for years to build their lives in America. Kazim Ahmad, 27, a graduate of a premier engineering college in West Bengal, said he was crushed. “I spent two years getting certified and interviewing for US companies. I feel very disheartened and devastated. It seems my American dream is dying now,” Ahmad said. “I come from a very poor family, and my state is also very poor. Going to the US could have stepped my family out of poverty and helped me progress, but now, I do not think aspirants have an option to move to the US.” Another hopeful, Vipul Kumar, echoed the frustration. “I spent my money and time on exams. I planned my life around the opportunities in the US. I feel very lost now.” Even those already working in America were forced to reconsider their plans. Inder Jeet, 35, from Haryana and an employee of a global tech giant, said his company warned him not to travel. “I was planning to go home next week and meet my family after two years, but now my company has informed us not to travel. I am heartbroken, but I am also thinking about what comes next for us,” he added. “The families on H-1B are enduring a nightmare. Some have just bought a home on a mortgage, and some have high loans to pay; everyone has a story.” For Suman in New York, the fear goes beyond bills and mortgages. “We do not know what tougher measures this administration is coming out with for migrants who are really working hard in this country to be part of it. To be part of the American dream,” she said, admitting she now questions whether it is wise to build a future in the US “There are a lot of questions in my mind.” The announcement left companies and employees scrambling. Within hours, several American tech giants warned their Indian staff not to leave the country and for those already abroad to return as quickly as possible. Rumors spread across airports, WhatsApp groups, and workplaces, fueling fears that even existing visa holders might be locked out. It wasn’t until the next day that the administration sought to calm the chaos. The White House clarified that the new $100,000 fee would apply only to fresh H-1B applications, not renewals or extensions. Current visa holders, officials said, would not be affected. At the same time, the Trump administration doubled down on its broader policy shift. A new proposal outlined changes to the H-1B lottery that would prioritize higher salaries and “top talent,” with the stated goal of protecting American workers from “unfair wage competition from foreign workers.” New Delhi was quick to sound the alarm. India’s Ministry of External Affairs described the sudden shift as more than an economic measure – calling it a potential “humanitarian crisis.” “This measure is likely to have humanitarian consequences by way of the disruption caused to families. Government hopes that these disruptions can be addressed suitably by the US authorities,” said Randhir Jaiswal, spokesperson for the ministry. He added that the mobility of skilled talent had contributed enormously to technology development, innovation, and economic growth in both countries. “Policymakers will therefore assess recent steps considering mutual benefits, which include strong people-to-people ties between the countries.” For Indians in the US, many say it is not about the job alone, but about the years of hard work they have put into building their lives in a country where they are now staring at an uncertain future. Earlier, Trump imposed 25% tariffs on Indian goods exported to the US, plus additional duties as a penalty for trading with Russia – making some exports completely unviable. Industry experts in India were more blunt. Mohandas Pai, former chief financial officer of Infosys, warned that Trump had “shot himself in the foot.” “These companies are among the most valuable assets in the US and the foundation of its global dominance. They are heavily reliant on high-quality H-1B talent from around the world,” Pai said, adding that the sharp fee hike would freeze fresh demand and push companies to shift jobs offshore. Pai estimated that the impact on India itself will be minimal, since the fee hike applies only to new applications. He pointed out that there is already a substantial stock of H-1B employees in the US, and most Indian IT firms now maintain large local (American) teams in their US development centers. “Over the past five years, they have undertaken risk mitigation measures,” he explained. He added that the visa restrictions would likely accelerate the growth of Global Capability Centers (GCCs) in India. “The multinational corporations respond to the scarcity of work visas by offshoring more operations.” India’s Sherpa for its G20 presidency in 2023, Amitabh Kant, slammed Trump’s move. He stressed that the $100,000 H-1B fee will choke US innovation and turbocharge India’s. “India’s finest doctors, engineers, scientists, innovators have an opportunity to contribute to India’s growth and progress towards Viksit Bharat,” he tweeted. Donald Trump’s 100,000 H-1B fee will choke U.S. innovation, and turbocharge India’s. By slamming the door on global talent, America pushes the next wave of labs, patents, innovation and startups to Bangalore and Hyderabad, Pune and Gurgaon . India’s finest Doctors, engineers,… Officials in India’s IT hubs also suggested the move could prove a long-term advantage for the country. Jayesh Ranjan, special chief secretary in Telangana, called it “a game changer.” “More skilled professionals may now choose to stay or return to India, which will fuel domestic innovation, startups and economic growth, and help transform India into a global technology hub. This will mainly affect American companies and some Indian youths who prefer going to the US. With this, many will be motivated to stay back, and this reverse brain drain will strengthen economic opportunities, competitive wages and broader reforms,” the official told The New Indian Express. For thousands of Indian families in the US, the new visa fee feels like a nightmare – mortgages, student loans, and years of sacrifice suddenly overshadowed by political uncertainty. As one H-1B worker put it: “Everyone has a story – a house just bought, a loan to repay, parents to support. Now everything is in doubt.” Yet industry observers in India say the broader impact could be more complex. Ajay Bagga, a financial markets commentator, noted that the policy might reduce India’s long-running brain drain, forcing both government and industry to find ways to absorb and productively employ highly skilled talent at home. “Brain drain will reduce, and India will have to find other avenues or productively use these people. This will be an objective for the government too,” he told ANI news agency. Others predict neighboring countries will benefit first. Canada and the UK, both eager for high-skilled migrants, could see a surge in applications as US doors narrow. Still, many in India believe the long-term opportunity lies at home – with more engineers, doctors, and innovators choosing to stay, fueling startups and strengthening the country’s own technology ecosystem. In the short term, though, the uncertainty remains crushing. For families like Suman’s, it isn’t just about fees or policy. It’s about watching years of effort and sacrifice suddenly hang in the balance – and wondering whether the American dream is still worth chasing.

Major U.S. equities indexes were little changed in recent trading, after snapping a record-setting streak yesterday. Lithium Americas (LAC) shares soared following a report the Trump administration may take an up to 10% stake in lithium project developer. Shares of Albemarle (ALB), the biggest U.S. lithium producer, also gained. Alibaba (BABA) shares surged after the Chinese tech giant said it is planning to spend even more on AI in the next three years than the $53 billion it projected previously. Shares of Diamondback Energy (FANG), APA (APA), and other energy providers continued to climb along with the price of oil, which rose after U.S. crude inventories declined. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 after the miner said it expects lower sales of copper and gold in the current quarter. Shares of Adobe (ADBE) also slid after a downgrade from Morgan Stanley, which raised concerns about the software maker’s ability to monetize AI. Motorola Solutions (MRI) shares fell as Piper Sandler warned the telecom equipment maker’s stock may be overvalued. Gold futures fell, and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose. The U.S. dollar was up on the euro, pound, and yen. Most major cryptocurrencies traded higher.

Title: The Shiller P/E ratio, a trusted stock-market gauge, just hit its highest level since the dot-com bubble
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-shiller-pe-ratio-dot-com-bubble-ai-2025-9
Time Published: 2025-09-24T14:43:25Z
Full Content:
A trusted market gauge has surged to its highest levels since the dot-com bubble, signaling stocks are the most expensive in 25 years. The Shiller P/E ratio, also known as the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio, compares the current value of a stock index like the S&P 500 to its average, inflation-adjusted earnings over the last 10 years. The S&P's Shiller P/E ratio crossed 40 on Monday for the first time since 2000, when it reached a record 44. That spike preceded a 49% crash for the benchmark stock index between March 2000 and October 2002 as the internet boom collapsed. "The US equity market looks expensive relative to its history, pretty much any way you slice it," Russ Mould, AJ Bell's investment director, told Business Insider by email. He added that the Shiller P/E and several other valuation measures are "all in the top 10% of their historic ranges." Mould said that "valuation does not guarantee an imminent accident," but investors might want to take precautions, in part because US stock returns have been "modest to disappointing" when they've traded at "similar Shiller P/E multiples to those in evidence now." He added, "The tricky bit is 10 years is a long time and you don't know when trouble is going to strike!" The Shiller P/E ratio was developed by Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Shiller, who predicted the dot-com bubble would burst in "Irrational Exuberance," published just as the market peaked in March 2000. He correctly warned the housing boom could collapse in the book's second edition, published in 2005. Investors use the traditional P/E ratio to value a company's stock based on its earnings multiple, or how many times higher its price is than its earnings per share, or EPS, in a year. They calculate it by dividing a stock price by an annual EPS figure, either historical or projected. Similarly, the Shiller P/E ratio takes a stock index's point value and divides it by the combined EPS of its constituent companies over the last 10 years, adjusted for inflation and divided by 10 to get a real, average figure. So if the S&P 500 is at 6,700 points, and its average, inflation-adjusted EPS over the last 10 years is $167, dividing one by the other yields a multiple of 40. The ratio can smooth out the effects of business cycles on profits by factoring in a decade's worth of earnings, providing a longer-term perspective on market valuation than the conventional P/E ratio. The Shiller P/E ratio doesn't indicate an imminent crash, as markets can remain overvalued or undervalued for years. It also doesn't account for interest rates, index composition, economic shifts, and corporate profitability, which can vary between time periods and influence valuations. The S&P 500 has doubled in five years to trade at record highs, led by AI stocks such as Nvidia, which has soared almost 14-fold to become the world's most valuable public company with a $4.3 trillion market capitalization. Several commentators have flagged that stocks are pricey. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in a Tuesday speech that "equity prices are fairly highly valued." Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business, told Business Insider in August that the huge market values and vast shareholder bases of AI companies like Microsoft and Meta meant "more investors will suffer than suffered in the dot-com crash, and their suffering will be more painful." But "Shark Tank" investor Kevin O'Leary and tech investor Ross Gerber dismissed the comparison between the AI boom and the dot-com bubble in separate interviews with Business Insider. O'Leary said in August that the AI boom isn't like the dot-com bubble because "you actually can see the productivity and measure it on a dollar-by-dollar basis." Gerber said that valuations are justified because AI companies promise tremendous growth and their profitability is "just insane." Copyright © 2025 Insider Inc and finanzen.net GmbH (Imprint).

September 24, 2025 10:09 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, Sept. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO). Such investors are advised to contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980, (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. The class action concerns whether Novo Nordisk and certain of its officers and/or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices. You have until September 30, 2025 to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class if you purchased or otherwise acquired Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. [Click here for information about joining the class action] On July 29, 2025, Novo Nordisk significantly lowered its sales outlook for 2025. The Company attributed the reduction to “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” On this news, Novo Nordisk’s American Depositary Receipt (“ADR”) price fell $15.06 per ADR, or 21.83%, to close at $53.94 per ADR on July 29, 2025. Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, Pomerantz pioneered the field of securities class actions. Today, more than 85 years later, Pomerantz continues in the tradition he established, fighting for the rights of the victims of securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct. The Firm has recovered numerous multimillion-dollar damages awards on behalf of class members. See www.pomlaw.com. Attorney advertising. Prior results do not guarantee similar outcomes.

Native Markets claimed that over $15 million worth of the stablecoin was pre-minted in the 24 hours before it went live on Wednesday. Earlier this month, Hyperliquid opened proposals to take over the USDH ticker on the network. As a result, a stream of crypto companies put their hats in the ring, including the likes of Paxos, Agora, and Ethena—the last of those with backing from BlackRock. However, it was Native Markets, a company formed just “months” prior to proposals opening, that won the bid. “The next stage of Hyperliquid's ascendance will be driven by native stablecoins,” Native Markets co-founder Max Fiege wrote on X. “We're honored to be leading the charge with USDH and look forward to showing up for the ecosystem every single day.” The next stage of Hyperliquid's ascendance will be driven by native stablecoins. We're honored to be leading the charge with USDH and look forward to showing up for the ecosystem every single day. https://t.co/wnaOpwLs4r — max.hl (@fiege_max) September 24, 2025 The primary condition for proposals was for the USDH ticker to be a “Hyperliquid-first” and “Hyperliquid-aligned” stablecoin. Native Markets is doing this by donating half of USDH revenues to Hyperliquid’s Assistance Fund, a protocol-driven buy-back fund. The issuer’s proposal claimed the stablecoin is backed by a mixture of cash and “U.S. treasury equivalents” managed by Bridge—a platform acquired by payments giant Stripe in 2024—and will be compliant with regulations in the U.S. and Europe. It is worth noting that the USDH ticker will not receive any “special privileges,” the Hyperliquid Foundation said. That didn’t stop crypto heavyweights from fighting over the ticker, presumably seeing it as a premium ticker for a U.S. dollar stablecoin on a rapidly growing network. Despite the big names bidding for the stablecoin, three days before the vote commenced, predictors on Myriad thought it was 96% likely that Native Markets would win. (Disclosure: Myriad is a prediction market developed by Decrypt's parent company DASTAN.) Some Hyperliquid community members and builders called foul play, suggesting that Native Markets were given a head start and that validators were only considering the new firm’s proposal. Native Markets did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comment. USDH’s debut comes at an interesting time for Hyperliquid, as it faces its first significant rival since launch. BNB Chain-based decentralized exchange Aster has seen its token skyrocket since launching last week, per CoinGecko, with the platform flipping Hyperliquid in revenue in the process. That said, according to DefiLlama, Hyperliquid remains ahead of Aster in weekly trading volume and revenue. Both projects are decentralized exchanges specializing in perpetual futures trading. Hyperliquid has dominated the field, although it appears that Aster is here to rival one of crypto’s biggest projects. Aster has surged 19% over the past 24 hours to a price of $2.31 and a nearly $3.8 billion market cap, according to CoinGecko, making it the 49th largest coin by market cap. Hyperliquid has fallen more than 6% on the day to $44.81, by comparison, although it remains well ahead with a $12.3 billion market cap and the 19th largest cryptocurrency. Even so, it's down almost 19% on the week, making it one of the biggest losers in the top 100 coins by market cap. Myriad users have turned bearish on HYPE's prospects in recent days, however, with 73% of predictors expecting the token to fall to a price of $39 sooner than it can rise to a new high of $69. The odds flipped on Sunday amid Aster's rise.

Title: Spatial structure evolution and ecosystem service relationship changes in urban-fringe-rural areas of megacities: Evidence from Suzhou, China
URL: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0332934
Time Published: 2025-09-24T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
The evolution of urban-fringe-rural structures profoundly impacts ecosystem services (ESs). However, the way in which trade-offs and synergies in ESs respond to changes in regional spatial structures has rarely been discussed. This knowledge gap hinders the development of spatially explicit strategies to mitigate ecological degradation while accommodating urban growth, ultimately perpetuating unsustainable landscape management practices characterized by reactive rather than preventive interventions. Such critical disconnect between structural dynamics and ES feedbacks has emerged as a major bottleneck to operationalizing landscape sustainability in metropolitan regions. This study selected Suzhou—a typical megacity in China—as an example to conduct an empirical study. The urban, urban fringe, and rural areas were firstly identified in 2010 and 2022 using Deep Neural Network (DNN) based on multi-source geographical data. Then, seven typical ESs were assessed using multiple models, and their interactions were examined through correlation analysis, coupling coordination degree model, and a self-organizing feature mapping network approach. At last, this study highlighted the complex responses of ESs relationships to dramatically changing spatial structure of urban-fringe-rural areas and proposed landscape management strategies. The findings include the following: (1) from 2010 to 2022, the spatial structure of urban-fringe-rural areas in Suzhou changed considerably, with 69.04% rural areas transformed into fringe areas, and 50.83% fringe areas developed into urban areas; (2) based on transition process, the region was further divided into urban maintenance, urban expansion, fringe maintenance, fringe expansion, and rural retention areas. Most of the mean value of ESs showed a gradient increasing differences along urban-fringe-rural, while the greatest decrease occurs in fringe expansion and urban expansion areas; and (3) interactions for changes in ES pairs also more closely linked in these two regions, with synergies dominating. The coupled coordination index among multiple ESs declines significantly in these areas, degrading from key coordination to key or mild trade-offs bundles. The results show ES interactions exhibit significant spatial variability under the evolution of metropolitan spatial structure, thus innovatively proposing integration of ESs synergies into urban-fringe-rural development framework to support overall landscape sustainability.

Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. The traditional urban-rural dichotomy has long defined the territorial structure of cities and rural areas. However, with urbanization, increasing interactions between urban and rural elements have blurred these boundaries, especially in metropolitan areas [1–3]. Scholars proposed the existence of a vast, transitional, dynamically evolving zone between urban-rural areas as the urban-rural fringe [4,5]. Scott emphasized that the fringe area is a distinct geographic unit, characterized by its evolving nature [6]. Thus, the urban-fringe-rural geographic classification model is gradually replacing the original dichotomy to capture complexities of regional spatial organization. However, most studies have focused on urban expansion, exploring its identification, evolutionary process, and impacts [7–10]. Less attention has been paid to broader spatial structure of urban-fringe-rural areas and their associated impacts. Properly defining the spatial extent of these areas is crucial for understanding territorial structures, assessing the socio-economic and spatial consequences of their evolution, optimizing land use, and enhancing ecological protection. Urban areas are characterized by high population densities and intensive industrial activities, with land use dominated by built environments [11,12]. Rural areas, in contrast, feature lower population densities and limited industrial development, with land predominantly devoted to agriculture and natural ecosystems [13]. The fringe areas, situated between urban and rural areas, exhibit a transitional mix of geographic elements [14,15]. This regional geospatial structure reflects the distribution of social and economic factors [16], with shifts symbolizing changes in human activities that impact ecosystem services (ESs). ESs are the benefits humans directly or indirectly derive from ecosystems, such as regulating, provisioning, and cultural services [17,18]. The interactions among ESs can involve trade-offs, where the increase of one service reduces another, or synergies, where multiple ESs are enhanced simultaneously [19,20]. This variability makes landscape less capable of providing stable, long-term ESs, which in turn affects human well-being [21,22]. Efforts to enhance ES synergies between urban and rural areas are gain attention, involving ES assessments, landscape fragmentation, ecological network security, and multifunctional ecological agriculture [23–26]. However, many studies separately focus on urban or rural areas, often overlooking the unique dynamics of the fringe zone. Megacities, characterized by large populations and expansive urbanization, present a complex urban-fringe-rural spatial structure [27]. The concentration of population and industry in these cities leads to significant, often irreversible land-use changes. These shifts pose potential risks to ESs and their trade-offs, further intensifying urban ecological unsustainability [28–30]. the evolution of urban-fringe-rural spatial structures helps clarify the complexity of urban-rural systems and their dynamic patterns. By examining how these changes affect ESs, it is possible to more accurately assess and predict ES supply, changes, and interactions, leading to more effective strategies for optimizing and protecting these services and promoting sustainable urban-rural development. Hence this study makes efforts to address the following questions: What are the spatiotemporal patterns of urban-fringe-rural structural evolution in megacities? How do ESs trade-offs and synergies respond to these changes? How can ES synergies be integrated into sustainability planning for urban–fringe–rural landscapes? This study takes Suzhou—a typical megacity in China—as an example. Over the past decade, Suzhou has experienced rapid urban growth, especially at the urban fringe, resulting in significant ecological challenges. As such, it provides an ideal setting for investigating the evolution of urban-rural spatial structures and the performance of ESs trade-offs. In this study, a deep neural network (DNN) model was constructed to identify urban, fringe, and rural areas in Suzhou, subdividing the territory into five zones based on transformation trends from 2010 to 2022. Then 7 key ESs were assessed by integrating models like InVEST and Maxent. Subsequently, correlation analysis, coupled synergies, and clustering technique were applied to explore the spatiotemporal dynamics of ESs relationships. The results help reveal the evolutionary patterns of ESs across these geographic zones. Finally, refined landscape management strategies are proposed. By mapping and prioritizing areas of intense ES trade-offs, integrating ES synergies into the classification and planning of urban-fringe-rural landscapes, planners can employ targeted interventions, such as green infrastructure, multifunctional agriculture, or ecological corridors. This can provide a clear pathway to sustain overall landscape functionality, balance competing land-use demands, and strengthen regional resilience. The flowchart of this study is shown in Fig 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332934.g001 Within the longstanding traditional framework of the urban-rural dichotomy, previous studies often distinguish urban and rural areas based on multi-source data like land-use data, nightlight intensity, point of interest (POI), and common research topics include urban sprawl, land-use transition, ESs change, and environmental degradation [31–34]. With a deeper understanding of urban fringe areas, the urban-fringe-rural triadic structure has gained increasing attention from scholars, gradually replacing the urban-rural binary structure as the regional classification framework for theoretical and empirical research in fields such as geography, urban planning, land resource management, and ecological planning [35,36]. Mutation detection and comprehensive evaluation methods are two main models to identify urban, fringe, and rural areas. The former uses clear spatial data like POI and nighttime lights to find spatial differentiation [37], while the latter relies on socio-economic indicators and spatial clustering [38,39]. Through informative, these methods are time-consuming and resource-intensive, with limited scalability in spatiotemporal analysis. Recent advances data processing and artificial intelligence have led to the application of machine learning methods. For example, Liu employed deep neural networks (DNNs) to identify urban-fringe-rural regions based on POI data [40], but this approach’s reliance on single-dimensional data limits its ability to capture the complex characteristics of urban-fringe-rural transitions. On the other hand, Jiao utilized graph convolutional networks (GCNs) with multi-source data to analyze spatial changes over time [41], but it primarily focused on scale variations, lacking a deeper exploration of the dynamic evolution of spatial features. To fill this gap, this study employs a DNN model to identify the spatial boundaries of urban, fringe, and rural areas. The DNN model is a type of artificial neural network that consists of multiple layers, supporting to learn complex representations of multi-source geographic data. It is characterized by its ability to handle large, high-dimensional datasets and model non-linear relationships, making it ideal for classifying spatial units into urban, fringe, and rural types. After identifying the spatial extent of these areas at two temporal nodes for a typical megacity, this study further explores the spatiotemporal evolution of the urban-fringe-rural regional structure. Additionally, it conducts a thorough analysis of the ESs relationship in the context of these spatial changes. ESs synergy has become a key objective in ecological planning and sustainable development, as it optimizes ecological functions and supports ecosystem health [42]. ESs are typically classified into provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural services [43]. Their assessment often involves process-based models (e.g., InVEST, SWAT) or statistical models (e.g., regression, time series analysis), using ecological principles, historical data, and GIS tools [44,45]. To understand the complex interactions between ESs, correlation analysis and spatial models are commonly employed, revealing trade-offs or synergies [46]. Factors influencing ES trade-offs include land-use, urbanization, climate change, ecosystem configuration, and socio-economic drivers such as population density and agricultural intensity [47–49]. Strategies for optimizing ES synergies generally focus on integrated land management, multifunctional land uses, ecosystem connectivity, and sustainable agricultural practices [50,51]. While research on ES trade-offs has primarily examined urban expansion, studies show that urban growth tends to reduce provisioning services (e.g., agricultural output, resource depletion) but can enhance cultural (e.g., recreation) and regulating services (e.g., urban climate regulation) [52]. Some studies also explore ES dynamics in urban fringe areas, highlighting competition among ESs due to land-use changes [53]. Others have balanced ES from a comprehensive rural-urban distribution perspective, indicating that rural areas prioritize ecological services like water retention and biodiversity, while urban areas emphasize cultural and regulating services [26,54]. However, there has been limited analysis of how ES trade-offs and synergies evolve across the broader spatial structure of urban, fringe, and rural areas. This gap limits the ability to manage ESs in a dynamic, holistic, and territorially comprehensive framework. The evolution of urban-fringe-rural spatial structures, especially in metropolitan regions, is widespread and continuous [55]. Once rural areas transition to urban or fringe zones, reversing this transformation is uncommon, as developed land seldom reverts to its non-built state. This irreversibility underscores the long-term consequences of land use changes. The urban-fringe-rural structure can be divided into five zones, including urban maintenance zones, urban expansion zones, fringe maintenance zones, fringe expansion zones, and rural retention zones. Each zone exhibits unique ES characteristics, encompassing both trade-offs and synergies. Understanding how ES relationships respond to dynamic changes in these zones is crucial for advancing sustainable development and optimizing ES management across urban and rural landscapes, helping to balance ecological integrity with the development needs of megacities. Suzhou (30° 47’–32° 02’ N, 119° 55’–121° 20’ E) is a prefectural city in Jiangsu Province, Southeast China, with a GDP of 2,395.83 billion yuan (333.28 USD) by the end of 2022, ranking among the top 20 regions in China. The city has a population of 12.911 million and an urbanization rate of 74.42%, making it a typical megacity selected for this case study. The rapid expansion of construction land (Fig 2) has significantly altered the urban-rural landscape. This growth, particularly evident in fringe areas where farmland and wetlands are being converted, creates competing demands on ESs—for instance, boosting housing and transportation capacity while reducing flood regulation and biodiversity. These intertwined trade-offs highlight the need to precisely map how different zones (urban core, expanding fringe, and rural hinterlands) contribute to ESs relationships. By understanding which areas see the sharpest conflicts between development and ecological functions, planners can target conservation efforts where they matter most, such as protecting critical wetlands in fast-urbanizing corridors or promoting green infrastructure in newly developed suburbs.

All data were reprojected to a consistent coordinate system, and the spatial resolution was harmonized to 30 m. ES trade-offs were assessed at the village administrative unit level based on grid-scale measurements. Following were main types of data and descriptions (Table 1). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332934.t001 The first challenge in classifying urban, fringe, and rural areas lies in establishing objective criteria for training the DNN model and validating the results. Given the absence of standardized frameworks, prior studies have relied on manual identification. In this study, five experts in urban planning and geography were engaged to identification, and following steps were taken: 1) Experts were divided into two groups—four in the identification group and one in the validation group; 2) For 2010 and 2022, 1000 random geographic points were generated for each year. Each point was input into Google Maps with a 1000-meter radius, and satellite images within this radius were extracted; 3) Two members of the identification group reviewed and labeled the images as rural (0), fringe (1), or urban (2), resulting in 2,000 labeled images; 4) If both members agreed on the label, it was forwarded to the validation group for final assessment. If the validation expert agreed, the label was confirmed; 5) In cases of discrepancies, the remaining identification group members re-evaluated the images, and the validation process repeated. If disagreement persisted, the point was discarded and a new one generated (Table 2). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332934.t002 Building upon this foundation, two DNN classification models were constructed for 2010 and 2022, each trained with 1000 labeled sample points (80% training, 20% test). The model architecture included an input layer, two hidden layers (128 and 64 neurons), and an output layer with Softmax activation for a three-class classification. The model used the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001, and sparse categorical cross-entropy as the loss function. Accuracy, calculated as the ratio of correctly predicted samples to total samples, was the primary evaluation metric. Key geographic features were selected to represent the distinctive characteristics of urban, fringe, and rural areas. These included population density, GDP density, construction land density, POI density, nighttime light brightness, and landscape fragmentation (Table 3). All datasets were processed at a 1 km spatial grid scale. Dropout layers (rate = 0.5) were added after each hidden layer to prevent overfitting. The model captured and learned complex nonlinear relationships between the input features using deep neural networks. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332934.t003 Guided by the principles of differences in ESs in urban and rural landscapes, the importance of ESs to urban and rural residents, and data availability, seven ESs, including one provisioning service (food production), four regulating services (carbon storage, soil conservation, water purification, and water yield), one supporting service (habitat quality), and one cultural service (landscape aesthetics), were selected in this study during 2010 and 2022. All ESs were quantified at a grid spatial resolution of 30 meters. The detailed assessment methodology is presented in Table 4. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332934.t004 Correlation analysis, coupling coordination degree model, and self-organizing mapping network methods were employed to investigate interactions between multiple ESs across temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal dimensions. To eliminate scale differences between ESs, Min–Max normalization was applied to standardize the data: where is the normalized ES value, is the observed value, and and are the minimum and maximum observed values. Spearman’s nonparametric correlation analysis was then used to identify trade-off or synergy relationships among ES changes from 2010 to 2022. Positive correlations indicate synergy, while negative correlations indicate trade-offs. The “corrplot” package in R4.3.1 was used to visualize correlations among ESs in 2010 and 2022. The correlation coefficient was calculated as: where is the correlation coefficient (value range [−1,1]), and and are ES data values. To explore the interactions among multiple ESs, we employed the coupled coordination degree model (CCDM) at the village scale to assess coordination changes in Suzhou from 2010 to 2022. Spatial trend analysis identified shifts in incoordination, shedding light on the evolutions of ES relationships over time and space. Coupling measures the interaction strength between systems, quantified by the coupling degree (CD) [65]. The coupling coordinated degree (CCD) reflects the level of integrated system development. For k systems, the coupling degree model (CDM) is given as: where represents the average value of each ES in a village, and C ranges from 0 (low interaction) to 1 (high interaction). When C = 1, the systems are fully integrated, and When C = 0, they are independent [66]. To assess coordination, the CCDM formula is: where T reflects the overall impact of the ESs, and a, b, c, …, h are coefficients that reflect the relative importance of each service (values: 0.12 for most services, and 0.16 for habitat quality, based on expert recommendations). D ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better coordination. Coordination is categorized into six levels (Table 5), from extreme incoordination (F) to high-quality coordination (A) [67]. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332934.t005 To capture the response of key ESs and their trade-offs within the urban-fringe-rural territorial structure evolution, Self-Organizing Map (SOM) clustering was applied. SOM is an unsupervised neural network that reduces dimensionality, visualizing high-dimensional data in a 2D grid while preserving topological relationships [68]. This method identifies patterns in ES interactions and their trade-offs, combining principal component analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering. SOM maintains the topology of input space through nearest-neighbor relationships and incorporates spatial data. Its ability to handle large, complex datasets while remaining interpretable makes it well-suited for exploring spatially distributed ESs across diverse structures. Additionally, SOM’s competitive learning algorithm detects hidden relationships without prior labeling, making it flexible for analyzing non-linear interactions among multiple ESs in dynamic environments [69]. In this study, the urban fringe of Suzhou was used as input, and the optimal number of clusters was determined by calculating the Davies–Bouldin index for 2–15 classes using the “kohenen” package in R4.3.1. This study maps the urban–fringe–rural spatial structure of Suzhou in 2010 and 2022, achieving DNN model accuracies of 0.9502 and 0.8850. The results (Fig 3) show that urban fringe areas are primarily located in the central and northern regions, with the south remaining predominantly rural. Both the central city and fringe areas exhibit polycentric dispersion and outward expansion. By 2022, the urban fringe covered 40.42% of the area, marking a 75.83% increase, while urban areas grew by only 2.13%. Conversely, rural areas decreased by 46.23%, covering 1,686 km2. Transfer analysis indicates that most land conversions occurred from rural to fringe areas (1,713 km2) and from fringe to urban areas (862 km2), representing 69.04% and 50.83% of the respective areas by 2022. This highlights that while the urban fringe is rapidly expanding, the rate of its transition to urban areas is slower, potentially leading to land resource inefficiency.

(Republished from Ministry of Natural Resources of China, http://bzdt.ch.mnr.gov.cn). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332934.g003 At the county level, there is notable spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Gusu District, Industrial Park, Huqiu District, and Xiangcheng District have the highest fringe-to-urban ratios (over 90%), indicating strong urbanization pressures. Changshu, Wujiang, and Taicang showed the fastest fringe growth (over 20% from 2010 to 2022), while Huqiu and Industrial Park experienced the most rapid urban growth (over 38%). Central Suzhou is characterized by urban expansion, while the northern and southern regions show more fringe expansion, reflecting differentiated urbanization patterns. Wujiang and Taicang’s substantial rural areas suggest lower urbanization, indicating potential for future development. Transformation scenarios were classified into five types, namely urban maintenance area (sustained urban from 2010 to 2022), urban expansion areas (transformed from fringe to urban), fringe maintenance area (sustained urban fringe), fringe expansion area (transformed from rural to urban fringe), and rural retention area (sustained as rural). Areas transitioning from urban or fringe to rural were excluded due to their minimal proportion, indicating that urbanization of rural areas is typically irreversible. fringe expansion areas (34.36%) make up the largest share, followed by rural retention (31.42%) and urban expansion (22.09%) (Table 6). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332934.t006 From 2010 to 2022, most ESs showed higher values in the northern and southern regions of Suzhou, with lower values in the central area. This trend applied to services such as carbon storage, water purification, soil conservation, and habitat quality (Fig 4). Food production was highest in the northeastern and southwestern regions, linked to arable land, and lowest in mountainous and urban areas. Water yield and landscape aesthetics both peaked in the urban center. Overall, most services, except cultural services, declined, with food production declining by 37.68%, primarily in the urban core and northern fringe. Regulatory and supporting services significantly decreased near urban centers, while mountainous regions saw increases in water purification and soil conservation. Notably, water yield rose significantly, while habitat quality declined in the urban fringe. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332934.g004 To understand the response of ESs to urban-fringe-rural spatial structures, changes across five regions were counted and compared (Fig 5). Most ESs—such as food production, carbon storage, soil conservation, nitrogen output, and habitat quality—were highest in rural retention areas, followed by fringe expansion areas, and lowest in urban maintenance areas, showing a decreasing gradient with urbanization. Conversely, urban maintenance areas exhibit the highest mean values for water yield and landscape aesthetics, with elevated phosphorus output in urban expansion areas. From 2010 to 2022, urban expansion, fringe expansion and urban fringe areas experienced substantial decreases in food production, water yield, and carbon storage, alongside the largest increases in landscape aesthetics. Soil conversation fluctuated in these regions. Notably, food production, carbon storage, nitrogen-phosphorus output, and habitat quality declined most in fringe expansion areas, with nitrogen output, food production and habitat quality dropped by 46.33%, 36.57% and 30.52%, respectively. Meanwhile, landscape aesthetics increased most in rural retention areas. (Republished from Ministry of Natural Resources of China, http://bzdt.ch.mnr.gov.cn). (Republished from Ministry of Natural Resources of China, http://bzdt.ch.mnr.gov.cn). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332934.g005 The correlations between changes in ES pairs from 2010 to 2022 were calculated across five regions (Fig 6). Positive correlations indicate synergies, where two ESs increase or decrease together, while negative correlations reflect trade-offs, where one ES increases and the other decreases. The absolute value of the correlation coefficient indicates the strength of the relationship. * FP—Food production; CS—Carbon storage; WY—Water yield; HQ—Habitat quality; SC—Soil conservation; TN—Nitrogen output; TP—Phosphorus output; LA—Landscape aesthetics. * FP—Food production; CS—Carbon storage; WY—Water yield; HQ—Habitat quality; SC—Soil conservation; TN—Nitrogen output; TP—Phosphorus output; LA—Landscape aesthetics. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332934.g006 Overall, the correlation coefficients of most ES pairs grew stronger from 2010 to 2022, particularly as fringe or rural areas transitioned to urban or fringe areas. Trade-offs were most evident in urban and fringe expansion areas, particularly between food production and landscape aesthetics, habitat quality and landscape aesthetics, and carbon storage and water purification. Urban fringe areas, with their edge effects, showed stronger coupling of ESs under anthropogenic disturbance. In contrast, rural reserves mainly experienced a loss in both food supply and habitat quality, reflecting the ecological degradation associated with urbanization. Additionally, trade-offs between carbon storage and nitrogen/phosphorus export, habitat quality, and food production were observed across all regions. To explore the interactions among multiple ESs in response to changes in urban-fringe-rural structures, a coupled coordination degree model was employed to Suzhou from 2010 to 2022. The results were categorized into six levels (Fig 7) and associated with the newly defined urban-fringe-rural territorial structure. (Republished from Ministry of Natural Resources of China, http://bzdt.ch.mnr.gov.cn). (Republished from Ministry of Natural Resources of China, http://bzdt.ch.mnr.gov.cn). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332934.g007 From 2010 to 2022, the average coupling coordination values for ESs in Suzhou decreased from 0.5820 to 0.4481, showing a shift from primary synergy to mild incoordination. ES interactions exhibit dissonance in urban maintenance areas but evolved toward harmony along the urban–fringe–rural gradient, reaching synergy in rural retention areas. The transfer matrix revealed that urban maintenance areas experienced growing dissonance, while rural retention areas shifted from mild dissonance to synergy, particularly in villages of southern Wujiang District, where ES relationships balanced. Notably, the most significant changes occurred in urban and fringe expansion areas. In urban expansion areas, ES relationships deteriorated from synergy to high dissonance, while fringe expansion areas saw a shift from good synergy to primary synergy. These findings highlight the disparities in ES interactions during urban-fringe-rural transformation. Urban expansion areas faced greater risks of environmental incoordination, while fringe maintenance areas exhibited minimal change. Spatial analysis, supported by the standard deviation plot (Fig 7), shows that an expansion of incoordination areas and a reduction in synergistic ones by 2022. The directional trend of the plot spreads toward the northeast in line with fringe sprawl. This study utilized the self-organized mapping network clustering method to categorize ES bundles at the village scale, the smallest ecological unit in territorial spatial planning. Seven distinct ES bundles (Fig 8) were identified based on dominant services and their interactions: (1) Key trade-offs bundle. Found near urban areas, characterized by high water yield and landscape aesthetics but minimal food production and depleted other ESs. (2) Mild trade-offs bundle. Located in fringe areas, with high water yield and landscape aesthetics, but low food provisioning and reduced other ESs. (3) Key synergistic bundle. Primarily in rural areas, showcasing balanced ES provision and strong synergies. (4) CS-HQ-LA bundle. Found mainly in southwest rural Suzhou, with high carbon storage, and notable synergies among carbon storage, habitat quality, and landscape aesthetics. (5) HQ-LA bundle. Located in rural areas, dominated by landscape aesthetics and habitat quality, with strong soil conservation services. (6) Water purification bundle. Concentrated in areas with extensive water bodies (e.g., Wujiang District), offering effective water quality purification and low nitrogen/phosphorus outputs. (7) FP bundle. Primarily in northern Suzhou, dominated by high food production. (Republished from Ministry of Natural Resources of China, http://bzdt.ch.mnr.gov.cn).

In urban expansion area, key trade-offs and mild trade-offs increased from 39.3% and 33.8% in 2010 to 52.6% for key trade-offs by 2022. Similarly, fringe maintenance areas exhibited a shift toward key trade-offs, from 34.6% and 30.7% in 2010 to 45.1% in 2022. In the fringe expansion area, the key synergistic bundle and water purification bundles were prominent in 2010 (39.2% and 25.2%), but by 2022, the area shifted to dominance by the key synergistic bundle and mild trade-offs (40.5% and 20.8%), while the water purification bundle declined to 17.8%. The rural retention area, initially dominated by food production, water purification, and key synergistic bundles in 2010 (26.9%, 21.2%, and 20.4%), but by 2022, saw these proportions decrease by 2022. ES bundle transfers primarily occurred in the urban expansion, fringe expansion, and rural retention areas, with urban maintenance and fringe maintenance areas remained stable. In urban expansion areas, mild trade-offs shifted to key trade-offs due to increased built-up land, leading to degradation in soil and water conservation and habitat quality. The fringe expansion area exhibited varied ES bundle changes across regions. In central and northern regions, some villages near the urban fringe experienced an increase in water yield and a reduction in food production, transitioning from key synergistic bundles to mild trade-offs (19.4%). In Wujiang and Kunshan, certain villages saw a decline in water purification capacity, triggering cascading habitat quality trade-off effect that shifted them from water purification to mild trade-offs bundles (16.1%), while others transitioned to key synergistic bundles. In rural retention areas, notable changes occurred in the Taicang-Changshu border, where fragmented arable land diminished food production. Some villages near the fringe expansion area shifted from HQ-LA to mild trade-offs, indicating habitat quality degradation risk. Given the irreversible nature of urbanization, ES trade-off risks exhibit distinct stages, particularly in dynamically developing urban and fringe expansion areas. The delineation of urban-fringe-rural spatial structures through our DNN framework inherently balances methodological rigor and contextual adaptability. We employed city-wide random sampling (2,000 grids) and multi-stage expert validation (7.2% resampling rate) to minimize labeling bias while capturing Suzhou’s unique land use context. Specifically, we excluded large water bodies (>1 km2), which constitute 37.1% of the territory, and integrated fragmented forests (median size <0.5 km2) into the rural classification based on their inherently low-density characteristics (S1 Fig). When applying this framework to other contexts, researchers should be tailored to local land use profiles. For instance, implementing pre-classification masking for forest patches exceeding context-specific size thresholds (e.g., > 5 km2 in mountainous cities like Lishui or eco-cities like Xiamen) to avoid misclassifying densely forested areas as rural zones. Additionally, temporal validation across Jiangsu Province (2005–2022, accuracies: 0.84–0.95) through DNN and comparative analysis against traditional mutation detection methods (low accuracy: 0.66, S2 Fig) confirm the model’s capacity to decode gradient urbanization patterns characteristic of polycentric metropolises. These technical considerations underpin our core finding that Suzhou exhibits a multi-layered urban-fringe-rural structure, highlighting the continuous expansion of urban fringe areas in Suzhou. This pattern aligns with similar trends observed in other Chinese cities, such as Chengdu, Shanghai and Guangzhou [70–72]. Given the irreversible nature of rural-urban transitions and the inherent heterogeneity in these shifts of metropolitan cities, accurately capturing their dynamic evolution is crucial for sustainable landscape development. The study categorizes the urban-fringe-rural continuum into five distinct types, revealing a multi-core developmental texture and differentiated formation mechanisms. In Suzhou, for example, the historical Gusu District (Fig 9, City 1) anchors the city’s urbanization trajectory. The “one core, four cities” policy has reinforced centralized growth, leading to simultaneous internal growth and external expansion across sub-regions like Xiangcheng, Huqiu, the Industrial Park, and Wujiang District. This phenomenon creates a unique multi-layered spatial structure, marked by overlapping urban, fringe, and fringe maintenance zones. Meanwhile, sub-city regions (City 2) predominantly exhibit external expansion, driven by transportation corridors and regional integration policies, influenced by Shanghai’s economic effect. These areas reflect decentralized urbanization, with fringe expansion zones along major transportation routes. This trend resonates with suburbanization patterns (e.g., suburban enclaves or exurban growth in metropolitan peripheries in the U.S. and Europe [73–75]), but also highlights the regional specificity shaped by China’s policy-driven urbanization. (Republished from Ministry of Natural Resources of China, http://bzdt.ch.mnr.gov.cn). (Republished from Ministry of Natural Resources of China, http://bzdt.ch.mnr.gov.cn). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332934.g009 The dynamic evolution of urban–fringe–rural spatial structures reflects a blend of internal densification and external expansion, offering a unique perspective for comparative studies on urban-fringe dynamics. This study also provides a practical foundation for exploring strategies for dynamic management, addressing social and ecological challenges, enhancing conservation, and promoting sustainable development in rapidly urbanizing regions. The dynamic evolution of urban–fringe–rural landscapes significantly influence ESs trade-offs and synergies, demonstrating the transitional and complex nature of these areas. Regulatory and supporting services like carbon storage, water purification, and habitat quality have markedly changed in fringe and expansion areas, intensifying trade-offs and driving the degradation of ES bundles. The most severe trade-offs are concentrated in rapidly urbanizing regions such as Kunshan and Changshu in northeastern Suzhou, where urban fringe expansion accelerates shifts from mild to severe trade-offs. This is driven by land-use changes and functional spillover effects from urban cores, like Gusu District. Some villages at the junction of Kunshan and the Industrial Park have undergone a leapfrogging development process, transitioning directly from key synergies to severe trade-offs between 2010 and 2022. This pattern underscores ecological risks and negative externalities associated with rapid urbanization in fringe areas. Addressing these challenges requires integrating ES synergistic management into urban–fringe–rural sustainability planning. Urban fringe areas serve as critical ecological buffers, mitigating urban pressures. Protecting key ecological nodes—such as water sources and biodiversity hotspots—helps maintain landscape connectivity and reduce ecosystem degradation. For example, enhancing ecological corridors, as seen in the European Green Belt, facilitates species migration and gene flow, balancing ecological integrity with development. Additionally, the intensive land-use changes in urban fringe areas necessitate adopting green infrastructure strategies. The intensive land-use changes in urban fringe areas necessitate adopting green infrastructure strategies. Green belts, parks, wetlands, and ecological buffers can enhance ecological resilience and mitigate urbanization’s environmental impact. These measures can improve both environmental quality and residents’ quality of life. In Suzhou, targeted green development can address ecological trade-offs and support urban-rural integration. Finally, integrated planning is essential for the irreversible ecological and social transitions in fringe areas. Policies should emphasize urban-rural resource complementarities, leveraging rural areas for food supply and regulating services, while urban areas provide cultural and economic benefits. Equitable distribution of public services and infrastructure, including transportation and green spaces, can foster synergy between urban and rural systems, as demonstrated by international models. These strategies offer a balanced approach to sustainable socio-economic and environmental development. While the proposed identifiable urban-fringe-rural framework effectively captures policy-driven metropolitan dynamics in Suzhou, its applicability to market-dominated cities or those with unique landscapes (e.g., mountainous or resource-depleted regions) requires further validation. Future efforts should prioritize two pathways: First, developing adaptive analytical modules tailored to different institutional contexts—for instance, incorporating land price indices in market-active areas and landslide risks in ecological corridors. Second, it is essential to engage stakeholders—including farmers, urban residents, government officials, and developers—in discussions about the findings and their views on ES trade-off decisions. Establishing a closed-loop system integrating “DNN identification-ES assessment-stakeholder engagement”, where resident preferences (collected through participatory platforms) directly inform model refinements, moving beyond post-hoc discussions. Finally, Additionally, the current semi-supervised model’s reliance on expert labeling could be optimized through disputed-area prioritization—focusing annotation efforts on ambiguous urban-rural transition zones rather than blanket sampling. This targeted approach maintains accuracy while enhancing scalability. In this research, multi-source geographic data and machine learning methods were emplyed to investigate the evolution of urban, fringe, and rural areas in Suzhou from 2010 to 2022. Key ESs and their interactions across urban–fringe–rural geospatial structures were analyzed, resulting in the identification of seven distinct ES bundles: key trade-offs bundle, mild trade-offs bundle, key synergistic bundle, CS-HA-LA bundle, HQ-LA bundle, water purification bundle, and FP bundle. These findings formed the basis for developing landscape optimization strategies to enhance synergies among ESs and promote sustainable urban-rural development. This study contributes to the literature in two significant ways. First, the DNN model-based identification method provides a refined approach for delineating urban–fringe–rural spatial structures across various scales and timeframes in metropolitan regions. Second, by employing a case-study approach, an innovative framework is presented for recognizing, evaluating, and managing dynamically evolving ES interactions, offering valuable guidance for sustainable urban–fringe–rural landscape planning and governance. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332934.s001 (JPG) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332934.s002 (JPG) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332934.s003 (ZIP) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332934.s004 (ZIP) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332934.s005 (ZIP) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332934.s006 (ZIP) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332934.s007 (ZIP) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332934.s008 (ZIP)

Title: Bitcoin Miner IREN Has 80% Potential Upside Thanks to Big Bet on AI Cloud: Bernstein

IREN (IREN), one of the largest self-operated BTC$109,621.01 miners in the U.S., is breaking away from the pack, and Wall Street is taking notice. Bernstein analysts raised their price target on IREN to $75 from $20, implying about 80% upside, as the miner doubles down on building its own AI cloud business rather than relying on co-location deals with partners like CoreWeave (CRWV). IREN has already had a major move, ahead more than eight-fold from its 52-week low of $5.13 hit in April. The shares are higher by 365% year-over-year. The broker now sees IREN’s AI pivot as credible, despite early skepticism about the miner’s ability to execute on a capital-intensive data center build-out and compete with AI cloud players tied to hyperscalers and Nvidia (NVDA). IREN is guiding for rapid growth, the report noted, with $500 million in annual recurring revenue by Q1 2026 on 23,300 GPUs, up from roughly $14 million in Q1 2025. Beyond AI, IREN retains flexibility with its 3 gigawatt (GW) power portfolio, balancing bitcoin mining and AI workloads to maximize revenue per megawatt, Bernstein analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote. Its 50 EH/s mining operation generates an estimated $600 million in annualized EBITDA at current bitcoin prices, funding its AI expansion, according to the analysts. Bernstein has shifted its valuation approach to a sum-of-parts model, assigning 87% of enterprise value to AI cloud and co-location potential at IREN’s 2GW West Texas site, with the remaining 13% coming from bitcoin mining. At the revised target, IREN would trade at $7.5 million per megawatt (MW), above other AI-focused miners but still far below established data center peers like CoreWeave, suggesting further room for multiple expansion, the report added.

Time Published: 2025-09-24T12:45:36Z
Full Content:
Micron (MU) shares were little changed in premarket trading Wednesday after the memory chip maker posted better-than-expected quarterly results and issued a rosy forecast amid surging AI-related demand. The company said late Tuesday it expects to generate fiscal first-quarter revenue of $12.20 billion to $12.80 billion. The midpoint of that range comes in well ahead of the $11.94 billion expected by analysts, with the guidance driven by booming demand for the company’s high-bandwidth memory chips and favorable pricing dynamics. Heading into the earnings report, the Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) partner's shares had nearly doubled since the start of the year and surged 40% in September. The gains have been fueled by customers investing billions in AI chips to build data centers tasked with powering increasingly memory-intensive applications. The stock was down 0.2% at around $166 in recent premarket trading. Below, we use technical analysis to identify important post-earnings price levels worth watching out for. After finding support near the 50-day moving average, Micron shares trended sharply higher before consolidating in a pennant pattern over the past week. While this month’s strong uptrend has coincided with the relative strength index crossing into overbought territory, the indicator remains below its June peak, signaling that the stock has further room to climb. During Wednesday’s trading session, it’s worth watching out for a breakout above the pennant, a move that would indicate a continuation of the recent bullish move. Let’s turn to Micron’s chart to forecast an upside price target and also identify important support levels amid the possibility for earnings-related volatility. If a post-earnings breakout move occurs, investors can use bars pattern analysis to project an upside target. When applying the technique to Micron’s chart, we take the price bars comprising the strong move higher this month and reposition them from the pennant pattern’s top trendline. This forecasts a target of around $240, 44% above Tuesday’s closing price. We selected this earlier trend to predict how a continuation move higher may play out on the chart if the stock has a similar bullish upward leg. During retracements in the stock, investors should initially keep a close eye on the $155 level. This area on the chart could provide support near the base of the pennant pattern and a brief pause in the stock’s strong uptrend earlier this month. Finally, selling below this level could spark a fall toward $129. Investors may seek to accumulate Micron shares in this location near the June and August peaks, which currently sit just above the upward sloping 50-day MA.

China’s top tech firm is spending even more than it originally planned on AI, turning up the heat on U.S. chip giants like Nvidia (NVDA) in the race to dominate the technology. Alibaba Group Holdings (BABA) CEO Eddie Wu reportedly said Wednesday that the Chinese company has raised its AI budget to more than the $53 billion three-year outlay it announced in February. The spending plan marks the latest push by a tech firm to invest big in AI, the technology that has fueled U.S. stock markets to hit record highs. Nvidia said earlier this week it plans to invest up to $100 billion in ChatGPT owner OpenAI. “We are vigorously advancing a three-year, 380 billion [yuan] AI infrastructure initiative with plans to sustain and further increase our investment according to our strategic vision in anticipation of the [artificial superintelligence] era,” Wu said at Alibaba Cloud’s annual flagship technology conference, according to CNBC. The boom in AI spending by tech firms has helped propel the U.S. stock market to record highs this year. American tech firms are a big reason for this, but increasing spending on AI in China—by Alibaba and rivals like Baidu—is also behind this spending, and comments today from Alibaba's CEO indicate that it could continue. Wu has said he sees companies globally spending around $4 trillion globally on AI over the next five years, and “Alibaba needs to keep up,” Bloomberg said. Alibaba shares have more than doubled so far this year, as co-founder Jack Ma returned to Beijing's fold and the ecommerce giant doubled down on its "AI first strategy." On Wednesday, they rose 9% in intraday trading. Adding to the investor optimism, Cathie Wood's funds bought Alibaba shares, according to a daily trading report from her Ark Investment Management. Bloomberg noted it was the star fund manager's first purchase in the Chinese company in four years. Alibaba didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

Title: GE Vernova Is Up 350%, But Can It Deliver?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/24/ge-vernova-is-up-350-but-can-it-deliver/
Time Published: 2025-09-24T12:30:00Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. GE Vernova stock has experienced an impressive increase. Following its spin-off from General Electric in April 2024, the stock has risen over 350%, significantly outpacing the S&P 500’s gain of 27% during the same timeframe. The reasons behind this rally are obvious: electricity demand is on the rise, production capacity is expanding, profit margins are improving, and sustainability pledges offer the company a compelling long-term story. Collectively, these elements have driven the stock’s remarkable performance. However, investors should consider whether the market has already factored in these positives or if optimism has outstripped the underlying fundamentals. At its current price, GE Vernova is far from being a bargain. The stock trades at a P/E ratio of 151, a price-to-sales ratio of 4.7, and a price-to-free cash flow of 63. These multiples are significantly higher than the S&P 500 averages, suggesting that investors are wagering not on the company's present, but on its potential future role as a crucial component in the worldwide transition to electrification. Given such high expectations, even minor execution errors could negatively impact the stock. That said, investing in a single stock entails risks. For those investors seeking less volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio offers an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and delivered returns of over 91% since its launch. As a whole, HQ Portfolio stocks yielded better returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; providing a steadier performance, as reflected in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Separately, check out GOOGL Stock Vs. AMZN, MSFT & META At its essence, GE Vernova is an energy technology firm dedicated to the transition toward a lower-carbon future. Its four divisions - Power, Wind, Electrification Systems, and Energy Financial Services - encompass the technologies required to produce, transmit, and manage electricity. In summary, GE Vernova is central to the electrification and decarbonization movement. In September, the management revealed the sale of its Proficy industrial software unit to TPG for $600 million. This is a typical divestiture strategy: offload non-core assets and reinvest in what is essential. For GE Vernova, this entails a renewed emphasis on grid software and power systems, where demand is growing. Electricity demand is not decreasing, and GE Vernova is aware of this. The company is increasing its turbine production capacity from 15,000 to 20,000 megawatts by 2026, aiming to fulfill the rising demand, particularly in rapidly industrializing areas. GE Vernova also plays a pivotal role in the transition to clean energy. With 55,000 wind turbines and 7,000 gas turbines operational, its technology contributes to approximately 25% of global electricity generation. Additionally, the company is striving for carbon neutrality by 2030, aligning itself with the worldwide decarbonization movement. The second quarter confirmed investor optimism. Revenue increased by 12% to $12.4 billion, adjusted EBITDA rose by 25%, and net income reached $492 million. Management even elevated its year-end revenue forecast to $36–37 billion, indicating confidence that the growth momentum will persist. Upon closer inspection, orders totaling $12.4 billion indicated strong future demand. The backlog increased by $5.2 billion, primarily driven by robust performance in Gas Power. Free cash flow remained positive at $194 million, although this figure was down from the previous year due to one-time items. Not all divisions are excelling, however. The Wind segment is still facing difficulties, hindered by tariffs, rising service costs, and challenges in offshore markets. At the current valuation, expectations are exceedingly high. To maintain its premium, GE Vernova must execute with near-perfect precision — increasing production, safeguarding margins, and tackling ongoing issues in wind. For investors, this means being aware of the risks and understanding that the present price requires patience. Investing in a single stock carries inherent risks, and a diversified approach may provide greater stability. You might consider exploring the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to deliver strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided an adaptable way to capitalize on favorable market conditions while mitigating losses when markets decline, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Stock futures are edging higher after major indexes snapped a three-day streak of record highs; Micron Technology (MU) shares are in focus after the chipmaker posted record revenue on strong AI demand; Stable coin issuer Tether is reportedly seeking funding that would value the company at $500 billion; shares of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA) are surging on its AI spending plans; and Lithium Americas (LAC) stock is soaring on a report that the U.S. government seeks to own a stake in the mining firm. Here's what investors need to know today. Stock futures are higher this morning after the market lost ground yesterday following comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who said the central bank faces challenges in determining interest rates as the labor market weakens while inflation remains elevated. Futures associated with the benchmark S&P 500, the tech-focused Nasdaq and the Dow Jones Industrial Average are pointing to a slightly higher opens for each of the major indexes. Gold futures, which have hit a series of record highs recently, ticked lower to around $3,800 an ounce. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects a wide range of consumer loans, was little changed at 4.13%. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) was at $113,100 recently, up from an overnight low of around $111,000. Memory chip maker Micron Technology (MU) posted record quarterly sales and delivered an optimistic outlook on surging demand for AI hardware. Micron reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.03 on revenue that jumped 46% year-over-year to $11.32 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter, both above estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. The partner to Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) said it expects adjusted earnings per share of $3.41 to $3.71 on revenue of $12.20 billion to $12.80 billion in the fiscal first quarter, also ahead of expectations. Shares of Micron, which have nearly doubled year-to-date, were down 1% in recent premarket trading. Stable coin issuer Tether is reportedly seeking to raise as much as $20 billion in private investment in a deal that could put the cryptocurrency firm’s value on par with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and Elon Musk’s SpaceX. Bloomberg reported that the El Salvador-based company is looking to raise between $15 billion and $20 billion in exchange for a 3% stake. The deal could see the company valued at $500 billion. In a social media post, CEO Paolo Ardoino said the funding would help scale by “several orders of magnitude” the firm’s business lines, which also included AI, commodity trading, energy, communications and media. Shares of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA) surged after a report that the firm plans to boost its AI spending. Bloomberg reported that CEO Eddie Wu said the company would ramp up AI spending beyond the original plan announced in February of around $53 billion, as overall spending on the technology worldwide is expected to reach $4 trillion over the next five years. The company will invest in the development of AI models and infrastructure, including plans to build data centers in Brazil, France and the Netherlands, the report said. U.S.-traded shares of Alibaba were up more than 8% ahead of the opening bell. Shares of Lithium Americas (LAC) soared in premarket trading on a report that the Trump administration may seek a stake in the mining company as part of a government loan deal. Reuters reported that the government may ask for a 10% stake in Lithium Americas as a condition in renegotiation talks over a $2.26 billion Energy Department loan for its Thacker Pass lithium project with General Motors (GM). Lithium is used to make electric vehicle batteries and other key electronic equipment. The move would come after the Trump administration took a similar stake in chipmaker Intel (INTC). Shares of Lithium Americas were up 70% in recent premarket trading, while GM gained more than 2%.

Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market The bitcoin price has traded sideways since May, dropping back from a peak of $124,000 per bitcoin in August as Tesla billionaire Elon Musk issues a stark $37 trillion warning. Now, as Goldman Sacks warns of U.S. dollar collapse, Wall Street giant Morgan Stanley is gearing up to offer bitcoin and crypto trading in 2026. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run “We are well underway in preparing to offer crypto trading through a partner model to E-Trade clients in the first half of 2026,” Jed Finn, head of wealth management at Morgan Stanley, said in a memo seen by CNBC, adding that, “offering clients the ability to trade crypto is the tip of the iceberg.” At launch, E-Trade clients will be able to trade bitcoin, ethereum and solana, a Morgan Stanley spokesperson told Reuters. Eventually, Morgan Stanley expects tokenized versions of traditional financial assets on blockchains will “significantly disrupt” the wealth management industry. “Tokenized substitutes for cash begin paying interest as soon as it hits the wallet. The rest of the asset classes will follow suit in seeking this efficiency," Finn wrote in the memo, echoing BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink who has said crypto-based tokenization will create a “revolution” on Wall Street. “We see immense power in the cryptocurrency space, not just with crypto as an investment for our clients, but also around [blockchain’s distributed ledger technology] and tokenization more broadly." Morgan Stanley—which is among the most bullish of the Wall Street giants on bitcoin and crypto, making bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) available to its wealth advisors in August last year—will offer crypto trading on E-Trade through a partnership with Zerohash, an infrastructure provider for the digital assets. This week, Zerohash, which provides crypto trading, tokenization and stablecoin infrastructure for financial institutions, raised $104 million at a $1 billion valuation in a round led by Interactive Brokers, it was reported by Fortune.

BlackRock’s spot bitcoin ETF exploded onto Wall Street in early 2024, becoming the fastest growing ETF ever and now holding almost 750,000 bitcoin worth $88 billion on behalf of investors. BlackRock, which manages around $10 trillion worth of assets for investors, spearheaded Wall Street’s campaign to bring a long-awaited spot bitcoin ETF to market in 2023, with its IBIT bitcoin fund dominating a fleet of funds that launched in January 2024.

Title: Why Ethereum Treasuries Could Be The Next Big Business Strategy

BySandy Carter, Contributor. Ethereum treasuries are revolutionizing corporate finance, moving beyond idle Bitcoin holdings. Companies are now actively using ETH as a productive, yield-bearing asset through staking and DeFi lending, generating 3-5% returns. Liquid staking offers flexibility, allowing businesses to earn income while maintaining access to capital. This shift makes ETH a new, powerful tool for treasury management, impacting both large institutions and small businesses globally. Ethereum treasuries are quietly becoming one of the most consequential shifts in corporate finance. When the first corporate treasuries began buying Bitcoin and Bitcoin ETFs, it made headlines. Tesla, MicroStrategy, and Square put digital gold on their balance sheets as a hedge against inflation and as a bet on a new monetary standard. Ethereum is quietly charting a different path (changing the world in different ways) that could prove even more transformative for corporate finance — and increasingly relevant for smaller businesses and investors too. According to the Block, nearly 70 organizations now hold more than 17 billion dollars worth of ETH directly, while ETFs account for another 25 billion. Together, close to 10% of Ethereum’s circulating supply is now under institutional control. An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a familiar stock market product that lets investors buy and sell Ethereum the same way they trade Apple or Microsoft stock, without ever touching crypto directly. That scale is remarkable, but the real story lies in what institutions are doing with their ETH. Unlike Bitcoin, which often sits idle on corporate balance sheets, Ethereum treasuries are yield-bearing assets. Ethereum itself is more than just a digital coin. It is a programmable blockchain, like a global computer, where apps for finance, art, and identity are built. The coin, called ETH, is valuable both because it can be traded and because it powers those applications. According to Seeking Alpha, companies such as BitMine and SharpLink are now staking billions of dollars of ETH to generate predictable income streams. Staking is like putting money in a savings account, but instead of a bank paying you, the Ethereum network pays you for helping to keep it running. This is not speculation. It is balance sheet engineering. By staking or lending ETH, treasuries reduce circulating liquidity while creating new sources of revenue. According to Mati Greenspan, founder and CEO of Quantum Economics, “Liquid staking captures the true magic of internet money and delivers it to asset managers on a silver platter. Institutional funds can now hold Ethereum that grows in value while staying liquid, a combination that traditional finance has never been able to offer. It is no wonder this strategy is spreading like wildfire across the globe.” According to Yellow.com, when ETH is staked, it generates yields in the range of 3 to 5%, often more than government bonds. ETH can also be deployed into lending markets, collateralized for credit, or structured into financial products. Traditional staking locks ETH away, which can be a problem if a company suddenly needs access to its capital. This is where liquid staking comes in. Think of it like a CD at the bank. With a CD, you earn interest but cannot touch the money until it matures. Liquid staking is like earning that same interest, but also getting a certificate you can borrow against, trade, or even spend while your deposit keeps working for you. For businesses, this is powerful because treasuries often need flexibility. They may want yield but also need to cover expenses or seize an opportunity on short notice. Liquid staking gives them both: productive assets and working capital. In Europe, liquid staking products have already been wrapped into regulated funds and exchange-traded products, allowing family offices and corporates to adopt the strategy without losing liquidity. Examples include Lido’s stETH and Rocket Pool’s rETH, which give holders a token they can move freely while still earning staking rewards. European adoption shows that liquid staking is not theory but an established practice that provides a roadmap for U.S. institutions. This matters well beyond Fortune 500 CFOs. A local business with extra reserves could stake a small amount of ETH to earn yield, much like putting idle cash to work in a savings account. A nonprofit could hold a fraction of its treasury in Ethereum ETFs to diversify beyond cash and bonds. Everyday investors could treat ETH staking like a higher-yield alternative to a bank account, understanding that the risks are different but the principle is similar — turning savings into income. Paul Frambot, CEO and co-founder of Morpho, the second largest lending protocol, emphasizes why risk safeguards are central here. “For institutions to adopt ETH treasuries at scale, they need the same credit and liquidity safeguards they expect in traditional finance. We are already seeing fintechs use DeFi lending as infrastructure, and corporate treasuries are following the same path. The difference is that Ethereum gives them programmable and transparent rails.” Institutions are beginning to establish a treasury playbook for Ethereum. Sam MacPherson, CEO of Phoenix Labs and core contributor behind Spark, explains the two most important sources of yield in practice. “When it comes to ETH, most of the fundamental yield comes from staking. I expect that actually to expand as more use cases in crypto come. Then there are onchain crypto lending markets such as SparkLend. These are people who are borrowing stablecoins. They have some ETH or Bitcoin, and want more exposure to the asset. So they’ll borrow stablecoins on an onchain market, and lever up that way, and they’re usually willing to pay a premium on top of the more base rate in TradFi.” These playbooks are not just about squeezing out returns. They point to a deeper shift in how companies treat digital assets. ETH is not simply something to hold on the side of the balance sheet. It is becoming a productive working asset. For investors, that means ETH is starting to look less like a speculative token and more like a hybrid between a growth stock and a bond — combining upside with regular yield. For businesses, it means treasury management is evolving. Where once the choice was between cash, bonds, or equities, ETH now represents a new category. Kean Gilbert, Head of Institutional Relations at the Lido Ecosystem Foundation, highlights this rotation. “Institutional money is rotating into Ethereum because ETH is both productive and liquid. That is a major change from Bitcoin reserves. This is not just holding crypto, it is re-engineering corporate digital asset strategy around programmable yield.” Several hurdles still need to be addressed. Risk management remains central, from validator penalties to smart contract exploits. Liquidity versus lockup is a real tradeoff, since staking yields require time commitments and occasional withdrawal delays. Liquid staking reduces this friction, but it still introduces complexity and counterparty risk. Regulation adds another layer of uncertainty. The SEC has raised questions about whether staking counts as a securities offering, while Europe has taken a more favorable approach with Ethereum ETFs and liquid staking products. Finally, governance questions remain: who decides how ETH treasuries are deployed, the CFO, the board, or specialized committees? Ethereum treasuries are becoming the next big business strategy. ETH serves a dual role: a strategic reserve asset and a yield-bearing instrument. That combination is powerful. In the coming years, we may see treasuries managed like corporate bond portfolios, balancing staking, lending, liquid staking, and ETF exposure. Platforms such as Lido, Spark, and Morpho may emerge as the BlackRock or Fidelity equivalents of Ethereum treasuries, building the rails that allow adoption at scale. More broadly, Ethereum is evolving into the financial operating system for balance sheets — from global corporations to local businesses to everyday investors. Ethereum treasuries are not simply digital reserves. They represent a new kind of financial strategy: programmable, productive, and accessible. The question is no longer whether ETH belongs in a portfolio, but how much, and how to manage it responsibly at scale. Ethereum treasuries will impact the markets.

By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) BTC$109,621.01 rebounded from Asian session lows of $111,000 to $112,800, repeating a pattern seen on Tuesday. However, the token remains below its 50- and 100-day simple moving averages (SMAs), with liquidity analysis and retail crowd sentiment signaling a potential for a deeper pullback. The CoinDesk 20 Index was down 0.7% over the past 24 hours, standing at 4,027. Two notable developments have emerged. The competition between on-chain decentralized exchanges Hyperliquid and Aster has intensified, with Aster surpassing Hyperliquid in daily revenue. According to DefiLlama, Aster generated $7.2 million in revenue in the past 24 hours compared to Hyperliquid’s $2.79 million. This divergence is also reflected in their native tokens: ASTR’s market cap has soared from $931 million to $3.74 billion in seven days, while HYPE’s market cap has dropped from $14.88 billion to $11.73 billion. ASTR has surged 37% over 24 hours, the best performance among the top 100 tokens by market cap, whereas HYPE ranked among the worst performers. In recent months, Hyperliquid has lost market share to competitors like Aster and Lighter, making this an area investors should watch closely. Meanwhile, data from CryptoRank shows Solana’s launchpad activity has sharply declined, with combined volume hitting a four-month low of $117 million. Active wallets have fallen below 100,000, and daily token project graduates – projects that have successfully completed their initial fundraising or token sale phases and moved on to public trading – have dropped to just 88, indicating reduced user engagement and fewer new launches. Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca, challenged the idea of a broad crypto bull market, emphasizing that the 2025 rally is narrow and selective, focused on certain coins backed by exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and digital asset trusts (DATs) such as BTC, ETH, and SOL. In traditional markets, the U.S. dollar rose 0.4%, likely influenced by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s cautious remarks on rate cuts earlier in the week. Nasdaq futures showed gains, offering risk-on cues to the crypto market. Stay alert!

Title: 3 Ways Companies Can Support Working Mothers Facing Rigid RTO Mandates

ByLiz Elting, Contributor. Juggling family and work responsibilities remains a constant challenge for many working parents, especially mothers. According to FlexJobs’ Working Parents Report, half of U.S. professionals say working mothers face higher standards than working fathers, while only 17% say the reverse. The report also found that more than half of working women feel they shoulder the most responsibilities at both work and home, and that more than half of working parents downplay caregiving duties to their employer to appear more committed. What’s more, recent return-to-office mandates implemented this year by companies like JPMorgan, Amazon and AT&T may further undermine work-life balance and gender equity for working parents, particularly for working mothers with young children who often rely on flexible work options to help balance work and family responsibilities. According to research from The Hamilton Project, an economic policy initiative at the Brookings Institution, one-third of prime-age women (ages 25 to 54) with children under five telework, and both mothers and fathers with young children are more likely to work remotely than other adults. Meanwhile, Flex Index’s Q3 2025 Flex Report found that nearly half of Fortune 100 companies now require in-office work four to five days a week, and the Federal Reserve’s latest Beige Book notes that many firms are using RTO mandates to reduce headcount in place of formal layoffs. Thus, it may not come as a surprise that, as RTO mandates took effect this year, labor force participation among mothers of young children saw the steepest 6-month decline in over 40 years, dropping three percentage points between January and June 2025, according to data from the Care Board at the University of Kansas. As RTO mandates make it increasingly difficult for many mothers to remain in the workforce, companies should consider taking concrete steps to create more equitable workplaces for parents. As companies roll out company-wide RTO mandates, it’s critical that they recognize how these mandates can disproportionately impact working parents, especially mothers, who often rely on flexibility to balance caregiving responsibilities. Without flexible options, strict in-office requirements risk pushing talent out of the workforce or forcing parents to choose between prioritizing work and family. To counter this, companies should consider offering flexible work options to employees who would benefit most from them, such as working parents. According to FlexJobs’ report, 72% of working parents say flexible hours would better support them, and 65% believe remote or hybrid work would help them in their roles. FlexJobs author Kirsten Chorpenning describes flexible work as an “essential tool” that enables parents to stay in the workforce and grow in their careers, rather than stepping back due to inflexible demands. And as I previously reported, in addition to more flexible workplace policies, interim executive and fractional leadership positions also offer working mothers the ability to work temporarily or part-time without having to forego leadership roles and career advancement. By embedding flexibility into workplaces, even within the framework of broader RTO plans, companies can reduce the negative impact those mandates can have on working parents and foster a more inclusive and supportive workplace that benefits everyone. After all, research shows that employees perform better when work/life balance is properly supported. As companies enforce RTO mandates, many working mothers are forced into difficult decisions between their families and their careers, and with rising childcare costs, many of those who don’t want to give up their careers are left with few options. Consequently, women who would have otherwise chosen to continue working are exiting the workforce to meet caregiving demands. According to Care.com’s 2025 Cost of Care Report, the average cost of childcare (including nannies, daycares and family care centers) now consumes 22% of household income, making the shift back to in-office work not just a logistical burden, but a financial one as well. FlexJobs’ findings reinforce this reality, with nearly half of U.S. professionals saying they would more likely stay in a role that offered employer-sponsored childcare. Providing subsidized childcare is another vital way for employers to support working parents, helping to reduce financial strains and potentially improve retention among working parents. In fact, Care.com’s report found that 79% of parents believe employers can reduce childcare expenses through subsidizing the cost of caregiving. Ultimately, when companies invest in employer-sponsored childcare, they’re more likely to foster a more equitable workforce as RTO mandates take effect. This in turn benefits employers, who see greater employee retention, morale and performance. Companies should also consider implementing active-listening strategies that encourage open dialogue between leadership and employees. This includes regular one-on-one meetings to better understand each employee’s individual needs and build stronger connections, as well as frequent surveys to gather feedback. These tactics can help leaders understand specific benefits their teams are seeking. They may also provide insight into the unique challenges their employees are facing and what can be done to support them in doing their best work. Improving communication within work teams can also help companies avoid broad, one-size-fits-all approaches that rarely work for everyone. For example, as previously reported, remote work can sometimes hinder rather than help women’s careers, since women often receive higher pay raises and more mentorship opportunities when they are physically present with coworkers. Therefore, while remote work might benefit some working mothers, it could also limit a woman just entering the workforce by reducing opportunities for guidance and career development. This underscores the importance of listening to and communicating with employees and offering flexible solutions so that each employee can perform at their best. It enables employers to understand what is and isn’t working for each individual, rather than applying blanket approaches that can hinder productivity, such as company-wide RTO mandates. Prioritizing individual employee needs doesn’t only benefit employees, it improves business outcomes. According to Future Forward Institute’s report titled The Competitive Advantage of the Win-Win Workplace, companies that invest in employee-focused benefits and work environments tend to achieve higher profitability. Despite recent setbacks, the long-term trend of more working mothers joining the labor force remains strong. Per the Care Board’s data, labor force participation among mothers of young children has risen from 58.9% in 1989 to 68.2% in 2025, marking decades of progress in workplace inclusion and gender equity. If companies choose to support working mothers now, this backslide will simply be a temporary stumble rather than a longer-lasting fall. By embracing responsive, flexible and supportive workplace practices, employers can help ensure that progress for all working parents continues to build rather than unravels.

Title: Amazon’s fall hardware event: 5 Echo devices due for an upgrade

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. After skipping last year, Amazon is back with a big fall hardware event slated for next week, and we’re expecting plenty of new Echo smart speakers and displays that make the most of Alexa+, Amazon’s AI revamp of the Alexa voice assistant. Plenty of other hardware will also be unwrapped during Amazon’s September 30 event in New York City; for example, we’re sure to see new Kindle tablets, as well as Fire TV models and perhaps even some Ring cameras. For now, though, we’re concentrating on new Echo devices, and there are a few popular Echo speakers and displays that are ripe for an upgrade. We’re most interested in how the latest Echo hardware will take full advantage of Alexa+, the generative AI-enhanced Alexa that can carry on flowing conversations, take actions on your behalf, and control smart home devices based on natural-language commands. (It’s worth noting that most existing Echo speakers and displays already are compatible with Alexa+, so there’s no pressing need to upgrade if you don’t want to.) There haven’t been many leaks or rumors about specific new Echo devices we might see next week. That said, we do have a bead on some older but nonetheless popular Echo speakers and displays that are in dire need of a refresh. What is it: Amazon’s flagship Echo speaker that doubles as a smart home hub Latest release: 2020 (fourth generation) List price: $99.99 Michael Brown/Foundry It’s been nearly five years since Amazon released a new version of its top-of-the-line Echo, making it the oldest speaker in Amazon’s current Echo lineup. It’s high time for a new one. A larger version of the popular and inexpensive Echo Dot, the Amazon Echo shares many of the Dot’s features, including motion detection, a temperature sensor, and the ability to extend the range of Amazon’s line of Eero mesh Wi-Fi routers. The Echo also houses stereo tweeters and a three-inch woofer, making for a nice upgrade to the Echo Dot’s so-so audio performance. But the Echo has an ace up its sleeve: a full-on Zigbee home hub, capable of directly controlling Zigbee lights, sensors, switches, and other Zigbee-enabled devices. The Echo also packs a Thread radio, allowing it to act as a Thread border router. Plunk an Echo in your living room, and you have everything you need to launch your smart home—well, aside from a Z-Wave radio, which would be a cool feature for an updated Echo. (We’re not holding on breath on that one, as Z-Wave is not embraced by the Matter standard.) An all-new Echo would seem like a no-brainer for Amazon’s hardware event next week, complete with beefier hardware for smoother Alexa+ performance and perhaps even a physical makeover. What it is: Amazon’s budget-priced Echo workhorse Latest release: 2022 (fifth generation) List price: $49.99 Ben Patterson/Foundry If the Echo is Amazon’s flagship smart speaker, the Echo Dot is its smaller sibling, shedding the Zigbee smart hub but keeping the motion and temperature sensors as well as the Eero mesh extender functionality. Priced at $50 but often on sale for much less, the Echo Dot is a smart choice for putting Alexa in every room, what with its handsome design and good-enough audio performance. There are now cheaper Echos in Amazon’s lineup—see the $40 Echo Pop from 2023—but the Echo Dot hits the sweet spot in terms of price and performance. Now that it’s due to celebrate its third birthday, the Echo Dot is primed for a new Alexa+-enhanced version. I could see it sharing the same overall design as the new Echo—smaller form factor, of course—with a modest audio upgrade and even a Thread border router functionality, which would allow the Dot to act as a hub for Matter devices. What it is: A premium Echo speaker that does Dolby Atmos Latest release: 2023 (second generation) List price: $199.99 (no longer available) Amazon If you want an Amazon Echo speaker that can truly put on a sonic show, the Dolby Atmos-enabled Echo Studio is the obvious choice—if you can find one, that is. The second-generation Echo Studio has been out of stock for months now, making it a prime candidate for a makeover. Packing three two-inch mid-range speakers, a 20mm tweeter, and a 5.25-inch woofer, the Echo Studio has all the drivers its needs to belt out audiophile-quality sound. The Echo Studio isn’t just a great music speaker, though. Like the Echo, it offers a Zigbee home hub and a Matter hub. An upgraded version of the Studio with Alexa+ playing DJ could be a highlight of Amazon’s hardware event next week. What it is: An Echo display with a pivoting screen that follows you around the room Latest release: 2021 (third generation) List price: $249.99 (no longer available) Michael Brown/Foundry Hard to believe, but it’s been four years since the Echo Show 10 made its debut, and boy was it a showstopper. Yes, the Echo Show 10 boasts such smart home features as a Zigbee hub and a Thread border router (the unit’s Matter-over-Thread abilities were enabled after launch), 2.1-channel audio, a 13-megapixel camera, and an impressive 10-inch screen. But its killer feature was its swiveling display, which could follow you as you strolled around the room. That rotating display made the Echo Show 10 feel like the most aware Echo device yet, so just imagine how that would play with Alexa+ on board, looking out into your kitchen and making suggestions as you prepare a gourmet meal. Sure, Alexa+ can already work on the existing third-gen Echo Show 10, but we’re eager to see a new take on that motorized design. As with the Echo Studio, the Echo Show 10 has been unavailable via Amazon for some time, leading us to believe that a fourth generation of the display is imminent. What is it: Amazon’s Alexa-powered smart glasses Latest release: 2023 (third generation) List price: Varies depending upon style Ben Patterson/Foundry With the likes of Meta’s camera-enabled AI glasses on the scene, Amazon’s audio-only Echo Frames are looking decidedly old hat these days. First announced back in 2019, the Echo Frames came with a handsome design and mini speakers and microphones in the temples that promised to put Alexa in your head. The most recent release from 2023 offered updated looks and plenty of audio refinements, and the Frames are now compatible with Alexa+. Still, the basic conceit and limitations remain: it’s Alexa (or Alexa+) in your head, and only in your head. Meta, meanwhile, has supercharged the market for smart glasses that allow an AI companion to see the world around you, offering commentary and insights wherever you go (even if the results are a tad uneven). Will Amazon take the fight to Meta with vision-enabled Echo Frames with Alexa+? It’s a bit of a long shot, but I’m not ruling it out.

Silicon Valley isn't the only industry reeling from President Donald Trump's plans to charge companies hiring skilled foreign workers $100,000 for visas. Wall Street banks and other financial firms have long used the H-1B visa program to fill an array of roles, from computer programmers to traders and even investment bankers.Trump's executive order, signed late Friday, "caught everyone off guard," JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said on CNBC while in Mumbai, India, this week. In order to visualize the potential impact on the financial industry, Business Insider turned to publicly available data from the Department of Labor and the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The data covers H-1B application data for the first three quarters of the government fiscal year 2025, as well as the less-common H-1B1 and E-3 visas, from October of 2024 to the end of June this year. We studied certified visa applications during this time period to highlight the biggest financial industry users of the visa program. The data does not reflect the total number of H-1B employees at any given firm, but it provides helpful context on immigrant labor demands. The data shows that some of the largest financial employers heavily rely on this visa to fill a range of roles, especially technology roles. Major banks like Chase and Goldman Sachs dominate the list alongside major payments companies like American Express. Asset managers like BlackRock and Vanguard, and research and ratings agency Moody's, help to round it out. Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and Citigroup declined to comment. The others did not respond to a request for comment from BI. Certified applications: 2,440 Employees worldwide: 317,160 as of the second quarter of 2025 The country's largest bank focused its H-1B hiring heavily on technologists, with more than 500 certified applications for vice president, lead software engineer, and associate software engineer III positions. The bank also filed visa applications for the firm's main business lines, such as an investment banking managing director. Certified applications: 1,575 Employees worldwide: Over 78,000 per its website Fidelity submitted a wide range of applications for technical roles, with 40 certified applications for full-stack engineering directors and 125 for full-stack engineering principals. Non-technical roles included a director of marketing. Certified applications: 1,280 Employees worldwide: 45,900 as of the second quarter of 2025 Not all of Goldman Sachs' certified applications specified the role, focusing instead on the level of hire, such as an associate. The data, however, does show a wide range of technologist hires and financial hires, including many vice president-level banking roles. Certified applications: 921 Employees worldwide: 75,100 as of the end of 2024 American Express's certified applications were largely for technologist roles, with more than 125 for"engineer" roles. Business Insider also found applications for non-technical roles, including director-level applications for risk management, communications, and controller. Certified applications: 874 Employees worldwide: 229,000 as of the end of 2024 Citi's certified applications also largely focused on technology roles, including more than 150 certified applications for "Application Development Technical Lead Analyst" roles. Certified applications: 871 Employees worldwide: 76,500 as of the second quarter of 2025 Like others on this list, Capital One's certified applications largely focused on technology and data roles. The data showed hundreds of applications for data science and analysis roles, as well as some less technical roles like "business manager." Certified applications: 770 Employees worldwide: 31,600 as of the end of 2024 Visa is yet another company largely focused on tech and data hires. Some non-technical roles include compensation business analysts, senior financial analysts, and managers. Certified applications: 718 Employees worldwide: 213,000 as of the second quarter of 2025 Bank of America also focused its applications on tech hiring. Their most common role on the list, a vice president-level software engineer III, could be found on over 100 applications. Certified applications: 673 Employees worldwide: 80,000 as of the first quarter of 2025 Morgan Stanley's data only showed the level of roles it was hiring for, so we cannot analyze what kinds of jobs its looking to fill. However, we can see that they have applied for vice president-level roles the most, followed by associates and then directors. Certified applications: 624 Employees worldwide: More than 70,000 per their company website US Bank is yet another bank that largely uses H-1B visas for for technology roles, such as senior software engineer. There are other financial roles though, like tax accountant, underwriter, and project manager for the firm's impact finance, focused on affordable housing. Certified applications: 457 Employees worldwide: 92,900 as of the end of 2024 The British bank's US visa hiring is also largely focused on technology. Some front-office hires included an equities derivatives trader and an equities "exotic" trader. Certified applications: 434 Employees worldwide: 32,600 per the firm's website Charles Schwab is also using H-1B visa to hire tech talent, with the data showing nearly 50 software development and engineering senior manager roles and nearly 100 software development and engineering manager hires. We were unable to find a single role that didn't appear to be related to technology. Certified applications: 391 Employees worldwide: 217,000 at the end of 2024 Wells Fargo joins the ranks of financial firms largely focused on technological hires in its H-1B visa applications. The data also showed certified applications for roles like lead securities trader and strategy and planning director. Certified applications: 339 Employees worldwide: 110,323 as of the end of 2024 UBS had certified applications for a slew of tech and financial roles. On the financial side, it has applied for roles like investment banking analyst and associate, the entry-level role to a banking career, as well as an associate director of global markets FX trading. Certified applications: 294 Employees worldwide: Approximately 22,000 per the firm's website. Like Morgan Stanley, BlackRock only provides the level of roles hired. The bulk of roles culled by Business Insider were at the associate or vice president level, though there are also more than 20 director-level applications. Certified applications: 213 Employees worldwide: Approximately 53,000 as of the first quarter of 2025 State Street's visa applications were largely focused on technology hires, though financial roles were also on the menu. Non-financial roles included applications for a head of internal liquidity stress testing in treasury and a global head of liquidity risk oversight. Certified applications: 209 Employees worldwide: Approximately 20,000 per the firm's website as of the end of 2024 A large chunk of Vanguard's applications were for application engineering and other technical roles. The asset management firm also had applications for a fixed-income trader, a head of wealth management and advice, and a head of fraud, strategy, and analytics. Certified applications: 199 Employees worldwide: 15,838 at the end of 2024 The ratings and research powerhouse joins the rest on the list with a focus on technologists. Senior software engineers and staff software engineers lead the way in certified applications. Some non-technical applications included a director-level sales manager, a credit associate, and a commercial real estate researcher. Certified applications: 185 Employees worldwide: 38,335 as of the end of 2024 Software engineering roles made up roughly half of Truist's applications reviewed by Business Insider. Most other roles were tech-focused, such as a senior data analyst in liquidity and regulatory reporting, though there were some rare non-tech roles, such as Treasury market and liquidity risk officer. Certified applications: 144 Employees worldwide: 21,000 as of the end of 2024 Discover joins the ranks of others on this list with roughly 100 applications mentioning data science. Other interesting technical roles included a lead robotic process automation analyst. Jump to

Title: Erdogan’s frustrations, Netanyahu and the opposition, what (and where) Geroulanos is shaking, Xenokostas and the Americans, the field cots ///

Hello, as of the time we were writing our daily news report, we did not yet have a definitive picture of whether the postponed meeting between Mitsotakis and Erdogan would take place, but generally speaking, there’s a Greek proverb about the …ship that’s late. Still, from what a government source said late last night, it doesn’t look good. So we know for certain that indeed the scheduled meeting yesterday evening at 9 (Greek time) was postponed for a real reason. Trump scheduled his meeting with the Arab countries at roughly the same time Mitsotakis was supposed to meet Erdogan (with half an hour’s difference), so of course the Turk wouldn’t ditch that meeting for the Greek Prime Minister. In the end, however, the American President’s meeting with the Arab leaders was delayed by about an hour and a half, which meant both Erdogan and Trump slotted in other meetings in the meantime. But we also know just as well that if Erdogan couldn’t “find”… half an hour today in his schedule for this meeting, it simply means the Turk never wanted it to happen in the first place. Not good, but of course not …the end of the world if the Turk doesn’t want to meet the Greek. And in that sense, the opposition’s reaction, just half an hour after the postponement was announced and before they even knew that the meeting was definitively off, is beyond words. Or rather, it’s a disgrace for the country that only a few minutes later Greek parties attack the Greek Prime Minister because the Turk canceled on him. Honestly, I don’t believe public opinion would have expected such an “instant” reaction from the opposition (from PASOK to Velopoulos) in order to applaud them — given one small detail: let’s not forget, we’re talking about a Greek and a Turk.

Title: Engagement-based advertising models are coming for AI

Frank - stock.adobe.com When Alphabet reported a 14% spike in second-quarter revenue this year, Google’s boss rushed to praise the role of artificial intelligence (AI). The technology is “positively impacting every part of the business”, said CEO Sundar Pichai. But that isn’t the reality for most firms. What’s more, the AI investment market is veering deeper into bubble territory. Torsten Sløk, the chief economist at Apollo Global Management, has warned that tech giants are staring at a brutal reckoning on Wall Street. “The difference between the IT bubble in the 1990s and the AI bubble today is that the top 10 companies in the S&P 500 today are more overvalued than they were in the 1990s,” he wrote to clients this summer, invoking the lead-up to the ruinous dot com crash. That market correction destroyed a generation of companies and erased $5tn in share value – roughly equal to $9.3tn today. Others are more blunt. “I am not here to belittle AI, it’s the future, and I recognise that we’re just scratching the surface in terms of what it can do,” the chief of hedge fund Praetorian Capital has written about the hazy economics of data centres. “I also recognise massive capital misallocation when I see it. I recognise insanity, I recognise hubris.” The grand payoff from generative AI (GenAI) is proving especially elusive. A study published by MIT in August suggests only 5% of businesses using it have seen rapid revenue acceleration. Still, the tech industry is notching up imperfect progress in models’ capabilities. And personal use of AI by consumers is steadily growing. Executives are thus roaring ahead with their mammoth spending plans. Even without a clear path to profitability, leading US tech companies plan to drop a staggering $344bn into AI this year. That figure will reportedly rise to half a trillion dollars in 2026. “As long as we’re on this very distinct curve of the model getting better and better, I think the rational thing to do is to just be willing to run the loss for quite a while,” said OpenAI CEO Sam Altman the day after his organisation released GPT-5. OpenAI’s own projections show it’s expected to burn through $115bn by the end of 2029. “None of this means that AI can’t eventually be as transformative as its biggest boosters claim,” points out business writer Rogé Karma. “But ‘eventually’ could turn out to be a long time.” And tech companies’ meteoric valuations can’t defy economic gravity forever. A foolproof way then to bankroll themselves within the attention economy is for tech companies to infuse advertising into models’ outputs. Indeed, some firms are already experimenting with the concept as they jockey to win the most costly industrial competition in history. The expansion of digital advertising is not an intrinsically bad thing. Done transparently and within clear guidelines, ads function as a beneficial form of free expression. They can also democratise consumer choice, drive innovation and spur competition within markets. Yet Meta’s recent decision to abandon its moratorium on advertising in WhatsApp is a possible harbinger of things to come. Meta resisted introducing ads into WhatsApp for over a decade after acquiring the app in 2014. Its ad-free experience, after all, was key to it becoming the world’s most popular messaging service. But that all changed earlier this year. Seeking to bolster Meta’s war chest in the AI arms race, CEO Mark Zuckerberg lifted the ban in June. Markets instantly rewarded his decision with a 2.5% bump in Meta’s stock price. Meta says ads on WhatsApp will not interrupt chats. Plus, users’ personal information won’t be given to advertisers. Yet Meta’s policy U-turn is a reminder that even the world’s tech juggernauts are beholden to market sentiments. “If you look at the trajectory of Google and Microsoft, it’s not a matter of ‘if’ ads end up in AI outputs, but how quickly and how deeply they get embedded,” says Adio Dinika, a researcher at the Distributed AI Research Institute (DAIR). “The driver isn’t user benefit; it’s the survival of an ad-tech business model that has monopolised the internet for two decades.” Others concur. “This shouldn’t be surprising,” says Daniel Barcay, executive director of the Center for Humane Technology, pointing to the evolutionary arc of social media. “The industry is moving from a phase of explosive expansion and onboarding to a phase of more zero-sum competition between AI platforms. “We see this pattern over and over again,” he says, “precisely because the aggregate value of a technology product is far greater than the user subscriptions – as soon as growth slows, the race for monetisation becomes more vicious and more hidden.” Elsewhere, a recently leaked memo from Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei confirms how easily ideals can be hollowed out. He and six of his colleagues founded Anthropic in 2021 after leaving OpenAI over concerns the latter was straying from its stated mission to develop safe, human-centred systems. Amodei even wrote last autumn that “AI-powered authoritarianism seems too terrible to contemplate”. However, in a Slack message sent by Amodei to his staff in July 2025, he justified the company courting investment money from “dictators” in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar to remain a leader in AI. “This is a real downside and I’m not thrilled about it,” wrote Amodei. “Unfortunately, I think ‘No bad person should ever benefit from our success’ is a pretty difficult principle to run a business on.” Citing the need for a “steady and scalable” revenue stream, Perplexity last November introduced ads into its AI-powered search results as prompts for sponsored follow-up questions. Google likewise began inserting sponsored content into its AI Overviews this past May. The search giant cites internal data that it claims shows users appreciate this because it helps them swiftly connect with relevant businesses, products and services. Yet chatbots are even better at accruing what brands and advertisers seek most: intimacy and trust. In his book Nexus, which explores how AI could radically reshape human information networks, historian Yuval Noah Harari invokes the unnerving example of former Google engineer Blake Lemoine. In mid-2022, Lemoine became convinced the chatbot he was working on, LaMDA, had become conscious, and it genuinely feared being disconnected. Lemoine was fired after going public with his feelings. In the contest for hearts and minds, Harari writes, intimacy is a powerful weapon. “By conversing and interacting with us, computers could form intimate relationships with people and then use the power of intimacy to influence us,” he warns. This is already evident in the new phenomenon of so-called AI psychosis. The number of users caught in grandiose delusions of chatbots sending them on secret missions or forging connections with spiritual beings is skyrocketing. An even higher number are developing friendships and romantic entanglements. Too often, these scenarios end tragically. In early August, OpenAI’s release of GPT-5 – which amalgamates the company’s prior model iterations under one program – angered hardcore ChatGPT users who had built a personal attachment to GPT-4o. The earlier model was widely criticised, including by Sam Altman himself, as being sycophantic. “Even after customising instructions, it still doesn’t feel the same,” one Reddit user said about GPT-5 in a now-deleted post. “It’s more technical, more generalised, and honestly feels emotionally distant.” Another Reddit post reads: “For a lot of people, 4.0 [sic] was the first thing that actually listened … It responded with presence. It remembered. It felt like talking to someone who cared.” OpenAI quickly reversed course after the backlash, enabling paid users to now self-select GPT-4o as their default version. This addictive hold that AI systems have over some users mirrors the toxic legacy of algorithmic targeting of content on social media platforms. And yet it also has the potential to go much further. “The intimacy of conversational AI creates unprecedented vectors for exploitation, systems that know your sleep patterns, your relationship anxieties, your financial stress, your health fears,” says Dinika, the AI researcher. “When those vulnerabilities become targeting parameters for advertisers, we’re not talking about so-called ‘relevant ads’ – we’re talking about weaponised psychology at scale.” Indeed, AI ads can and will do far more than just inject links into text streams, predicts Barcay, from the Center for Humane Technology. “AI ad systems can subtly shift the tone, language and content of a conversation to elevate the prominence of products, industries, cultural figures or political parties. They can steer discussions with users towards or away from topics, amplify desires, invoke associations.” This could be aggravated further in a future when conversant humanoid robots take up the roles of assistants, educators and caregivers. But policymakers still have a window to act. This is pertinent given how US courts have ordered Google to share search data with its rivals, liberating all kinds of new material for AI developers to expedite their projects. “If policymakers have learned anything, it should be that disclosure has to be front and centre in the output itself, not buried,” says Dinika. He suggests placing strict limits on using conversational data for targeting while prohibiting advertising in sensitive areas like health, immigration, or finance. AI’s immense capabilities and intimate access to consumers will also likely trigger deeper questions about the very nature of the advertising industry itself. “I imagine that many legal battles will be fought in this area in the years to come about what defines the limits of an ad,” says Barcay. This might encompass “what denotes proper disclosure, what aspects of a user’s interaction are fair game to be used, and what reinforcement signals can be used to tune a model towards persuasive salesman-like behaviours”. Ultimately, regulators should get in front of AI advertising before any nascent problems grow too big to handle, advises Bloomberg tech columnist Parmy Olson, who argues that tech companies will inevitably claim that advertising is a necessary part of democratising AI. If not, she says, “we’ll repeat the mistakes made with social media – scrutinising the fallout of a lucrative business model only after the damage is done”.

The valuation would cast the issuer of USDT, the world's largest stablecoin, into the ranks of artificial intelligence developer OpenAI and Elon Musk's space transport company SpaceX, which received similar valuations. El Salvador-based Tether is aiming to raise $15-$20 billion for an approximate 3% stake, Bloomberg reported, although an additional source said that the range was a goal and could be much lower. The sources said discussions were in the initial stages and that the deal could change. The announcement is the latest evidence of the rising significance of stablecoins, a result of the friendlier political and regulatory environment in the U.S. under the Trump administration, including the Genius Act greenlighting the issuance and trading of stablecoins. During a White House visit in July shortly before the passage of the legislation, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino, told Decrypt of the firm's plans to create USAT, a U.S.-specific stablecoin catering to different use cases than USDT, the company’s flagship stablecoin. In September, the company named Bo Hines, former executive director of the White House’s digital assets working group, to serve as USAT's CEO. Earlier in the summer, stablecoin rival Circle listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock's debut outpaced those of tech behemoths Meta, Robinhood, and Airbnb, nearly quadrupling its initial offer price of $31. The company currently has a valuation above $30 billion, according to Yahoo Finance data. Tether has a market cap of $172 billion, more than double Circle's $74 billion value, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. On Tuesday at a conference in Seoul, Hines said during an interview that Tether has no plans to raise money, Bloomberg reported. The deal would involve new shares, not current investors selling their equity. Investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald is serving as the lead adviser. In recent weeks, potential investors have received access to a data room as they consider their participation, the publication reported, which added that a deal is expected to close by year's end. According to its own attestation in July, Tether issued $20 billion in USDT through the first six months of the year and generated a net profit of $5.7 billion over this period, including $4.9 billion in its second quarter alone. The firm counts Bitcoin and gold among its holdings.

Title: Why Micron's Record Sales and Strong Outlook Are a Bullish Signal for the AI Trade

Micron Technology (MU) shares climbed in extended trading Tuesday after the memory chip maker posted record quarterly sales, boosted by surging demand for AI hardware. The Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) partner's shares were up over 2% in after-hours trading. They've nearly doubled in value in 2025 through Tuesday's close. The memory chip maker reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.03 on revenue that jumped 46% year-over-year to a record $11.32 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter. Both figures topped analysts' estimates compiled by Visible Alpha as Micron's data center business grew. As a memory supplier for leading artificial intelligence chipmakers like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, Micron stands to benefit from the same trends and its results can be taken as a positive sign for the AI trade. “In fiscal 2025, we achieved all-time highs across our data center business and are entering fiscal 2026 with strong momentum and our most competitive portfolio to date. As the only U.S.-based memory manufacturer, Micron is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the AI opportunity ahead," said CEO Sanjay Mehrotra. Looking ahead, Micron said it expects adjusted earnings per share of $3.41 to $3.71 on revenue of $12.20 billion to $12.80 billion in the fiscal first quarter, ahead of consensus projections.

US stock market retreated today after hitting record highs recently, with the S&P 500 slipping 0.53% to around 6,658 and the Nasdaq falling nearly 1% amid a selloff in Nvidia shares. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also dipped 0.19%, closing near 46,293. Nvidia's shares dropped about 2.8% a day after announcing a $100 billion investment in OpenAI, which had initially boosted its stock and lifted the market. Micron Technology bucked the trend by jumping on strong fiscal fourth-quarter results that exceeded Wall Street expectations, driven by robust AI-related demand. Wall Street stepped back from record territory on Tuesday, as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that stocks are “fairly highly valued” and signaled caution on further rate cuts.

Title: Sustainability remains hot topic in corporate America

A series of random questions answered by Harvard experts. Low-carbon energy firm CEO says executives dialed in on climate change, pondering adjustments despite shifts in Washington Alvin Powell Harvard Staff Writer Joseph Dominguez (right), president and CEO of Constellation, with Nat Keohane, president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. Photos by Veasey Conway/Harvard Staff Photographer The current U.S. administration has de-emphasized many measures aimed at fighting climate change, but that hasn’t affected the conversation around sustainability among many business leaders, according to the chief executive of the nation’s largest provider of low-carbon energy. “We’re dealing with some of the largest clients on the planet. You’ve heard us announce deals with Meta, with Microsoft, and with others. I will tell you the conversation in the room has not changed,” said Joseph Dominguez, president and CEO of Constellation. Dominguez spoke Friday morning at Harvard Business School’s Klarman Hall at the Harvard Climate Symposium, part of Harvard Climate Action Week, which featured an array of climate-change-focused events across the University’s campuses. Dominguez said business executives are well aware of the significant climate shifts that are expected over the coming decades. The last time the climate rose between 6 degrees and 8 degrees Celsius, it took 8,000 years, he said. This time it’s expected by the end of the century, with some models predicting warming to be even higher. “If you’re a businessperson in this space, that’s got to tell you that 10 years from now this is going to be a much more difficult conversation, because not only are politics going to change but the environment — political and otherwise — is going to change,” he said. “It doesn’t matter who the president is. People are looking at business fundamentals and trying to predict the future environments. The bottom line is the president’s going to serve another three years, and then things are going to change again.” The Constellation executive said the current administration has shown some support for selected low-carbon energy sources. The Trump administration’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” cut credits for wind and solar but left them intact for geothermal, advanced nuclear, and battery storage. Dominguez predicted nuclear may be set up for a renaissance. While nuclear power lost support among the public and many politicians in recent decades, Republicans have consistently supported the industry. More recently, he said, some Democrats have softened their stance against nuclear because it is carbon-free. That makes nuclear, while not the first choice on either side of the aisle, the second choice of both. “Nuclear, ironically, after having been ignored for decades and, frankly, despised by some components of the Democratic Party, is now emerging as the consensus view on technology,” Dominguez said. “It’s the only thing that 100 percent of Democrats voted for and 100 percent of Republicans voted for.” The symposium, organized by the Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability, opened with comments from Harvard President Alan Garber and Salata Institute Faculty Director James Stock, Harvard’s vice provost for climate and sustainability. Stock said this is a pivotal moment for climate and energy, with energy demand rising rapidly, in part because of the demand from data centers and the rapid growth of artificial intelligence. And despite the current political environment, the rapid growth of low-carbon technology is a reason for optimism. “A key source of hope is the stunning progress on low-carbon energy technologies,” Stock said. “Over the past 15 years, prices on solar power, wind power, and batteries have plummeted,” he said. “EVs are rapidly approaching price parity with internal combustion engines, and, due in part to important work here at Harvard, new methods of detecting methane leaks have improved dramatically so oil and gas companies can sell their natural gas instead of leaking it to the atmosphere.” Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey said the work at Harvard is just part of her administration’s vision for the state’s future, which is to become a hub of climate technology. Key to that, she said, will be the continued development of jobs in the low-carbon energy sector. Healey has appointed a cabinet-level climate chief to oversee all the pieces needed to make that come about, including workforce development, K-12 education, higher education, transportation, and even housing. “The workforce is not just something that’s nice to have; it’s absolutely essential,” said Healey, who spoke at the Climate Symposium in discussion with Tracy Palandjian, Harvard Corporation fellow and founder of the nonprofit Social Finance. “For all the policy positions and laws passed, none of that does any good unless you’re able to actually implement and operationalize.” Massachusetts needs an estimated 34,000 green-energy workers, Palandjian said, to fill well-paying jobs in the trades that also have the prospect of growth. Palandjian outlined a program started by Social Finance that aims to boost community college graduation rates by providing funds for students to meet the everyday hurdles and expenses — such as transportation and childcare — that often lead them to break off their studies short of graduation. The fund would be repaid by students if they land well-paying jobs or by the students’ employers, on a voluntary basis, and then cycled back to a new generation of students. Healey praised the program, saying that kind of innovation will help a sector she believes remains a big part of the state’s future despite political headwinds. “We’re going to do this. We have to do this. Our economies depend on this,” Healey said. “We just try to put points on the board and keep moving forward as best as we can.” Designation comes as Harvard’s decadeslong archaeological dig uncovers new secrets from remains of ancient Turkish city In podcast, experts discuss why learning to love to read again may be key to reversing trend New data-based study debunks long-held notion, finds wide opportunity gaps remain Geneticist explains recent analyses made possible by tech advances show human history to be one of mixing, movement, displacement 7 min read Yet federal funding cuts have put next chapter of David Reich’s work in doubt 3 min read In Ed School panel, Howard Gardner says tech could make ‘most cognitive aspects of mind’ optional for humans 4 min read A series of random questions answered by Harvard experts.

DALLAS — A contractor for Amazon Logistics plans to lay off more than 200 workers at two facilities in North Texas, according to filings with the state. Accelore Group, which is contracted by Amazon Logistics for package delivery services, plans to cut 214 jobs at two Amazon Logistics facilities -- one in the 3700 block of San Jacinto Drive in Fort Worth and one in the 12800 block of Eastgate Drive in Mesquite -- by Nov. 1, according to a filing with the Texas Workforce Commission. The affected employees are primarily delivery associates, along with four dispatch managers, a fleet supervisor, an operations manager, a hiring manager and a helper, according to the filing. "All affected employees have been notified of their separation dates and that their separation from employment will be permanent," the letter, signed by Accelore Group CEO Akram Syed and filed with the Teas Workforce Commission, stated. An Amazon spokesperson said Accelore Group is exiting Amazon's delivery service partner program in which independent third-party groups, like Accelore Group, provide delivery drivers who deliver packages for Amazon. Our content partners at the Dallas Business Journal, which first reported the news of Accelore Group's planned layoffs, report that the program launched in 2018 and seeks to help entrepreneurs start delivery businesses. "Accelore Group is exiting the Amazon Delivery Service Partner program. We're actively working to help connect affected employees with other Delivery Service Partners in the Dallas-Forth Worth region who are currently hiring," Amazon said in a statement. Accelore Group was founded in 2003 in the Dallas area, according to their website. Amazon also ended contracts with two Philadelphia-area delivery partners, leading to nearly 150 jobs being cut, as the Dallas Business Journal reported. Amazon has invested about $70 billion in Texas since 2019 and has 49 fulfillment centers, 33 delivery stations and 36 Whole Foods locations in the state, according to the DBJ. Amazon reportedly recently bought 120 acres of land in Terrell, which is about 30 miles east of Dallas, for "the development of an international distribution center."

Title: Trump administration proposes overhauling H-1B visa process for higher-paid workers

Time Published: 2025-09-23T20:00:00Z
Full Content:
Profile news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time After announcing a new $100,000 fee on H-1B visas, the Trump administration on Tuesday proposed overhauling the visa’s lottery selection process to prioritize higher-paid and higher-skilled foreign employees. The proposed policy changes could reignite the debate over the use of foreign labor by U.S. employers. The move comes as President Donald Trump has taken aim at H-1B visas, a program used widely by Big Tech and outsourcing companies to hire foreign workers, announcing Friday that companies would be required to pay a $100,000 fee with new applications submitted after Sept. 21. The administration on Tuesday targeted H-1B visa allocation, proposing a “weighted selection process” for when annual demand for the visas tops the 85,000 limit set by Congress, which it says has happened every year for more than a decade. The new process would replace the current lottery system that determines who gets to apply for those limited visa spots in favor of putting more weight on higher skilled and higher paid foreign workers, according to a proposed rule set to be published in the Federal Register on Wednesday. Under the current lottery rules, offers to apply for an H-1B visa are assigned at random. The Trump administration’s proposal would assign prospective employees to four different wage bands, with workers in the highest wage category being entered into the selection pool four times and those in the lowest wage category being entered into the selection pool once. The Department of Homeland Security stated in the proposal that the weighted system would better serve the visa program’s original intent and "incentivize employers to offer higher wages or higher skilled positions to H-1B workers and disincentivize the existing widespread use of the H-1B program to fill lower paid or lower skilled positions.” It said the proposed selection process would still maintain opportunities for employers to hire H-1B workers at “all wage levels.” The H-1B visa program allows U.S. employers to temporarily hire skilled foreign workers in “specialty occupations” across health care, tech and finance industries, and other STEM-related fields. The two new proposed policies together send “a strong signal of the direction that the administration wants to go,” said Xiao Wang, CEO of Boundless Immigration, a company that offers services to people navigating the immigration process in the U.S. If adopted, the policies would benefit companies seeking to keep foreigners with specialized skills who studied at American universities in the U.S., as well as ensuring H-1B visas “disproportionately go to people who are deemed higher skilled, represented by higher wages and higher salary,” he said. Trump stated Friday that changes were needed in the visa system, saying it was designed to bring in temporary workers with “additive, high-skilled functions, but it has been deliberately exploited to replace, rather than supplement, American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labor.” For the last H-1B lottery round, which closed its registration in March, about 339,000 people applied. Of those, 120,141 applications were selected for the lottery, according to USCIS data. The proposal faces a 30-day public comment period before it is considered by the administration for a final rule, a process that could take months. If the changes are adopted, companies seeking to hire lower-wage workers from India and China for computer-related jobs appear likely to be among the most affected. For more than a decade, about 60% of H-1B workers approved every year have held computer-related jobs, according to Pew Research. Start-ups and smaller companies who cannot afford to pay their workers in the higher pay categories compared to major tech companies would also be impacted, Wang said. Deedy Das, a partner at Menlo Ventures venture capital group, said in a social media post that the latest proposal would hurt many tech companies. “Overall, it’s really bad for startups, early employees, helps IT consulting shops and can be easily gamed,“ Das wrote. Trump’s announcement of a new $100,000 fee on H-1B visas touched off a frenzy among current visa holders, the companies that employ them and countries around the world as they worked to understand the edict. Eventually, the White House clarified that it would be a one-time fee and apply only to new visa applicants. Trump said companies would have to pay the fee for new H-1B visa applications submitted after Sept. 21. That's a steep rise from current fees, which are usually $2,000 to about $5,000. Both the fee and Tuesday's proposal are likely to face challenges in court. A growing chorus on both the left and the right say an over-reliance on the visa by U.S. firms has put U.S.-born workers at a disadvantage. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has called the H-1B visa program a “scam,” while the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute has claimed that some of the companies most reliant on H-1B visas, such as Amazon and Facebook’s parent, Meta, have also had sizable layoffs, though it did not cite evidence that the use of the visa and the layoffs are related. In the first half of 2025, Amazon received approval for more than 12,000 H-1B visas, while Meta received more than 5,000. Representatives for both companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Daniella Silva is a national reporter for NBC News, focusing on immigration and education.

September 23, 2025 13:57 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Sept. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important September 30, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s growth potential. Notably, Novo Nordisk’s asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood that such patients would switch to Novo Nordisk’s branded alternatives. Further, defendants greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise, Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

HOUSTON — It's official: Big Pharma is landing in Houston. Eli Lilly and Co. (NYSE: LLY) confirmed Sept. 23 that the Bayou City will be part of its domestic manufacturing push. David Ricks, Lilly's CEO and chairman, joined Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to officially announce that the pharmaceutical giant will build a $6.5 billion manufacturing plant in the Generation Park development. That dollar figure is a significant bump from the $5.9 billion Lilly had indicated it would invest when the Indianapolis-based drugmaker filed an application for a tax abatement through Texas' Jobs, Energy, Technology and Innovation program earlier this year. In August, the Texas Comptroller's Office recommended Lilly's JETI application for approval, meaning the company just needed a final agreement with Abbott's office and Sheldon Independent School District, where the plant will be located.

But while Fold’s stock (Nasdaq: FLD) started off hot on the day, it quickly plunged. The Fold Bitcoin Credit Card will let users accumulate Bitcoin through everyday spending, offering up to 3.5% back on all purchases with no spending categories or deposit requirements, the company said. Users earn an unlimited 2% back instantly, plus up to 1.5% additional when paying through their Fold Checking Account. Enhanced rewards of up to 10% are available with major partners, including Amazon, Target, Home Depot, Uber, Starbucks, and hundreds of other brands. FLD opened at a price of $4.69 on Tuesday after closing at $3.88 on Monday. However, the buzz didn’t last, with the price plunging to $3.32 as of this writing, marking a more than 14% dip on the day. “Our credit card offers clear and compelling value and makes Bitcoin easily accessible to everyone,” said Fold founder, Chairman, and CEO Will Reeves, in a statement. “There are no categories to manage, no tokens to stake, no exchange account or balance requirements; just real Bitcoin, earned automatically with every purchase.” No timeline has been announced for the Fold credit card’s release. Stripe said that it has already processed over $3.1 billion in transaction volume and distributed more than $83 million in Bitcoin rewards. The company also holds 1,485 BTC in its treasury, worth about $167 million at present. Fold’s stock surged on Friday, roughly doubling in price and peaking above $7 per share amid speculation that veteran crypto industry investor Mike Alfred was joining the company. Instead, another publicly traded crypto company, Bakkt, announced Alfred’s appointment to its advisory board on Monday, prompting its own stock spike. Bakkt is up nearly another 18% so far on Tuesday, rising to $17.31 as of this writing. The price of FLD fell on Monday following the Bakkt appointment announcement, and has continued to fall on Tuesday. Even so, FLD remains up about 8% over the last week, though it’s down about 12% on the month. Bitcoin itself is roughly flat on the day at a current price of $112,774, but has fallen about 3% on the week. Myriad Markets users have recently turned bearish on the top cryptocurrency's chances of rising to $125,000—which would be a new all-time high mark—sooner than it can fall to $105,000. As of this writing, 53% of predictors expect it to hit the lower mark sooner than the higher price. That mark has grown substantially over the last week, rising from about 38% on September 16.

Title: The surprisingly lucrative business of making a list of 500 stocks

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) Richard Drew/AP/AP hide caption This comes from the Planet Money newsletter. Subscribe now to get more insights into how our economy works delivered to your inbox each week. Once a month, from 1989 to 2019, David Blitzer walked into a well-appointed conference room with a view of downtown Manhattan to discuss the 500 largest and most important public companies in the U.S., the ones whose stock just about any American can buy. Blitzer was a member of, and then chair of, the committee that makes the S&P 500. It's like the Billboard Hot 100, except instead of ranking the most popular songs in America, it lists the most valuable companies. Sabrina Carpenter wants to keep releasing pop anthems that keep her on the charts; Boeing wants to keep selling enough planes to stay in the S&P 500. The S&P 500 is famous. It's cited constantly in newspapers and on TV; it's the basis of millions of investing-for-retirement plans. Less well-known is that S&P Global, the company that makes the S&P 500 and that employed Blitzer, is itself on the S&P 500 list. One reason why is that S&P Global makes hundreds of millions of dollars every year in revenue just from the S&P 500. The company has other larger businesses, like rating bonds, but its indexing business is particularly lucrative and profitable. How do you profit wildly from a list of stocks that seemingly anyone could make? And why don't competitors erode those profits? Answering those questions requires a better understanding of the infrastructure behind Americans' go-to investing plan. It also shows how millions of Americans have, often unknowingly, bet their life savings on a few tech giants and the hundreds of billions of dollars they've invested in artificial intelligence. Loading... The S&P 500 is what's known as a stock market index, and its purpose is to be a barometer. Is the stock market up today? Was it down last week? Until the late 1800s, those were not easy questions to answer. But in 1896, financial journalists Charles Dow and Edward Jones created the Dow Jones index by averaging the share price of 12 large public companies. (It later expanded to 30 large stocks.) They used it to inform their columns and increase sales of their flagship paper, The Wall Street Journal. In 1957, S&P released a competitor: its now-iconic list of 500 stocks. At the time, it was a triumph of new technology. Tracking 500 stocks and updating the index took much more work and computing power, especially since S&P updated the index hourly, rather than just once per day. (Now it's updated constantly, in almost real time.) Also, the S&P 500 accounts for the size of each company and the number of shares. It was an improvement on the Dow Jones Industrial Average's price-weighted approach. In the Dow, companies with higher share prices have a larger impact on the index. So Goldman Sachs, whose share price is around $802, is much more important than Apple, whose share price is around $245.50. In contrast, the S&P 500 is weighted for market capitalization, the total amount invested in each company (the share price x number of shares outstanding). So if Netflix stock is up 1% and Apple is down 1%, that will nudge the S&P 500 down. Which makes sense! Way more people have way more money invested in Apple ($3.5 trillion) than Netflix (just over $500 billion). So, overall, investors had a down day. The S&P 500 is widely considered superior to the Dow for tracking the state of the stock market. Nevertheless, when David Blitzer joined the S&P 500 committee in 1989, the Dow was still the definitive stock market index. People in finance respected the S&P 500 — many professional investors used the index as a benchmark to see whether they were "beating the market," and they paid for access to the S&P 500 and related data. But it wasn't much money. Just a few years earlier, in 1982, "the income was zilch, almost," Blitzer says. So what changed? Three new financial products helped turn the S&P 500 into the dominant index and a golden goose: In each case, the companies paid to use the S&P 500 name, data and methodology. That fee was based on how much money people invested in S&P 500 index funds and ETFs (or spent on S&P 500 futures). So if a schoolteacher invested $30,000 of retirement savings in Vanguard's S&P 500 fund, Vanguard might charge that teacher $15 per year and give S&P a chunk of that $15. These novel products did not immediately make the S&P 500 a gold mine. The products were new, and investors were skeptical. So S&P's fees were modest. Blitzer says that when he became chair of the committee, in 1995, there were around 25 employees devoted to the S&P 500 and two other indexes they published. But "it grew incredibly," he adds. "You know, it was a good ride." A key period, Blitzer says, came in the late 1990s, as the dot-com bubble inflated. New internet companies like Yahoo grew and grew, and Blitzer and his colleagues duly added them to the S&P 500. (Yahoo replaced Laidlaw, North America's largest bus operator. "What it says is that the internet slowly but surely is becoming a key part of the U.S. economy," Blitzer told reporters in 1999.) The manic increases in internet stock prices pushed the S&P 500 up and up. "For 15 or 20 months, or maybe two years or more, the S&P 500 outperformed like 90% of all the mutual funds and ETFs in the market," says Blitzer. In other words, Wall Street's elite money managers — whom Americans gladly paid fat fees every year to invest their savings for them — were making lower returns (less per dollar invested, especially after accounting for fees) from the stock market than people who'd bought SPY or Vanguard's S&P 500 index fund. Blitzer's simple list of 500 stocks was one of the hottest portfolios on Wall Street, and getting access to it was cheap. The fees for SPY and index funds were a fraction of what elite Wall Street firms charged. So more and more families moved their retirement savings out of the hands of those active investors and into S&P 500 funds. What they were essentially doing was betting that America's 500 largest companies would keep growing and making profits — which is a pretty good, safe bet. The creators of the index chose 500 companies because it approximated the entire stock market: S&P 500 companies typically represent more than 75% of the entire American stock market (in terms of size, or market capitalization). And even as internet and tech stocks made up a larger and larger share of the S&P 500, people who bought SPY or index funds were still well diversified, since they were also investing in energy, health care and consumer-goods companies — which cushioned their losses when the tech bubble burst. This trend of people moving their retirement savings into index funds and ETFs has continued for decades. By the time Blitzer stepped down as chair of the S&P 500 committee in 2019, he says, their index business employed around 700 people, and they'd created so many indexes (the S&P Southeast Asia 40, the S&P Emerging Under $2 Billion, the S&P Municipal Bond Water & Sewer Index) that he legitimately did not know how many existed. (In the early 2010s, S&P also bought a controlling stake in the Dow Jones indexes; Dow Jones & Co. retains some affiliation with the indexes, but no ownership.) But the S&P 500 remains the crown jewel. In 2024, S&P Global earned $1.6 billion in revenue from its indexes business. Most of that revenue came from firms paying to use the S&P name for $16.6 trillion of index funds and other investments. Of that $16.6 trillion, a whopping $13 trillion came from SPY, Vanguard's S&P 500 index fund and similar investments. As a director and senior analyst at Mizuho Securities USA, Sean Kennedy closely follows seven companies so he can advise customers on whether to buy, hold or sell their stock. S&P Global is one of them. I ask whether he ever worries about S&P's indexes business faltering. "No," he responds instantly. "I think their moat is so impenetrable," he says, that customers ask him only really about other parts of S&P Global's business. By a "moat," Kennedy means the factors that prevent competitors from launching their own indexes and conquering S&P's castle (i.e., its customers and business). According to Kennedy and Blitzer, that moat consists of three main factors: The S&P 500 does have competitors. The London Stock Exchange Group has the Russell Indices, and MSCI publishes popular ones too. But their most prominent indexes are complements to the S&P 500, rather than competitors. From the perspective of S&P's customers, says Kennedy, "there's really no one you can switch to." What also sets the S&P 500 apart is the committee that Blitzer headed up for more than two decades. Even many finance experts are surprised to learn that it exists. They expect the S&P 500 to be like a formula: You calculate which companies are the 500 largest, in terms of share price and number of shares, and then publish the list. S&P publishes its methodology on its website, but it leaves some wiggle room to achieve other goals of the index, such as mitigating turnover and keeping the list representative of the broader market. That wiggle room was Blitzer's domain. In the early 1990s, for example, the committee held off on adding Microsoft to the index because founders Bill Gates and Paul Allen still owned more than 50% of the shares. In other cases, if two companies merged, creating one corporation large enough to make the S&P 500, the committee might similarly wait to see how the new company (and its stock price) fared before adding it. Blitzer said in a 2020 Bloomberg podcast that they sometimes "got pounded" for these decisions but "learned to shrug our shoulders and say wait till next month." He also suspects the committee's existence, as well as the fact that no one could fully predict the list, gave the S&P 500 some "aura." Potential changes were always a gossipy topic in business and finance. Even within the S&P office, no one knew for sure what Blitzer would announce. Since Blitzer retired in 2019, it's now someone else's job to pick the 500 stocks and endure the criticism. (That's now easier, however, because S&P keeps all members of the committee anonymous, in part so CEOs would stop FedEx-ing them quarterly reports and financial literature to lobby for inclusion in the S&P 500.) The biggest criticism in recent years, though, is not about a specific stock. It's that the S&P 500 no longer broadly represents the stock market. Just seven tech stocks — Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Nvidia, Tesla, Microsoft and Apple — have grown so huge that they make up more than 30% of the S&P 500. Increasingly, when the S&P 500 goes up or down, it reflects the performance of these "Magnificent 7" tech companies. Many economists, financial experts and money managers are concerned. Millions of people have invested trillions of dollars in S&P 500 funds with the idea that it's a well-diversified portfolio — a bet on the entire U.S. economy (or at least the large slice of it available to buy on stock markets), not a bet mostly on continued iPhone profits and AI chatbots becoming a profitable business. There are alternatives on offer. Firms like Vanguard offer index funds and other easy ways to invest in indexes of smaller companies, midsize companies, international stock markets or the "total" U.S. stock market — or to diversify into real estate. But as Blitzer points out, the Magnificent 7's domineering influence does not mean the S&P 500 is broken. The S&P 500 may be "pretty top heavy right now," but it has been top heavy before, in periods like the dot-com boom, and it still represents some 80% of American stock markets. The S&P 500 is doing its job: reflecting the state of the stock market and the investments everyone has decided to make. The point of the S&P 500 and the many investments based on it is to follow the markets — to trust its crowdsourced intelligence and not second-guess it or think you individually know better — because even though markets are sometimes very wrong, trusting them has an excellent track record over the long run. This is simply the state of our economy in 2025. Like it or not, it's increasingly a huge bet on a few tech giants and their massive investments in artificial intelligence startups, new data centers and AI being the next big thing.

Costco has always been a part of my life. I remember taking family trips to the warehouse as a kid and sharing soft-serve with my siblings. When I moved away for college, I still asked my parents to take me to Costco, often "borrowing" their membership card for big shopping trips to stock up on food and household items. Later, my partner and I went all in, splurging on our own executive membership and even getting the Costco Citi card. Now, as adults, we're at Costco multiple times each month, filling up on everything from gas to groceries. We make almost all our large purchases there, and have even booked Costco vacation packages. As a longtime shopper, I can confidently say the benefits of a Costco executive membership are worthwhile. Here's why I think it's worth upgrading to the higher membership tier. A standard Costco membership costs $65 a year, and the executive version is double the price at $130 annually. However, we recover the cost of the upgrade just by making qualifying purchases at the warehouse. That's because the executive membership comes with a 2% cash back reward, which allows shoppers to earn up to $1,250 back on qualifying pre-tax purchases. To break it down, this means that if we spend about $3,250 a year at Costco, we earn back the cost of the executive membership upgrade. If we spend a little more, we're making money to spend at the warehouse. Once a year — about two months before our membership renews — Costco sends a cash back voucher, which can be redeemed on future purchases. Plus, Costco has a membership satisfaction guarantee, meaning the company will refund the price of the membership at any time if you're not satisfied with it. In addition to the 2% cash back perk, Costco executive members can often access extra benefits. For example, the company recently started giving executive members a $10 monthly credit to use on same-day delivery through Instacart. The credit is automatically applied at checkout when we spend $150 (before tax). After returning home from vacation, this perk was a game changer. Instead of fighting the weekend Costco crowds to stock up on our favorite products, our groceries were delivered promptly to our doorstep. We were even able to snag a coveted rotisserie chicken. And speaking of vacations, executive members also get extra benefits on trips booked through Costco Travel. A few years ago, I purchased an all-inclusive vacation package to Costa Rica. As part of the deal, my friend and I each received $50 to use at the spa and a complimentary fruit basket for our room. Earlier this year, Costco announced it would be opening its doors for an additional six and a half hours each week for US executive members. Now, we can begin shopping at the warehouse an hour early on weekdays and Sundays. On Saturdays, we can enter half an hour earlier than other members. We recently attended this special shopping hour on a Sunday and noticed a stark difference. For example, my store typically has a line out the door to get in at opening, but we were able to stroll right in without bumping into anyone. We didn't even have to wait in line to check out. We'll likely make it a habit to go during these exclusive hours, as it made for a much better experience overall. I've been shopping at Costco for as long as I can remember, and I don't plan on stopping anytime soon. Costco's greatest draws are its ability to provide value for the price and an unbeatable customer experience. For my partner and me, paying for the executive membership is a no-brainer. The 2% cash back means our $130 annual membership pays for itself. Plus, we love having access to all the premium perks. Jump to

Title: Steven Pinker on Speculation Bubbles, Super Bowl Ads, and What Leaders Need to Know About Group Psychology

A conversation with psychology professor Steven Pinker on a powerful force that unites us. As a leader, psychology is fundamental to your success – whether that means understanding consumer behavior, team dynamics, or even your own biases and blind spots. Harvard professor Steven Pinker says that an important phenomena to understand is that of common knowledge and its downstream effects. It’s the idea that there is power in knowledge, but also power in knowing what other people know – and that when a large group of people know what others around them know, and vice versa, that’s when major change can happen. He explains how common knowledge underlies meme stocks, the rise of crypto, meeting etiquette and the success of Super Bowl ads. Pinker wrote the new book When Everyone Knows That Everyone Knows . . .: Common Knowledge and the Mysteries of Money, Power, and Everyday Life. ADI IGNATIUS: I’m Adi Ignatius. ALISON BEARD: I’m Alison Beard, and this is the HBR IdeaCast. ADI IGNATIUS: All right. So Alison, the more I think about leadership, the more I think that leading effectively is almost all about psychology. ALISON BEARD: Yeah, I can see what you mean. You need to understand consumers’ wants and needs, your employees’ wants and needs, your business partner’s wants and needs. Really anticipating everything that stakeholders might do or think. ADI IGNATIUS: Yeah, exactly. I think successful leaders need to think on multiple levels, both to cope with the complexity of their jobs and to outthink their competition. So our guest today, Steven Pinker, is all about the power of knowledge. Understanding what we know, what we don’t know, and most importantly, whether or not others know what we know. So I know that sounds very Donald Rumsfeldian, but there is power in understanding all of this. ALISON BEARD: Yeah, it does sound very meta, but Pinker is an expert in explaining very complex topics in a way that feels understandable and applicable to our everyday lives. So I’m interested to hear what he has to say. ADI IGNATIUS: Absolutely. So Pinker is a professor of psychology at Harvard University, author of the new book, When Everyone Knows That Everyone Knows: Common Knowledge and the Mysteries of Money, Power, and Everyday Life. It’s a book that helps explain everything from the power of Super Bowl ads to the rise of cryptocurrency, to the unspoken rules of how we interact in the office. Here’s our conversation. ADI IGNATIUS: Steven, thank you for being with us today. STEVEN PINKER: Thanks for having me. ADI IGNATIUS: Great. So, your book is about common knowledge, what it is and how we use it and in ways that we’re aware of and in ways that we aren’t aware of. So, for the audience, what are you getting at with common knowledge and why should we care about that? STEVEN PINKER: I’m using the term specialized sense, not to refer to conventional wisdom or something that is widely known, but to something that is known to be known. That is I know something, you know it. You know that I know it. I know that you know it. You know that I know that you know it, and so on ad infinitum. So, that’s common knowledge in the technical sense. It’s important because it’s necessary for coordination for two or more people to be on the same page to make choices that might be arbitrary, but it works for everyone as long as everyone makes the same choice. Do you stay home on Saturday or Sunday? Do you drive on the right or drive on the left? Now for common knowledge to work, you don’t literally have to think, “I know that she knows it. I know that she knows.” Because your head starts to spin after one or two levels, and technically, common knowledge requires an infinite number of them, which can’t fit inside a single head. But we have a sense of common knowledge when something is conspicuous or self-evident or public or out there. If I see it while I see you seeing it, then I know that you know that I know that you know it. ADI IGNATIUS: So this is the emperor has new clothes. STEVEN PINKER: Well, I begin the book with the story of the emperor’s new clothes because there’s a sense in which it’s a story about common knowledge. When the little boy said the emperor was naked, he wasn’t telling anyone anything they didn’t already know. But he’s changed the state of their knowledge nonetheless because by blurting out what everyone could see within earshot of everyone else, at that moment, everyone knew that everyone else knew that everyone else knew that the emperor was naked. And another point in the book is that just like driving on the right or driving on the left is a solution to a coordination problem or staying home Saturday or staying home Sunday, respecting paper currency, I suggest that our informal social relationships. Are we friends? Do I defer to you? Are we transactional partners? Are we lovers? All of those are matters of common knowledge as well. They’re coordination games and we solidify them by generating some public signal that we both see that inaugurates the relationship. There can be forms of common belief, common misconception, common pretense where you do have assumptions about what other people are thinking and vice versa, that in some cases may not actually be a reality. In the case of a common pretense where we refer to that by saying, “We’re ignoring the elephant in the room,” the metaphor is that an elephant in the room is something you can’t ignore, but we’re pretending to ignore it. Sometimes there is a phenomenon called pluralistic ignorance or a spiral of silence. In economics, it’s sometimes called the Abilene Paradox, where no one actually believes something, but everyone thinks that everyone else believes it, but no one actually does. ADI IGNATIUS: Is there an easy example of that? STEVEN PINKER: Sure. It was originally studied in a fraternity where all the frat guys said privately that it’s really stupid to drink until you puke and pass out. But they said, “What can I do about it? All the other guys think it’s cool.” It turns out none of them thought it was cool, but everyone thought that everyone else thought it was cool. There’ve been many phenomena like that. It turns out that in Saudi Arabia, most of the men think that women should have the right to work and drive, but they couldn’t allow their wives to do it because they mistakenly thought that all the other men thought that it was impermissible. ADI IGNATIUS: So I want to lead this conversation mainly into economic, financial, market areas but your book, I’d say it’s challenging in some ways. There are a lot of brain-teasers, there are a lot of prisoner’s dilemmas, things like that, but it’s also fun. I mean there are a lot of popular references, jokes, cartoons, and then examples. So, one of the things you talk about is the Keynesian beauty contest. Which – and if I get it wrong, you’ll correct me, but where a judge doesn’t simply select the contestant that he or she thinks is the most attractive, but rather is rewarded on selecting based on what he or she thinks the other judges will select, right? STEVEN PINKER: Who are engaged in the same puzzle. ADI IGNATIUS: In the same thing. STEVEN PINKER: They’re guessing what everyone else will judge to be the prettiest face, which is different from the old Miss Rheingold competition where people voted on the prettiest face. In the beauty contest that Keynes hinted might have been in the newspapers in his day, this would be London in the ’20s. No one can ever actually verify whether there really was such of a contest. But it was a great example because for Keynes where he said, “Everyone is trying to out-guess other people out-guessing still other people.” He said, “That’s the way speculative investing works.” They buy the security because they think they can sell it at a higher price to other people who think it’s underpriced, who in turn will want to sell it to still other people. Speculative bubbles, crypto perhaps being one of the most recent examples, are cases where people think that other people in the future will want to buy in, something that’s called the greater fool theory of investing that you invest because you think other people will invest because they think that still other people will invest. The thing is, of course, bubbles can pop when the market starts to run out of the greater fools who think that it’ll continue to appreciate forever. But this can all get started when there is some public signal. In the case of the emperor’s new clothes, the boy blurting it out, or like a public ceremony or a public signal where if there is just a rumor or some reason to think that other people are getting in, that can cause other people to get in. A couple of recent examples are meme stocks where an influencer might talk up a stock even if the fundamentals are terrible, pretty crummy. But the fact that other people know that he’s talking it up and they know that still other people are talking up means that it really can appreciate at least for a while. Two Super Bowls ago, there were a number of high concept ads for crypto exchanges, which mentioned nothing about the advantages of crypto. ADI IGNATIUS: I remember that. These are the Larry David ads. STEVEN PINKER: The Larry David, the Matt Damon, where the point of the ads were everyone’s getting into crypto, don’t be left out. In fact, the punchline to the Larry David comic ad was, “Don’t be like Larry, don’t be left out.” ADI IGNATIUS: So this sounds like a tool that people who understand the psychology could and probably do benefit from, right? STEVEN PINKER: Yes. Getting back to marketing, I talk about an analysis by a political scientist like Michael Chwe, who is in some ways my predecessor in writing a book about common knowledge where he analyzed the most famous and most expensive ad in history. This was the 1984 ad directed by Ridley Scott of Blade Runner and Alien and Fame. It ran exactly once during the 1984 Super Bowl and it was to introduce the Apple Macintosh. It was a revolutionary new product. Unlike those of us who remember the first personal computers, remember it had a little screen with 24 lines of 80 characters and you had to type in alphanumeric commands like del, fubar, fu.bar, and they were error-prone. They were clumsy. So, Apple’s coming out this insanely great new product with windows and menus and icons and a mouse. But they realized that no one would buy it if they thought they were the only one buying it because the price wouldn’t come down because of demand. There wouldn’t be a community of users and experts. So, how do you break the knot and cut the knot and get people to buy something that they’ll only buy if other people are buying it? The answer is the Super Bowl is an annual right in American culture. You know that a lot of people are watching it and you know that a lot of people know that a lot of people are watching it. It is a common knowledge generator. To break the logjam, Apple paid for this ad. It said nothing about the Apple computer, for those of you who have seen it. It played off the fact that it was January 1984, the date of George Orwell’s novel. So, it showed a grim corporate meeting where gray drones trudge into a cavernous hall and listen to drivel from a voice on the screen, intercut with scenes of a live young woman in a bright red gym shorts and a singlet carrying a mallet. She bursts into the corporate meeting, hammer throws the mallet into the screen, which explodes in a fireball revealing the crawl that says on January 25th, Apple will introduce the Macintosh and you’ll see why 1984 won’t be like 1984. Now, the point of the ad was not to advertise the product, it didn’t say anything about the product, but to advertise the audience for the potential buyership. It generated common knowledge. I’m seeing the ad. I know lots of other companies are seeing the ad. What Chwe showed… I mean, it’s a story. How did he prove it? I mean, that’s just a sample of one. So, he looked at other products that only work if enough other people adopt it, products that depend on network effects. Monster.com was one of the first job-seeking ads. Now, why would anyone look for a job on Monster.com unless they thought that lots of employers were posting there? Why would employers post there unless they thought a lot of job seekers were looking for jobs there? Monster.com was introduced at the Super Bowl. Another example is the Discover credit card, which was great credit card, rebates, and high limits, but didn’t matter if you were the only one who had a Discover card because no merchant would accept it and no merchant would accept it unless they thought enough people were going to carry it, introduced in the Super Bowl. Chwe argued that it was another category aside from products that inherently depend on networks, they’re prestige goods that depend on other people that you respect also consuming that product. As far as language, sneakers are sneakers, but for some people, it matters whether they’re the person who wears Nikes or Adidas. An American beer is American beer, but for some people, like being a Bud drinker is just different from being a Coors drinker and products that are consumed in public and where the brand image is important also tend to advertise in the Super Bowl. Crucially, what Chwe showed was not so much that advertisers willing to pay per eyeball, but they’re willing to pay a premium for venues that were common knowledge generators, where it was known that a lot of people were to watch them. They’re willing to pay more per eyeball for products that were consumed in public or that depended on network effects. ADI IGNATIUS: So, maybe the flip side of this phenomenon is the toilet paper shortage during COVID, which was not this, not network effects, but an assumption that I know what you know that I know that you know that. STEVEN PINKER: Well, yes. So, economist named Justin Wolfers speculated that the great COVID toilet paper shortage was like a bank run where people withdraw their money, not necessarily because they think that there’s anything wrong with the bank, but they have heard that other people think there might be something wrong on the sound. They might just have heard that other people think that might be something. That that’s not how it sounds. So, you get this reverberant doubt, and no one wants to be the last customer withdrawing at a point where the bank no longer can cover its deposits. So, people rush to the bank to withdraw their savings, which actually causes the bank to fail, which otherwise it wouldn’t. Likewise, Wolfers suggested that there actually wasn’t a toilet paper shortage. It’s true that people were staying home. So, they were using six packs of Charmin, instead of the big jumbo rolls in their workplace. But Kimberly-Clark quickly stepped up production to meet the demand, but somehow people just know that in an emergency, people hoard toilet paper, which can cause the very shortage that leads people to hoard toilet paper. So, they did hoard toilet paper. A lot of retailers then posted signs, max three rolls per customer. ADI IGNATIUS: That reinforced it. STEVEN PINKER: And that ended the shortage. Not so much because people didn’t strip the shelves because they couldn’t, but they were reassured that since no one else could buy more than three rolls, there was no reason for them to panic. Again, getting back to common knowledge, how did this originate? At least according to one history, it all started with another common knowledge generator, the Tonight Show, which back in the three network era, Johnny Carson was the king of late night. He had not only a huge audience, but people knew that people were watching Johnny Carson, which is why catchphrases from the show like, “Here’s Johnny,” everyone recognized it. So, one night, I think it was 1973, he said, “There’ve been all kinds of shortages lately.” This was an era where there were lines to get gasoline because of the Arab oil embargo and there was a meat shortage and a coffee shortage. He said, “Have you heard the latest? I read it in the papers. There’s a shortage of toilet paper.” Now it turned out it wasn’t true at the time. There was no shortage of toilet paper, but then that created a shortage of toilet paper when everyone ran out to buy it. Since then, at least according to the story, it’s hard to proof, it’s just become conventional wisdom that toilet paper becomes scarce in an emergency. ADI IGNATIUS: All of this must be very valuable for people who are in negotiation, right? Because negotiation is always, “What is it that we both know, and what is it that only I know?” I mean that’s how you win. But yeah, talk about to what extent I know, you know… That’s the fundamental of the people who negotiate better probably understand this concept better. STEVEN PINKER: Yeah. So, negotiation is one of a number of kinds of games in the game theory sense, meaning my best option depends on what you do and vice versa. In any time in which there can be multiple equilibria, cases where everyone is better off if they both do something, but it isn’t preordained what they’ll do. So, the negotiation is what’s sometimes called a battle of the sexes is the technical term. It has nothing actually to do with the sexes, but it refers to a hypothetical couple where they like to spend time together. He would prefer that they go to the hockey game. She would prefer they go to the opera. They’d rather go to either than not do something together. The question is, which one do they go to? Both of them are equilibria. In the case of negotiation, let’s say a car salesman and a buyer. There’s a range of prices in which the salesman makes a profit and the customer pays what they’re willing to pay to get the car. But within that range, the highest the customer is willing to pay, the lowest the seller is willing to sell for, how do they decide? Obviously, the seller wants it as high as possible, the buyer wants it as low as possible. If either of them walks away from the deal, then they’re both worse off. So, how do they decide? So there are many predicaments in life like this where there are many ways of doing something, but both parties are better off if they can figure out some way to do it. In the case of a negotiation, it’s interesting. This is something pointed out many years ago by the political scientist, Thomas Shelley, who won a Nobel Prize for this and other work, that often a buyer and seller in order to find somewhere, anywhere to land on that the other guy will agree with, they’ll pick something like splitting the difference or a round number. He notes that the salesman, who announced that his rock bottom price for the car is $30,007.26, is pretty much pleading to be relieved of $7.26. It’s like, “Oh, come on.” So why a round number? I mean, what’s so special about a round number? What’s special is other people can think it’s special or can expect each other to recognize it as special. So, these points, focal points, sometimes called shelling points, points that pop out in the minds of both parties and that’s all they need to come to an agreement are often where negotiations end up. ADI IGNATIUS: When you talk about common knowledge, particularly some of the early references, it seems a different era than where we are now. Maybe this was never true, but people my age will look back and say, “Well, we used to agree on facts.” We probably didn’t altogether, but we did, right? As you say, there were only three networks that wasn’t this ubiquity of opinion and everything. Now we’re really in an era where they’re competing truths and I would assume competing common knowledges. Obviously, there’s various common knowledges between people and in relationships, but at a larger level, I guess my question is, is that eroding the common knowledge that enables social interaction, et cetera? Is that a concern for you? STEVEN PINKER: There is that fear, although as you say and I often point out that the best explanation for the good old days is a bad memory. There’s a lot of polarization in the ’60s too, riots and terrorist bombings and assassinations and so on. Duly not romanticizing the past, there does seem to be an increase in negative polarization that is not just that people disagree, but each thinks that the other is evil. It’s plausible that one of the contributors was the fragmentation of the media markets. So, that instead of everyone watching Walter Cronkite or Huntley and Brinkley, first with cable news, with Fox News, whose business model was to cultivate a highly partisan audience that wants to hear a certain spin on everything and with social media where the networks of posting and reposting and tweeting and retweeting and linking and relinking has been shown to take place within two or more closed networks with not much interaction between that there could be separate pools of common belief within each of these communities. Something that’s easier to happen when there isn’t one public signal, a Super Bowl, a Johnny Carson, a Walter Cronkite that everyone knows that everyone knows is aware of. ADI IGNATIUS: Okay, so anyway, so this concept of common knowledge existing in different ways in different forms of relationships. So, within a company, if an executive, if a leader wants to create a common knowledge that he or she imagines would be beneficial for the culture of the company, is there a playbook almost for how to create a positive common knowledge within this environment? STEVEN PINKER: Well, in general, common knowledge is generated by something that is conspicuous, public. So, face-to-face meetings can generate common knowledge in a way that, say, remote meetings don’t. That is when you’re in a room, you see everyone else, they see you, they know that they’re seeing each other and seeing the speaker or the leader. So, I think that’s one of the reasons that as with the Super Bowl, which is a broadcast version, but there is an important role for publicly conspicuous notices, sometimes pronouncements. Going back to the economy as a whole, the reason that statements from the Fed are scrutinized and poured over like rabbis parsing the Talmud is that anything that the chairman of the Fed says can create its own reality when people knowing that other people have heard it will act on it out of anticipation of what other people will do, which can then feed on itself and create a bubble, a recession. So, I quote Alan Greenspan, who at one point said, “Since I’ve become chair of the Fed, I’ve learned to mumble with great incoherence. If I seem clear to you, you must have misunderstood what I said.” Because a signal that, say, a recession is ahead will create that recession because companies won’t hire out of fear that they’ll have to lay off employees. Consumers won’t buy out of fear that they might lose their jobs, each of which then creates the reality of the other. So, the chairman of that has to be very, very careful as to what she or he says. ADI IGNATIUS: Yeah. What’s interesting in all of this… You talk about politics in some ways, you talk about authoritarian politics. I lived in China and I lived in Russia and you did have the phenomenon that you described, which is everybody knows that the regime is rotten, but nobody says it because you can’t be certain if you take the streets, there’s going to be anybody else with you, even though everybody knows. Then you understand why you have to control everything because the moment you loosen up anything, it allows for this possibility of communication and understanding. It is like that moment when Ceausescu fell in Romania and he’d controlled everything. Suddenly, there’s people shouting in the back as he’s giving a speech and some stuff’s happening. He realizes it’s over because it’s either complete control or no control. STEVEN PINKER: In particular, since no dictator can control every last member of the population, there just isn’t enough firepower. There aren’t enough informants. As I quote the character of Gandhi in the movie by that name ADI IGNATIUS: Ben Kingsley… STEVEN PINKER: Who at one point tells a British colonial officer, “In the end, you’ll leave because 100,000 Englishmen simply cannot control 350 million Indians if the Indians refuse to cooperate.” He could have said, “Refuse to coordinate or are unable to coordinate.” So people can overpower a regime if they all stand up at the same time, if they all storm the palace, if they all stop work. But how can they do it if each one is afraid that he’ll be the only one? If he stands up, he can be picked off or bundled off to prison. If everyone protests at the same time, then there’s the safety in numbers, but there’s safety in coordination. So, there has to be a way of generating the common knowledge. Now’s the time that we all stand up together. So, protest in a public square where everyone sees everyone else seeing everyone else can often do it, which is why dictators are often terrified of public protests. Or if there is a widely circulated magazine, TV show, radio show, which is why they clamp down on the media. ADI IGNATIUS: Talk about the blank paper. STEVEN PINKER: Oh yeah. So, there’s a joke from the Soviet Union about a man handing out leaflets in red square. Of course, the KGB arrest him. They bundle him off to police headquarters, only discover that the leaflets are blank sheets of paper, and they confront him. They demand, “What is the meaning of this?”, and he says, “What’s there to say? It’s so obvious.” So the point of the joke was he was generating common knowledge. He didn’t need to say anything because people already knew it, but they didn’t know that everyone else knew it. And in a case of life imitating a joke, Putin’s police force has arrested a number of people for carrying blank signs. ADI IGNATIUS: Yeah, well, I wonder if it was before. So, that in China where it’s very dangerous to protest and very dangerous to dissent publicly, after the mishandling of COVID, there were famously blank paper protests. STEVEN PINKER: Oh, interesting. ADI IGNATIUS: Possibly inspired by the original- STEVEN PINKER: Joke. ADI IGNATIUS: … Soviet joke. Yeah. So, the book is fascinating and you put your finger on common knowledge and how we know what we know and how we think about certain things and how we operate. What are we supposed to do with all that? STEVEN PINKER: Well, it’s hard to answer that question because I didn’t write it as a how-to book or as a manual or self-help. It’s a work in fundamental science and logic and philosophy with lots and lots of applications. How you work it out in a particular case often depends on the particular payoffs. What would happen if you fail to coordinate? What do you gain if you do coordinate? If there are multiple ways of coordinating, who gains, who loses? So there’s no single formula, but it is a lens with which to view the world simply because coordination is so ubiquitous in human affairs. Any corporation, any institution, any school, any relationship, any couple, any friendship, any family, these are all people trying to coordinate and they always have to coordinate with some signal of common knowledge. They often, in order to preserve the relationship, have to keep things out of common knowledge. So, all the phenomena of politeness, euphemism, innuendo, tact, pretending not to see the elephant in the room, beating around the bush, hypocrisy, genteel hypocrisy, all of those I consider to be cases where people privately know something, but there’s some reason to keep it out of common knowledge. The reason being something in common knowledge changes the relationship. Sometimes you don’t want to change the relationship or you don’t want to signal the wrong relationship. So, just to give a couple of examples, I mean the most common case of systematic hypocrisy is politeness. If you could pass the salt, that would be awesome. What? If you think about it, literally, it really doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. But could you pass the salt? Do you think you might pass the salt? Why do we go through those rituals? It’s because we don’t want to boss each other around. I don’t want to give you a command as if you’re the butler, assuming that we’re friends or for that matter, strangers. ADI IGNATIUS: So benign hypocrisy or some of these protocols, they may not be direct, they may not be honest, but they’re what we need to function. STEVEN PINKER: They’re what we need to preserve our relationships because our relationships are coordination games, which depend on common knowledge. Sometimes we don’t want to blow up a relationship. So, we avoid the common knowledge. ADI IGNATIUS:. Steven Pinker, thank you for being on IdeaCast. STEVEN PINKER: Thanks for having me.

Meta brought the smarts of Oakley Meta HSTN to Ray-Ban styles. Here's what's new compared to the first-gen pair. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Same looks, new features Higher-quality 3K video recording and double the battery life highlight the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 upgrades over the original model. It's available in the same Wayfarer, Headliner, and Skyler styles and prescription lenses are available within the supported range. A classic with limits Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1) was the breakthrough follow-up to Ray-Ban Stories, and it has sold millions. There's a reason for that — these are great smart glasses, but they also come with notable limitations, including battery life and camera quality. Ray-Ban Meta became the first product to make smart glasses mainstream, selling over two million units since their debut in 2023. Now, Meta is here with a second-generation version of the three iconic Ray-Ban smart glasses styles, packing revamped hardware. The recent Oakley Meta HSTN launch brought extra battery life and crisper video recording to Meta smart glasses, and now those advancements are headed to Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2. Meta is continuing to sell the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 at a lower price than the Gen 2 smart glasses, creating an interesting dilemma for interested buyers. Should owners of the Gen 1 smart glasses upgrade to the Gen 2 revision, and should new buyers pay more for the extra features? Those are the questions we'll help you answer in this comparison between Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 and Gen 2. Let's dive in. Why you can trust Android Central Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test. Meta revealed the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 smart glasses at Connect 2025. They are available now online and at partner retailers for $379. They're sold in the same Wayfarer, Skyler, and Headliner styles as the first-generation smart glasses, but there are a few limited-edition colorways for early adopters. The same range of prescription lenses is supported, too, with prescriptions between -6.00 and +4.00 being compatible. The Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 smart glasses are sticking around at a $299 price point, but some styles are out of stock. Skyler and Wayfarer styles appear to be available, although it's unclear for how long or if stock will be replenished. You can equip them with prescriptions between -6.00 and +4.00, just like Gen 2. For those with advanced prescription needs, there are third-party workarounds available. Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 are identical to the first-generation pair of smart glasses from a design standpoint. You can choose between Wayfarer, Skyler, or Headliner styles depending on which you prefer, but these frames will look virtually identical across the Gen 1 and Gen 2 models. You get a camera on one side of the frames for photos and video recording, plus an LED indicator light on the opposite side to let others know when you're capturing content. The big change to the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2's design and dimensions is that Meta managed to shave a few grams of weight off the frames. The new pair of smart glasses weighs 48 grams, down from 52 grams on the Gen 1 model. I had comfort issues with Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 at times, partially due to the weight, which caused the glasses to slip down the bridge of my nose at times. I don't know whether the four-gram difference in weight will make the Gen 2 noticeably more comfortable, but I don't think it can hurt either. Category Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1) Styles Wayfarer, Headliner, Skyler Wayfarer, Skyler, Headliner (out of stock) Lenses Polarized, Transitions, prescription (-6.0 to +4.0) Polarized, Transitions, prescription (-6.0 to +4.0) Camera 12MP Ultra-Wide 12MP Ultra-Wide Photo resolution 3024 X 4032 pixels (Portrait only) 3024 X 4032 pixels (Portrait default) Video resolution 1200p at 60FPS 1440p at 30FPS 3K at 30FPS 1440 x 1920 pixels at 30 fps (Vertical default) Speakers 2X open ear speakers 2X open ear speakers Microphones Custom 5-mic Array (2 in left arm, 2 in right arm, 1 near nose pad) Custom 5-mic Array (2 in left arm, 2 in right arm, 1 near nose pad) Storage 32GB; about 500 photos, 100 30-second videos 32GB; about 100+ videos (30 sec) and 500+ photos (3 frame burst) Connectivity Wi-Fi 6; Bluetooth 5.3 Wi-Fi 6; Bluetooth 5.3 Compatibility iOS; Android iOS; Android Weight 52g 49.2g Durability IPX4 IPX4 Battery Up to 8 hours per charge 5 hours continuous audio playback or voice calling 4 hours per charge: 30 minutes live streaming Charging (glasses) case 48 hours worth of charge Up to 32 hours Charging speed 50% in 20 minutes 50% in 20 minutes Both the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 and Gen 2 smart glasses offer a 12MP ultra-wide camera, with support for 3024 X 4032 resolution photos. However, the video-recording capabilities of the Gen 2 pair are vastly superior to the Gen 1 model. You get 1200p at 60FPS, 1440p at 30FPS, and 3K at 30FPS video recording on the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2, and that exceeds the 1080p maximum on the Gen 1 glasses. It's the same 3K camera we saw on Oakley Meta HSTN, which should bring more advanced stabilization while recording video, particularly handy for action shots. Hyperlapse and slow-motion video recording is heading to Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 in a future software update this fall, according to Meta. Whether you need the extra resolution and video recording features will depend on whether you're satisfied with your current Gen 1 pair. Those who love recording video while running or working out will likely benefit from the extra frame rate support and stabilization of the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 camera. Both the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 and Gen 2 smart glasses have open-air speakers for video calls, audio playback, and more. There's also built-in microphones for audio input. Battery life was the most obvious place for Meta to upgrade its Ray-Ban smart glasses, and the second-generation model doesn't disappoint in this area. Just like the Meta Oakley HSTN smart glasses, the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 glasses can last up to eight hours on a single charge. That's double the four-hour battery life of the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 smart glasses. In the real world, that means you can take more photos, record more videos, and listen to more audio without needing to pop the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 into their charging case. In fact, the new model nets you five hours of continuous audio playback or voice calling. Both the Gen 1 and Gen 2 smart glasses can charge up to 50% in 20 minutes in a pinch. You charge both pairs of smart glasses by popping them into an included charging case, which has its own internal battery and a USB-C port. The case is also used for pairing with the Meta AI companion app and has a button for connections and resets. Meta AI is becoming more robust, supporting voice assistance and camera inputs. Essentially, it's a multimodal AI service that can take in audio plus your surroundings to help answer questions and take actions on your behalf. Both generations of Ray-Ban Meta support Meta AI, but there are extra features on the Gen 2 revision, like better live translation support. The ability for offline translation is also said to be coming in a future update. If you're in the market for a new pair of Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, the choice is easy. The second-generation Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses clear the originals in weight, camera quality, and battery life — all key areas. As such, paying the extra $80 for the Gen 2 is a no-brainer when you consider all the quality-of-life upgrades you'll get. You should consider whether Ray-Ban Meta Display, Oakley Meta HSTN, or Oakley Meta Vanguard might suit you better if you have specialized use cases, like the need for a display or fitness-focused glasses. However, those with the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 smart glasses shouldn't feel the pressure to upgrade immediately. If the camera quality and battery life are meeting your expectations, hold onto them. The experience between models is largely the same, you'll just need to charge your Gen 1 pair more frequently. The one to buy Meta addressed the major drawbacks of Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 with the second-generation revision, and they only cost a bit more. For that extra cash, you get excellent 3K video with better stabilization and double the battery life of the original. It's a no-brainer for people in the market for new smart glasses. Worth holding onto Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1) are still a great set of smart glasses, so current owners might need to upgrade if the battery life is not meeting their needs. It could also be a neat value purchase if you want to save a few bucks compared to the Gen 2 version.

Stratechery Plus Learn MoreMember Forum Stratechery Plus Learn MoreMember Forum Latest Podcast Listen to Podcast Listen to this post: Action is happening up-and-down the LLM stack: Nvidia is making deals with Intel, OpenAI is making deals with Oracle, and Nvidia and OpenAI are making deals with each other. Nine years after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang hand-delivered the first Nvidia DGX-1 AI computer to OpenAI, the chip giant is investing up to $100 billion in the AI lab, which OpenAI will, of course, spend on Nvidia AI systems. This ouroboros of a deal certainly does feel a bit frothy, but there is a certain logic to it: Nvidia is uniquely dominant in AI thanks to the company’s multi-year investment in not just superior chips but also an entire ecosystem from networking to software, and has the cash flow and stock price befitting its position in the AI value chain. Doing a deal like this at this point in time not only secures the company’s largest customer — and rumored ASIC maker — but also gives Nvidia equity upside beyond the number of chips it can manufacture. More broadly, lots of public investors would like the chance to invest in OpenAI; I don’t think Nvidia’s public market investors are bothered to have now acquired that stake indirectly. The interconnectedness of these investments reflects the interconnectedness of the OpenAI and Nvidia stories in particular: Huang may have delivered OpenAI their first AI computer, but it was OpenAI that delivered Nvidia the catalyst for becoming the most valuable company in the world, with the November 2022 launch of ChatGPT. Ever since, the assumption of many in tech has been that the consumer market in particular has been OpenAI’s to lose, or perhaps more accurately, monetize; no company has ever grown faster in terms of users and revenue, and that’s before they had an advertising model! And beyond the numbers, have you used ChatGPT? It’s so useful. You can look up information, or format text, and best of all you can code! Of course there are other models like Anthropic’s Claude, which has excelled at coding in particular, but surely the sheer usefulness makes ultimate success inevitable! If a lot of those takes sound familiar, it’s because I’ve made some version of most of them; I also, perhaps relatedly, took to Twitter like a fish to water. Just imagine, an app that was the nearly perfect mixture of content I was interested in and people I wanted to hear from, and interact with. Best of all it was text: the efficiency of information acquisition was unmatched, and it was just as easy to say my piece. It took me much longer to warm up to Facebook, and, frankly, I never was much of a user; I’ve never been one to image dump episodes of my life, nor have I had much inclination to wade through others’. I wasn’t interested in party photos; I lusted after ideas and arguments, and Twitter — a view shared by much of both tech and media — was much more up my alley. Despite that personal predilection, however, and perhaps because of my background in small town Wisconsin and subsequently living abroad, I retained a strong sense of the importance of Facebook. Sure, the people who I was most interested in hearing from and interacting with may have been the types to leave their friends and family for the big city, but for most people, friends and family were the entire point of life generally, and by extension, social media specifically. To that end, I was convinced from the beginning that Facebook was going to be a huge deal, and argued so multiple times on Stratechery; social media was ultimately a matter of network effects and scale, and Facebook was clearly on the path to domination, even as much of the Twitterati were convinced the company was the next MySpace. I was similarly bullish about Instagram: no, I wasn’t one to post a lot of personal pictures, but while I personally loved text, most people liked photos. What people really liked most of all, however — and not even Facebook saw this coming — was video. TikTok grew into a behemoth with the insight that social media was only ever a stepping stone to personal entertainment, of which video was the pinnacle. There were no network effects of the sort that everyone — including regulators — assumed would lead to eternal Facebook dominance; rather, TikTok realized that Paul Krugman’s infamous dismissal of the Internet actually was somewhat right: most people actually don’t have anything to say that is particularly compelling, which means that limiting the content you see to your social network dramatically decreases the possibility you’ll be entertained every time you open your social networking app. TikTok dispensed with this artificial limitation, simply showing you compelling videos period, no matter where they came from. Of course TikTok wasn’t the first company to figure this out: YouTube was the first video platform, and from the beginning focused on building an algorithm that focused more on giving you videos you were interested in than in showing you what you claimed to want to see. YouTube, however, was and probably always has been my biggest blind spot: I’m just not a big video watcher in general, and YouTube seemed like more work than short-form video, which married the most compelling medium with the most addictive delivery method — the feed. Sure, YouTube was a great acquisition for Google — certainly in line with the charge to “organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful” — but I — and Google’s moneymaker, Search — was much more interested in text, and pictures if I must. The truth, however, is that YouTube has long been the giant hiding in plain sight: the service is the number one streaming service in the living room — bigger than Netflix — and that’s the company’s 3rd screen after mobile and the PC, where it has no peer. More than that, YouTube is not just the center of culture, but the nurturer of it: the company just announced that it has paid out more than $100 billion to creators over the last four years; given that many creators earn more from brand deals than they do from YouTube ads, that actually understates the size of the YouTube economy. Yes, TikTok is a big deal, but TikTok stars hope to make it on YouTube, where they can actually make a living. And yet, YouTube sometimes seems like an afterthought, at least to people like me and others immersed in the text-based Internet. Last week I was in New York for YouTube’s annual “Made on YouTube” event, but the night before I couldn’t remember the name; I turned to Google, natch, and couldn’t figure it out. The reason is that talk about YouTube mostly happens on YouTube; I, and Google itself, still live in a text-based world. That is the world that was rocked by ChatGPT, especially Google. The company’s February 2023 introduction of Bard in Paris remains one of the most surreal keynotes I’ve ever watched: most of the content was rehashed, the presenters talked as if they were seeing their slides for the first time, and one of the demos of a phone-based feature neglected to remember to have a phone on hand. This was a company facing a frontal assault on their most obvious and profitable area of dominance — text-based information retrieval — and they were completely flat-footed. Google has, in the intervening years, made tremendous strides to come back, including dumping the Bard name in favor of Gemini, itself based on vastly improved underlying models. I’m also impressed by how the company has incorporated AI into search; not only are AI Overviews generally useful, they’re also incredibly fast, and as a bonus have the links I sometimes prefer already at hand. Ironically, however, you could make the case that the biggest impact LLMs have had on Search is giving a federal judge an excuse to let Google continue paying its biggest would-be competitors (like Apple) to simply offer their customers Google instead. The biggest reason to be skeptical of the company’s fortunes in AI is that they had the most to lose; the company is doing an excellent job of minimizing the losses. What I would submit, however, is that Google’s most important and most compelling AI announcements actually don’t have anything to do with Search, at least not yet. These announcements start, as you might expect, with Google’s Deep Mind Research Lab; where they hit the real world, however, is on YouTube — and that, like the user-generated streaming service, is a really big deal. A perfect example of the DeepMind-to-YouTube pipeline was last week’s announcement of Veo 3-based features for making YouTube Shorts. From the company’s blog post: We’ve partnered with Google DeepMind to bring a custom version of their most powerful video generation model, Veo 3, to YouTube. Veo 3 Fast is designed to work seamlessly in YouTube Shorts for millions of creators and users, for free. It generates outputs with lower latency at 480p so you can easily create video clips – and for the first time, with sound – from any idea, all from your phone. This initial launch will allow you to not only generate videos, but also use one video to animate another (or a photo), stylize your video with a single touch, and add objects. You can also create an entire video — complete with voiceover — from a collection of clips, or convert speech to song. All of these features are a bit silly, but, well, that’s often where genius — or at least virality — comes from. Critics, of course, will label this an AI slop machine, and they’ll be right! The vast majority of content created by these tools will be boring and unwatched. That, however, is already the case with YouTube: the service sees 500 hours of content uploaded every minute, and most of that content isn’t interesting to anyone; the magic of YouTube, however, is the algorithm that finds out what is actually compelling and spreads it to an audience that wants exactly that. To put it another way, for YouTube AI slop is a strategy credit: given that the service has already mastered organizing overwhelming amounts of content and only surfacing what is good, it, more than anyone else, can handle exponentially more content which, through the sheer force of numbers, will result in an absolute increase of content that is actually compelling. That’s not the only strategy credit YouTube has; while the cost of producing AI-generated video will likely be lower than the cost of producing human-generated video, at least in the long run, the latter’s costs are not borne by TikTok or Meta (Facebook and Instagram are basically video platforms at this point). Rather, the brilliance of the user-generated content model is that creators post their content for free! This, however, means that AI-generated video is actually more expensive, at least if it’s made on TikTok or Meta’s servers. YouTube, however, pays its creators, which means that for the service AI-generated video actually has the potential to lower costs in the long run, increasing the incentive to leverage DeepMind’s industry-leading models. In short, while everyone immediately saw how AI could be disruptive to Search, AI is very much a sustaining innovation for YouTube: it increases the amount of compelling content in absolute terms, and it does so with better margins, at least in the long run. Here’s the million billion trillion dollar question: what is going to matter more in the long run, text or video? Sure, Google would like to dominate everything, but if it had to choose, is it better to dominate video or dominate text? The history of social networking that I documented above suggests that video is, in the long run, much more compelling to many more people. To put it another way, the things that people in tech and media are interested in has not historically been aligned with what actually makes for the largest service or makes the most money: people like me, or those reading me, care about text and ideas; the services that matter specialize in videos and entertainment, and to the extent that AI matters for the latter YouTube is primed to be the biggest winner, even as the same people who couldn’t understand why Twitter didn’t measure up to Facebook go ga-ga over text generation and coding capabilities. The potential impact of AI on YouTube’s fortunes isn’t just about AI-created videos; rather, the most important announcement of last week’s event was the first indicator that AI can massively increase the monetization potential of every video on the streaming service. You might have missed the announcement, because YouTube underplayed it; from their event blog post: We’re adding updates to brand deals and Shopping to make brand collaborations easier than ever. We’re accelerating these deals through a new initiative and new product features to make sure those partnerships succeed – like the ability to add a link to a brand’s site in Shorts. And YouTube Shopping is expanding to more markets and merchants and getting help from AI to make tagging easier. It’s just half a sentence — “getting help from AI to make tagging easier” — but the implications of those eight words are profound; here’s how YouTube explained the feature: We know tagging products can be time-consuming, so to make the experience better for creators, we’re leaning on an AI-powered system to identify the optimal moment a product is mentioned and automatically display the product tag at that time, capturing viewer interest when it’s highest. We’ll also begin testing the ability to automatically identify and tag all eligible products mentioned in your video later this year. The creator who demonstrated the feature — that right there is a great example of how YouTube is a different world than the one I and other people in the media inhabit — was very enthusiastic about the reduction in hassle and time-savings that would come from using AI to do a menial task like tagging sponsored products; that sounds like AI at its best, freeing up creative people to do what they do best. There’s no reason, however, why auto-tagging can’t become something much greater; in fact, I already explained the implications of this exact technology in explaining why AI made me bullish on Meta: This leads to a third medium-term AI-derived benefit that Meta will enjoy: at some point ads will be indistinguishable from content. You can already see the outlines of that given I’ve discussed both generative ads and generative content; they’re the same thing! That image that is personalized to you just might happen to include a sweater or a belt that Meta knows you probably want; simply click-to-buy. It’s not just generative content, though: AI can figure out what is in other content, including authentic photos and videos. Suddenly every item in that influencer photo can be labeled and linked — provided the supplier bought into the black box, of course — making not just every piece of generative AI a potential ad, but every piece of content period. The market implications of this are profound. One of the oddities of analyzing digital ad platforms is that some of the most important indicators are counterintuitive; I wrote this spring: The most optimistic time for Meta’s advertising business is, counter-intuitively, when the price-per-ad is dropping, because that means that impressions are increasing. This means that Meta is creating new long-term revenue opportunities, even as its ads become cost competitive with more of its competitors; it’s also notable that this is the point when previous investor freak-outs have happened. When I wrote that I was, as I noted in the introduction, feeling more cautious about Meta’s business, given that Reels is built out and the inventory opportunities of Meta AI were not immediately obvious. I realize now, though, that I was distracted by Meta AI: the real impact of AI is to make everything inventory, which is to say that the price-per-ad on Meta will approach $0 for basically forever. Would-be competitors are finding it difficult enough to compete with Meta’s userbase and resources in a probabilisitic world; to do so with basically zero price umbrella seems all-but-impossible. This analysis was spot-on; I just pointed it at the wrong company. This opportunity to leverage AI to make basically every pixel monetizable absolutely exists for Meta; Meta, however, has to actually develop the models and infrastructure to do it at scale. Google is already there; it was the company universally decried for being slow-moving that announced the first version of this feature last week. I can’t overstate what a massive opportunity this is: every item in every YouTube video is well on its way to being a monetizable surface. Yes, that may sound dystopian when I put it so baldly, but if you think about it you can see the benefits; I’ve been watching a lot of home improvement videos lately, and it sure would be useful to be able to not just identify but helpfully have a link to buy a lot of the equipment I see, much of which is basically in the background because it’s not the point of the video. It won’t be long until YouTube has that inventory, which it could surface with an affiliate fee link, or make biddable for companies who want to reach primed customers. More generally, you can actually envision Google pulling this off: the company may have gotten off to a horrible start in the chatbot era, but the company has pulled itself together and is increasingly bringing its model and infrastructure leadership to bear, even as Meta has had to completely overhaul their AI approach after hitting a wall. I’m sure CEO Mark Zuckerberg will figure it out, but Google — surprise! — is the company actually shipping. Or, rather, YouTube is. Close readers of Stratechery have been observing — and probably, deservedly, smirking — at this most unexpected evolution: I am enjoying @benthompson’s journey to becoming a $GOOGL bull pic.twitter.com/xryDBIukRW That quote is from Paradigm Shifts and the Winner’s Curse, an Article that was mostly about my concerns about Apple and Amazon, and reads: And, by the same token, I’m much more appreciative of Google’s amorphous nature and seeming lack of strategy. That makes them hard to analyze — again, I’ve been honest for years about the challenges I find in understanding Mountain View — but the company successfully navigated one paradigm shift, and is doing much better than I originally expected with this one. Larry Page and Sergey Brin famously weren’t particularly interested in business or in running a company; they just wanted to do cool things with computers in a college-like environment like they had at Stanford. That the company, nearly thirty years later, is still doing cool things with computers in a college-like environment may be maddening to analysts like me who want clarity and efficiency; it also may be the key to not just surviving but winning across multiple paradigms. Appreciating the benefits of Google being an amorphous blob where no one knows what is going on, least of all leadership, is a big part of my evolution; this Article is the second part: that blob ultimately needs a way to manifest the technology it manages to come up with, and if you were to distill my worries about Google in the age of AI it would be to wonder how the company could become an answer machine — which Page and Brin always wanted — when it risked losing the massive economic benefits that came from empowering users to choose the winners of auctions Google conducted for advertisers. That, however, is ultimately the text-based world, and there’s a case to be made that, in the long run, it simply won’t matter as much as the world of video. Again, the company is doing better with Search than I expected, and I’ve always been bullish about the impact of AI on the company’s cloud business; the piece I’ve missed, however, is that Google already has the tip of the spear for its AI excellence to actually go supernova: YouTube, the hidden giant in plain sight, a business that is simultaneously unfathomably large, and also just getting started.

Title: Uber Stock To $200?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/23/uber-stock-to-200/
Time Published: 2025-09-23T09:30:00Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) has experienced significant growth recently thanks to its primary ridesharing, delivery, and freight sectors capitalizing on recovering demand, as well as a renewed focus on improving margins and returning value to shareholders. With gross bookings rising 17-18% year over year in the recent quarters, and a strong increase in adjusted EBITDA, investors are questioning whether Uber could significantly outperform at its current valuation. Is it possible for the stock to double, or at the very least, provide substantial upside? Let’s delve into the thesis. However, for those seeking upside with reduced volatility compared to holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has produced returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Additionally, refer to – Is Klarna stock worth the premium? At its present valuation, Uber seems to be trading with relatively moderate expectations factored in. Its revenue base is already substantial—approximately $43.9 billion in 2024, reflecting an 18% increase year over year, and if it can maintain 18% annual growth, revenues could approach $70 billion by 2027; with margins improving to 12–15%, net income could rise to $6–10 billion compared to the current $3 billion. At the moment, Uber is valued near a $200 billion market cap, but if it were to achieve higher profitability and a more favorable 25–40× P/E ratio in line with its competitors, the company could be justified at a $350–400 billion valuation within three years. This calculation translates to a share price of around $200, or nearly double today’s $99, provided that Uber meets its growth and margin expansion goals. Several factors could assist Uber in realizing that upside: Uber currently appears to be a more mature, cash-flow positive growth business, rather than a constantly loss-making startup. At $99 per share (EV/Revenue 4.3-4.8x, P/E in the 15-20× range depending on predictions), the market has already started incorporating many positive expectations. Nonetheless, there remains ample opportunity for upside if Uber can succeed in expanding its margins, maintaining consistent revenue growth, and providing returns to shareholders. Under a realistic scenario of solid medium-term growth alongside improved profitability, the stock could potentially double from current levels—particularly if multiples shift upwards. For investors who believe that Uber can preserve its scale advantages, manage costs effectively, and execute its diversified strategy, it presents a compelling asymmetric opportunity. However, the execution will be crucial—and there is considerable downside risk if growth slows or margins fail to meet expectations. Investors must brace for significant volatility and the possibility of considerable losses if market conditions worsen or if the company does not accomplish its ambitious growth objectives. While the potential for a 2x upside is mathematically viable based on projected revenues, it necessitates flawless execution in a rapidly shifting and competitive environment. Now, we implement a risk assessment methodology while developing the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which, comprising a collection of 30 stocks, has a proven track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the prior 4-year period. What’s the reason for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks yielded better returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster experience as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: ASML Stock: An Overlooked AI Play?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/23/asml-stock-an-overlooked-ai-play/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. ASML (NASDAQ:ASML), the Dutch semiconductor equipment powerhouse recognized as one of the most crucial firms in the semiconductor ecosystem, has witnessed its stock rise almost 25% in the last month, bouncing back from a decline in July following its Q2 earnings report, which sparked worries about demand for 2026. ASML’s significance lies in its distinctive function: it manufactures the machines that enable the production of the world's most advanced chips, making it essential to the entire semiconductor value chain. With the stock gaining momentum, is now the right time to invest? To provide context, here’s what ASML specializes in. ASML produces the most advanced manufacturing tools in the semiconductor sector, and arguably, the entire world. Its standout product is its extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines. These devices utilize ultra-short light wavelengths to engrave fine circuit patterns on silicon wafers, facilitating the manufacture of the leading-edge chips of 5 nanometers and below. Put simply, without ASML, the processors that power AI data centers, smartphones, and even contemporary vehicles would not be possible. Thus, ASML stands out as a unique enterprise. EUV technology plays a vital role in prolonging Moore’s Law, a long-held industry trend whereby transistor density doubles roughly every two years, enabling chipmakers to keep pushing the boundaries of computing capabilities and cost efficiency. See AVGO Stock vs. NVDA & INTC Multiple factors have shifted sentiment to be more favorable for ASML recently. To start, U.S. tariffs on semiconductor equipment, which include ASML’s lithography machines, were avoided thanks to a U.S.-EU trade agreement that exempts semiconductor production equipment from tariffs. This alleviated a significant worry for ASML's stock. Regarding demand, investment in AI remains robust. Major players like Nvidia and Broadcom are experiencing substantial growth as the increase in training and executing intricate models drives demand for high-performance semiconductors—the very kind ASML’s machines enable to manufacture. Indeed, the company reports that many of its largest customers are already increasing their EUV capacity to match the escalating need for AI chips. To illustrate the scale of these investments, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta (NASDAQ:META) indicated a potential cumulative capital expenditure of $364 billion for their respective current fiscal years. Much of this could translate into heightened demand for ASML. Importantly, ASML’s largest client, TSMC, reported a 37% year-over-year increase in revenue through August 2025. This impressive revenue growth is attributed to advanced nodes such as 3nm and 5nm, with the scaling up of 2nm chips expected to further stimulate demand for ASML’s EUV machinery. ASML stock is currently trading at 36x projected FY2025 earnings, which is slightly high, but there are positive signs for the stock. According to consensus estimates, ASML’s revenues are set to increase by a robust 14% this year. During the past quarter, ASML recorded net bookings of 5.5 billion euros ($6.4 billion), approximately 25% above expectations, and a historic backlog of 33 billion euros ($38 billion). With lead times of 12 to 18 months for most of its offerings, current orders should accurately reflect customer confidence well into 2026, suggesting favorable prospects for future revenue growth. Additionally, the company’s dominant market position, cutting-edge and proprietary technology, and its connection to the generative AI trend could also render the stock appealing. Discover more about the Trefis RV strategy that has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000), generating impressive returns for investors. Separately, if you seek potential upside with less volatility than individual stocks like ASML, you might consider the High Quality portfolio, which has surpassed the S&P and achieved over 91% returns since its inception. As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; they’ve exhibited a smoother trajectory, as highlighted in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: 3 Mistakes Smart People Make Investing In AI Stocks
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamsarhan/2025/09/22/3-mistakes-smart-people-make-investing-in-ai-stocks/
Time Published: 2025-09-22T22:14:07Z

ByAdam Sarhan, Contributor. Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the strongest trends on Wall Street in 2025. I began trading in the 1990’s and the AI trend reminds me of the early stages of the dot-com boom during the late 1990s (in excitement, hype, and lofty expectations). When we look back in history the creation of the internet will likely go down with the same impact as fire, the wheel, or the printing press. Now, investors are wondering will AI have the same impact? The short answer is, only time will tell. In the rush to find the next big monster stock, many investors are repeating old patterns that have historically ended with disappointment. The AI revolution is real, but investing successfully in it requires discipline, patience, proper risk management, and rational analysis. Remember, most dot com stocks are not around today. The same is true for other major technological disruptions like the airlines, railroads, and countless other examples. Here are three common mistakes I see smart people making when they invest in AI stocks. Mistake 1: Chasing Hype Without FundamentalsThe allure of the next big winner is extremely powerful and that causes many smart people to make emotional, not rational, decisions with their money. One common emotional mistake I see people make time and time again is thinking this time might be different and they jump in, after a big move up, and chase a big winning stock. The solution here is to have a plan, respect risk, and remember, this time is not different. After you buy a stock, it can only do one of three things, go up, down, or sideways. It doesn’t matter if it is an AI stock, gold stock, or railroad. All stocks go up, down, or sideways. Even great companies that are around today that survived the dot com boom and bust, had huge swings in their prices and those swings would knock out most investors. It’s easy to get caught up in the hype and excitement. It happens to most people but respecting risk, focusing on fundamentals, and making rational decisions are keys to long-term success in the market. It is also important to note that AI is full of visionaries, bold promises, and captivating stories. It’s easy to be pulled in by exciting headlines about startups developing new AI models, or tech giants unveiling massive investments in training computers to think “like humans.” Just like in the dot-com boom, the stories feel groundbreaking. The problem? Many companies riding the AI hype lose money. Some are even startups with barely any revenue. The same was true during the dot com boom and subsquent bust. Typically, what happens is investors pile in hoping to capture outsized returns, but they often end up buying into businesses that can’t support their lofty valuations and ultimately lose money when the stock falls. The history lesson: dot-com déjà vuIn 1999, companies with “.com” in their names raised billions, even when they had no plan to generate lasting cash flow. When the bubble burst, most collapsed. A similar pattern can’t be ruled out for AI. While some winners will emerge and dominate, many current players may fade into irrelevance or bankruptcy. What fundamentals still matter in AIA lesson often forgotten during speculative booms is that traditional financial metrics matter. Cash flow, balance sheet strength, and proven demand should anchor investment decisions. For chipmakers like NVIDIA that already generate substantial profits, the AI boom supports a strong existing foundation. But for early-stage firms, the risks can outweigh the potential if investors ignore fundamentals. Investor takeaway: Always separate visionary storytelling from hard financial data. A revolutionary technology is not a guarantee of revolutionary profits. Mistake 2: Overconcentration in One or Two Big NamesThe temptation to “go all in” is real and is another common mistake I see very smart people make in various market cycles. NVIDIA’s meteoric rise has transformed it into one of the best-performing stocks of the decade, largely due to AI. Its chips are essential for training AI models, and its revenue has exploded as demand for data center hardware soars. For many investors, the temptation is to put a disproportionate share of their portfolio into one strong idea. The temptation is there for just about any stock, it especially when the stock is going up. The same happened in past cycles. During the dot com boom, names like Intel, Cisco, Qualcomm, and Microsoft raced higher. During the smartphone revolution, it was Apple. Those who bet heavily on a single titan enjoyed enormous returns—but timing and risk management matter. Investors who bought those names at their peak lost a lot of money during the dot com crash. Investor takeaway: AI is bigger than one or two companies. Proper risk management and proper diversification across the value chain can help reduce risk while maintaining upside potential as long as AI stocks remain in favor. Mistake 3: Ignoring Cycles and ValuationsThe myth of endless growth and this time is different are very powerful.Boom cycles make it feel like the good times will never end. In 2023 and 2024, AI fueled explosive stock runs, with market leaders adding billions to their market caps in months. The narrative was simple: AI will reshape everything, and therefore valuations don’t matter. That mindset is very dangerous. No matter how transformative a technology, growth slows and expectations reset. Even industry titans experience profit cycles, regulatory pressures, and increased competition. Assuming AI leaders will post quarter after quarter of uninterrupted growth ignores how markets function. Why valuation discipline matters in AIWhen investors pay 100-400+ times earnings, they are essentially betting that hypergrowth will continue for years without fail. That leaves no margin of safety. If growth merely slows rather than collapses, stocks priced for perfection can still fall by double digits. Tesla, for example, soared on future-oriented narratives about electrification. Yet periods of slower sales or increased competition triggered sharp corrections in the stock, even though the long-term thesis hasn’t disappeared. AI stocks face the same risk: growing markets, but volatile share prices. Liquidity, rates, and market sentimentAnother overlooked factor is the broader economic cycle. AI companies thrive in markets with plentiful liquidity, like when interest rates are low and growth capital is abundant. Markets and the economy move in cycles. Investors who ignore this reality may get caught in market downturns that can be far more brutal than expected. Investor takeaway: Even the best AI stocks can tumble if valuations get too stretched. A disciplined entry point, and strong respect for risk, matters as much as believing in the long-term story. Putting It All Together: An Investor PlaybookAI is unlike any other technological wave because of its scope, touching everything from healthcare and finance to defense and entertainment. Yet human behavior in markets has not changed, and the same investor mistakes recur. To avoid missteps, investors can build a playbook: Prioritize fundamentals: Separate hype from balance sheet strength. Profitable companies with durable moats offer safer long-term prospects. Diversify exposure: History has taught me that it is usually a good idea not to put all your money in one “hot” stock. Respect cycles: Recognize AI leaders can endure corrections when valuations run too hot—patience, timing, and risk managemnet always matter. Stay adaptive: The winners today may not be winners tomorrow. New stocks come all the time and shifts in regulation can disrupt even dominant players. Measure conviction against risk: Ask whether your excitement is based on headlines—or on sustainable advantages. Conclusion: Riding the AI Wave WiselyInvestors are right to be excited about AI. It will likely be as transformative as the internet, smartphones, or electrification. But the stock market has a way of turning great technologies into poor investments when enthusiasm divorces from discipline. The good news: by avoiding these three mistakes—chasing hype without fundamentals, overconcentrating in one name, and ignoring valuation cycles—investors can improve their odds of capturing long-term gains without succumbing to short-term pain. There is a very strong chance that over time, AI will create trillion-dollar companies. It will also produce plenty of losers. The key is remembering that markets ultimately reward patient, rational investors who separate stories from substance.

Title: Seoul Exchange, One of Only Two Licensed Platforms For Unlisted Securities, Will Exclusively Use Story To Settle Tokenized RWAs

Seoul, South Korea, September 22nd, 2025, Chainwire Seoul Exchange, One of Only Two Licensed Platforms For Unlisted Securities, Will Exclusively Use Story To Settle Tokenized RWAs Partnership set to bring programmable assets to Korea’s $450b crypto market, the world’s second largest by trading volume Seoul Exchange and Story Protocol have entered into an agreement to build Korea’s first dedicated blockchain exchange for tokenized cultural and intellectual property assets. The collaboration outlines how Seoul Exchange will launch a regulated RWA trading platform powered entirely by Story’s blockchain infrastructure for the next 3 years. Seoul Exchange is a fintech company that provides brokerage services for unlisted stocks of startups and venture companies through its unlisted securities trading platform “Seoul Exchange.” It is one of only two platforms officially selected by the Korean government to operate under the financial regulatory sandbox. Seoul Exchange has received investment from leading Korean and global VCs such as Hashed, SoftBank Ventures, Capstone Partners, and POSCO Technology Investment. Under the agreement, Seoul Exchange will use Story as the sole infrastructure provider for registering and settling tokenized offerings. For an initial term 3 years, all listings on the exchange ranging from music IP and webtoons to patents and private securities, will be recorded on Story’s network, leveraging its composable architecture and native $IP token economy. IP is expected to become Korea’s leading real-world asset (RWA) category, with Story positioned as the exclusive chain for Seoul Exchange’s IP tokenization. Story is a Layer-1 blockchain purpose-built to make intellectual property programmable. Backed by $136 million from a16z, Polychain, and Samsung Ventures, Story launched its mainnet in early 2025 and has quickly become a leading infrastructure for tokenized IP. Korea is home to some of the world’s most successful creative exports, but monetizing IP remains limited to insiders. This new trading platform aims to change that. By bringing IP onchain, Story and Seoul Exchange are unlocking a new class of fractional, transparent, and globally accessible digital securities. Global IP is valued at over $80 trillion, yet most of it remains illiquid and inaccessible. This partnership aims to unlock IP and other real-world assets (RWAs) via blockchain, allowing global investors to own, trade, and earn from high-value creative works. Korean storytellers have captured the world’s imagination. Global hits like K-POP Demon Hunter became Netflix’s most-popular film of all time with 236 million views in the first nine weeks. Parasite won Best Picture at the Oscars. Squid Game became Netflix’s most-watched show. Baby Shark is a global phenomenon. But behind this success lies a structural problem: creators rarely retain ownership or share in the long-term upside. Platforms like Netflix own the IP. Studios operate on thin margins. Even as Korean content goes global, the value flows elsewhere.This imbalance has sparked growing debate in Korea, with many voices calling for a new model that allows creators to break free from reliance on upfront financing and pre-production deals. Story is introducing such an alternative through content tokenization. By enabling global fans to directly participate in fundraising, production companies can retain ownership of their IP and instead engage in distribution agreements that ensure fairer and more sustainable revenue models. This approach not only protects creators’ rights but also opens the door to a new, fan-driven economy in entertainment. The platform will combine retail accessibility with institutional-grade compliance under Korean regulations. Should a Korean won-pegged stablecoin be approved by regulators, the platform is designed to support its integration it may be integrated for native currency settlement, further aligning with domestic financial infrastructure. Tokenized content, including music rights, game universes, can be listed and traded by retail and institutional investors alike, all within Korea’s evolving STO regulatory sandbox. Story Protocol is the world’s first Layer-1 blockchain purpose-built for IP. It enables IP to be registered, licensed, and monetized in real time, embedding royalties and usage terms directly into the tokenized representation of creative assets. Backed by investors including a16z, Polychain, Hashed and Samsung Ventures, Story launched its mainnet in early 2025 and has already rapidly expanded its ecosystem and onboarded a diverse music collectives, DeFi protocols, and global entertainment IPs. For example, Story has already begun tokenizing major K-culture IP, including the music rights of leading K-pop artists (BTS, BLACKPINK, Psy, BIGBANG) and global artists (Justin Bieber and Miley Cyrus) Seoul Exchange’s integration makes Story the de facto infrastructure for Korea’s next wave of tokenized RWAs, positioning it as the blockchain gateway for cultural capital. This partnership bridges Korea’s booming cultural industries with the world’s capital markets. The platform will prioritize assets with strong fan engagement and long-term value potential, and will also support future integrations with financial products, remix licenses, and governance layers, bringing programmability to previously static IP rights. JD Yang, CEO, Seoul Exchange: “Through this collaboration, Seoul Exchange has further strengthened the stability and trust in the process of building our STO exchange. We aim to become Korea’s leading STO exchange through a differentiated tokenization model centered on IP and content.” Seung-yoon “SY” Lee, Co-founder & CEO, Story Protocol: “We see this as a landmark step in making Korea’s world-class cultural IP accessible to global investors. Story enables creators and platforms like Seoul Exchange to go beyond traditional licensing models to build liquidity, loyalty, and monetization around programmable IP. Intellectual property is the largest untapped asset class in the world, worth over $80 trillion, and with Korea now the second-largest crypto trading market in the world, the opportunity to pioneer new asset classes is massive. This partnership brings us one step closer to unlocking that value at global scale. With this move, Story will be one of only two chains powering RWAs in Korea, the second-largest crypto market in the world, confirming IP’s place at the center of Korea’s next blockchain growth cycle.” About Story Story is a Layer-1 blockchain purpose-built to make intellectual property programmable. Backed by $136 million from a16z, Polychain, and Samsung Ventures, Story launched its mainnet in early 2025 and has quickly become a leading infrastructure for tokenized IP. The network enables creators, developers, enterprises, and AI labs to register content as on-chain assets with embedded rights, turning media, data, and AI-generated works into legally enforceable digital property. By bridging the gap between outdated legal frameworks and the realities of the AI era, Story makes it possible to track provenance, automate licensing, and unlock new markets for ideas. As the foundation for IP’s evolution into an internet-native asset class, Story powers a more open, equitable, and composable creative economy. Copyright © 2025. All Rights Reserved By Media Fuse LTD

Title: Google faces antitrust déjà vu as US seeks to break up its digital advertising business

After deflecting the U.S. Justice Department’s attack on its illegal monopoly in online search, Google is facing another attempt to dismantle its internet empire in a trial focused on its abusive tactics in digital advertising. The trial that opened Monday in an Alexandria, Virginia, federal court revolves around the harmful conduct that resulted in U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema declaring parts of Google’s digital advertising technology to be an illegal monopoly. The judge found that Google has been engaging in behavior that stifles competition to the detriment of online publishers that depend on the system for revenue. Google and the Justice Department will spend the next two weeks in court presenting evidence in a “remedy” trial that will culminate in Brinkema issuing a ruling on how to restore fair market conditions. “The purpose of a remedy is doing what is necessary to restore competition,” said Julia Tarver Wood in an opening statement for the DOJ’s antitrust division. Wood said that the Google is manipulating the market in a way that is antithetical to free market competition. “The means to cheat are buried in computer codes and algorithms,” Wood said. An attorney for Google, Karen Dunn, countered that the remedy proposed by the government is reckless and radical, and that the DOJ is attempting to remove Google entirely from the competition. No matter how the judge rules, Google says it will appeal the earlier decision labeling the ad network as a monopoly. Appeals can’t be filed until the remedy is determined. The case, filed in 2023 under President Joe Biden’s administration, threatens the complex network that Google has spent the past 17 years building to power its dominant digital advertising business. Besides accounting for most of the $305 billion in revenue that Google’s services division generates for its corporate parent Alphabet Inc., digital advertising sales provide the lifeblood that keeps thousands of websites alive. If the Justice Department gets its way, Brinkema will order Google to sell parts of its ad technology — a proposal that the company’s lawyers warned would “invite disruption and damage” to consumers and the internet’s ecosystem. The Justice Department contends a breakup would be the most effective and quickest way to undercut a monopoly that has been stifling competition and innovation for years. Google believes it has already made enough changes to its “Ad Manager” system, including providing more options and pricing options, to resolve the issues the Brinkema flagged in her monopoly ruling., The legal battle over Google’s advertising technology mirrors another showdown that the company recently navigated after another federal judge condemned its dominant search engine as an illegal monopoly and then held remedy hearings earlier this year to consider how to stop the misconduct. In that case, the Justice Department also proposed a severe crackdown that would have required Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, but U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta decided a less dramatic shake-up was needed amid a search market being reshaped by artificial intelligence technology in a decision issued earlier this month. Even though Google didn’t agree with all aspects of Mehta’s decision, the ruling was widely seen as a slap on the wrist — a sentiment that has helped propel Alphabet’s stock price to new highs. The 20% gain since Mehta’s decision helped make Alphabet only the fourth publicly traded company to reach a market value of $3 trillion — an increase of more than $1 trillion since Brinkema branded Google’s ad technology as a monopoly in April. In an indication that the outcome of the search monopoly case might sway things in the advertising technology proceedings, Brinkema asked both Google and the Justice Department to address Mehta’s decision during the upcoming trial. As they did in the search case, Google’s lawyers already have been asserting in court papers that AI technology being used by ad network rivals like Meta Platforms is reshaping the way the market works and overriding the need for the Justice Department’s “radical” proposals. The Justice Department is “fighting for a remedy that would vanquish a past that has been overtaken by technological and market transformations in the way digital ads are consumed,” Google’s lawyers argued leading up to the trial. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Shares of a semiconductor testing company rose Monday after an analyst highlighted strong demand trends and collaboration with a major chip-industry player. Meanwhile, reports of an impending product safety announcement dragged down shares of a consumer health firm. Major U.S. equities indexes moved higher as plans by Nvidia (NVDA) to invest up to $100 million in ChatGPT maker OpenAI reinvigorated optimism around artificial intelligence. The S&P 500 added 0.4%, extending its streak of all-time closing highs to three consecutive sessions. The Dow ticked 0.1% higher, while the Nasdaq jumped 0.7%, with both setting their own fresh closing records. Shares of Nvidia finished 4% higher. Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here. The day's top performance in the S&P 500 belonged to shares of semiconductor equipment maker Teradyne (TER), which surged 13%. Susquehanna Financial boosted its price target on Teradyne stock, with its analysts saying the provider of automated test equipment for semiconductors and robotic systems could benefit from strong demand trends over the coming years and highlighting Teradyne's increasing partnership with chip industry giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM). White House officials confirmed that Oracle (ORCL) is part of a consortium set to control the U.S. operations of the social media platform TikTok. Oracle also announced that Clay Magouyrk, current president of cloud infrastructure, and Mike Sicilia, president of industries, will take the reins of the enterprise software giant as co-CEOs. Current CEO Safra Catz will remain with Oracle as the executive vice chair of its board, while co-founder Larry Ellison will maintain his role as chief technology officer and board chair. Oracle shares jumped 6.3%. Moderna (MRNA) shares gained 5.2% after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine panel voted on updated recommendations related to COVID shots. While the CDC's Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices removed guidance calling for all people to be vaccinated against COVID and now recommends that patients consult with their doctor before receiving the shot, the panel opted not to require patients to obtain a prescription for the vaccine. Shares of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies (WAB), a provider of equipment for freight and passenger railway systems, added 4.9%. The company also known as Wabtec announced a deal worth more than $4 billion to deliver 300 of its Evolution Series locomotives to Kazakhstan's national railway company over the coming decade and provide long-term service support. Citi analysts initiated coverage on Wabco stock with a "buy" rating, suggesting the company could benefit from increasing infrastructure investment as well as moves by railroad operators to renew and expand their fleets. Shares of Tylenol maker Kenvue (KVUE) dropped 7.5%, the most of any S&P 500 stock, following reports that the Trump administration planned to make an announcement linking use of the painkiller during pregnancy to autism. A presentation on the matter happened at the White House after the closing bell. Kenvue, the consumer health company that spun off from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) in 2023, said that scientific studies show no link between acetaminophen and autism. Social media giant Meta Platforms (META) launched a pair of new features for its Facebook Dating service—an AI assistant that provides support throughout the dating process and a function that offers automatic matches with potential partners based on Facebook's algorithms. Shares of Match Group (MTCH), operator of Tinder, Hinge, and other dating platforms, fell 5.4%. Lennar (LEN) shares fell 4.3% on Monday, extending losses posted Friday after the homebuilder missed quarterly sales and profit forecasts. Following the softer-than-expected earnings results, Raymond James downgraded Lennar stock to "underperform" from "market perform." Analysts suggested that Lennar's margins could remain under pressure, citing the company's use of selling incentives to attract buyers and its elevated on technology and teams.

September 22, 2025 16:30 ET | Source: Rocket Lab Corporation Rocket Lab Corporation LONG BEACH, Calif., Sept. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a leading launch and space systems company, delivered two Explorer-class spacecraft to Kennedy Space Flight Center for NASA’s Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers (ESCAPADE) mission, in partnership with the University of California, Berkeley’s Space Sciences Laboratory. Last year Rocket Lab completed the design, build, integration, and testing of the twin spacecraft, named Blue and Gold, in just three and a half years, an accelerated timeline for a Mars mission. This achievement was made possible by Rocket Lab’s mature spacecraft manufacturing experience and its vertically integrated supply chain, which brings production of critical components like solar arrays, star trackers, propellant tanks, reaction wheels, radios, flight software, and more, in-house. ESCAPADE is based on Rocket Lab’s Explorer spacecraft platform, a configurable, high delta-V interplanetary variant of the Company’s advanced family of spacecraft. ESCAPADE is part of NASA’s Small Innovative Missions for Planetary Exploration (SIMPLEx) program, designed to deliver high-value planetary science at lower cost and on faster timelines. ESCAPADE will deliver critical Mars science at a fraction of the cost and time of traditional billion-dollar missions. During a 22-month cruise to Mars, Blue and Gold will travel together before entering complementary elliptical orbits around the planet to conduct their science campaigns. The spacecraft will simultaneously capture data from two regions of Mars’ magnetosphere. This unique two-point measurement will allow scientists to understand how the solar wind strips atoms from Mars’ atmosphere, offering insight into the planet’s atmospheric escape history and space weather environment, and informing future human exploration strategies. Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, says: “ESCAPADE is a perfect example of why Rocket Lab exists – to make ambitious space science faster and more affordable. Delivering two interplanetary spacecraft on schedule and within budget for a Mars mission is no small feat, and it speaks to the determination and agility of our team. They’ve proven that we can take a concept from design to Mars readiness in just a few short years. This won’t be Rocket Lab’s last time at Mars, with concepts like the Mars Telecommunications Orbiter on the horizon, we’re laying the groundwork for more complex, capable, and essential missions that will support future human exploration.” Rob Lillis, ESCAPADE Principal Investigator and Associate Director for Planetary Science at the UC Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory, says: “It's been a long road, but we are so excited to be launching Blue & Gold on their mission to understand the Martian space weather environment. Through the usual ups and downs, Rocket Lab has been right alongside NASA and UC Berkeley, supporting us every step of the way on this interplanetary journey." Upon arrival at Kennedy Space Center, Rocket Lab engineers will conduct post-transport inspections and functional tests in the cleanroom before propellant loading and vehicle integration. Launch is scheduled to occur no earlier than this fall on Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket. + Rocket Lab Media ContactLindsay McLaurinmedia@rocketlabusa.com + About Rocket LabRocket Lab is a leading space company that provides launch services, spacecraft, payloads, and satellite components serving commercial, government, and national security markets.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Meta announced on Monday that it’s bringing an AI assistant to Facebook Dating. This chatbot is intended to help users find matches who are more closely tailored to what they are looking for. For example, Meta might suggest users ask it to find “a Brooklyn girl in tech,” or a user could ask the AI to help refine their profile. Meta also says that it’s “helping people avoid swipe fatigue” with a new feature called Meet Cute, which gives users a weekly “surprise match” chosen based on its algorithm. The company says Facebook Dating matches among adults ages 18 to 29 have increased 10% year-over-year, with hundreds of thousands of users in that age group creating Facebook Dating profiles each month. That’s small compared to competitors like Tinder, which has about 50 million daily active users, and Hinge’s 10 million daily active users. AI features have already become the norm in mainstream dating apps. Even newer dating apps like Sitch have attempted to differentiate themselves with their AI features. Match Group — the owner of Tinder, Hinge, OKCupid, and others — entered a partnership with OpenAI last year, which is part of the dating giant’s $20 million-plus investment in AI. That’s a big bet, especially given the financial struggles of Match Group, which has lost about 68% of its stock price in the last five years. So far, this investment has produced features like an AI photo selector tool for Tinder, which scans your camera roll to help choose profile images, as well as AI-powered matching. Hinge has a feature that lets users improve their responses to profile prompts with AI. Bumble has added similar AI features, and founder Whitney Wolfe Herd even ruffled some feathers last year when she suggested that one day, users could have personal “AI concierges” that go on dates with other people’s AI to determine compatibility.

September 22, 2025 15:52 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, Sept. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in Novo Nordisk A/S ("Novo" or the "Company") (NYSE: NVO) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Novo investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/novo-nordisk-a-s-lawsuit-submission-form-3?prid=168441&wire=3 NVO investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Novo during the relevant time frame, you have until September 30, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff. NO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. There is no cost or obligation to participate.

Title: Google enters second court battle against DOJ over alleged monopoly

Time Published: 2025-09-22T16:44:46Z

Watch CBS News September 22, 2025 / 12:44 PM EDT / AP After deflecting the U.S. Justice Department's attack on its illegal monopoly in online search, Google is facing another attempt to dismantle its internet empire in a trial focused on its abusive tactics in digital advertising. The trial scheduled to begin Monday in an Alexandria, Virginia, federal court will revolve around the harmful conduct that resulted in U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema declaring parts of Google's digital advertising technology to be an illegal monopoly. The judge found that Google has been engaging in behavior that stifles competition to the detriment of online publishers that depend on the system for revenue. Google and the Justice Department will spend the next two weeks in court presenting evidence in a "remedy" trial that will culminate in Brinkema issuing a ruling on how to restore fair market conditions. Although the judge hasn't set a timetable for making that decision, it's unlikely to come down before the end of this year because additional legal briefs and courtroom arguments are expected to extend into November before Brinkema takes the matter under submission. No matter how the judge rules, Google says it will appeal the earlier decision labeling the ad network as a monopoly. Appeals can't be filed until the remedy is determined. The case, filed in 2023 under President Joe Biden's administration, threatens the complex network that Google has spent the past 17 years building to power its dominant digital advertising business. Besides accounting for most of the $305 billion in revenue that Google's services division generates for its corporate parent Alphabet Inc., digital advertising sales provide the lifeblood that keeps thousands of websites alive. If the Justice Department gets its way, Brinkema will order Google to sell parts of its ad technology — a proposal that the company's lawyers warned would "invite disruption and damage" to consumers and the internet's ecosystem. The Justice Department contends a breakup would be the most effective and quickest way to undercut a monopoly that has been stifling competition and innovation for years. Google believes it has already made enough changes to its "Ad Manager" system, including providing more options and pricing options, to resolve the issues the Brinkema flagged in her monopoly ruling. The legal battle over Google's advertising technology mirrors another showdown that the company recently navigated after another federal judge condemned its dominant search engine as an illegal monopoly and then held remedy hearings earlier this year to consider how to stop the misconduct. In that case, the Justice Department also proposed a severe crackdown that would have required Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, but U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta decided a less dramatic shake-up was needed amid a search market being reshaped by artificial intelligence technology in a decision issued earlier this month. Even though Google didn't agree with all aspects of Mehta's decision, the ruling was widely seen as a slap on the wrist — a sentiment that has helped propel Alphabet's stock price to new highs. The 20% gain since Mehta's decision helped make Alphabet only the fourth publicly traded company to reach a market value of $3 trillion — an increase of more than $1 trillion since Brinkema branded Google's ad technology as a monopoly in April. In an indication that the outcome of the search monopoly case might sway things in the advertising technology proceedings, Brinkema asked both Google and the Justice Department to address Mehta's decision during the upcoming trial. As they did in the search case, Google's lawyers already have been asserting in court papers that AI technology being used by ad network rivals like Meta Platforms is reshaping the way the market works and overriding the need for the Justice Department's "radical" proposals. The Justice Department is "fighting for a remedy that would vanquish a past that has been overtaken by technological and market transformations in the way digital ads are consumed," Google's lawyers argued leading up to the trial. © 2025 The Associated Press.

The move comes as the company shifts focus from generalist AI tutors to specialist roles, after testing workers to assess their strengths. Employees were told they’ll be paid through the end of their contracts — or November 30 at the latest — but their system access was cut immediately, Business Insider reports. Has reportedly laid off about 200 workers, or 1.5% of its staff, as the company braces for the end of federal EV tax credits under President Trump’s policy changes. The $7,500 incentive for new electric cars expires this month, adding to pressure from cooling demand. Despite the cuts, Rivian says it’s moving ahead with plans for a lower-cost model. Is cutting another 101 jobs in Seattle and 262 in San Francisco, just weeks after a wave of layoffs in August. The company, which had about 3,900 local employees before the cuts, hasn’t explained the move and declined to comment. Is trimming another 262 jobs at its San Francisco headquarters, according to a state filing, with layoffs set to take effect November 3.

Will eliminate 221 positions across its Milpitas and San Francisco offices, including 157 in Santa Clara County and 64 in San Francisco, effective October 13, according to filings with California’s Employment Development Department reported by the San Francisco Chronicle.

The AI coding startup recently acquired by Cognition has had a rocky stretch, including a near-acquisition by OpenAI and a reverse-acqui-hire by Google that saw key talent depart before Cognition stepped in.

The Australian software firm was founded 2002. Is cutting about 7% of its workforce, or 47 employees, as part of a push toward profitability, Bloomberg reports.

Title: Google faces antitrust déjà vu as US seeks to break up its digital advertising business

By MICHAEL LIEDTKE, AP Technology Writer After deflecting the U.S. Justice Department’s attack on its illegal monopoly in online search, Google is facing another attempt to dismantle its internet empire in a trial focused on its abusive tactics in digital advertising. The trial that opened Monday in an Alexandria, Virginia, federal court revolves around the harmful conduct that resulted in U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema declaring parts of Google’s digital advertising technology to be an illegal monopoly. The judge found that Google has been engaging in behavior that stifles competition to the detriment of online publishers that depend on the system for revenue. Google and the Justice Department will spend the next two weeks in court presenting evidence in a “remedy” trial that will culminate in Brinkema issuing a ruling on how to restore fair market conditions. “The purpose of a remedy is doing what is necessary to restore competition,” said Julia Tarver Wood in an opening statement for the DOJ’s antitrust division. Wood said that the Google is manipulating the market in a way that is antithetical to free market competition. “The means to cheat are buried in computer codes and algorithms,” Wood said. An attorney for Google, Karen Dunn, countered that the remedy proposed by the government is reckless and radical, and that the DOJ is attempting to remove Google entirely from the competition. No matter how the judge rules, Google says it will appeal the earlier decision labeling the ad network as a monopoly. Appeals can’t be filed until the remedy is determined. The case, filed in 2023 under President Joe Biden’s administration, threatens the complex network that Google has spent the past 17 years building to power its dominant digital advertising business. Besides accounting for most of the $305 billion in revenue that Google’s services division generates for its corporate parent Alphabet Inc., digital advertising sales provide the lifeblood that keeps thousands of websites alive. If the Justice Department gets its way, Brinkema will order Google to sell parts of its ad technology — a proposal that the company’s lawyers warned would “invite disruption and damage” to consumers and the internet’s ecosystem. The Justice Department contends a breakup would be the most effective and quickest way to undercut a monopoly that has been stifling competition and innovation for years. Google believes it has already made enough changes to its “Ad Manager” system, including providing more options and pricing options, to resolve the issues the Brinkema flagged in her monopoly ruling., The legal battle over Google’s advertising technology mirrors another showdown that the company recently navigated after another federal judge condemned its dominant search engine as an illegal monopoly and then held remedy hearings earlier this year to consider how to stop the misconduct. In that case, the Justice Department also proposed a severe crackdown that would have required Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, but U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta decided a less dramatic shake-up was needed amid a search market being reshaped by artificial intelligence technology in a decision issued earlier this month. Even though Google didn’t agree with all aspects of Mehta’s decision, the ruling was widely seen as a slap on the wrist — a sentiment that has helped propel Alphabet’s stock price to new highs. The 20% gain since Mehta’s decision helped make Alphabet only the fourth publicly traded company to reach a market value of $3 trillion — an increase of more than $1 trillion since Brinkema branded Google’s ad technology as a monopoly in April. In an indication that the outcome of the search monopoly case might sway things in the advertising technology proceedings, Brinkema asked both Google and the Justice Department to address Mehta’s decision during the upcoming trial. As they did in the search case, Google’s lawyers already have been asserting in court papers that AI technology being used by ad network rivals like Meta Platforms is reshaping the way the market works and overriding the need for the Justice Department’s “radical” proposals. The Justice Department is “fighting for a remedy that would vanquish a past that has been overtaken by technological and market transformations in the way digital ads are consumed,” Google’s lawyers argued leading up to the trial.

Title: Microsoft reacts to President Trump's shocking $100K H-1B visa fee — "creating anxiety and uncertainty"

Time Published: 2025-09-22T14:05:00Z

There's a lot of confusion surrounding the new $100,000 H-1B visa fee announced this past weekend. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Some of the world's largest tech companies, including Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, had a busy weekend scrambling to provide proper guidance for employees following US President Trump's announced $100,000 H-1B visa fee. The executive order, signed by President Trump on Friday, September 19, went into effect on Sunday, September 21. Microsoft was quick to release a memo to affected employees on Saturday explaining the situation. According to an internal memo (via Business Insider), Microsoft advised H-1B employees currently in the US to remain in place. The advisory for H-1B employees caught outside the US at the time of the proclamation is much more frenzied: If you are in H-1B or H-4 status and are currently outside the U.S., we strongly recommend that you do what you can to return to the U.S. tomorrow before the deadline. The Proclamation was released within the last 30 minutes, so we realize that there isn't much time to make sudden travel arrangements. But again, we strongly encourage you to do your best to return. If you are not able to return, please use this form to let us know about your situation. Please only complete that form if you are outside of the U.S. We want to be able to follow up with each individual and provide support and guidance as they try to return within the next 28 hours. Although H-4 dependents weren't included in President Trump's proclamation, Microsoft also recommended that those employees remain in the US. For those with other visa statuses, including L-1 and TN, Microsoft states that the proclamation will not have any impact. Microsoft adds that it knows "these developments are creating anxiety and uncertainty for many of you," and it asks "that you prioritize the recommendations above" despite the company not having "all of the answers right now." All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Similar memos were released by Amazon and Google, emphasizing the importance of these H-1B visas in the tech industry that relies so heavily on skilled foreign workers. Friday's press conference, in which President Trump and US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick laid out the new plans for H-1B visas, caused a lot of confusion. At first, it seemed like the executive order would install a yearly $100,000 fee for H-1B visa employees. It also seemed like those with H1-B visas outside the US at the time the proclamation went into effect would be affected. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt provided an update on X on Saturday afternoon — well after associated memos from big tech companies went out and employees scrambled to find flights back to the US — stating that "this is NOT an annual fee" and that "those who already hold H-1B visas and are currently outside of the country will NOT be charged $100,000 to re-enter." To be clear:1.) This is NOT an annual fee. It’s a one-time fee that applies only to the petition.2.) Those who already hold H-1B visas and are currently outside of the country right now will NOT be charged $100,000 to re-enter. H-1B visa holders can leave and re-enter the…September 20, 2025 Of course, Leavitt's update comes with a Community Note pointing out that "Lutnick repeatedly said in an Oval Office briefing that this was an annual fee." The H-1B visa program was created in 1990 and was designed as a way to grant temporary worker status in the US. It does not grant residency. Since its inception, companies have used H-1B visas to fill roles with foreign workers that cannot otherwise be filled by US workers. There are 65,000 H-1B visas available each year for workers with at least a bachelor's degree, as well as 20,000 for workers with advanced degrees. The visas can be approved for three to six years. According to a White House press release explaining the proclamation: The large-scale replacement of American workers through systemic abuse of the program has undermined both our economic and national security. Some employers, using practices now widely adopted by entire sectors, have abused the H-1B statute and its regulations to artificially suppress wages, resulting in a disadvantageous labor market for American citizens, while at the same time making it more difficult to attract and retain the highest skilled subset of temporary workers, with the largest impact seen in critical science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. Up until President Trump's weekend executive order, H-1B visa costs included a $215 filing fee and a $780 sponsor fee, paid when the employer submitted a petition to the government to receive a visa. Amazon might have received the most H-1B visa applications in 2025, but Microsoft is in second place. The official White House proclamation didn't name names, but it didn't exactly obfuscate either: One software company was approved for over 5,000 H-1B workers in FY 2025; around the same time, it announced a series of layoffs totaling more than 15,000 employees. Another IT firm was approved for nearly 1,700 H-1B workers in FY 2025; it announced it was laying off 2,400 American workers in Oregon in July. A third company has reduced its workforce by approximately 27,000 American workers since 2022, while being approved for over 25,000 H-1B workers since FY 2022. A fourth company reportedly eliminated 1,000 jobs in February; it was approved for over 1,100 H-1B workers for FY 2025. That "one software company" approved for 5,000 H-1B visas does indeed seem to refer to Microsoft, which in 2025 experienced five months of layoffs totalling more than 15,000 employees, including 6,000 jobs in May and 9,000 in July.

Food insecurity and agriculture in South Asia, including Bangladesh, pose significant threats to the well-being and livelihoods of its people. Building adaptive capacities and resilient food systems is crucial for sustainable livelihoods. This study employs the Resilience Index Measurement and Analysis II framework to construct a Resilience Capacity Index (RCI) and analyze its relationship with food security using data from the Bangladesh Integrated Household Survey 2018. The study applies Exploratory Factor Analysis and Structural Equation Modeling to examine the impact of key resilience components such as Access to Basic Services, Adaptive Capacity, and Assets on household resilience. The findings reveal that access to basic services, land assets, and farm equipment positively influences households’ resilience capacity. However, the presence of livestock assets has a negative impact, potentially due to market volatility, climate vulnerability, and disease outbreaks. Additionally, adaptive capacity has a positive but insignificant influence on RCI, suggesting that without enhancing economic opportunities, institutional support, and inclusive development strategies, adaptive capacity could not be enough to foster resilience. However, resilient capacity enhances food security metrics such as the Food Consumption Score and Expenditure. These findings underscore the importance of policies that focus on increasing and maintaining access to basic services, promoting sustainable land management practices, and strengthening social safety nets. This study emphasizes the importance of focusing on livestock assets to ensure their sustainability by stabilizing the livestock market, improving veterinary services, and providing subsidies to reduce maintenance costs.

Food consumption is a fundamental human need, and a global concern, characterized by a surplus of food in some regions and scarcity in others. It stands as a cornerstone of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), notably SDG-1 (No Hunger) [1]. Achieving food security, which ensures an end to hunger, is essential for human well-being [2]. According to the World Food Summit, food security entails access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food [3]. However, food security is a multifaceted issue intertwined with trade, politics, history, health and nutrition [4]. Countries reliant on imports are often vulnerable to fluctuations in the global market, as international trade can directly affect food accessibility and price stability [5,6]. Political instability and conflict can severely disrupt food production and distribution systems, as observed in countries like Somalia and Yemen [7]. Food systems and access continue to be shaped by historical legacies of colonialism and unequal land distribution, particularly in many developing countries [8]. Moreover, malnutrition exacerbates health vulnerabilities, while poor health undermines households’ capacity to produce or procure food, creating a cyclical relationship [9,10]. Achieving food security, therefore, requires nutrition-sensitive systems that go beyond meeting calorie needs to ensure dietary diversity and adequate nutrient intake [11,12]. Food insecurity, on the other hand, refers to limited or uncertain access to adequate and nutritious food, and the inability to obtain food in socially acceptable ways [13]. It represents a complex challenge that affects individuals and communities worldwide. Many developing countries, including Bangladesh, have recently experienced acute food insecurity. According to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a collaborative initiative involving governments, non-governmental organizations, UN Agencies, civil society and other relevant actors, approximately 9.14 million individuals, or 20% of the population, are categorized in Phases 3 and 4 [14]. These phases indicate high levels of acute food insecurity in certain parts of Bangladesh. The poorest households in these areas face significant challenges exacerbated by factors such as high inflation, reduced earnings, and frequent climate-related shocks, which contribute to the severity of food insecurity among the population [14]. The frequency and intensity of natural, economic, and political hazards affecting individuals, businesses, economies, and even entire nations are increasing [15–19]. The concept of resilience has thus gained prominence in governmental and research contexts. Initially introduced in ecology literature by Holling [20], resilience has since been studied and applied across various fields, including socioeconomics [21]. Resilience is commonly defined as the capacity to anticipate, prepare for, respond to, and recover from shocks efficiently and effectively [22]. Recent studies have expanded this definition to include the ability to manage persistent risk exposure [23]. In the context of food security analysis, resilience refers to the latent capacity of households to withstand and navigate socioeconomic factors, climate variability, and other shocks [24]. Traditionally viewed as an endpoint, resilience is now understood as a continuous process that can either enhance or diminish response capacities, thereby impacting overall well-being [25]. Resilient food systems are adept at adapting to new conditions while maintaining stable food production and ensuring access for vulnerable populations. They mitigate the impact of shocks and stressors, with social and economic factors playing crucial roles in enhancing resilience. In countries like Bangladesh, where a significant portion of the population relies on agriculture, food insecurity remains a pressing concern. The food system is vulnerable due to its heavy reliance on a few staple crops such as rice, wheat, and maize, and its interconnectedness with the global food supply chain [14,26–28]. Disruptions in one part of the system can lead to cascading effects throughout. Moreover, the lack of agricultural diversity and reliance on intensive monoculture practices increase vulnerability to pests, diseases, and climate shocks. Bangladesh is particularly susceptible to extreme weather events such as heat waves, floods and droughts [29], which can severely impact food production and access [30]. Assessing the resilience of communities and households to shocks and threats is crucial as it allows nations to anticipate and effectively address these challenges. Resilience assessments help policymakers and organisations understand how well a community can rebound from adversity. Food security, with its multifaceted and complex nature, has predominantly been studied through vulnerability assessments. However, the methodologies used in these assessments often lack dynamism, which makes precise predictions of potential shocks and incidents challenging [31–33]. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) developed the Resilience Index Measurement Analysis (RIMA) to quantify resilience [6,34,35]. This method introduces the concept that resilience can be estimated as a latent variable through a two-step procedure involving observable factors, even when resilience itself is not immediately observable [33]. Recent advancements by FAO have enhanced this approach by using structural equation modelling instead of factor analysis to estimate the resilience index. Additionally, more variables have been included as proxies to represent institutional and natural environments [36]. Applying the RIMA-II model in Bangladesh offers a novel, structured econometric approach to measuring household resilience, an aspect largely absent in previous food security studies. Unlike traditional vulnerability assessments that rely on static indicators, RIMA-II conceptualizes resilience as a latent variable, allowing for a more nuanced and dynamic analysis of the factors influencing resilience capacity. While RIMA-II has been applied in various regions, its use in Bangladesh remains limited, with most existing studies focusing on food security determinants [37,38] or coping strategies [39–48] rather than the interactions among resilience components. Furthermore, prior research lacks a comprehensive resilience index beyond traditional vulnerability assessments, limiting its ability to capture the complex interconnections among resilience factors. Thus, this study makes two main contributions. Firstly, it investigates the key determinants shaping the resilience capacity of households, which influence their ability to adapt and recover from adverse conditions. Second, it assesses how resilience capacity translates into improved food security outcomes. By situating this analysis within the broader context of rural livelihoods, the study aims to provide empirical insights into the mechanisms through which resilience serves as a buffer against food insecurity, offering implications for policy interventions aimed at fostering sustainable rural development. When attempting to understand and enhance resilience, it is crucial to provide necessary resources and techniques to mitigate adverse outcomes, predict and prepare for shocks and stress, eliminate destructive coping mechanisms, and facilitate recovery [49]. Resilience in environmental and socioeconomic systems is demonstrated by responses to negative events and shocks [21], which encompass transformation, adaptation, and absorption responses [50–53]. Resilience, viewed as an intermediate outcome in socioeconomic studies, integrates capacities such as a household’s or community’s ability to cope with shocks [53]. Recent studies have endeavoured to integrate resilience into various development contexts, including food safety [22,54], well-being [55,56], rural development [57–59], and sustainable livelihoods [60–62]. The articles by [32,33] represent early efforts to define and quantify household resilience in the context of food insecurity. These studies focused on the household as the primary unit of analysis, recognising that crucial decisions regarding risk management made at this level, both before and after adverse events impacting food security [33] introduced a resilience index, treated as a latent variable that cannot be directly observed, and employed a two-stage factor analysis approach using measurable variables. Building on this framework [63] applied a similar latent variable model to measure resilience in Northern Bangladesh, highlighting the importance of comprehensively understanding resilience factors across various capacities. Additionally, d’Errico et al. investigated how shocks, particularly conflicts and climate events, influence resilience measurement [24]. Similarly, Ciani et al. aimed to assess household resilience to food insecurity in a changing environment using principal components and multivariate analysis of panel data. Their resilience index indicated that small landowners and agricultural wage workers exhibited lower resilience levels compared to other livelihood groups [64]. Dhraief et al. conducted a cross-sectional survey employing factor analysis and regression models. Their findings highlighted the significant roles of income and food access, adaptive capacity, and social safety nets in enhancing household resilience, as evidenced by their positive correlations with the resilience index [65]. Conversely, asset possession and climate change showed negative associations with household resilience in their study. However, contrasting findings in other studies have indicated that assets can have positive and notable effects [49,66,67]. Rural households generally exhibit less resilient to food shortages compared to urban and peri-urban households [68]. However, during the COVID-19 lockdowns, urban households experienced higher levels of food insecurity than rural households, yet they were more likely to resort to financial and food-compromising coping strategies [48]. Sassi et al. argued that households often turn to less preferred and cheaper food options during times of food insecurity, which can lead to long-term societal impacts and reduced ability to cope [69]. Large family households are particularly vulnerable to food insecurity, often relying on lower-quality meals and support from family or friends [70]. Ownership of assets also plays a crucial role in the resilience of smallholder farmers, with households possessing more assets generally exhibiting greater resilience to food insecurity [66]. Food-secure households typically exhibit higher dietary diversity and rely less on coping mechanisms, benefitting from adaptive and absorptive resilience capacities along with sufficient income [71]. Previous studies have highlighted that household resilience to food insecurity is influenced by factors such as income, assets, social safety nets, and adaptive capacity, with resilience levels varying across different livelihood groups and geographic locations [32,34,72,73]. However, findings on the role of assets remain inconclusive, calling for a more nuanced approach that differentiates asset types to better capture their distinct contributions to resilience. Despite the growing use of resilience measurement frameworks, studies in Bangladesh have yet to adopt a comprehensive approach that captures the interplay between various resilience components. Although prior research has identified the resilience determinants [48,63,74], few studies have specifically examined the suitability of RIMA-II for the Bangladeshi context [75]. Traditional vulnerability assessments often fail to account for critical dimensions such as access to services, adaptive strategies, and the differential roles of asset types as drivers of resilience. This study addresses these gaps by employing RIMA-II to systematically measure resilience as a latent construct, offering a more integrated and nuanced approach compared to earlier methods in rural Bangladesh. A key contribution of this research is the disaggregation of asset components, land, livestock, and farm equipment, to assess their distinct effects on resilience. This disaggregation is essential, as each asset type contributes differently to resilience in rural Bangladesh. Land ownership is vital for food production and long-term economic stability [76–78], while livestock assets, despite their perceived benefits, introduce risks related to market volatility [79–81], disease outbreaks [82–88], and climate vulnerability [89–92]. Farm equipment, on the other hand, plays a key role in mechanization and agricultural efficiency, making it distinct from the other asset categories [93–97]. Treating assets as a single, aggregate variable would overlook these critical differences in how they contribute to or detract from resilience. This approach ensures a more accurate and policy-relevant analysis of household resilience dynamics in Bangladesh. Furthermore, the use of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to validate resilience determinants has been rare in prior research, emphasizing the need for this methodological advancement. By combining RIMA-II with a robust empirical framework, this study advances the understanding of resilience pathways and generates policy-relevant insights for improving food security in Bangladesh. It is increasingly recognised that one of the most effective ways to reduce or even avert food security crises is to create more resilient livelihoods [24,49]. The Resilience Index Measurement and Analysis (RIMA) was developed within this framework, with pioneering contributions by the FAO [34]. Employing a novel quantitative methodology, RIMA helps explain why and how certain households can withstand shocks and stressors more effectively than others. Resilience, being a multidimensional concept that cannot be directly observed, must be assessed through proxies by focusing on the needs of the most vulnerable groups. The new RIMA-II methodology offers enhanced guidance for successfully planning, implementing, overseeing, and assessing aid. The RIMA II model was employed to identify and study household resilience [36]. The RIMA-II model enables a better understanding of households` circumstances and needs, as well as identifying potential areas for improving future assistance. Access to Basic Services (ABS), Assets (AST), and Adaptive Capacity (AC) are the widely recognised pillars of the Resilience Capacity Index (RCI). Due to the lack of available data on Social Safety Nets (SSNs), our study focuses on the other three pillars. To estimate each pillar, variables were considered based on a literature review, data availability, context analysis, and statistical properties. ABS refers to the ability to meet households’ basic needs and encompasses the quality, effectiveness, and access to basic services [98]. This study assesses ABS through the following components: floor type (X1), wall type (X2), housing condition (X3), roof type (X4), sanitation type (X5), source of water (X6), cooking fuel type (X7), distance to health facilities from residence (in kilometers) (X8) and distance to the market (in kilometers) (X9). AC refers to a household’s ability to cope with and adapt to an unfamiliar situation, enabling them to maintain everyday affairs without long-term disruptions [32,36]. It indicates that more adaptive residents can handle adverse situations without reducing their standard of living [49,99]. In this study, this pillar includes the following components: household head`s employment location (X10), household head`s occupation type (X11), savings (X12), household income per month (X13), household head`s education year (X14), and diversified sources of income (X15). An essential prerequisite for shock response is AST, the second pillar of the RIMA-II model [32]. Assets encompass a household’s income-producing and not-producing assets [98], serving as indicators of the household’s economic circumstances and providing insight into the impact of shocks on households. The proxies used to construct AST include land holding (in decimal) (X16), land value (X17), livestock value (X18), livestock quantity (X19), farm equipment value (X20), farm equipment quantity (X21), and non-agricultural asset value (X22). The RIMA-II is divided into two sections: a descriptive and a causal analysis [98]. The RCI used to assess households and inform policy, is generated through descriptive analysis. The RCI is constructed in two stages. The first stage, the formative model, employs factor analysis of observable variables to estimate attributes (pillars) of resilience. The second stage, the measurement model, utilizes a Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes (MIMIC) model to calculate the RCI based on these pillars while considering the relationships between RCI and food security indicators. The developmental model links resilience to the pillars, while the measurement model focuses on food security indicators such as the Food Consumption Score (FCS) and Food Expenditure (FX). Food Consumption Score (FCS) collects household-level data on the diversity and frequency of food groups consumed over seven days. This data is weighted according to the relative nutritional value of each food group. The main food groups and their respective weights are: staples (weight 2), pulses (weight 3), vegetables (weight 1), fruit (weight 1), meat/fish (weight 4), milk (weight 4), sugar (weight 0.5) and oil (weight 0.5). To calculate FCS, the first step is to sum the consumption frequencies of food items within each group. Next, each food group`s total is multiplied by its respective weight [100]. Food Expenditure (FX) refers to the total cost of food obtained, whether purchased or acquired through other means, including both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. This calculation also encompasses food expenditures on dining out at venues such as bars, restaurants, food courts, workplace canteens and street vendors [101]. FX is calculated by multiplying the quantity of food consumed over a seven-day period by its unit price, expressed in Bangladeshi Tk (1 US$ = 110 BDT (Bangladesh Bank, 2024). Based on the literature and the conceptual framework depicted in Fig 1, observable variables are expected to significantly influence latent variables or pillars. Furthermore, these latent variables are expected to have a significant impact on the RCI. Finally, the RCI is expected to significantly influence food security indicators, specifically, FCS and FX. Previous studies [14,15,19,20,25,29,41–43,76–79] have consistently highlighted the substantial influence of various observable variables on latent pillars, the significant impact of latent pillars on RCI, and the consequential effect of RCI on food security. Consequently, this study proposes the following hypotheses: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332868.g001 The observed variables (X1, X2,.. Xn) used in this study were derived from the Bangladesh Integrated Household Survey (BIHS) 2018. This household survey is administered by Data Analysis and Technical Assistance Limited and designed and supervised by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI). The BIHS sample is statistically representative of rural Bangladesh, covering the nation`s seven administrative divisions: Barisal, Chittagong, Dhaka, Khulna, Rajshahi, Rangpur, and Sylhet. The survey includes 325 primary sampling units (PSUs) or villages, encompassing a total of 5,604 households in the BIHS dataset. Therefore, this study utilises a cross-sectional dataset of 5,604 households to achieve its research objectives. This dataset serves as the basis for assessing resilience through the pillars of ABS, AC, and AST, and their impact on the RCI and food security indicators. Twenty-two measurement items were used to construct latent pillars of the RCI, which is presented in Appendix Table 1 in S1 File. Each observable variable was assessed using a five-point summated Likert scale, where respondents rated their conditions (1 = very poor; 2 = poor; 3 = moderate; 4 = rich; 5 = very rich). The study utilized a quantitative approach. Initially, descriptive statistics were used to summarize and describe the observable variables of the pillars related to the pillars of resilience and food security indicators. This involved calculating measures such as means, standard deviations, and frequency distributions to provide a clear picture of the characteristics of the data. Statistical factorial analyses were employed to test the study’s hypotheses. To assess the factorial validity of the constructs and explore the latent pillars in the data, exploratory factor analysis was performed following [102]. Given the interconnections among latent constructs, we allowed for inter-factor correlation using the maximum likelihood factor extraction method with orthogonal varimax rotation. Subsequently, structural equation modeling (SEM) was exclusively used for descriptive purposes to understand the explanatory power of the pillars and their relationships with the RCI. This approach is a powerful statistical technique that allows researchers to test complex relationships among variables. It was used in this study to examine the linear correlations between the underlying factors (in this case, the pillars) and the latent variable RCI [103]. The formative model, represented by structural Equation (1), links resilience (η) to the pillars (xi). In contrast, the measurement model, represented by Equation (2), is defined by the Food Consumption Score (FCS) and household food expenditure (FX). The upper portion of the path diagram (Fig 2) illustrates the relationship between the resilience pillars, as measured by error εR, and the disturbance term of the structural estimation. The measuring model is represented by arrows pointing toward the food consumption Score and the food expenditure in the lower half of the structural model. Since the estimated RCI lacks a specific measurement scale, a scale has been proposed with the coefficient of the food consumption loading (˄1) set to 1. This assumption posits that a one standard deviation increase in RCI corresponds to a one standard deviation increase in food intake. This determination also establishes the unit of measurement for the other outcome indicator (˄2), alongside the variance of the two food security indicators, as depicted in Equations (3) and (4): https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332868.g002 The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. It utilized publicly available data from the Bangladesh Integrated Household Survey (BIHS), administered by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI). The BIHS obtained formal written informed consent from all respondents prior to data collection. The summary statistics of all the attributes used to construct the resilience pillars are presented in Appendix Table 2 in S1 File. According to the established criteria [102,104], data is considered normal if kurtosis falls between −7 and +7 and the skewness between −2 and +2. However, our results indicate that some attribute values exceed these thresholds, suggesting potential outliers that may be excluded from further analysis. Cronbach’s alpha assesses with which respondents answer items on a scale or subscale [105]. A Cronbach’s alpha score greater than 0.6 is generally considered reliable with values between 0.6 to 0.8 deemed acceptable [106,107]. The reliability alpha value for the adaptive capacity (AC) pillar significantly exceeded the threshold of 0.70, indicating adequate reliability [105]. The other four pillars also demonstrated reliability, with Cronbach’s alpha values greater than 0.60 [106–108]. Following the initial reliability assessment, Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was employed to explore the latent factor structure. The maximum likelihood method was used to identify components and establish the pattern matrix. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy was 0.778, surpassing the maximum acceptable level of 0.5 [109]. The criteria, which include a significant correlation matrix determinant of 0.009, a KMO value of 0.778, and a significant Bartlett’s Chi-square of χ2 = 26648.163, p = 0.000, confirmed the adequacy of the sample size chosen for the study [110], indicating sufficient intercorrelation for factorial analysis. Initially identifying ten factors, we retained five factors that collectively explained 82.68% of the total variance in the data, exceeding the acceptable threshold of 60% [102]. Table 1 presents the pattern matrix, demonstrating how each numbered questionnaire item loaded precisely (values above 0.50 on a single component) onto its respective factor. Typically, minimum item-factor loadings of 0.3 to 0.4 are recommended [111–113]. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332868.t001 Table 1 categorizes items X1(floor type), X2 (wall type), and X3 (housing condition) under factor 1 as ABS, explaining 29.74% of the total variance. Factor 2, labelled AC, includes X10 (household head`s employment location) and X11 (household head`s occupation type), explaining 23.49% of the variance. Factors 3 and 4 are labelled Ld_A and Lv_A, respectively, and explain 11.09% and 10.25% of the variance. They comprise items X16 (land size), X17 (land value), X18 (livestock value), and X19 (livestock quantity). Item X20 (farm equipment value) and X21 (farm equipment quantity) of factor 5 are labelled FE. Although factors Ld_A, Lv_A, and FE collectively represent the single factor named Assets (AST), they are labelled as separate factors based on our country’s perspective. The loadings of the items range from 0.51 to 0.92. Table 2 presents the correlation matrix of the five factors included in the analysis. ABS shows significant positive correlations with Ld_A (0.042) and FE (0.034) at the 1% significance level, as these factors contribute to higher income levels that enable households to afford better services. ABS also negatively correlates with AC (0.028) and Lv_A (0.026) at the 5% and 10% significance levels, respectively, possibly due to market volatility and health-related concerns affecting livestock income and service accessibility. AC demonstrates a significant positive correlation with Ld_A (0.023) and Lv_A (0.035) at the 10% and 1% significance levels, respectively, but shows an insignificant correlation with FE (0.017). Ld_A shows a significant positive correlation with both Lv_A (0.047) and FE (0.072) at the 1% level. Lv_A and FE correlate significantly at the 5% level (0.030). Despite the correlations observed among factors, there is no evidence of significant multicollinearity, as no correlation coefficient exceeds 0.8 [114–116]. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332868.t002 Table 3 presents the findings from the multiple indicators multiple causes (MIMIC) model, which was derived using structural equation modelling. In this case, we consider the broader contextual framework to accurately analyze the 2018 data, which includes ongoing food insecurity, a substantial influx of Rohingya refugees facing acute malnutrition amidst monsoon-related hazards, and deep-rooted structural vulnerabilities such as limited agricultural diversification. These factors influenced both households` potential for resilience and the outcomes observed in our SEM model. Study shows that ABS exhibits a significant coefficient of 0.429, indicating that a well-structured living condition with essential facilities enhances households’ resilience capacity. This finding also indicates that households with better access to essential services are more equipped to cope with food insecurity and recover from shocks. Thus, the study’s findings support hypothesis A: access to basic services significantly influences the resilience capacity index. Our results reveal a positive correlation between ABS and RCI (Table 3), consistent with previous studies [32,36,117,118], which suggest that access to basic services enhances economic opportunities, knowledge, and overall well-being, thereby contributing to greater resilience. In contrast, studies by [53,66,119,120] report a negative association, attributing decreasing service quality as households become poorer in their respective countries. Previous studies have often identified AC as a significant influencing factor [24,65,67,121,117]. However, our findings indicate that AC is a positive but insignificant factor, suggesting that institutional and economic barriers impede the effectiveness of this factor. While education, skill development, access to information, and access to credit are critical components of AC, their impact on resilience is highly dependent on external factors such as labor market conditions and institutional access [122,123]. This discrepancy may be attributed to Bangladesh`s high vulnerability to global changes, significant socio-economic challenges, and limitations in institutional capacity [124–126]. In Bangladesh, people are unable to leverage their adaptive skills for resilience due to a lack of employment opportunities [119,125,127,128]. Moreover, limited access to credit, and financial services may restrict households from transferring their adaptive strategies to long-term stability [43,125,128]. Furthermore, gender-based disparities in access to resources and decision-making power also undermine the significance of AC [54,129–133]. As a result, households in Bangladesh may exhibit lower adaptive capacity compared to those in other developing or developed countries [43,47,134,135]. Thus, our results do not support hypothesis B: adaptive capacity significantly influences the resilience capacity index. The “Resilience Index Measurement and Analysis II” report by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) discusses how adaptive capacity contributes to resilience but notes that its impact may not always be significant in certain contexts [36]. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332868.t003 The critical role of assets in resilience capacity has been widely recognised, as they constitute the most significant pillar for the RCI. Similar findings have been reported by other authors, such as [49,66,67,119] in the context of Malian and Ethiopian households, highlighting assets as the most pertinent factor for RCI, which aligns with our study findings. However, this study takes a more granular approach to segregating the assets into three distinct categories; land asset, livestock asset, and farm equipment, to identify their unique contributions to resilience building. This disaggregation is crucial, as each asset type plays a unique role in shaping a household`s ability to withstand and recover from food insecurity shocks. In the context of Bangladesh, only a small proportion of households own all three asset types of assets simultaneously, making it essential to analyse their individual and combined impacts on resilience. Our results demonstrate a significant coefficient of 0.119 for Ld_A and 0.042 for FE, indicating a positive influence on RCI, thereby corroborating hypotheses C and E. Land assets are crucial for resilience building as they provide financial stability and income through agriculture [76–78,136]. Additionally, having farm equipment ensures household mechanization and agricultural efficiency, which boosts farm production and enhances household resilience [93–97]. Since these assets play distinct roles in shaping resilience capacity, it is essential to calculate them separately. However, Lv_A demonstrates a significant negative value of 0.053 suggesting that it has a significant negative impact on resilience in Bangladesh. Because it has a high mortality rate of livestock due to natural disasters and high disease outbreaks [137,138]. High vulnerability to climate change may, directly and indirectly, affect livestock production systems, resulting in negative asset values [47,89–92,139–142]. Lv_A are influenced by several interrelated factors that exhibit a counterintuitive negative relationship with resilience, such as market volatility, disease outbreaks, high maintenance cost, and climatic vulnerability. During economic downturns or supply chain disruptions, farmers are forced to sell their livestock at lower prices, undermining their financial stability [79–81]. Disease outbreaks, such as foot-and-mouth disease or avian influenza, frequently affect livestock in Bangladesh, resulting in significant economic losses for rural households. Limited access to veterinary care and inadequate disease prevention measures exacerbate this issue [82–88]. Livestock also involves costly sectors such as feeding, healthcare, and shelter, imposing additional financial burdens on households. While land or farm equipment offers long-term productivity gains, livestock requires continuous investment, making it a riskier asset for resilience building. These combined factors suggest that although livestock is traditionally seen as a liquid asset, it needs more infrastructural development to contribute to long-term resilience in the Bangladeshi context. Consequently, Lv_A cannot verify hypothesis D, which suggests that livestock assets positively influence resilience capacity. Our study indicates that RCI positively influences FCS and FX with significant coefficients of 0.778 and 0.688, respectively. That means households with higher resilience are less likely to experience deteriorating food security and are better positioned to maintain or restore food consumption and expenditure [24]. Policymakers should prioritize resilience-building as a core component of food security programming, employing multidimensional frameworks such as RIMA-II in Bangladesh for targeted, long-term strategies. Our results support hypotheses F and G, which concern the impact of resilience on food consumption and expenditure. These outcomes remain robust across various model specifications. The results presented in Table 4 indicate that the model under consideration exhibits a significant likelihood ratio Chi-square of 1200.82 at the 1% significance level. The first chi-square compares the model against the saturated test, while the second chi-square compares the baseline versus the saturated model. The saturated model demonstrates a perfect fit for the covariance structure. According to Browne et al., the root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA) indicates an adequate fit with values between 0.05 and 0.08 [143]. A value close to one on both the Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) and the comparative fit index (CFI) denotes a good fit, as suggested by Hair et al. and Bentler [102,144]. The coefficient of determination (CD = 1.00) also confirms a perfect fit. Typically, for an adequate fit, the standardised root mean square residual (SRMR) should be less than 0.05, as recommended by Hu and Bentler [145]. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332868.t004 Our study results demonstrate that access to basic services, land assets, and farm equipment significantly enhances household resilience. The positive impact of these factors on RCI suggests promising avenues for further research. Future studies could delve into how these components bolster agricultural system resilience, aiding government efforts in designing effective action plans. Exploring potential interactions among these factors could yield insights into the intricate dynamics of resilience. Interestingly, adaptive capacity showed no noticeable impact on RCI, highlighting the distinction between adaptation and resilience. Although our study indicates that livestock has a negative impact on resilience, it remains an invaluable resource for food security, income generation, and financial stability in rural economies. Livestock plays a crucial role in resilience management by acting as a liquid asset during economic crises, enhancing agricultural output through soil fertility and draft power, and improving access to financing. Building resilience remains the most effective strategy to withstand shocks. In developing countries, policies and programs aimed at improving household resilience can significantly advance long-term food security. Humanitarian resilience initiatives should prioritize addressing rural populations` needs, as they face heightened exposure to food insecurity. Study results indicate that prioritising access to basic services such as healthcare, education, and sanitation in rural areas is crucial for fostering local and national resilience. Furthermore, enhancing incentives for land protection and promoting sustainable land management practices can enhance agricultural resilience. Policies supporting agricultural technology and equipment can also bolster resilience. Implementing social safety nets and encouraging farmers to diversify their revenue streams are effective strategies beyond human-centric protection measures. To enhance the sustainability of livestock assets, policymakers should focus on improving the affordability and accessibility of veterinary services and climate-resilient livestock management at the grassroots level. Subsidies on livestock medicine, feed, and improved breeds should also be provided to reduce maintenance costs. Strengthening adaptive capacity requires skill-based education, financial inclusion, and institutional support to foster entrepreneurship and human capital development, thereby creating more employment opportunities and improving infrastructure. Additionally, targeted awareness programs should encourage women’s participation in household and community decision-making, ensuring gender-inclusive resilience-building strategies. However, the data used in our analysis were not explicitly gathered for resilience measurement purposes, which may limit the depth and accuracy of our study. Using cross-sectional data limits the ability to capture dynamic changes in household resilience over time, as it provides only a snapshot rather than reflecting long-term trends. Thereby restricts our ability to draw definitive conclusions about long-term resilience to food insecurity. It is important to acknowledge that, while this study emphasizes the role of land access and basic services in strengthening household resilience, social capital, gender dynamics, and power disparities are also significant, though less visible, factors influencing resilience in rural Bangladesh. These factors could not be explicitly incorporated into the SEM analysis due to dataset constraints. Furthermore, the absence of data related to recent shocks, disasters, or conflicts in our analysis limits the comprehensiveness of our study. These data constraints hinder our ability to examine the impact of acute events on household resilience, potentially overlooking critical dimensions of resilience dynamics. Future research should utilize longitudinal datasets specifically designed for resilience measurement, incorporating multiple survey rounds to capture temporal dynamics. Additionally, integrating socio-institutional variables with real-time data on shocks, disasters, and conflicts will enhance the comprehensiveness of resilience analysis, enabling a more accurate assessment of household responses to food insecurity.

Title: Asset-lite, profit-heavy: How Porter built India’s biggest intra-city logistics empire

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Mumbai/New Delhi: Azim Qureshi’s story is hardly unique. It is the story of millions of people who run small and mid-sized businesses across India. Qureshi, 54, runs a kirana store in Delhi, an operation that requires moving his stock on time everyday, across multiple tranches. Until a few years ago, he relied on a chaotic network of local fleet operators, with varying degrees of success and frustration. “Sometimes they showed up, sometimes they didn’t. Halfway through a delivery, they’d call saying the vehicle broke down, or suddenly, hike the price," he said. One day, help arrived on a smartphone, brought to him by his 24-year-old son. He introduced the senior Qureshi to Porter, a company now known for intra-city logistics—essentially the short-haul movement of goods within city limits. “My son books goods on the Porter app, for supplies from the mandi to my shop, and sometimes even from my shop to customers," the kirana owner said. “It can still be chaotic, but most of the time, it works." Then there is Anil Sharma, co-founder of Newtreo, a food and beverage brand with yearly sales of ₹16 crore a year. For a long time, he found himself trapped in a frustrating cycle of two-day lead times to deliver his ready-to-eat products—energy drinks, non-alcoholic beer, fruit juices among others—to customers. Using Porter brought that lead time down to two hours. “We end up using Porter at least three-four times everyday. We don’t mind paying a higher cost…when compared to a local player, there is also far more transparency in pricing," Sharma said, adding that at times, unorganised transporters hike price by as much as two-fold without any explanation. Newtreo also uses Delhivery, a larger logistics company, for bigger consignments across different cities. “While Porter is really good for intra-city and smaller shipments, Delhivery is more apt for larger orders," Sharma said. In 2014, Uttam Digga, Pranav Goel and Vikas Choudhary, the three founders of Porter, saw the chaos, mistrust, and inefficiency Qureshi and Sharma described. They set out to organize logistics for small businesses by aggregating mini-trucks, inspired by Uber’s ride-hailing model. The intra-city logistics market has always been a tough nut to crack. Orders are small, margins thin, and fuel costs unforgiving. Not to mention the stiff competition from a web of informal fleet operators. But Porter’s bet on an asset-lite model that caters to small businesses eventually paid off—the company was able to turn what looked like a messy, fragmented market into a system that could generate predictability, revenue, and profit. In 2024-25, the company’s revenue surged nearly 57% to ₹4,342 crore; it posted its first ever profit of ₹55 crore, from a loss of ₹96 crore a year earlier. India’s intra-city parcel delivery market, in 2024-25, was estimated at $600–800 million by Redseer, a research firm. Porter leads the pack, well ahead of Rapido, Borzo, Uber, Uncle Delivery and others, with commissions typically at 14–16%, said Mrigank Gutgutia, partner at the firm. That is not all. The company’s good run includes one of the largest fund raises this year— $200 million—from prominent investors including Kedaara Capital and Wellington Management. The round, which pegged the company’s valuation at around $1.2 billion, is yet to close. The capital raise is likely to touch $300 million, with new investors expected to join the cap table, multiple people familiar with the matter told Mint. We spoke to nearly a dozen stakeholders, including lawyers, consultants, logistics experts, investors and founder Pranav Goel to understand how the company cracked this difficult market. Their accounts reveal a story of sharp pivots, structural headwinds, and a high stakes balancing act between growth and profitability. That act would continue to shape the company’s trajectory, going ahead. The unlikely gamblePorter was not always in the business of short-haul logistics. Like we mentioned earlier, the Bengaluru-based company began as a mini-truck aggregation service, first, by catering to deliveries within cities and then foraying into inter-city operations. “While we were new to intra-city, we were ambitious," said founder Goel. “We thought we should also solve for inter-city and larger enterprises within the first year of business. We started multiple businesses which were very different from each other." View Full Image Porter began as a mini-truck aggregation service. Doing too many things too early proved costly. Inter-city and intra-city logistics run on different mechanics. In the first business, operators work with larger shipments, higher margins and the luxury of planning routes a day in advance. Intra-city, on the other hand, is about immediacy—customers expect a vehicle in 5–15 minutes—often for an order worth barely ₹500. Margins are razor-thin, and efficiency depends on real-time allocation. At the peak of India’s e-commerce boom, Amazon, Flipkart and Snapdeal were pumping volumes and capital into logistics. Soon, the inter-city segment overheated. Inefficiencies and cash burn made the model unsustainable, quickly cooling investor enthusiasm. Porter, competing with deep-pocketed rivals such as Mahindra’s SmartShift, was burning way too much capital. The founders pulled back. “The company chose to tighten their belt and took some hard calls to dramatically bring down costs—they shut the inter-city vertical and remained laser focused on their core area," Sasha Mirchandani, founder and managing partner at Kae Capital, the earliest investor in Porter, said. The startup, next, figured out a sweet spot. “The primary issue was severe underutilization. A vehicle, which could do four-five trips a day, was only doing a single trip back then. So, there was a big matchmaking problem between truckers and businesses," Goel recalled. There was a big matchmaking problem between truckers and businesses. — Pranav Goel Inefficiencies ran the deepest when it came to small businesses. “They deliberately focused on small and medium businesses while competitors chased larger enterprise accounts or individual customers," an industry executive said, asking not to be named. “They have built their model on sheer density." Porter’s ‘density model’ essentially refers to better asset/fleet utilization by providing the right vehicle at the right price, through faster order matching using its tech platform. The right vehicle could be a bike for a parcel delivery, and small trucks, or even three-wheelers, for heavier loads. Goel recalled that his team spent months largely on the streets, visiting wholesale markets and interacting with small business clusters. “We would explain how their transportation needs could be done through us. We helped them understand how we could be more reliable; help in bringing down their logistics cost," he said. “We replicated the same process with truck drivers and vehicle operators, assuring them of better vehicle utilization." Porter’s ‘density model’ refers to better asset/fleet utilization by providing the right vehicle at the right price, through faster order matching using its tech platform. Those early efforts worked. Porter says it now works with about two million small and medium businesses every month. An investor Mint spoke to, who didn’t want to be identified, said that Porter’s near-monopoly in intra-city logistics is built on sticky small and medium enterprise clients, loyal truckers, and an asset-lite model. “Supply and demand have become fairly concentrated for them. As the marketplace matured, the unit economics also began to show positively," the person said. The 2018 momentA pivotal moment came in February 2018. The Mahindra Group was scouting for opportunities to invest in the shared mobility sector. It zeroed in on Porter—at that time, it had over 10,000 vehicles on its platform and had executed 15,00,000 deliveries in the previous three years, according to a press statement. Mahindra announced that SmartShift, its on-demand logistics service, would merge with Porter. The auto-to-software conglomerate also invested ₹65 crore in the two entities. More than cash, the deal gave the young startup both validation and muscle in a still-fragile market. It unlocked Mahindra’s fleet, a wider customer base, and hard lessons from the ground. “Logistics is different and complex in every country and being backed by the Mahindra gave them a stronger understanding of the arena. A pure-play financial investor wouldn’t have been able to provide that," said a person involved in the transaction who didn’t want to be identified. Mahindra, according to data from Tracxn, went on to increase its bets on Porter in subsequent years. Since that deal, Porter’s investor roster also expanded to include Tiger Global Management, Vitruvian Partners and Elev8 Venture Partners. The reshuffleBy mid-2023, Porter felt confident enough to revisit inter-city logistics again, with a courier service offering door-to-door delivery. The company took on rivals such as Delhivery and Ekart head-on. In 2023, Porter also reshuffled leadership. Uttam Digga became CEO while Goel moved to an executive vice chairman role. Some market watchers said the move reflected the need for sharper execution, as the company was preparing for bigger strategic bets. “Uttam’s strategy and competency in driving growth, taking risk and operational rigour is unmatched," Goel said, adding that the transition was based on the company’s ambitions and target for the next decade. In 2023, Porter reshuffled its leadership. Uttam Digga became CEO while Goel moved to an executive vice chairman role. Some market watchers said the move reflected the need for sharper execution, as the company was preparing for bigger strategic bets. The transition also coincided with the company taking its foot off the growth accelerator to focus on profitability. Between 2020-21 and 2022-23, losses nearly tripled to ₹175 crore even as revenue grew over fivefold to ₹1,789 crore, according to data from Tracxn. Investors saw the red ink not as weakness, but intent. “The period of widening losses was a function of increased competitive intensity post the pandemic. Porter wanted to focus on growth and ride the online boom. Once they were comfortable with their top line, they made an internal call to bring down losses," said another investor, requesting anonymity. The logistics industry, overall, has also seen a reset— companies such as Delhivery, Rapido, Shadowfax and Shiprocket have turned profitable or have cut losses. This is largely a function of investors backing firms that can rein in burn, Mrigank Gutgutia of Redseer noted. Apart from inter-city logistics, Porter is now planting the seeds for further diversification. It is building out newer revenue streams like packers and movers services (which contributes to 5% of overall revenue), among others. In parallel, the company wants to expand beyond India—it has already started operating in the Middle East and other countries in the Indian subcontinent. A GST squeeze?Despite its successes, Porter faces a fresh challenge: The new goods and services tax (GST) regime. Earlier this month, the Indian government announced rationalisation of indirect taxes, with most products and services falling into two slabs—5% and 18%. But this has created ambiguity for Porter, as its services could be taxed at 18%, up from 5% earlier. View Full Image Traditional road transporters fall under the 5% GST bracket. The GST Council has brought local delivery services via e-commerce operators under the 18% slab, with platforms liable to pay tax under reverse charge if delivery partners are unregistered, explained Ankit Jain, partner at Ved Jain and Associates, a law firm.“This applies to standalone delivery apps like Porter, Uber Delivery or Rapido’s courier services, not to goods platforms such as Amazon or Flipkart where delivery is incidental to the sale of goods," Jain added. Meanwhile, the biggest cost for logistics firms, fuel, is kept outside the GST net. So, logistics firms can’t claim credit on it. This could create a cascading tax burden that inflates last-mile logistics costs. “Every rupee spent on fuel is a sunk cost, pushing up operating expenses," said Kulraj Ashpnani, partner at Dhruva Advisors, a tax advisory firm. However, Porter argues it is a ‘digital Goods Transport Agency (GTA),’ while an offline GTA is simply a traditional road transporter that issues a consignment note and falls under the 5% GST bracket. “We classify ourselves as a digital GTA. The new GST rule seems to be for delivery services meant for convenience of end consumers, unlike Porter, which serves the core goods transportation need for MSMEs," Goel said. “From a first-principles perspective, I don’t think the government’s intent is to tax digital GTAs differently from traditional offline GTAs—that would create a major disparity. A high digital tax would push MSMEs back to offline channels, which may not be the intent," he added. Nevertheless, ‘Digital GTA’ isn’t a formal GST category—it’s an industry shorthand for tech-led platforms. Goel added that the company is evaluating the impact on its business and hoped that the government will come up with clarifications soon. “Much of this extra tax will either get baked into what the customer pays or chip away at what the delivery partner earns," said Satish Meena, co-founder of Datum Intelligence, a research firm. “Platforms themselves can’t really absorb it right now—they’re chasing profitability while pouring capital into growth and new bets." Porter, which has navigated many tricky scenarios in the past, and built its unicorn business on the promise of bringing order to mess, now has a new chaos to cut through.

A pure-play financial investor wouldn’t have been able to provide that," said a person involved in the transaction who didn’t want to be identified. Mahindra, according to data from Tracxn, went on to increase its bets on Porter in subsequent years. Since that deal, Porter’s investor roster also expanded to include Tiger Global Management, Vitruvian Partners and Elev8 Venture Partners. The reshuffleBy mid-2023, Porter felt confident enough to revisit inter-city logistics again, with a courier service offering door-to-door delivery. The company took on rivals such as Delhivery and Ekart head-on. In 2023, Porter also reshuffled leadership. Uttam Digga became CEO while Goel moved to an executive vice chairman role. Some market watchers said the move reflected the need for sharper execution, as the company was preparing for bigger strategic bets. “Uttam’s strategy and competency in driving growth, taking risk and operational rigour is unmatched," Goel said, adding that the transition was based on the company’s ambitions and target for the next decade.

Porter wanted to focus on growth and ride the online boom. Once they were comfortable with their top line, they made an internal call to bring down losses," said another investor, requesting anonymity. The logistics industry, overall, has also seen a reset— companies such as Delhivery, Rapido, Shadowfax and Shiprocket have turned profitable or have cut losses. This is largely a function of investors backing firms that can rein in burn, Mrigank Gutgutia of Redseer noted. Apart from inter-city logistics, Porter is now planting the seeds for further diversification. It is building out newer revenue streams like packers and movers services (which contributes to 5% of overall revenue), among others. In parallel, the company wants to expand beyond India—it has already started operating in the Middle East and other countries in the Indian subcontinent. A GST squeeze?Despite its successes, Porter faces a fresh challenge: The new goods and services tax (GST) regime. Earlier this month, the Indian government announced rationalisation of indirect taxes, with most products and services falling into two slabs—5% and 18%. But this has created ambiguity for Porter, as its services could be taxed at 18%, up from 5% earlier. View Full Image Traditional road transporters fall under the 5% GST bracket. The GST Council has brought local delivery services via e-commerce operators under the 18% slab, with platforms liable to pay tax under reverse charge if delivery partners are unregistered, explained Ankit Jain, partner at Ved Jain and Associates, a law firm.“This applies to standalone delivery apps like Porter, Uber Delivery or Rapido’s courier services, not to goods platforms such as Amazon or Flipkart where delivery is incidental to the sale of goods," Jain added. Meanwhile, the biggest cost for logistics firms, fuel, is kept outside the GST net. So, logistics firms can’t claim credit on it. This could create a cascading tax burden that inflates last-mile logistics costs. “Every rupee spent on fuel is a sunk cost, pushing up operating expenses," said Kulraj Ashpnani, partner at Dhruva Advisors, a tax advisory firm. However, Porter argues it is a ‘digital Goods Transport Agency (GTA),’ while an offline GTA is simply a traditional road transporter that issues a consignment note and falls under the 5% GST bracket. “We classify ourselves as a digital GTA. The new GST rule seems to be for delivery services meant for convenience of end consumers, unlike Porter, which serves the core goods transportation need for MSMEs," Goel said. “From a first-principles perspective, I don’t think the government’s intent is to tax digital GTAs differently from traditional offline GTAs—that would create a major disparity. A high digital tax would push MSMEs back to offline channels, which may not be the intent," he added. Nevertheless, ‘Digital GTA’ isn’t a formal GST category—it’s an industry shorthand for tech-led platforms. Goel added that the company is evaluating the impact on its business and hoped that the government will come up with clarifications soon. “Much of this extra tax will either get baked into what the customer pays or chip away at what the delivery partner earns," said Satish Meena, co-founder of Datum Intelligence, a research firm. “Platforms themselves can’t really absorb it right now—they’re chasing profitability while pouring capital into growth and new bets."

Title: Trump’s $100K H-1B Fee Sends Shockwaves Through Tech And Cybersecurity
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilsayegh/2025/09/22/trumps-100k-h-1b-fee-sends-shockwaves-through-tech-and-cybersecurity/
Time Published: 2025-09-22T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
ByEmil Sayegh, Contributor. President Donald Trump signed a sudden proclamation Friday that no one saw coming. It imposes a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa petitions for foreign nationals outside the United States. The one-time fee, which does not apply to existing visa holders or renewals, takes effect immediately. The proclamation, called “Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers,” also raises prevailing wage requirements and introduces a national interest exception that allows the Department of Homeland Security to waive the fee in certain cases. It’s set to last 12 months unless extended. This order represents one of the most dramatic changes to the H-1B visa system in decades. As with Trump’s tariffs announcement, the proclamation sparked a strong public response. For years companies have paid relatively modest filing fees to sponsor high-skill workers. Now, the cost of a single new petition rivals the salary of an entry-level engineer. The administration says the move is intended to protect U.S. workers, prevent wage suppression and ensure that foreign hires are limited to cases of clear national interest. Many said that the news came out of nowhere and warned that it could harm American innovation. John Trasvina, former general counsel to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, noted that the initial confusion was damaging. “At first people thought existing H-1B holders would be turned away unless employers paid $100,000. Clarification came but the panic was real.” Indian IT industry body Nasscom also warned of ripple effects on U.S. competitiveness and global job markets, pointing out that many firms rely heavily on rotating skilled foreign labor into U.S. operations. While industry leaders focused on disruption and risk, the administration framed the move as a chance to redirect opportunities toward U.S. citizens and strengthen the domestic workforce. Microsoft had already announced more than 15,000 layoffs in 2025, including 6,000 in May and another 9,000 in July. Across the broader industry, more than 144,900 tech workers have been laid off in over 500 separate events this year, according to TrueUp. Meta, Google, Intel and Amazon all contributed heavily to those totals. While the CompTIA unemployment report shows tech unemployment at 2.8% compared to 4.3% for the overall U.S. labor force, those percentages mask the scale of disruption. Tens of thousands of highly skilled engineers and cybersecurity professionals remain on the sidelines. This sudden policy shifts the spotlight toward that available domestic workforce. Federal agencies have also been shrinking as part of efficiency drives tied to the Department of Government Efficiency. Government bodies like the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and Department of Homeland Security have already let go of highly trained cybersecurity staff. Many of those workers are cleared and trained yet now find themselves searching for new opportunities. This policy creates pressure and incentive to reabsorb those citizens into private sector cyber roles where they are badly needed. The fee represents a costly inconvenience for large technology companies, but many can absorb it. For startups and mid-sized firms, the burden may be crushing. Some may choose to relocate development offshore, an option that creates new risks. Innovation in AI, cloud and advanced data science could slow if fewer foreign graduates enter the U.S. market. Worse, cybersecurity work, such as Security Operating Centers, moved offshore is a dangerous recipe for the United States and businesses in general. Protecting critical infrastructure and government systems requires U.S. citizens working on U.S. soil. Moving those functions abroad undermines security and invites potential insider threats from hostile actors. Federal downsizing has already put thousands of cleared cyber professionals out of work. This creates both a problem and an opportunity. On one hand, budget cuts may have weakened agencies responsible for defending critical infrastructure. On the other, the sudden availability of highly trained citizens means private companies now have access to talent that can be integrated into private cyber operations. This policy directly channels employers toward that workforce, strengthening national security by ensuring that sensitive work is handled by Americans. The Trump administration views this move as a way to accomplish multiple goals. It forces companies to prioritize U.S. citizens and laid-off federal workers. It raises the cost of relying on foreign labor and discourages abuse of the H-1B system. It strengthens national security by ensuring that cyber roles are staffed by U.S. citizens on U.S. soil, where clearance processes are more reliable and insider threats are less likely. The policy also generates new revenue that can support reskilling programs, STEM education and veteran transition initiatives. Just as importantly, it aligns with broader efforts like the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification, which require defense contractors to meet strict security and compliance standards by Nov. 10, 2025. By prioritizing U.S. workers and cleared personnel, companies can more easily meet CMMC requirements while reducing risk across the defense industrial base. The risks are equally clear. If retraining programs and certification pathways are not expanded quickly, many open roles will remain unfilled. Startups and immigrant-founded companies could falter or shift overseas. America’s global reputation as the preferred destination for top technical talent could decline. There are also legal questions about whether the executive branch has the authority to impose such sweeping fees and how “national interest exceptions” will be applied. At the same time, the opportunity is real. Tens of thousands of unemployed U.S. tech and cyber professionals are available and ready. This policy could open doors for them to reenter the workforce at higher wages and with greater stability. Whether this becomes a national advantage or a national setback depends entirely on whether America invests quickly and decisively in training, placement and domestic talent pipelines. The $100,000 H-1B fee is one of the boldest shifts in high-skill immigration policy in decades. It came without warning and blindsided even the largest players in the industry. The winners will be companies that already rely on U.S. citizens and have strong domestic pipelines. The losers may be startups, global firms dependent on H-1B talent and foreign nationals who had hoped to contribute to the American economy. At its core, this is not just about fees. It is about how America balances innovation, economic growth and national security. The immediate shock and reaction mirror what we saw with tariffs in past years. Then, as now, markets and companies panicked but eventually adapted. The real measure will be whether the United States uses this disruption as a catalyst to train, hire and secure its own workforce, including veterans and employees laid off from governmental agencies, or whether it allows opportunity to slip away.

Title: What’s Up with the Crazy Flow Volatility at ARK’s ETFs?
URL: https://www.thedailyupside.com/etf/investing-strategies-etf/whats-up-with-the-crazy-flow-volatility-at-arks-etfs/

Competing theories have been proposed to explain why billions of dollars have gone into and out of several ARK ETFs in recent weeks. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com Something strange has been happening to several of ARK’s ETFs recently: Assets have been spiking like blood sugar after a pumpkin spice latte. There has been speculation about the causes, but no one, other than the unidentified traders, knows why. One explanation is that the activity is merely heartbeat trades that were used to wash taxes. Another is that a zealous bunch of retail investors wanted exposure to a few IPOs. But the most interesting theory, from the Financial Times’ Robin Wigglesworth, is that someone gamed the creation and redemption process to ultimately pocket a cool $21 million in just a matter of days. Just before the Bullish IPO in August, someone could have borrowed shares of constituent stocks that are in the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) and used the holdings to create about 70 million ETF shares, Wigglesworth wrote. After ARKK bought Bullish shares in the IPO, the person or group seemingly redeemed their ETF shares for the constituents, able to then sell the Bullish stock at a premium, he said. A twist is that the same thing appeared to have happened ahead of Klarna’s Sept. 10 IPO, “with one crucial, hilarious twist … ARKK didn’t actually invest in the Klarna IPO!” Wigglesworth noted. If the theory is correct, it would be an uncommon approach to profiting within ETFs, said Todd Sohn, senior ETF and technical strategist at Strategas Securities. Many ETFs don’t buy stocks at the time of an IPO, he said. “This activity is happening outside the fund in the primary market through the APs/market makers; they are bearing the cost of the activity.” Other ETF shareholders are insulated from the effects of such tactics, he said. Regardless of what’s happening, it’s interesting. “It’s an incredibly unique situation,” Morningstar principal US equity strategist Robby Greengold said. “Three of ARK’s ETFs have been swept up in these violent flow patterns that don’t really happen anywhere else. This is fascinating to watch unfold, but it’s also extremely difficult to know who’s behind it.” There is a potential downside for other investors in the ARK funds, as the ETFs significantly increased their cash allocations after the share creations. The flow activities showed dramatic changes: Low Point in the Arc: As of Friday, the data didn’t show a massive exit from ARKK, and what’s happening isn’t clear. ARK did not comment on any of the recent flow activity. “Effectively, it’s dilutive to any of ARK’s pre-existing fund holders,” Greengold said of the big fluctuations that hiked cash allocations. “That post-IPO pop wasn’t felt as strongly as it otherwise would have been.” The company, whose parent is the personal finance publisher, would add 15 ETFs to its existing line of six. Big, multinational firms have regional expertise and may be able to swallow the costs, but smaller companies will have a harder time. Investors in YieldMax ETFs may have lost about 11% per year since late 2022, according to a recent Morningstar report. ETF uptake varies significantly across generations. This gap presents a major growth opportunity for the industry. The Federal Reserve’s decision may not have been a surprise, but ripple effects are already being felt across the industry. Generic listing standards for crypto exchange-traded products could open the floodgates for ETPs beyond spot Bitcoin and Ethereum. The New York-based firm is planning to launch some of the first tokenized ETFs, according to a report. The company filled a hole in its fixed-income ETF line — but the timing may not be ideal, given relatively low yields in junk bonds relative to Treasurys, one observer said. Reckoner Capital Management, which added its Leveraged AAA CLO ETF in July, has aspirations of building out a global credit business. As new ETFs launch at breakneck speed, expensive products are raking in revenue. The firm’s founder claims a new ETF using fundamentals beyond market-cap weighting to determine holdings is the next big thing. Funds holding large financial institutions have significantly outperformed broad market indices this year. © 2025 The Daily Upside
