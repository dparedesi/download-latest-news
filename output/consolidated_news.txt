ByNina Bambysheva ByNina Bambysheva, Forbes Staff. Brian Moynihan, the chief executive officer of $2.6 trillion (assets) Bank of America, doesn’t usually make headlines for his crypto opinions. But in February, he did just that: “If they make that legal, we’ll go into that business.” He was talking about stablecoins—blockchain-based tokens typically pegged to the U.S. dollar and, increasingly, the plumbing of global payments. “They” are Congress, which is now racing to lay down the rules of the road for these crypto creations. The STABLE Act in the House and the GENIUS Act in the Senate are dueling bills with a common goal: to bring stablecoin issuers into the regulatory fold, spelling out exactly how much capital, liquidity and risk management is enough. They also aim to clarify which federal or state agencies get to play referee. But there’s another, less flashy subplot: how will widespread acceptance of stablecoins among traditional institutions globally affect the $28 trillion United States Treasury market? Here’s the thing: Treasurys are the backbone of stablecoin reserves because not much else comes close in terms of safety and liquidity. If you’re offering a digital dollar, you need to back it with assets that are as close to risk-free as possible. This sounds a lot like hundreds of money market mutual funds, which are issued by giants like BlackRock, Fidelity and Vanguard and hold over $6 trillion in assets, mostly in U.S. Treasury bills. The big difference is that unlike a money market fund, say, from Fidelity, which might pay you an annual yield of 4%, most stablecoin issuers have so far resisted offering any kind of yield or income to their holders. That’s one reason why Tether, the largest of them, has extremely high margins and reported over $1 billion in operating profit in the first quarter of 2025. Right now, the dozens of stablecoin issuers that exist—though mostly Tether, based in El Salvador, and Circle, headquartered in New York—hold an estimated $150 billion in U.S. government debt, primarily short-term T-bills. That’s a rounding error in the $28 trillion Treasury securities market and a fairly insignificant portion of the $6 trillion in Treasury bills outstanding. Most Treasurys are still held by the U.S. government itself, think Social Security and federal pension funds. U.S. mutual funds, banks and insurance companies are the next biggest holders, with foreign investors accounting for about 30% (roughly $8.8 trillion), led by Japan and China. But Britain’s Standard Chartered Bank, an $874 billion (assets) institution that offers custody for cryptocurrencies, projects that the global stablecoin market could jump from $240 billion to $2 trillion in just three years. Both current drafts of the stablecoin bills explicitly identify Treasury securities with maturities of 93 days or less as one of the few acceptable reserves. That could mean an extra $1 trillion in demand for T-bills in the near term, according to an April 30 presentation by the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee (TBAC), a group of senior bankers, asset managers and hedge fund representatives that advises Treasury officials each quarter. Citi’s research team goes further, suggesting that by 2030 stablecoin issuers could surpass any single foreign country as holders of U.S. government debt. Despite its controversial history, Tether, with $120 billion invested in U.S. Treasurys already, could become the largest holder if it falls into compliance with new regulations. Citi This market upheaval could unfold as the U.S. national debt climbs past $36 trillion, swelling by another trillion roughly every 176 days. Meanwhile, creditors like China and Saudi Arabia are quietly trimming their Treasury holdings. China’s dropped to $761 billion earlier this year, its lowest since 2009, while Saudi Arabia’s have fallen to a year-and-a-half low of $126 billion, reflecting a global rebalancing of reserves and rising skepticism about U.S. sovereign debt. Enter crypto users around the world, in places like Buenos Aires and Nairobi, using stablecoins for everything from paying their rent to hedging against local currency volatility and simultaneously stepping up as a new, eager class of lenders to Uncle Sam. The Trump administration has already made its stance on stablecoins clear. Crypto and AI Czar David Sacks has argued that they could help secure the dollar’s global dominance, and President Trump has pressed Congress to get a bill to his desk before the August recess. “Stablecoins have the potential to ensure American dollar dominance internationally to increase the usage of the U.S. dollar digitally as the world’s reserve currency, and in the process create potentially trillions of dollars of demand for U.S. Treasuries, which could lower long-term interest rates,” said Sacks during his first press conference in February. Additionally, the Trump family’s crypto venture, World Liberty Financial, announced plans for its own stablecoin, which is now apparently complicating the fate of pending regulation. On May 1, World Liberty announced that the token would be used by MGX, an Abu Dhabi government-backed firm, to invest $2 billion into Binance, the crypto exchange whose founder is reportedly seeking a presidential pardon. A couple of days later, nine Senate Democrats, including four who previously backed the stablecoin “GENIUS” bill, issued a statement saying they would oppose the legislation in its current form, Politico reported. But lawmakers had been promoting the idea of stablecoin issuers as ultimate Treasurys buyers even before Trump took office. Congressman Ritchie Torres of New York wrote last fall that more stablecoin adoption means higher demand for Treasurys and, in turn, lower U.S. borrowing costs. Earlier, former House Speaker Paul Ryan floated stablecoins as a buffer against a future wave of foreign selling: if traditional buyers retreat, dollar-backed token issuers could fill the gap. Christopher Perkins, president of crypto-focused investment firm CoinFund, puts it bluntly: “You couldn’t invent a better innovation for the U.S. dollar than a stablecoin. It makes the dollar more available globally. It reinforces it as the global reserve currency. If it gets into the wrong hands, there's due process by which the government can freeze and seize assets. It checks so many boxes: creates buyers for your debt, brings your interest rates lower.” Yesha Yadav, a professor at Vanderbilt University whose research focuses on the Treasury market, is decidedly less enthusiastic about a crypto takeover of the government securities market. She believes that embedding stablecoins into it creates new vulnerabilities. “If the U.S. Treasury market becomes, for whatever reason, stressed, if there are doubts about the U.S.’s ability to make good on its payments, then for stablecoin issuers, it's no longer a safe asset that can substitute as a money claim,” she explains. And if a major stablecoin issuer collapses, it could be forced to dump Treasurys en masse, destabilizing the market. Unlike foreign central banks, stablecoin issuers face genuine run risk: panicked customers can pull funds instantly, triggering immediate selling pressure. Of course, this risk applies to money market funds as well. In 2008, after Lehman Brothers collapsed, the $65 billion Reserve Primary Fund, which held less than 2% of Lehman’s commercial paper, experienced a run and “broke the buck”, forcing it to liquidate its assets. “For the first time, the Treasury market is supporting the moneyness of a payment system by becoming a backstop of an entirely new monetary claim,” Yadav notes. If a crisis hits, will the government have to bail out stablecoin issuers to honor the dollar claims they’ve issued? Policymakers haven’t fully grappled with these questions, and they should, she says. Arthur Wilmarth, a law professor at the George Washington University, raises another concern: “The creation of major new demands for Treasury bills and Treasury-backed repos and reverse repos by stablecoin issuers could cause dangerous shortages of available Treasury bills, particularly during periods of financial stress.” He points to past disruptions like the repo market crisis of September 2019 and the “dash for cash” in March 2020 as cautionary tales. For now, another trillion dollars in Treasury demand from stablecoin issuers might seem manageable. But the landscape is shifting fast. Major financial institutions like Bank of America and Fidelity, which manage trillions in assets, are eyeing stablecoin launches. Visa and Stripe-acquired Bridge just rolled out stablecoin-linked cards across Latin America, and Mastercard unveiled a new platform through which users will be able to pay for purchases with stablecoins and withdraw them directly into their bank accounts. Still, Yadav cautions anyone thinking that stablecoins will become a reliable backstop for the U.S. dollar or the Treasury market: “The presumption that stablecoin issuers will simply fill the gap, is not something that policymakers should be counting on,” she warns. And there’s another potential risk: will banks and other stablecoin issuers limit their reserves to Treasurys? Kevin Lehtiniitty, CEO of Borderless.xyz, believes bank-issued stablecoins could become subject to the fractional reserve rules that banks have long used to turn their FDIC-insured deposits into more lucrative growth areas.

Title: Meta's layoffs were supposed to target low performers. These employees share how it felt to them.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-layoffs-low-performance-cuts-review-cycle-politics-2025-4
Time Published: 2025-05-06T09:00:01Z
Full Content:
Months after Meta's high-profile culling of low performers, the stigma associated with the job cuts still stings. CEO Mark Zuckerberg's push to "raise the bar on performance" saw about 5% of its workforce — roughly 3,600 employees — laid off in a sweeping round of cuts in February. The company said it targeted its lowest performers, but some former employees pushed back on that. Some said they had received positive ratings months earlier. Others said they were on medical or parental leave, mid-transfer between teams, or hadn't received a formal rating yet. Some speculated that conflict with a manager was the deciding factor. As of late April, laid-off employees received severance payouts. The eight accounts below offer a sense of how employees who were let go experienced the cuts and their concern about how it could affect their futures. BI has verified the performance records of these ex-workers, who asked for anonymity because they fear the "low performer" label could hurt future job prospects. A Meta spokesperson reiterated what the company previously shared with BI earlier this year about its low-performer cuts: "Let me be clear, these were performance-based terminations," the spokesperson said. "Prior ratings were not downgraded. Simply because someone had a history of meeting or exceeding expectations does not mean they continue to consistently meet the bar." The spokesperson added that Meta employees are held accountable to a goal-based culture of high performance. A former employee in Meta's human resources division had returned to work after being on parental leave for nearly five months when his division lost close to 10% of its staff. His midyear review put him "At or Above Expectations" — the middle tier — but his year-end rating was "Meets Most," which made him eligible for termination. "I tried calling my boss immediately, but in my heart, I knew it probably wasn't an error — Meta wouldn't make a mistake that significant." He said the manager was distressed but repeated: "I can't say anything. It's just part of Mark's mandate. It's a hard year." He said he didn't know why his rating had fallen. "We can't even see the feedback our managers wrote for us," he said. "Once the shock wore off, there was actually a mix of emotions — including some relief at being freed from that situation." But he does worry about carrying the low-performer label. "It's one thing to be let go in a restructuring," he said. "It's another to have your professional reputation potentially damaged by being mischaracterized as an underperformer." A former senior machine learning engineer at Meta described the shock of being laid off, only for a Meta recruiter to invite her to reapply three days later and skip the interview process. "Same email address. Same person. No acknowledgment of what had just happened. It felt surreal," she said. She said she joined Meta in early 2024 and earned a midyear review of "At or Above Expectations." Initially rated "Meets All Expectations" in the January 2025 year-end review, she was downgraded to "Meets Most Expectations" after a second round of director-level reviews. She said she suspects "directors were under pressure to hit a layoff quota." Before the layoff, she was dissatisfied with her manager and sought a transfer to a top-tier team. It was approved, but she was told the move could lower her rating, so she waited — only to be pink-slipped. She said she's not taking the recruiter up on her offer. Ultimately, she's confident she can land or create her next opportunity. "I'll be fine. I can get another job or start something of my own." This software engineer who joined Meta in May 2024 to work on cross-platform content sharing said a promising start unraveled because of internal politics over a new feature he prototyped. He said he took a four-month leave for burnout in August and returned in December to complete two more projects. Two weeks before the layoffs, he said, his new manager told the team everyone was "safe." Then came the termination email — and a performance rating of "Meets Some Expectations," low on Meta's end-of-year rating scale. "How could they evaluate my performance when I'd only worked 10 weeks in 2024?" he said, adding that an HR director had said he was "too new to evaluate." Although he's now fielding interest from other companies and expects to receive 16 weeks of severance, he still feels the sting of his rating. "The harmful 'low performer' label still feels wrong," he said. This product manager joined Facebook as a contractor in 2018, converted to full time in 2020, and consistently received a year-end "Greatly Exceeds Expectations" ratings label. In 2023, when she moved to Reality Labs, "everything changed," she said. "My manager would call late at night to question my capabilities and create doubt, even though teammates gave me positive feedback," she said. A review in early 2024 dropped her two tiers to "Meets All Expectations." Feedback included accusations that she was "blinded" by a "desire for promotion," she said. In August, she took a 12-week disability leave "because I was physically ill from all the stress." She returned in November and was laid off in February. She's being "selective" in her hunt for a new job. "The experience damaged my health, affected my family, and forced me onto medication for anxiety. I need to walk away from toxicity at the first sign, not wait until it affects my health and family again." A technical program manager was laid off after seven years of good performance ratings at Meta. A reorganization placed her under a new manager a few months earlier — a shift she felt exposed her. "When managers have to meet quotas and choose someone to cut, people with less history on the team are at higher risk," she said. "I contacted my manager in shock" after the termination notice, she said. "I just wanted five minutes to talk to ensure I wasn't going crazy." The manager responded with a templated email — the same company-approved language she had been required to use the day before when laying off her own direct report. She still doesn't know exactly what led to their selection. "Was it because I had significant equity vested when the stock price was low?" she said. " Was it because I expressed disappointment about Meta rolling back DEI programs on internal forums? I'll never know — but there's clearly more to this story than simply cutting the lowest performers." After 14 years at Google and three at Meta, a program manager said she was laid off despite a strong performance record: "At Meta, I'd even received 'Exceeds Expectations' and the rare 'Redefines Expectations.'" She said her manager told her she was doing "a great job" at the midyear review. "I was candid with my manager — sometimes critically, but always constructively — about where I thought things could improve," she said. "I was transparent about how stress in my personal life was affecting me: My husband had been laid off, and we were caring for a special-needs child." She said her manager told her not to worry, but she'd noticed a shift in tone at Meta — for example, when chief technology officer Andrew "Boz" Bosworth said a worker who alleged mistreatment should just quit. "The compassionate tone of the 2022 layoffs — the regret, the messaging about hard decisions — feels like a distant memory," she said. "This round was cutthroat. Silent. Cold. 'The Hunger Games,' but for high performers." "I wrote a final email to my skip-level manager," she added. "Not to get my job back. Not even to get a reply (I didn't). I just wanted to be heard. To say: I know I did good work. I know I didn't deserve this. And I hope someone — anyone — in leadership still has the humanity to care." This employee spent years working on critical internal systems. In the days before the layoffs, he focused on ensuring everything would run smoothly. He had received consistently strong performance ratings and said his managers agreed he was on track, but his termination letter assigned him a "Meets Most Expectations" rating. He said his managers didn't look at the self-review he submitted. "That told me everything. This wasn't about performance," he said. "This was about filling quotas." The manager expressed support for the decision, but said there were constraints around time and communication. In his view, the company culture had grown increasingly cutthroat, with employees clinging to projects to boost their ratings, jockeying within the performance curve, and seeing dissent increasingly punished. "Many people stay because the compensation is hard to walk away from, not because they believe in the mission. I was one of them. It was a place that offered scale and learning, but at a steep emotional cost," he said, adding that his healthy salary would have made him "an easy target" for cost-cutters. An engineer was laid off after five months of leave for a serious health crisis while in the middle of disability-related negotiations. He said his final performance rating — "Meets Most Expectations" — felt like "a scarlet letter." "I wasn't underperforming," he said. Peer reviews before the leave had been entirely positive, and he saved "screenshots of it all for my lawyer." His compensation exceeded $500,000, making him the highest-paid person on the team after his manager. He said he worked 60 to 75 hours before falling ill, but he sensed resentment after raising burnout concerns and stepping away from a major project. "And after the layoff? Nothing. My manager didn't even say goodbye." He said Meta's branding of laid-off workers as low performers "sets a dangerous precedent — companies can quietly rewrite the story of your career, and you don't get to fight back." He's exploring legal options. "Meta is telling one story," he said. "And for many of us, it's not the truth." Have a tip?

Title: UK's Deliveroo to be bought by US firm DoorDash for £2.9bn

Deliveroo, the food delivery app, has agreed to be taken over by US giant DoorDash in a deal valuing the business at £2.9bn. The combined company will have a presence in more than 40 countries serving about 50 million customers per month. The tie-up is also expected to provide fierce competition to rivals Just Eat and Uber Eats in the UK. However, the deal is the latest example of a UK-listed company being taken over by a US firm, fuelling further concerns over UK investment. DoorDash is offering 180p per Deliveroo share, which marks a 44% increase on the UK company's share price from the point when takeover talks were made public last month. However, it is well below the 390p share price that Deliveroo first floated at when it launched on the London Stock Exchange in April 2021. "The combination with Deliveroo will strengthen DoorDash's position as a leading global platform in local commerce," the two firms said. Will Shu, chief executive and co-founder of Deliveroo, said he was "very proud of everything we have achieved as a standalone business". However, he said the deal with DoorDash, which is based in San Francisco, was "transformative". "The enlarged group will have the scale to invest in product, technology and the overall consumer value proposition." The takeover is to be put forward to shareholders for final approval. Mr Shu, is set to receive about £172.4m for his 6.4% stake. Deliveroo, which was co-founded by Mr Shu in 2013, operates in nine countries with more 130,000 delivery riders. It provides a food delivery service by linking restaurants with customers through an app. It also supplies groceries. It made sales of about £2bn in 2024, while DoorDash, which was set up in the same year, made some £8bn last year through its operations in more than 30 countries. The companies both started out as food delivery services, offering customers convenient and quick access to a range of restaurants and takeaways, but DoorDash has grown into a much bigger business. DoorDash has seen its value soar after listing in the US, compared to Deliveroo, which has been listed in the UK. The takeover raises further questions for the London Stock Exchange, which has lost another big name to a US company. As well as takeovers, UK-listed firms worth hundreds of billions of pounds have been quitting the London Stock Exchange for the US over the past few years, prompting concerns over how attractive the UK is for investment. These include Cambridge-based microchip giant Arm Holdings, which now sells its shares in New York, Paddy Power's owner Flutter and equipment hire giant Ashtead. One of Deliveroo's first backers, Danny Rimer of Index Ventures, previously told the BBC that if he had his time again he would have voted for a US listing. News of a potential agreement between the firms emerged just over a week ago, and sent Deliveroo's share price up sharply. Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said DoorDash was aiming to "squeeze out" rivals such as Just Eat and "rattle Uber" in the UK. "The deal, expected to close later this year, could turn the UK market into a fierce two-horse race with DoorDash and Uber at the top," he added. "With no competing bid in sight, this looks like a bold, calculated move to outpace global rivals and gain ground fast." Oury Amadou Diallo, 22, did not have licence for modified bike classed as motorcycle, court hears. David Nicholson rents a school kitchen out of hours and cooks meals that are sold on Deliveroo app. Councillors say action is needed from companies to avoid the safety risks being posed to shoppers. Illegally converted bikes are linked to fires while charging, often overnight in users' homes. The London Fire Brigade says e-bikes and e-scooters are the capital's fastest growing fire risk.

Title: Deliveroo deal shows UK still can't hang on to big firms

Time Published: 2025-05-06T08:00:05Z

The takeover of Deliveroo by its US counterpart DoorDash is an illuminating example of the differing fortunes and attractions of US and UK stock markets. DoorDash's offer for Deliveroo values the business at £2.9bn and will create a company with operations in more than 40 countries. While both are similar companies, their fortunes have dramatically diverged over the past few years. Both started out as food delivery services offering customers convenient and speedy access to their favourite restaurants and offering restaurants the ability to more fully utilise the capacity of their kitchens. Both extended their offerings to include other convenience shopping items – like nappies, flowers and pet food. Both raised money by selling shares to the public in an initial public offering (IPO) around the same time – Deliveroo on the London stock market, DoorDash on the New York Stock Exchange. But when Deliveroo listed its shares in London, DoorDash was worth five times as much as its UK counterpart. Four years later DoorDash was worth 35 times as much. This is not a perfect comparison as DoorDash has issued more shares to raise money to expand over time which would boost its total value – its market capitalisation. But the appetite for shares in the US company meant that it could successfully raise that money on US markets. Let's look at another measure – the price of each share. An investor who bought a share of DoorDash has seen its value rise 84%. An investor who bought a share of Deliveroo has seen its value fall 56%. What this means is that DoorDash is now in a position to use its greater financial heft to take over its UK rival – just as Deliveroo is finally turning a profit. One of Deliveroo's first backers, Danny Rimer of Index Ventures, told the BBC in 2023 that if he had his time again he would have voted for a US listing, and people close to the company agree that the current takeover bid was partly enabled by DoorDash's access to US capital markets. This is just one example which helps explain a wider problem. Companies are increasingly shunning the London stock market in favour of a US listing. There are many reasons. Higher valuation. The 500 largest publicly traded US companies (S&P 500) are worth, on average, 28 times the profit they make in a year. The 100 largest publicly traded UK companies (the FTSE 100) sell for 12 times their yearly earnings. Less than half. How can there be such a huge disparity? Partly because the US is home to most of the world's most successful and profitable companies – the so-called Magnificent Seven (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla) Take those out and shares trade at 20 times earnings – still a massive premium to the UK. One of the other reasons UK valuations lag is old-fashioned lack of demand. UK investors' appetite for UK stocks has shrivelled. Over the last 30 years, the share of the UK market owned by UK financial institutions has shrunk from 50% to less than 5%. This is partly because financial regulation has encouraged pension funds to buy less risky investments like government bonds. But it's also partly because the managers of those pension funds think they will get better returns investing in US markets – and they have been dead right. In just the last five years, the total return including dividends on investing in US shares has been 116% while the same number for the UK is 45%. But there are changes afoot. The government's so-called "Edinburgh Reforms", designed to make listing in the UK more attractive, included reducing the proportion of a company available for sale to the public and retaining more voting power for founders who wanted to keep control of the company even as they sold stakes to others. There have also been positive comments on the attractiveness of the UK from financial giants like Larry Fink of BlackRock and Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan. They both noted the UK looks undervalued and the UK market has outperformed the US so far this year. The secret that UK stocks are cheap has been out there for some time. That is precisely why private buyers from the US and elsewhere have swooped on UK-listed companies meaning they disappear from the UK stock market. Even some of the biggest ones left are considered candidates for a move. Shell boss Wael Sawan told the BBC that while he had "no immediate" plans to move, he and his company "got a very warm welcome" when they held their big reception for investors in New York. Shell trades at a 35% discount to its US-listed peers and many of its shareholders aren't happy about it. What the DoorDash swoop on Deliveroo seems to highlight once again is that companies listed in the US can summon greater financial firepower with which to expand or acquire their rivals. Deliveroo will join the likes of Arm Holdings, Morrisons, CRH Holdings, Ultra, Meggitt and many others as companies who used to be listed on the London Stock Exchange. Does it matter? Pension funds, or individual investors, can buy shares whether they are listed in the UK, US or one of the European exchanges. But a UK listing generates significant ancillary business for a UK financial services industry that still makes up more than 10% of the UK's entire economy and contributes more than 10% of all taxes paid here.

Title: Deliveroo deal shows UK still can't hang on to big firms

Time Published: 2025-05-06T08:00:05Z
Full Content:
The takeover of Deliveroo by its US counterpart DoorDash is an illuminating example of the differing fortunes and attractions of US and UK stock markets. DoorDash's offer for Deliveroo values the business at £2.9bn and will create a company with operations in more than 40 countries. While both are similar companies, their fortunes have dramatically diverged over the past few years. Both started out as food delivery services offering customers convenient and speedy access to their favourite restaurants and offering restaurants the ability to more fully utilise the capacity of their kitchens. Both extended their offerings to include other convenience shopping items – like nappies, flowers and pet food. Both raised money by selling shares to the public in an initial public offering (IPO) around the same time – Deliveroo on the London stock market, DoorDash on the New York Stock Exchange. But when Deliveroo listed its shares in London, DoorDash was worth five times as much as its UK counterpart. Four years later DoorDash was worth 35 times as much. This is not a perfect comparison as DoorDash has issued more shares to raise money to expand over time which would boost its total value – its market capitalisation. But the appetite for shares in the US company meant that it could successfully raise that money on US markets. Let's look at another measure – the price of each share. An investor who bought a share of DoorDash has seen its value rise 84%. An investor who bought a share of Deliveroo has seen its value fall 56%. What this means is that DoorDash is now in a position to use its greater financial heft to take over its UK rival – just as Deliveroo is finally turning a profit. One of Deliveroo's first backers, Danny Rimer of Index Ventures, told the BBC in 2023 that if he had his time again he would have voted for a US listing, and people close to the company agree that the current takeover bid was partly enabled by DoorDash's access to US capital markets. This is just one example which helps explain a wider problem. Companies are increasingly shunning the London stock market in favour of a US listing. There are many reasons. Higher valuation. The 500 largest publicly traded US companies (S&P 500) are worth, on average, 28 times the profit they make in a year. The 100 largest publicly traded UK companies (the FTSE 100) sell for 12 times their yearly earnings. Less than half. How can there be such a huge disparity? Partly because the US is home to most of the world's most successful and profitable companies – the so-called Magnificent Seven (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla) Take those out and shares trade at 20 times earnings – still a massive premium to the UK. One of the other reasons UK valuations lag is old-fashioned lack of demand. UK investors' appetite for UK stocks has shrivelled. Over the last 30 years, the share of the UK market owned by UK financial institutions has shrunk from 50% to less than 5%. This is partly because financial regulation has encouraged pension funds to buy less risky investments like government bonds. But it's also partly because the managers of those pension funds think they will get better returns investing in US markets – and they have been dead right. In just the last five years, the total return including dividends on investing in US shares has been 116% while the same number for the UK is 45%. But there are changes afoot. The government's so-called "Edinburgh Reforms", designed to make listing in the UK more attractive, included reducing the proportion of a company available for sale to the public and retaining more voting power for founders who wanted to keep control of the company even as they sold stakes to others.

Title: DoorDash agrees to buy Deliveroo in $3.9bn deal
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/05/06/doordash-agrees-to-buy-deliveroo-in-39bn-deal/
Time Published: 2025-05-06T07:32:27Z

DoorDash has agreed to buy UK-based food-delivery platform Deliveroo for an equity value of about £2.9 billion (€3.4 billion), as the US company pushes into more overseas markets. DoorDash has offered £1.80 in cash for each Deliveroo share, the company said in a statement on Tuesday, confirming the terms of an offer announced on April 25th. That’s a 29 per cent premium to Deliveroo’s closing share price on April 24. The deal is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval. DoorDash, which controls two-thirds of the restaurant delivery market in the US, will expand its reach to more than 40 countries with the acquisition, it said. The two companies combined had a gross order value of about $90 billion last year and have a combined 50 million monthly active users. Deliveroo shares closed at £172.10 on Friday in trading in London, where markets were closed on Monday. The stock is up 21 per cent this year. DoorDash’s shares also advanced, closing at $205.40 on Monday, taking gains for the year to 22 per cent. DoorDash said that its offer is final and won’t be increased unless another bidder comes in for the UK company. Previous negotiations had ended in disagreement over Deliveroo’s valuation, Reuters reported last year. DoorDash, which provides a restaurant delivery service through a mobile application, said it would not increase its offer, but reserved a right to do so if a third party emerged with a competing offer for Deliveroo. The acquisition will help Doordash grow its market share in Europe, competing against Just Eat and Uber Eats. Britain and Ireland are Deliveroo’s largest market, accounting for 62% of the value of its orders in its latest quarter. Deliveroo’s directors, including chief executive officer Will Shu, have agreed to offer their shares in the deal, and DoorDash said it has agreements from investors representing 15.4 per cent of the stock so far. The deal needs the approval of owners representing 75 per cent of Deliveroo’s shares. The proposal is the latest example of consolidation in the industry, after Prosus in February agreed to buy Amsterdam’s Just Eat Takeaway. Food delivery companies are being pushed to combine after rapid acceleration during the Covid-19 pandemic lost steam in the years following. A new generation of global players with deep pockets are now competing for customers across borders. Deliveroo shares dropped in March after projecting earnings that fell far below analysts’ estimates, and the company exited the Hong Kong market, following disappointing sales and mounting competition. - Reporting: Bloomberg/Reuters Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: WPP Prepares to Kill Off GroupM Name to Make Way for WPP Media

We deliver! Get curated industry news straight to your inbox. Subscribe to Adweek newsletters. WPP is set to retire its GroupM brand, which houses its media agencies, renaming it WPP Media, per several industry reports. ADWEEK also learned of the decision to sunset the 20-year-old name from a source with knowledge of the matter. A WPP spokesperson told ADWEEK: “We don’t comment on speculation.” Switching out the 20-year-old name is set to occur before summer, and follows what WPP chief executive (CEO) Mark Read described in the company’s annual report as a “year of transition” for the media investment division under new CEO Brian Lesser, who joined in September 2024. GroupM employs around 40,000 people, more than a third of WPP’s total global workforce. Ad Age reported that there will be layoffs as part of the process, related to the consolidation of individual media agency teams. WPP declined to comment on any reduction in staff. Just now, GroupM operates with a core group of four global agencies: Mindshare, Wavemaker, EssenceMediacom, and T&Pm. It also offers cross-channel performance via GroupM Nexus, data solutions through Choreograph, and entertainment services via GroupM Motion Entertainment. Per WPP’s website, GroupM manages $63 billion worth of media budgets. Major clients include Amazon and Unilever. Coca-Cola is also a key account, however WPP recently lost the soda giant’s North American media business to rival Publicis Groupe. Lesser revamped GroupM’s leadership restructure in January 2025, axing global CEO positions for individual agencies and naming McKinsey & Company’s Emily Del Greco global chief operating officer (COO). Read recently told ADWEEK that GroupM was a key player in WPP’s turnaround plan as it posted a 5% Q1 2025 revenue dip amid ongoing financial struggles. Year-on-year revenue declined at GroupM for the quarter too, with growth in the U.S. offset by client losses from “previous years” and weakness in China. “At its best, GroupM is extremely competitive. We just need to make sure they’re on their best every day of the week,” Read said at the end of April. Mark Read is Still Banking on a GroupM Turnaround The CEO’s six-year tenure at WPP has been marked by consolidation to cut operating costs. One big change on the creative side involved bringing together VML and Y&R with Wunderman Thomson under the VML brand. On the media side, Read merged digital media agency Essence and media buying firm Mediacom to form EssenceMediacom. He also merged five of WPP’s branding and design agencies into Superunion, which was then combined with Design Bridge to create Design Bridge and Partners. Rebecca is Adweek's Europe brand editor.

The expansion brings Spark’s total value locked (TVL) to $2.4 billion, making it the leading on-chain allocator, per DeFiLlama data. The allocation follows the conclusion of Spark’s "Tokenization Grand Prix," a months-long initiative that awarded capital to three RWA protocols: BlackRock/Securitize’s BUIDL, Superstate’s USTB, and Centrifuge-Anemoy’s JTRSY. “The expanded capital base comes at a time of growing institutional and retail momentum in onchain finance, particularly across Asia Pacific and emerging markets,” the platform shared in a statement with Decrypt. The initial $1 billion allocation, finalized following a Sky governance vote on April 3, deployed $500 million to BUIDL, $300 million to USTB, and $200 million to JTRSY. Spark’s Liquidity Layer automates liquidity provision for USDC, among other stablecoins, directly from Sky across various networks and protocols. The new funds are being distributed to the same recipients as Spark’s original $1 billion Tokenization Grand Prix. The latest allocation offers a clearer picture of how tokenized RWAs, primarily short-term U.S. Treasuries, are being actively adopted as primary reserves by major DeFi protocols seeking to stabilize yields and reduce exposure to crypto-native volatility. The Tokenization Grand Prix, launched in July 2024, was an open call for asset issuers to propose RWA products for Spark’s stablecoin-backed treasury. Thirty-nine applications were reviewed by Steakhouse Financial, a firm embedded in the Spark ecosystem with experience underwriting RWA protocols. Evaluations focused on liquidity, pricing transparency, and alignment with Spark’s goal of integrating low-volatility, yield-generating assets into DeFi. The assets were onboarded via the Spark Liquidity Layer (SLL), which holds stablecoins including USDC, USDS, sUSDS, USDe, and sUSDe. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund holds approximately $2.81 billion in tokenized U.S. Treasuries, making it the largest among the three. Superstate’s USTB follows with $490.7 million, while Centrifuge’s JTRSY stands at $237.1 million, according to DeFiLlama data. All three funds are backed by short-duration government debt and structured to reinvest as securities mature. Spark’s role within Sky, a rebranded MakerDAO, has grown since the governance overhaul was announced in August 2024. Now operating as a standalone “Star” (Sky’s designation for modular sub-protocols), Spark has reported around $40 million in revenue in Q1 2025 and launched a USDC Savings Vault, which has attracted more than $41 million in deposits, according to the protocol. The protocol also expanded to Arbitrum and Base earlier this year. While many DeFi protocols have explored exposure to sovereign debt, Spark’s combined $2.4 billion deployment places it ahead of peers. RWA.xyz data shows that total tokenized U.S. Treasury assets across protocols now exceed $3.5 billion, meaning Spark alone accounts for more than two-thirds of the current market.

Title: Conservative Leader Friedrich Merz Set To Become Germany's Chancellor
URL: https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/conservative-leader-friedrich-merz-set-to-become-germanys-chancellor-8341776
Time Published: 2025-05-06T06:08:39Z
Full Content:
Conservative Friedrich Merz is set to be sworn in on Tuesday as Germany's new chancellor at a critical juncture as the economy battles its longest post-war downturn, relations with top security ally the United States fray and the far-right surges. Lawmakers are widely expected to back Merz as chancellor in a vote in the lower house of parliament after his CDU/CSU conservatives, who won February's federal election, secured a coalition deal with the centre-left Social Democrats. The pressure is on for Merz to show leadership after the implosion last November of outgoing SPD Chancellor Olaf Scholz's three-way coalition left a political vacuum at the heart of Europe, even as it faced a myriad of crises. "People have been asking Germany to lead for a long time, and there is no more space to not heed that call," said Sudha David-Wilp of the German Marshall Fund of the United States. "Everything that had been undergirding post-war Germany in the past eight decades is no longer the case, whether it be open markets and free trade, whether it be the U.S. security presence in Europe." A global trade war sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's sweeping import tariffs is threatening a third year of downturn in Europe's largest economy, which has already had to grapple with the end of cheap Russian gas since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and growing rivalry from China. Meanwhile, Trump has threatened not to come to the aid of fellow members of the NATO defence alliance, prompting even transatlanticist Merz to question the reliability of the United States and urge Europe to improve its ability to defend itself. The German coalition deal has mapped out plans to revive growth such as reducing a corporate tax and lowering energy prices. It also vows strong support for Ukraine and higher military spending. While Merz is a veteran politician who started his career as a European lawmaker in the 1980s, he still has to prove his chops in power as he has never held a government office. After losing a power struggle to arch party rival Angela Merkel in 2002, he spent over a decade working in the private sector before finding his way back into top level politics. A wealthy, Catholic west German lawyer and hobby pilot who served for four years as chairman of the German arm of fund manager BlackRock, Merz is widely considered the antithesis in both style and policy to the woman who led Germany for 16 years. Where Merkel was an even-tempered pragmatist who shifted the conservatives more towards the centre, Merz is a provocative economic liberal who has pulled the bloc back to the right. Merz's supporters highlight the fact he secured a historic fiscal package to boost spending on infrastructure and defence even before taking office. Critics say it was only necessary because of his erratic decision to push an anti-migration motion through parliament with the backing of the Alternative for Germany, breaking a taboo on cooperation with the far-right. That decision boosted support for both the AfD and the far-left Left party, who together secured enough support to be able to block a loosening of Germany's fiscal rules in the next parliament. "Merz remains a black box," said Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING. "The U-turn on fiscal policies, as much needed as it was, still begs the question why Merz ruled it out during the elections, and does he really have a longer-term vision on the economy?" With the AfD topping some recent polls, the new government's main challenge is clearly to restore confidence and trust in Germany's political centre, said Brzeski. "If this government fails, the AfD will get more support in the next elections and could become part of any next government," he said. Merz's designated cabinet reflects a belief in the need for expertise over political capital and a desire for renewal given the declining trust in the establishment, say analysts. Only one minister from the previous government will retain his position: Defence Minister Boris Pistorius. The rest of the cabinet are new appointees, many of them like the economy minister with private sector experience in the area they will now be governing.

There is a palpable sense of purpose and job satisfaction among the young adults with Down syndrome who work in the Happy Out cafe in Dún Laoghaire. We are chatting on the outdoor terrace of the cafe in the refurbished Dún Laoghaire Baths building overlooking the harbour. It’s a stunning setting for any cafe, but this one has extra-special credentials because it may be the first commercial cafe in Ireland to employ adults with Down syndrome in partnership with a social enterprise. “I don’t have anyone in my family with Down syndrome, but this opportunity fell into my lap and I thought it would be very nice to do,” says Brian Hanratty, who owns Happy Out cafes on Bull Island and in Donnybrook as well as Dún Laoghaire. Hanratty first came in contact with the Together Academy social enterprise – which trains and finds work for adults with Down syndrome – at its base in the Wanderers Football Club a few years ago. “I helped them set up their coffee shop in the bar at Wanderers and trained them how to make coffee,” Hanratty explains. The Together Academy was cofounded by Therese Coveney, whose 14-year-old daughter April gave her the impetus to set up the social enterprise. “I can feel change in the Dún Laoghaire/Blackrock area since the Happy Out cafe opened [in July 2023]. Most adults with Down syndrome rely on day services when they turn 21, but we wanted robust, industry-recognised training and a job to change the statistic that only 10 per cent of adults with Down syndrome work,” says Coveney. “After Covid, most of us understood what it was like to have meaningless, aimless days with no purpose. We are giving these young adults opportunities to be more independent, to be a valuable part of their community and to be paid employees.” Currently, there are 14 adults with Down syndrome on the roster at Happy Out in Dún Laoghaire. Each person does a three-hour shift – partly because they can’t work more than about 10 hours a week while keeping their disability allowance, but also because three hours is long enough for most of the employees. [ Down syndrome and employment: ‘It shouldn’t be amazing anymore, it should just be the norm’Opens in new window ] “In the beginning we found it hard to get enough guys to work with us but not now. They do everything from serving on the till, making and serving coffee and dealing with orders,” says Hanratty. The cafe has a card-only payment system which reduces potential for errors. Hanratty says the younger generation of customers love seeing adults with Down syndrome working in the cafe, but it has taken some older people a bit of time to get their heads around it. “Some ‘old school’ people don’t expect things to be done right and they will look to another staff member to make sure it’s really happening. But when they see that the staff member with Down syndrome has done the job well, they are very positive,” says Hanratty. The staff working regular eight-hour shifts also have to be a bit more flexible. “When we hire staff, we have to make sure that they know what they are taking on and be willing to help out in certain scenarios, and be more patient at times. They need to know that it’s different to a regular cafe.” Hanratty says the key to everything is to serve good coffee. “If the coffee isn’t good, people will come once and won’t come back, even if they think it’s a nice idea.” Ciara Donohoe from Newtownmountkennedy in Co Wicklow works on Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Sundays at Happy Out. “It’s really good and not too hard. It’s very challenging making the drinks and I’m still learning how to be a barista,” she says. [ Down syndrome: ‘Sarah regards herself as a businesswoman... she’s certainly breaking the stereotype’Opens in new window ] Charlie O’Reilly from Sandycove works on Mondays and Fridays: “I love chatting with customers and colleagues when I’m working at Happy Out. It’s a really good business.” Kim Williams from Shankill has a reputation for being good at latte art. “I also do the tills and take orders,” she says, admitting that walking through the cafe when it’s really busy can be a bit difficult. Cafe manager Matthew Roche says some of the staff with Down syndrome can get a bit flustered and emotional if it’s very busy. “We just take some time out in the foyer or outside if this happens – especially on busy days or at the weekends,” he explains. Building up people’s confidence to work front and centre in a public space has taken time, says Coveney. “When we first started training people, there was a lot of heads down, withdrawn people with their headphones on, but they have grown and flourished,” she says. “Working in a cafe won’t suit everyone, but there was something there waiting to be nurtured and educated. “It is about having higher expectations of these young adults but it would be naive to let them fly on their own. They need the supports around them.” Paula Doherty is the Pathways to Employment lead with the Together Academy. Her job involves finding work placements and paid employment for students who have completed the two-year culinary and hospitality programme that Together Academy runs at the Wanderers Football Club. [ Man with Down syndrome who wants to live independently brings council to court over housing assessmentOpens in new window ] “It’s about matching the person with the job and carving out a role for them. This can involve two or three tasks over two mornings a week from, say, 10am-1pm,” she says. “Some businesses are nervous about taking someone on, but once they meet with us and see the supports they get, it eases their minds.” The Together Academy provides backup support for the workers, meeting them before and after their job, and checking in every four to six weeks with three-, six- and 12-monthly reviews. They also do inclusive training with staff and set up a buddy system in the workplace so the person with Down syndrome has one key worker to turn to if they have any concerns. This summer the Together Academy will open a second, larger training centre in SMBC Aviation Capital on Fitzwilliam Square, Dublin. “This will be about providing more programmes for young adults with Down syndrome. It’s about elevating people’s expectations whilst giving people a lot of support,” says Coveney. She adds that all of the staff at Happy Out still live with their families and it has taken a lot of forbearance on their parts. “Many travel to work independently on public transport. We know that we are still working with vulnerable young adults. We take our role very responsibly.” Sylvia Thompson, a contributor to The Irish Times, writes about health, heritage and the environment © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Adani Power aims to expand to 30,670 MW by 2030 using brownfield expansion for quicker execution and competitive advantage. Ather Energy IPO Post-listing Gaurav Garg, Lemonn Markets Desk Ather Energy made a muted debut on the stock market, opening with a modest 2% gain before slipping 8% intraday to close at approximately ₹303—below its lower issue price of ₹304. The IPO saw a lukewarm response, with the retail portion subscribed just 1.89 times and the HNI segment at a mere 0.69 times. The stock’s weak listing and subsequent dip reflect cautious investor sentiment around its steep valuation. However, continued downward pressure could help realign its valuation, potentially making it more attractive to value-conscious investors. The Indian rupee slipped on Tuesday, tracking mild losses in regional peers and dollar demand from foreign banks, though broader weakness in the greenback limited the decline.

Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) had permitted general insurers to issue surety insurance bonds in April 2022. The bonds are legally enforceable tripartite contracts that seeks to provide hedge against risk involved with infrastructure projects.

The Government of India (GoI) has also announced to launch several infrastructure projects in water supply and urban transport. Likewise, Indian Railways too has plans for major infrastructure overhaul. To make these projects a reality, India needs to widen the contactors’ pool, who face fund issues, especially with regard to limits that is required under India’s bidding and other processes, said Subrata Mondal, Managing Director (MD) and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of IFFCO-Tokio. This is where the Surety Bond insurance provides respite to contactors and frees up financial burden on them, he said.

Track live price movements of Ather Energy following its listing here The markets on Monday closed higher at 24,461, however the Index continues to face resistance near the 24,500 levels. A decisive move above this mark could potentially drive it towards the 24,630 zone. On the downside, immediate support is seen at 24,360. Bank Nifty remains confined within a narrow range of 54,770-55,560, and a breakout on either side will offer clear directional cues. The Auto sector has witnessed consolidation breakout, indicating a possible shift towards a positive trend (Exide Industries and Tube Investments of India). The Energy sector is also nearing a breakout from its consolidation phase, making it worth monitoring for potential gains. In the Metal sector, a bullish Pennant and Pole pattern is taking shape, which, once broken, could lead to a strong upward rally. The Pharma sector is currently forming a small triangle pattern, awaiting a definitive breakout. Stocks such as Aurobindo Pharma and Glenmark are on the verge of breaking out from consolidation and triangle patterns, while Biocon has already broken out of a symmetrical triangle. Meanwhile, in the Defence space, strong momentum is visible in stocks like GRSE and Mazdock, signaling continued strength in the sector.

But he never cottoned to Bitcoin, although his stance about the technology behind digital assets softened over time. The 94-year-old Buffett, who made his surprise announcement at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual shareholder meeting, maintained that Bitcoin would never endure as a unit of value, and once famously called Bitcoin “rat poison squared” in a May 2018 interview with CNBC’s "Squawk Box." He remained skeptical of its usefulness, even after meeting with some of the industry’s most powerful advocates. In a 2018 interview with CNBC earlier in the year, Buffett had said that “cryptocurrencies, generally... with almost certainty… will come to a bad ending." “When it happens or how or anything else, I don’t know,” he added in an interview from Omaha, Nebraska. “If I could buy a five-year put on every one of the cryptocurrencies, I’d be glad to do it, but I would never short a dime’s worth.” “We don’t own any, we’re not short on any, we’ll never have a position in them,” he added. “I get into enough trouble with things I think I know something about,” he added. “Why in the world should I take a long or short position in something I don’t know anything about?” As recently as 2023, even as the price of the asset had surged to new highs in the years prior, Buffett called Bitcoin a "gambling token." He said that people investing in it were chasing easy money, and that investors wanted to "play the roulette wheel" by putting funds into it. To be sure, Buffett was a reluctant tech investor, whose portfolio weighted more to companies in manufacturing and other traditional industries. He began buying shares in Apple only in 2016, although the personal device manufacturer later became the largest part of his holdings. Buffett’s rhetoric about the technology behind Bitcoin changed over the years, too. In a 2019 CNBC interview he said “blockchain was important,” although he called Bitcoin “a delusion" in the same discussion. His remarks echoed the opinions of financial services titans, including JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who praised blockchain technology but slammed Bitcoin. Those firms have subsequently debuted multiple crypto-focused initiatives over the years and shown an increasing willingness to embrace digital assets as a long-term fixture. (Fink is now a fan of Bitcoin; Dimon not so much.) Buffett reiterated his own more nuanced Bitcoin-Blockchain stance during a fancy dinner with Tron founder and crypto mogul Justin Sun, saying that while Bitcoin was just value changing hands and “no different from a seashell,” crypto companies were here to stay. “Bitcoin cannot capture the value of blockchain,” he said at the much-publicized 2020 dinner date. “Just because something has value doesn’t make it a good investment,” Buffett added. Buffett made a living off seeing a company’s value before everyone else, buying up its shares and being patient. But his distaste for the so-called digital gold was perhaps understandable: Buffett also famously avoided commodities like gold and oil.

Title: Cisco, UPS, other companies adjusting workforce as they embrace AI: report

Waystar CEO Matt Hawkins discusses denied healthcare claims and overturned rates on 'The Claman Countdown.' Some companies have been adjusting their workforce as they simultaneously embrace artificial intelligence and automation more, according to Forbes. The outlet reported over the weekend that Duolingo, UPS, Klarna, Cisco and Inuit are among some of the firms that have demonstrated that trend. Duolingo recently said it was striving to be "AI-first," with CEO Luis von Ahn outlining various measures that it will take to help accomplish that in a publicly available company-wide message, per Forbes. (Avishek Das/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Von Ahn said in the message that Duolingo will "gradually stop using contractors to do work that AI can handle" and that headcount "will only be given if a team cannot automate more of their work." When hiring and doing performance reviews, people’s abilities to use AI will also be part of what the company considers, according to the message. DUOLINGO ANNOUNCES 148 COURSES CREATED WITH GENERATIVE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE LAUNCHING SOON ON PLATFORM The CEO said the "AI-first" moves focused on "removing bottlenecks so we can do more with the outstanding Duos we have" rather than "replacing Duos with AI." At UPS, some 20,000 employees are getting the ax, the company announced in late April. Forbes reported that UPS said AI wasn’t directly taking the place of employees, but the company is working to increase its efficiency through more automation and AI tools, something that the outlet said helped with shrinking its labor demands. UPS and Amazon, its largest customer, agreed in January that the e-commerce giant would reduce its package volume with UPS by more than 50%. Klarna has been leaning into AI more in recent years, using it for customer service, transaction processing and other functions, according to Forbes. (Jonas Walzberg/picture alliance via Getty Images) CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski has said in the past that certain human work functions can be done by AI, the outlet reported. In February last year, the company said that an AI chatbot it launched was capable of doing the work of 700 full-time agents. AI has enabled Klarna to have a smaller workforce, according to Forbes. Last fall, Cisco Systems embarked on a restructuring so it could invest in AI, cybersecurity and other growth areas, the outlet reported. When announcing the restructuring, the company also said in an SEC filing the move would "drive more efficiencies in its business." AI ENERGY DEMAND IN US WILL SURGE BUT ALSO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITY TO MANAGE ENERGY Roughly 7% of the company’s workers lost their jobs as part of the restructuring. Cisco has been putting artificial intelligence into network management and customer support systems, Forbes reported. Meanwhile, Intuit announced layoffs of 1,800 workers in July last year as part of a reorganization to boost its investments in artificial intelligence, according to the outlet. CEO Sasan Goodarzi said the reorganization would "enable us to allocate additional investments to our most critical areas to support our customers and drive growth," per a company-wide email that the company included in an SEC filing at the time. The company identified AI-powered tools it offers as some of the initiatives that it wanted to put more money into, Forbes reported. (REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File) At the same time, Goodarzi said Intuit would hire 1,800 new people "primarily in engineering, product, and customer-facing roles" to support its growth areas. A MAJORITY OF SMALL BUSINESSES ARE USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AI started seeing a major increase in uptake in the wake of OpenAI releasing its ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022, spurring major investments and innovations in the sector.

Title: Trump shrugs off warnings over trade war costs

SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week Trump's tariffs are spiraling the U.S. toward an economic crisis as shipments slow down — and China doesn't plan to back down China vowed this week it would "never kneel down" to America in President Donald Trump's tariff war, as shipments of goods from China to the U.S. plummeted and economists and retailers warned of impending price hikes and empty store shelves. With most Chinese imports facing a 145 percent levy, "essentially all shipments out of China for major retailers and manufacturers have ceased," said Port of Los Angeles executive director Eugene Seroka. The chief economist of asset management giant Apollo, Torsten Slok, said he expects "empty shelves in U.S. stores in a few weeks" and "Covid-like shortages for consumers." That slowdown, Slok said, would result in "significant" layoffs in retail, trucking, and other sectors. Trump signaled his readiness to negotiate "substantial" tariff cuts and claimed Chinese President Xi Jinping had called him. But officials in Beijing denied negotiations were taking place and struck a defiant tone. "Bowing to a bully is like drinking poison to quench thirst," China's Foreign Ministry declared in a social media video. A report that Amazon would display the cost of Trump's tariffs alongside the price of products prompted fierce blowback from the White House; Trump press secretary Karoline Leavitt called it a "hostile and political act." The company quickly disavowed any such plan, saying it was under consideration only for its low-cost Haul store and "was never approved." Trump said he'd called Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and "solved the problem very quickly," praising him as a "good guy" who "did the right thing." Trump signed an executive order easing a 25 percent tariff on imported parts used by U.S. automakers. Foreign-made autos will remain subject to a 25 percent tax. Trump called it a "short term" allowance for automakers, who say the import duties will spike prices, cut sales, and lead to layoffs. But at a rally in Michigan, Trump vowed to stay the course on tariffs, and ultimately "slaughter" carmakers who don't shift production to the U.S. In an ABC News interview, he rejected the idea that American consumers would see any price rises. "China probably will eat those tariffs," he said. "Everything's going to be just fine." Escape your echo chamber. Get the facts behind the news, plus analysis from multiple perspectives.

"Economic mayhem is setting in" thanks to Trump's "crackpot tariff ideas," said the Houston Chronicle. The stock market has recorded its worst first 100 days of any presidential term since Gerald Ford took office in 1974, with the S&P 500 down 7.9 percent. Corporations are starting to furlough workers and pause expansion plans. And because tariff costs are ultimately passed along to consumers—not foreign firms as Trump likes to claim—a typical American family can expect its expenses to climb by $2,700 a year. "It won't be the president's billionaire buddies bearing the costs for them." Amazon should have stuck with its "brilliant tariff idea," saidThe Wall Street Journal. Tariffs are taxes, and online shoppers already get to see how they much they have to cough up in state taxes when they check out. Americans would benefit greatly from clarity about exactly what Trump's tariffs will cost them, but "instead of owning its policy," the White House "bullied Amazon to keep quiet." What is Trump afraid of? Small businesses across the U.S. are reeling, said Daisuke Wakabayashi in The New York Times. Hundreds of owners tell the Times they've "been stunned into paralysis" by the tariffs and the uncertainty of what's coming next. Tim Fulton, who runs a business in Alaska making conveyor belts for airline cargo, had to raise prices due to new tariffs on essential components that are only made overseas, like motorized rollers from Japan. A pipeline of interested customers then "disappeared overnight," and potential investors retreated. Instead of growing his business, Fulton is now consulting a bankruptcy lawyer. Consumers haven't yet felt the sting, but they will soon, said Dominic Pino in The Washington Post. There's a lag, because ships from China take a month to cross the Pacific Ocean and because retailers loaded up on inventory before the tariffs hit. But "boatloads of pain" will land when retailers run out of product and choose to restock at much higher prices—or decide to let shelves sit empty. Trump's tariffs "might steal Christmas," said The Economist. Some 80 percent of the toys sold here come from China. Production "has ground to a halt," and unless import duties are slashed, nearly half the small-and medium-size firms surveyed by The Toy Association say they'll be out of business within months. Trump is taking a phenomenal risk, said Adam Cancryn in Politico. He was elected on promises of lower prices and an economic "golden age." Instead, his "chaotic" tariffs are "shaking the foundations" of America's financial system and have put his approval rating underwater by double digits. True to form, Trump is blaming stock market woes on former President Joe Biden, said Mark Antonio Wright in National Review, claiming this week it's suffering a Biden "overhang." But "every American" knows Trump owns these tariffs—and any economic fallout. A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com "We are on the verge of an economic crisis that could leave America poorer for generations," said James Briggs in The Indianapolis Star. It doesn't feel that way now. But recall early 2020, when we knew a lethal novel virus was coming for us and blithely went about our lives. Life felt normal, "until it didn't." Right now, "the vast majority of economic indicators are screaming crisis," the dollar is down, and CEOs say we're heading for a recession. With Trump's next moves uncertain, "the future is unwritten, but the risks are coming into focus." Trump's levies are being challenged by a raft of lawsuits, said Erik Larson in Bloomberg. Attorneys general from 12 states and legal advocacy groups representing numerous businesses have sued, arguing that Trump's claiming of emergency powers to impose the tariffs is unconstitutional. This week, the administration asked the U.S. trade court to reject one such suit, saying the plaintiffs are improperly "inviting judicial second-guessing of the president's judgment." Meanwhile, China shows no sign it's ready to back down, said Ryan Hass in Time. With no competitive elections, its leaders believe China's political system is "more unified, hardened, and disciplined than the Trump administration to withstand a trade war."

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Rite Aid on Monday announced it is filing for bankruptcy for a second time, barely just seven months after the chain exited Chapter 11 and emerged as a private company. The financially strapped drug store chain said it is looking for a buyer, and re-filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection will help facilitate that process. The company said it would keep its stores open throughout its bankruptcy. “While we have continued to face financial challenges, intensified by the rapidly evolving retail and healthcare landscapes in which we operate, we are encouraged by meaningful interest from a number of potential national and regional strategic acquirors,” said Matt Schroeder, Rite Aid’s CEO, in a statement. “As we move forward, our key priorities are ensuring uninterrupted pharmacy services for our customers and preserving jobs for as many associates as possible.” Rite Aid first filed for bankruptcy in October 2023, becoming a casualty of a miserable environment for drug stores, exacerbated by its runner-up status to bigger chains and expensive legal battles for allegedly filling unlawful opioid prescriptions that pushed its debt to nearly $4 billion. It took about a year to navigate the Chapter 11 process, finally emerging in September 2024 by slashing $2 billion in debt, securing $2.5 billion in funds to keep operating and the closure of about 500 locations. On Monday, Rite Aid said it secured nearly $2 billion in new financing to keep it operational during its bankruptcy. Rite Aid is a distant third-largest nationwide standalone pharmacy chain in the United States — and the seventh largest pharmacy overall, when taking into account big box chains. It has about 1,250 stores remaining — roughly half of the number it had just two years ago. It was offered a $17 billion lifeline in 2015 when Walgreens offered to buy the chain. But the deal was met with stiff scrutiny from US regulators who feared the combination would violate federal antitrust laws and reduce competition in the drug store market. Ultimately, in 2017, the companies agreed to a smaller, $4.4 billion deal, in which Walgreens bought just under 2,000 Rite Aid locations, leaving Rite Aid diminished in stature and unable to compete at the scale of its bigger rivals. Neil Saunders, the managing director of GlobalData, a data analytics company, said he was not surprised by Rite Aid’s second bankruptcy, since the drug store chain hasn’t been able to secure enough inventory to keep shelves stocked. “The first bankruptcy did little to resolve the chain’s issues, and it has been teetering on the edge of survival for quite some time,” Saunders said. With Walgreens no longer in a position to buy Rite Aid outright, the most likely outcome is that other drug store and retail chains will “cherry pick” individual Rite Aid stores to purchase and keep open, Saunders said. Rite Aid’s bankruptcy comes amid struggles for its rivals, too. Walgreens Boots Alliance announced in March that it’s being taken private in a deal valued up to $24 billion, following a largely disastrous run on the public markets where its market cap has lost billions and more than 1,200 of its locations have closed or plan to close. The transaction is expected to be finalized later this year. Related article Why Walgreens, CVS and Rite Aid are closing thousands of drug stores across America At CVS, the chain has closed more than 1,000 stores and undergone thousands of layoffs over the past several months. The company is experimenting with a new, smaller-format store that only focuses on the pharmacy rather than the retail part. All three chains have struggled with declining prescription reimbursements in recent years, sending its value plummeting to just around $9.5 billion from $100 billion a decade ago. They have also all become ubiquitous and over-expanded, with the chains becoming synonymous with convenience stores, giving people the option to pick-up their medication and perhaps grab something else, too. However, they’ve struggled to keep up with Amazon, Target and other retailers and have also had issues with theft, which has chipped away their profitability. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Quantum computing has long been announced as “just around the corner,” but several companies are now determined to make this a commercial reality, with the promise of solving complex problems beyond classical computers’ reach. The problems in question are wide-ranging, from medicine and cybersecurity to materials science and chemistry. But first, there are very practical problems to be solved, such as developing chips that can reliably host large numbers of qubits — short for quantum bits, the fundamental unit of information in quantum computing. As usual in a high-stakes tech race with an uncertain time horizon, tech giants such as Google and Microsoft are at the forefront. Yet startups are also set to play an important role, especially tackling bottlenecks like connectivity and error correction that are critical for scaling quantum systems. But some startups and smaller tech companies are taking on the chip challenge head-on and deserve mention alongside the more attention-grabbing efforts from industry giants. While Big Tech projects typically boast the highest qubit counts, rethinking designs from first principles and using different approaches could yield equally promising results. Here are some of the companies behind the main quantum chip projects that are worth tracking. Akhetonics is a German photonics startup working on an all-optical, general-purpose chip — a contrarian bet in a field where most focus on narrower applications. This bold version and its first-principles approach helped the company raise a €6 million seed funding round led by Matterwave Ventures in November 2024. Alice & Bob is a French startup that raised a $104 million Series B round of funding in January 2025 to continue working toward building a “fault tolerant” quantum computer. Unlike companies focusing only on chips, Alice & Bob is developing a full quantum computing system. To do so, it relies on cat qubits, a type of superconducting qubit designed to reduce errors and simplify error correction. Amazon officially joined the quantum chip race in early 2025 when AWS introduced Ocelot, developed in partnership with the California Institute of Technology. While this is the company’s first quantum chip, AWS had previously launched Braket, a quantum computing service, in partnership with D-Wave, IonQ, Rigetti, and others. Atom Computing is a U.S. company building quantum computers with arrays of optically trapped neutral atoms. At the Microsoft Ignite 2024 conference, Microsoft and Atom Computing announced plans to launch a commercial quantum computer in 2025. D-Wave is a quantum computing company whose latest flagship system, the Advantage2 prototype, relies on a process called quantum annealing, which uses quantum physics to find the most stable, lowest-energy arrangements of elements to figure out the best mix for a given problem. Founded in 1999 as a spinoff from the University of British Columbia in Canada, D-Wave is now a public company listed on the NYSE. Illinois-based EeroQ is a startup betting on helium for its quantum chip design. Having raised a $7.25 million seed funding round in 2022 and received regional public support, the company made a $1.1 million commitment in September 2024 toward expanding its HQ in Chicago’s Humboldt Park. In April 2025, Fujitsu and Japanese research institution RIKEN announced having developed a 256-qubit superconducting quantum computer at the RIKEN RQC-FUJITSU Collaboration Center, up from a 64-qubit iteration in 2023. In December 2024, Google announced Willow, its latest quantum computing chip. Google didn’t stop at saying Willow was better than its predecessor, Sycamore, or at describing it as “a major breakthrough in quantum error correction.” In a statement that made headlines, Google Quantum AI founder Hartmut Neven wrote that Willow’s performance lent “credence to the notion that quantum computation occurs in many parallel universes.” IBM’s quantum efforts include Condor, its milestone superconducting chip for scaling up to 1,121 qubits, and Heron, a 156-qubit processor focused on improved performance and lower error rates. Founded in 2007, Infleqtion (formerly ColdQuanta) is a US-based company developing quantum computers based on neutral atom technology. Intel is developing quantum computers based on silicon spin qubits. In June 2023, it unveiled Tunnel Falls, a 12-qubit research chip, and said a next-generation quantum chip based on Tunnel Falls was expected to be released in 2024, but this hasn’t happened. IonQ is a publicly listed U.S. company developing trapped-ion quantum computers, including the IonQ Forte. After going public via a SPAC in late 2021, it acquired Canadian networking specialist Entangled Networks. IQM is a Finnish startup building superconducting quantum computers and is a spinout of the Aalto University and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. It received funding in its early days from the Business Finland government agency, followed by additional support from the EIC Accelerator program. In 2022, IQM raised €128 million in Series A2 funding led by World Fund, adding to the €39 million led by MIG Fonds it had raised in 2020 as part of what was then its Series A. This second tranche included part of a previously announced €35 million venture loan from the European Investment Bank, as well as participation from the EIC Fund and others. In February 2025, Microsoft introduced Majorana, a quantum chip using a topological core architecture. Microsoft previously declared that it expected to build a quantum supercomputer within 10 years. As its name suggests, Oxford Ionics is a British startup that spun out of Oxford University and focuses on trapped-ion quantum computing. It raised a £30 million Series A (approximately $36 million) in early 2023, followed by an additional £2 million (approximately €2.32 million) from the UK’s National Security Strategic Investment Fund (NSSIF) that same year. More recently, it was selected for DARPA’s Quantum Benchmarking Initiative (QBI) alongside Quantinuum. Pasqal is a French startup taking a full-stack approach to quantum computing and betting on neutral atoms. The company emerged out of the Institut d’Optique in 2019, and its co-founders include 2022 Nobel Prize laureate for physics and professor Alain Aspect. In February 2023, Pascal raised a €100 million Series B funding round led by Singapore’s Temasek, with participation from existing investors Quantonation, the Defense Innovation Fund, Daphni, and Eni Next, as well as new investors European Innovation Council (EIC) Fund, Wa’ed Ventures, and Bpifrance (through its Large Venture Fund). PsiQuantum is a quantum computing startup using photonics technology and aiming to build “a 1 million-quantum-bit machine.” In February 2025, it announced Omega, a quantum photonic chipset manufactured at GlobalFoundries in New York. In 2021, PsiQuantum landed a $450 million Series D investment led by BlackRock, which is now said to be leading a potential $750 million round into the company at a $6 billion pre-money valuation. Founded by Australian academics, it is also backed by the Australian and Queensland governments. Qilimanjaro is a Spanish startup focusing on analog quantum app-specific integrated circuits (QASICs) and taking a full-stack approach, including hardware, software, and applications. Based in Barcelona, it won the Four Years From Now startup competition at Mobile World Congress in 2024, going on to receive €1.5 million in funding from Catalonia later that year. Quandela is a French startup founded in 2017 to develop photonic quantum computers. In November 2023, Quandela raised a €50 million Series B and received support from the French government through the France 2030 Plan. Quantinuum is a quantum computing company formed in 2021 by the merger of Cambridge Quantum and Honeywell Quantum Solutions. Its flagship product is the H-Series of trapped-ion quantum computers. In April 2024, together with Microsoft, it announced a breakthrough in error correction. QuantWare is a Dutch startup that came up with a proprietary 3D chip architecture, VIO, which focuses on scaling bottlenecks in quantum processing units (QPUs). It started accepting preorders for Contralto-A, its first QPU for quantum error correction, in February 2025. Founded in 2020, it is a spinout of TU Delft and its affiliated research institute, QuTech. In March 2025, and following a €6 million seed round in 2023, it announced having raised a €20 million Series A (approximately $19.27 million) — including €5 million in equity out of the €7.5 million it previously secured from the European Innovation Council (the remainder is a grant). Boston-based QuEra is betting on neutral atoms as the “best approach to achieve large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers.” Its products include Aquila, a 256-qubit analog neutral-atom quantum computer launched in 2022 and accessible via Amazon Braket. QuEra is notably backed by Google, which led the $230 debt round that the quantum startup raised in February 2025 — with a convertible note also backed by SoftBank, Valor, and existing investors. Founded in 2013 by Chad Rigetti, Rigetti Computing is a quantum company focusing on superconducting technology. Its range of products include Ankaa-3 and the uppcoming 336-qubit Lyra system. Just like rivals D-Wave and IonQ, Rigetti Computing is a listed company; it raised just under $200 million in VC capital before going public via a SPAC in 2021. In February 2025, it signed a strategic partnership with Taiwan-based Quanta Computer, which is set to invest $35 million and purchase shares of Rigetti, while both companies invest more than $100 million each over the next five years to accelerate the development and commercialization of superconducting quantum computing. U.S. quantum startup SEEQC — an acronym for “scalable, energy efficient quantum computing” — is a spinout of chip company Hypres, which was itself established by former employees of IBM’s superconducting electronics division. In 2023, SEEQC announced a partnership with Nvidia to build an “all-digital, ultra-low-latency chip-to-chip link between quantum computers and GPUs.” In January 2025, SEEQC raised a $30 million round of funding co-led by Booz Allen Ventures and Japanese-European VC firm NordicNinja. Other backers include Merck’s corporate venture capital arm, M Ventures. SEEQC is leading the U.K.-supported QuPharma project to explore how quantum computing can accelerate drug discovery, in partnership with BASF and Merck. SpinQ is a Chinese startup founded in 2018 that develops quantum computers. It claims that some of them are portable and making use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Xanadu is a Canadian startup aiming to build quantum computers through a photonic approach. In January 2025, it introduced Aurora, a 12-qubit system, including 35 photonic chips. Founded in 2016, Xanadu raised some $275 million to date, including a $100 million Series C in November 2022 at a $1 billion valuation.

The Economic Collapse Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression? Are you ready for store shelves to start emptying all over America? When I first started writing about the coming shortages last month, I received quite a bit of criticism. But now expert after expert is warning that we really are facing a crisis of historic proportions. Most major retailers still have several weeks of inventory on hand, but after that shortages are going to start becoming very visible. For smaller businesses, the shortages will be noticeable a lot sooner. On Sunday, I visited a local small business to purchase some groceries. In addition to selling groceries, this particular discount store also sells a wide variety of other products, and some of them are made in China. As I walked through the aisles, I was stunned by how low their stock levels were. Honestly, it was kind of depressing. Of course anything that we are witnessing now is just the leading edge of what is eventually coming. According to CNN, it is being estimated that “Chinese imports into the United States will plunge by as much as 80% by the second half of the year”… The historically high tariff on China has effectively stopped all trade between the two countries, Trump has said repeatedly. The number of cargo ships headed from China to the United States fell 60% in April, according to Flexport, a logistics and freight forwarding broker. JPMorgan estimates Chinese imports into the United States will plunge by as much as 80% by the second half of the year. American consumers should expect pandemic-like disruptions as goods that were warehoused before tariffs took effect begin to run out over the next week or so, including higher prices, shortages and empty store shelves. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said repeatedly that the high tariff on China are “unsustainable,” and Trump also said he expects the tariff to come down. But it would need to come down significantly – by more than half – for any real trade to recommence, trade experts say. But even then, the economic damage would be done — and it would be weeks or even months before American shelves would be replenished. This is going to be catastrophic. Anyone that cannot see this simply does not understand how our system works. Flexport CEO Ryan Petersen is a supply chain expert that helps thousands of businesses move products around the globe, and he is warning that we are facing “an extinction-level, asteroid-wiping-out-the-dinosaurs kind of event”… “If they don’t change the tariffs, it’s going to be an extinction-level, asteroid-wiping-out-the-dinosaurs kind of event,” he told me. “Only these aren’t dinosaurs. These are dynamic, healthy businesses.” He knows this because those businesses are his customers. They use Flexport to transport products from the factory to your front door. Petersen’s company handles everything from booking space on planes, trucks and enormous ocean carriers to managing all the tedious paperwork along the way. Ryan Petersen knows exactly what he is talking about, because dealing with supply chains is what he does for a living. According to Petersen, container bookings from China to the United States have already fallen by 60 percent… But since the tariffs took effect, ocean-freight bookings from China to the U.S. have dropped 60%, Petersen says. In response, containership operators are shrinking their boats and canceling trips altogether. It takes a while for downstream consequences to flow through the system—but logistics nerds can look at the data on their screens and see into the future. If tariffs continue at this rate, Petersen says, it’s only a matter of time before that asteroid hits. There are thousands upon thousands of products that are made in China that aren’t made anywhere else. And it takes years to build new factories and set up new supply chains. So how are we possibly going to replace the 438 billion dollars of imports from China that normally fill up our store shelves? Of course the truth is that we aren’t going to replace those imports and store shelves will soon start getting emptier and emptier. In addition, it is likely that we will see massive layoffs as supply chains all over the U.S. slow down dramatically. Southern California is one area that will get hit particularly hard… With more than 70% of the port workforce living within a 10-mile radius of the complex, LA’s waterfront communities of San Pedro, Wilmington and Long Beach are expected to be the first hit by the slowdown, but they will certainly not be the last, said Gary Herrera, president of International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) local 13. “One in every five jobs in southern California is tied to the ports – warehouse workers, truck drivers, logistic teams and more,” said Herrera, who has been a longshore worker since 1998. Herrera says LA’s Inland Empire, including Riverside and San Bernardino, which serve as warehousing centers for retailers such as Walmart and Amazon, as well as communities such as Bakersfield and Barstow, which have freight rail lines, will also be severely affected. Even if President Trump made a deal with China this week, we are being told that it could take up to a year for our supply chains to fully return to normal… “These are big, massive bullwhips that have not been seen since COVID,” Evan Smith, the CEO of the supply-chain-management company Altana Technologies, told me. “The tariffs themselves are a shock to the system, and the shock is echoed and amplified across the entire chain. Even if there is resolution, it will take nine to 12 months to work out these bumps.” The good news is that it appears that the Chinese are open to beginning negotiations with the Trump administration. But the Chinese are insisting that they will not be coerced into making a deal. There had been hope that tariffs on Chinese goods would be reduced in an attempt to get China to the negotiating table, but President Trump has slammed the door on that possibility… When Welker directly asked, “You’re not dropping the tariffs against China to get them to the negotiating table?” Trump’s response was unequivocal: “No.” His firm stance underscores a broader strategy of using tariffs as leverage to protect American economic interests and curb China’s global influence. Even if negotiations commenced tomorrow, we would probably not see a deal with China until months from now. Meanwhile, our supply chain crisis will continue to get worse with each passing day. If there is anything that is made in China that you are going to need, I would get it immediately. It does not appear that President Trump plans to reverse course on his tariffs any time soon. In fact, he just unveiled a new 25 percent tariff rate on most foreign-made auto parts… President Trump’s tariffs on foreign-made auto parts began on May 3, with automakers receiving some concessions from the administration but still feeling the heat on others. Trump signed an executive order formalizing the new rules late last week, which gave some carve-outs to what would have been blanket 25% tariffs on imported auto parts. Everything from foreign-made powertrain components to seats and airbags is affected. This is not a drill. A global trade war is here, and it is going to cause immense pain all over the planet. It won’t be too long before empty shelves start appearing all over America. So if there is something that you need to get done, get it done now.

Title: Germany's chancellor-in-waiting: Who is Friedrich Merz?

He has never held a top position in government, yet he has become Germany's tenth chancellor. DW takes a look at the life of Friedrich Merz. Friedrich Merz has made it to the chancellery after a bumpy start. He needed an unprecedented second vote to secure the necessary majority in the Bundestag in what was a historic debacle in German politics. Now Merz's center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) the regional Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) and the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) will be working together as Germany's new government. For Merz, it is a big step in an unusual career. Merz, who is 69 years old, has never held a top governmental office with significant leadership responsibilities. He has never been a federal minister, or a state premier, or even mayor of a small town. He is the oldest chancellor to take office since Konrad Adenauer, the first post-war German head of government (1949–1963). The previous weeks were also the first time he had ever taken part in negotiations aimed at forming a government coalition. The media, as well as some unnamed representatives from the negotiation teams, have at times held this against him. The SPD leaders, Lars Klingbeil and Saskia Esken, and the head of the CDU's Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), Markus Söder, all have experience in this particular kind of wrangling. But as the would-be head of government, Merz hopes to lead a coalition between the CDU and these parties, and mediate between their interests. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video According to the German business magazine Wirtschaftswoche, Merz is a "trans-atlanticist, friend of Europe, and reformer." This, it wrote, could mean he was "exactly the right person for the current times." From 1989 to 1994, Merz was a member of the European Parliament. This was followed by 15 years in the Bundestag, between 1994 and 2009, during which he rose to become head of the CDU's parliamentary group, only to lose out to Angela Merkel in a struggle for the party leadership. Over these years, he took a particular interest in Germany's relationship with the United States. A commercial lawyer, Merz hails from Sauerland, an area of North Rhine-Westphalia, east of the Ruhr, where he still lives. It's predominantly a middle-class, rural region, popular with tourists, that tends to espouse conservative, Catholic values. Merz was clearly more traditionally conservative than his East German rival, the quantum chemist Angela Merkel. Early in his career, he was a close confidant of the now-deceased veteran CDU politician Wolfgang Schäuble, who was a member of the German parliament for more than 50 years. Merz chose not to stand for parliament again in 2009, and went on to pursue a career in business. From 2016 to 2020, he was chairman of the supervisory board of the German arm of BlackRock, currently the world's largest asset management company, and during this time he was often in the United States on business. It wasn't until 2021 that Merz ran again for the Bundestag, and was elected. In fleshing out his plans for government, he has been more outspoken than his taciturn predecessorOlaf Scholz, Merz frequently makes a point of mentioning that, for several months now, he has been in regular contact with European heads of government: dinner with France's President Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee Palace, bilateral talks in Berlin or Brussels. He also intends to travel to the US before the summer recess to meet Republican President Donald Trump. In a particularly striking example, Merz gave an hour-long TV interview to the German political talk show Caren Miosga eight days before the Easter weekend, in which he spoke about continuing military aid to Ukraine, going significantly beyond the "red line" repeatedly drawn by Chancellor Scholz. Merz raised the prospect of Germany delivering Taurus cruise missiles to Kyiv. These long-range, high-impact weapons would be of great assistance to Ukraine, and could seriously pressure Russia. He added that the UK, France, and US had already been supplying cruise missiles, and if the weapons supply was coordinated with its allies, "Germany should also participate." He commented that the Ukrainian army "has to get out of the defensive position — all it does is react." It needed to "be able to exert some control over what's happening." Merz even explicitly mentioned the possibility of Ukraine destroying the Crimean Bridge, a key strategic link between Russia and the unilaterally annexed Crimean peninsula. With this rhetoric and level of detail, Merz has positioned himself in direct opposition to Scholz, who consistently opposed Taurus deliveries and warned against any further escalation of the war between Russia and Ukraine. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Continued support for Ukraine is only one element of the broader political upheaval in Germany that has resulted from the policies of the new US administration — an upheaval that at times has caused Merz's standing and credibility to plummet. For months, both in the Bundestag and on the campaign trail, Merz and other conservative politicians emphasized the importance of adhering to Germany's debt brake, and called for fiscal discipline. This abruptly changed with the start of the exploratory talks between the CDU/CSU and the SPD. By mid-March, both of Germany's legislative chambers had approved a historically unprecedented decision: From now on, there will be no cap on defense spending. A package worth €500 billion ($570 billion) is also being introduced, aimed at improving Germany's crumbling infrastructure. This entails easing the debt brake to which, during the election campaign, the CDU and CSU had initially promised to adhere. Meanwhile, Merz — and all the mainstream parties — have the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) pressuring them from behind. Observers say the AfD's gains in the most recent election have prompted the future coalition partners to include stricter immigration policies and a greater focus on internal security in the coalition agreement. Just days before the federal election, Merz sparked controversy and confusion, both at home and abroad, by effectively weakening the "firewall" that he, along with all the other mainstream parties, had pledged to maintain against the AfD. Merz accepted the AfD's backing in several parliamentary votes on migration policy, in a bid to help the CDU/CSU and pro-business Free Deomcratic Party (FDP) defeat the remaining red-green votes, which by then no longer held a majority. This move triggered a wave of outrage among politicians and in German civil society. Now, Merz says he wants to boost the confidence of the German people. "We are a great country of more than 80 million people, who live and work here and take care of their families," he said. He wants to show "that the effort is worth it."

Title: Netflix stock was supposed to be safe from the trade war. Then Trump talked movie tariffs
URL: https://qz.com/netflix-stock-trump-movie-tariffs-proposal-1851779194
Time Published: 2025-05-05T17:46:00Z
Full Content:
Netflix (NFLX) was supposed to get its happily ever after: Its stock had been skyrocketing, and Wall Street largely saw it as a recession-proof play amid swirling macroeconomic concerns. But that all changed with one social media post from President Donald Trump, in which he announced plans to impose a 100% tariff on all movies made outside the U.S. The president wrote Sunday night on his Truth Media social platform that the “Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death.” Trump claimed that other countries are offering incentives to studios outside the country, which is “a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat. It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda!” He finished the post: “WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick responded on X, saying, “We’re on it.” As of now, there are no details on how this plan will be implemented or what will be included in these tariffs. Netflix’s stock price fell almost 3.7% between Friday’s close and Monday’s open. It’s since risen some throughout the day, but it’s still down about 1.3% as of midday. This sudden fall marks a stark reversal from late April, when a bullish analyst report from William Blair said Netflix is “currently not experiencing economic headwinds with stable retention” after its strong quarter. The financial services firm maintained its “outperform” rating for Netflix’s stock. “Netflix is relatively more insulated from the recent market turmoil because it is not overly exposed to tariffs and will be relatively resilient in any potential future economic downturn,” analysts Ralph Schackart and Jack Brenczewski wrote in the report. “Overall, Netflix remains well positioned to remain a secular streaming winner, in our view, and we believe longer term it will continue to have pricing power.” Other entertainment companies have seen somewhat similar dips following Trump’s social media post. Paramount’s (PARA) stock is down 0.7%, Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) is down 0.6%, and Lions Gate (LGF.A) is a big loser on the day, down 5.4% as of early Monday afternoon. Disney’s (DIS) stock fell but has since recovered its earlier losses, up 0.1%, similar to Comcast (CMCSA), which was up 0.4%. Key details of the president’s plan remain unclear, including whether the tariff would apply only to theatrical releases or also to streaming content, how it would be calculated — by production budget or box office revenue — and whether it would affect TV shows or already-completed films. Citigroup (C) analyst Jason Bazinet told The Wrap that, in a worst-case scenario, Netflix could face a 20% decline in earnings and an annual cost increase of $3 billion. He said, however, that the actual impact is likely to be significantly lower. According to Citigroup’s analysis, the streaming platform currently spends about $17 billion per year on content, with 60% of that being original productions and the remaining 40% licensed. Of the original content, half is produced outside the U.S. Based on these figures, a 100% tariff on movies could reduce earnings per share by 20%, or approximately six cents. And that cost could be passed on to Netflix’s consumers. “If we assume U.S. production costs are 35% higher than non-U.S. costs, it’s akin to a $1 billion increase in annual costs,” Bazinet said. “If this cost is borne by U.S. consumers, it would cause [average revenue per user in the U.S. and Canada] to rise about 7%.” Trump addressed his planned movie tariffs in front of reporters later Sunday after returning from Mar-a-Lago. He said, “I’ve done some very strong research over the past week, and we’re making very few movies now. Hollywood is being destroyed. Now, you have a grossly incompetent governor that allowed that to happen, so I’m not just blaming other nations, but other nations have stolen our movie industry.” Hollywood producers and labor unions have been urging Governor Gavin Newsom to boost the state’s tax incentives to better compete with other locations. A ProdPro survey of executives found California was the sixth most-preferred place to film in the next couple of years, behind Toronto, the U.K, Vancouver, Central Europe, and Australia. When speaking to reporters, Trump also accused other countries of stealing America’s “moviemaking capabilities” and said their financial support for Hollywood films was “sort of a threat to our country in a sense.” In January, Trump named Jon Voight, Sylvester Stallone, and Mel Gibson as “special ambassadors” to bring a “troubled” Hollywood back “bigger, better and stronger than ever before.” Sources told Variety that Voight and his manager, Steven Paul, have been taking meetings with various guilds to advise the president on how to reinvigorate filming in the U.S. Under Trump’s proposal, nearly all of this year’s major blockbusters would have been affected, including the top-grossing Minecraft Movie, filmed in New Zealand, and Captain America: Brave New World, which was shot across multiple countries, including the U.S. Coming releases such as Mission: Impossible: The Final Reckoning and the John Wick spin-off Ballerina would also feel the weight of the president’s tariffs. Gibson, meanwhile, has been planning to shoot his Passion of the Christ sequel in Italy. “I think the most likely consequence is not that more productions will be done outside of America, or more productions would be done in America, but probably that just fewer productions will (be made),” Scott Roxborough, the Europe bureau chief of the Hollywood Reporter, told Reuters. On Monday, the British media and entertainment union Bectu called on the British government to “move swiftly to defend this vital sector ... as a matter of essential national economic interest.” Officials in Australia and New Zealand also responded to Trump’s proposed movie tariffs by pledging support for their local sectors, which have become key global filming hubs — Marvel movies have been filmed in Australia, while New Zealand was home to The Lord of the Rings franchise. So will we see the third Dune movie filmed in New Mexico and the next Mission Impossible installment in South Dakota? For now, the only certainty is uncertainty — and a growing sense that Netflix’s “safe” status in a trade war may have been a Hollywood fantasy all along.

Title: Weighing The Positives Of Fully Remote Workplaces

ByMegan Poinski ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff. I'm the writer for the Forbes C-Suite newsletter series. ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff. As technology continues to define business opportunities, there are basic needs that are integral to every development. Last week, I attended a panel at Honeywell’s Future of Energy Summit in Washington, D.C., at which top industry and policy leaders discussed two: energy and AI. Page Crahan, general manager of Tapestry at Google’s X, the Moonshot Factory, said that AI is becoming as ubiquitous among businesses as energy. “Would you ever ask a business owner if they use math?” Crahan asked. Gordon Bitko, IT Industry Council executive vice president of policy, said energy and AI are inextricably linked. “AI uses a lot of power, so the answer is: Let’s use more AI to figure out how to use less energy,” Bitko said. Industry has used AI technology for years to determine ways to be more efficient, so this sounds like a paradox. AI is being used to create hardware that can process data better, and it only makes sense to use AI to determine the best ways to generate power, optimize workloads and automate data centers. Crahan’s project is building an AI-powered, unified platform for the electric grid. Crahan said Tapestry is essentially creating “Google Maps for electrons” to figure out and predict what’s happening throughout the grid. And the rise of AI— which she called a wonderful tool for helping solve extremely complex problems with data—is coming at the perfect time. But while AI can find solutions, it comes back to the question of power. Bitko said that for AI to do its best, the U.S. needs to de-risk investment in the technologies that can improve performance and capacity for energy infrastructure, as well as get the critical materials available to build them. China has not been waiting to move forward, Bilko said, and the U.S. shouldn’t either. Crahan added that there’s another key to making quick advancements: People talking to one another and sharing their solutions. This isn’t just a matter of companies and countries talking, but also people from different parts of organizations communicating and understanding one another. “It’s really on us to take those actions forward, and that is what gives me a lot of optimism is this community is here for the change and we help each other,” Crahan said. “We want to drive change, and I think that’s really special.” Honeywell Global Regions CEO Anant Maheshwari moderated the discussion, in which Rep. Julie Fedorchak (R-N.D.) also participated. Many companies are asking their employees to return to the office this year, but there are still fully remote companies. I spoke with Ann Schlemmer, CEO of software company Percona, about why her employees will not be asked to report to an office anytime soon. An excerpt from our conversation appears later in this newsletter. Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange last Wednesday. Last week, the markets fully recovered from the “Liberation Day” tariff announcement crash, with the S&P 500 seeing its longest winning streak since 2004. Investors were encouraged by better job growth than expected—177,000 non-farm jobs added from March to April, beating expectations of 133,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics—and better-than-expected earnings reports from Big Tech, including Microsoft, Meta and Amazon. Inflation in March also moderated, according to Commerce Department data released last week, with the personal consumption expenditures index up 2.3% from last year, and core inflation—excluding food and energy costs—matching estimates of 2.6% in March. Even though these are positive metrics, they don’t necessarily indicate a recovering economy. While stocks have recovered from their low point in early April, markets are still down since Donald Trump’s presidency began in late January—the S&P is now 5% lower. According to the Wall Street Journal, Trump’s first 100 days in office have been the worst for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 since President Richard Nixon’s second term in 1973. While there was more job growth than expected, a report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas found that layoffs are way up—April’s cuts were up 63% compared to a year ago, and the more than 600,000 layoffs so far in 2025 are 87% higher than at this point in 2024. The firm found that 48% of the layoffs were tied to cuts made by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Forbes senior contributor Teresa Ghilarducci found troubling signs for employment underneath the strong job creation numbers. Worker confidence is down: 11.8% of the unemployed had left their jobs, down from 13.2% in January. Payroll numbers only increased by 0.3%, though inflation is much higher. Long-term unemployment is on the rise—1.9% of unemployed people have been without work for 15 weeks or longer, up from 1.4% in January. The economy as a whole also contracted significantly in the first quarter. According to the Bureau of Economic Research, GDP was down 0.3% compared with the last three months of 2024. That’s a drop from steady previous growth—GDP was up 2.4% in Q4—and the weakest growth since Q1 of 2022. Much of the drop in GDP came from fewer imports, as sweeping tariffs loom. And while the Trump administration has touted deals in progress—including talks to reduce a 145% tariff on China—nothing has been announced and Beijing says it is evaluating whether to negotiate. Tariffs are already reducing the amounts of goods shipped to the U.S. from China, setting the stage for fewer items on shelves in coming months, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. Last week, the Trump Administration also eliminated the de minimis trade exemption, which allowed low-cost items from online retailers, including Temu and Shein, to be shipped to the U.S. duty-free. Now, items from those retailers are seeing a 145% tariff, more than doubling prices for U.S. consumers. Meanwhile, several companies anticipating a negative impact from tariffs for the rest of the year have reduced their estimates or pulled guidance. Warren Buffett in 2017. One of the world’s most respected CEOs unexpectedly announced over the weekend that he would step down at the end of the year. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett is handing the reins of the firm to Berkshire Hathaway Energy CEO Greg Abel, which he announced at the end of his address at the annual shareholders’ meeting. Forbes’ Hank Tucker writes the news surprised nearly everyone there—board members and Abel included—though the timing seems to make sense. Buffett is 94 and worth some $168 billion over the weekend, according to Forbes estimates. Buffett has been Berkshire Hathaway CEO since 1965, and the announcement of his step down received a standing ovation. Abel, a 62-year-old Canadian who’s been with Berkshire since it acquired MidAmerican Energy in 1999, will have big shoes to fill. Buffett, known as the “Oracle of Omaha,” is an American legend for his shrewdness in investing. Even this year prior to Buffett’s announcement, Berkshire’s stock is up 19%, nearly matching its compounded annual gain of 19.9% from 1965 to 2024. Just about every company wants to improve its adoption of and expertise in AI this year, and C-suite executives are also getting into it. According to a recent survey by LinkedIn, 88% of C-suite execs say speeding AI adoption is a top priority this year. Executives are looking for their employees to become AI experts, but they aren’t forgetting themselves. C-suite leaders are 1.2 times more likely to add AI literacy skills to their LinkedIn profile than other professionals, and three times as many C-suite leaders have AI skills on their profiles now compared to two years ago. This isn’t to say that C-suites across the board are getting the AI skills they need. About four in 10 leaders said their top team is preventing AI adoption, citing reasons like lack of training, no change management plan, and failure to be convinced of AI’s ROI. LinkedIn and Microsoft have opened several AI skills courses, making them free of charge for several months. The time spent gaining AI skills is likely to pay off. LinkedIn found that 51% of organizations that adopted generative AI reported revenue increases of at least 10%. Percona CEO Ann Schlemmer. Open source database software company Percona has always been a fully remote company since its founding in 2006, so it was already in the swing of a distributed workforce when most of the country’s offices shut down for the Covid-19 pandemic. Percona currently has just over 350 employees located in 52 countries around the globe, and CEO Ann Schlemmer says they have no intention of requiring them to work together in an office somewhere. (Percona does have a headquarters office in North Carolina, where the COO works.) I talked to Schlemmer about being an all-remote company in a world that is moving toward requiring employees to return to the office. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. Why does being remote work for Percona? Schlemmer: We put a lot of work behind it. This was our intention from the very beginning: don’t let geography determine your talent. It also was a little bit of a labor arbitrage, that you could get high quality talent and maybe in lower cost centers. Trying to get all tech talent from Silicon Valley is really expensive. We have always been bootstrapped and customer-funded—we haven’t taken outside funding. That was also part of the drive: finding those areas of technical expertise globally that other people may not have found. Are you receiving more interest from potential employees now that a lot of workplaces are putting out return to office mandates? Yes. Flexibility [is a common reason] for sure. In our company, we’ve always had this mentality of being able to flex and have that flexibility as long as you get the job done. That said, not every job has flexibility. [In] some of our customer-facing roles, it’s very clear that you're expected to be available for the customers between certain hours. As a CEO, what I really care about is someone getting their job done in the time that we expect them to get it done and that they have the tools and capabilities to do that. Expectations with your colleagues on your availability would happen whether you’re remote or in person. There has to be a really high degree of trust when you are a remote worker—which also means that you need to have a high level of your own personal accountability in getting the job done, being clear on expectations and can you fulfill those expectations in that environment. With you at the helm, would you ever consider making Percona a company where people have to go into an office? I don’t see that it would ever be a whole company initiative. I could see that if there was a business case: That we had a specific team that was trying to drive new product innovation and the request was, we have the center and we want to be in person to do that, or we found that that really is the most effective. I could see that as very use-case specific. The company itself now, I wouldn't see the advantage of that. And for us in our structure, it would be a massive cost that I don’t think would give me an ROI that would make it appealing. What advice would you give to business leaders who have been much more remote since Covid and are trying to decide whether they should go back to an office? If the question is singularly return to the office or stay remote, start with what problem you are trying to solve and have clarity on that. Really large corporations have a big commercial investment that they’ve made into real estate, so, versus selling that off, they want a return on that investment. They want people coming in. And their culture and systems have been built around being in-person. That is pretty compelling. It’s a matter of defining what problem are you trying to solve, being clear on that and gaming it out to understand what are the consequences, positives, and potentially negatives of those decisions—which is what business leaders do anyway. They always have to weigh the cost of their decisions.

IBIT holdings surge as BlackRock's broader Bitcoin exposure strategy unfolds. BlackRock expanded its exposure to Bitcoin-linked assets in the first quarter of 2025, pushing its total investments to more than $5.4 billion, according to data from Timechainindex. Between the last quarter of 2024 and March 2025, BlackRock added over 3.2 million shares of the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) to its portfolio. This move brought its total IBIT holdings to around 5.85 million shares, valued at roughly $274 million. In an interesting shift, BlackRock also began investing in rival spot Bitcoin ETFs. It purchased nearly 71,000 shares of Fidelity’s FBTC and made smaller allocations to Grayscale’s GBTC and GBTC Mini products. This marks the firm’s first foray into rival ETFs, reflecting a broader strategy aimed at tapping into multiple channels of Bitcoin market exposure. Combined, these holdings are valued at more than $5 million. Altogether, BlackRock’s total position in spot Bitcoin ETFs has reached approximately $279 million. At the same time, the firm increased its exposure to companies with direct ties to Bitcoin. The asset management firm increased its stake in Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) to over 14.4 million shares during the quarter. The firm also acquired more than 620,000 of MicroStrategy’s Series A preferred shares and nearly 15 million shares across two of the company’s commercial notes. These positions bring BlackRock’s total exposure to Strategy to over $4.23 billion. Meanwhile, BlackRock also deepened its positions in Bitcoin mining companies, pushing its investments in these cohorts to almost $1 billion, with investments in Riot Platforms, Marathon Digital, TeraWulf, and others.

ByJon Helgi Egilsson ByJon Helgi Egilsson, Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Jon Egilsson explores crypto, decentralized finance, and regulation. ByJon Helgi Egilsson, Contributor. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent views stablecoins as a strategic tool to boost U.S. Treasury demand ... More and strengthen dollar dominance. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) A powerful U.S. Treasury advisory group sees stablecoins emerging as a major new source of demand for government debt. With the market projected to reach $2 trillion by 2028—nearly all of it dollar-denominated. At its meeting last week, the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee —comprising senior executives from BlackRock, JPMorgan, and other major financial institutions reporting to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessen—highlighted the stablecoin market as a rapidly expanding force in creating new Treasury demand. The implication is clear: current regulatory proposals could channel more stablecoin reserves into U.S. Treasuries than China currently holds. While the committee stopped short of making direct comparisons, its analysis suggests that if projected growth materializes and legislation like the GENIUS Act is enacted, stablecoin demand could rival that of traditional sovereign creditors. The GENIUS Act, expected to pass in 2025, would regulate stablecoin issuers and link reserves ... More directly to short-term U.S. Treasuries. With the GENIUS Act expected this August, U.S. dollar stablecoin issuers like Tether and Circle will be required to hold reserves—including Treasuries—positioning them as major institutional buyers. That demand could surpass the $784 billion currently held by China, reshaping how the U.S. finances its debt. This isn’t just regulatory housekeeping—it’s strategic fiscal architecture. “The ultimate design and adoption of stablecoins will drive the magnitude of impact they have on U.S. Treasury demand,” the TBAC wrote in its meeting minutes. By designating T-bills with maturities under 93 days as eligible reserves, the proposed rules would position stablecoin issuers as key players at the front end of the curve. The GENIUS Act goes further, allowing those Treasuries to be used as repo collateral—making them even more attractive as backing for stablecoins. Japan and China—the top two foreign holders of U.S. Treasuries—currently hold $1.13 trillion and $784 billion, respectively. Combined, that’s still less than the projected $2 trillion market cap of stablecoins by 2028. If that projection holds, U.S. dollar stablecoins could soon rival or surpass traditional sovereign creditors. This isn’t just crypto—it’s a structural shift in how America funds itself, trading geopolitical reliance for market-based infrastructure powered by code and regulation. Stablecoin issuers are already acting like institutional buyers of U.S. Treasuries. Over $120 billion in short-term Treasuries back stablecoins today, with another $90 billion in money market funds. Unlike banks, which operate on fractional reserves, stablecoin issuers—under proposed U.S. rules—would hold full reserves, making them a steady, transparent source of Treasury demand. This shift has high-level backing. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has called stablecoins “a new channel of strategic demand,” saying they not only expand access to the dollar but also “support sustained demand for U.S. Treasury bills.” Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller has backed the role of stablecoins in extending U.S. dollar access globally—especially in high-inflation countries and regions with limited banking. “U.S. dollar stablecoins could be particularly appealing to those in high-inflation countries or to those without easy or affordable access to dollar cash or banking services,” Waller said. “I believe that stablecoins have the potential to maintain and extend the role of the dollar internationally.” According to a report by the venture firm a16z, stablecoins are crypto’s first “killer app.” In 2024, stablecoins facilitated $15.6 trillion in transfers—roughly equivalent to Visa’s annual volume. In March alone, stablecoin transactions hit a record $1.82 trillion, the report stated. While much of this is financial flows rather than retail payments, it highlights their rapid adoption in global finance. As trade tensions and tariff wars strain U.S.–China ties, Washington looks to stablecoins to reduce ... More its reliance on foreign creditors. As China steadily pulls back—its U.S. Treasury holdings dropping from $1.32 trillion in 2013 to $784 billion—Washington faces a question: who fills the gap? The TBAC suggests stablecoins might. With legislation expected by August, the U.S. could soon have a framework that turns stablecoins from crypto fringe into fiscal foundation. McKinsey estimates global bank deposits at $117 trillion; if less than 8% of this flows into dollar-backed stablecoins, it would exceed all foreign holdings of U.S. Treasuries. If current projections hold and regulation advances, the next major buyer of U.S. Treasuries may not be China or any foreign government—but a global network of dollar-backed stablecoins.

May 05, 2025 09:10 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, May 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Just months after basking in the glow of a meteoric 700% stock surge, fueled by investor enthusiasm for its artificial intelligence technology and burgeoning ad business, AppLovin Corp. (NASDAQ: APP) is facing a shift in sentiment on Wall Street. Several prominent investment banks have significantly lowered their expectations for the stock following the release of multiple critical reports from short-selling firms about the mobile advertising technology firm. Adding to its woes, AppLovin is now facing a securities class action lawsuit. Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com | 844-916-0895 Analysts Downgrade APP Shares The latest blow came on Friday, April 11, when The Goldman Sachs Group slashed its price target for AppLovin from a lofty $500.00 to a more sobering $335.00. This downgrade followed a similar move by UBS Group earlier in the week, when the firm reduced its price target on AppLovin from $630.00 to $450.00. Short Seller Onslaught: Allegations of Data Exploitation and Inflated Metrics These downward revisions follow a barrage of critical reports from short sellers. Most recently, on March 28, Muddy Waters Research alleged that AppLovin's ad technology "systematically" violates app store rules by "impermissibly extracting proprietary IDs" from major platforms to deliver targeted ads without user consent. The report also claimed a significant churn rate among e-commerce advertisers, contradicting company statements. Earlier, in February, Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research had also critiqued AppLovin's AXON software, with Fuzzy Panda later urging the S&P 500 committee to exclude the company due to alleged "data theft" and "revenue fraud." Securities Class Action Alleges Misleading Statements Adding to AppLovin's challenges, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against the company. The lawsuit alleges that AppLovin misled investors about the capabilities of its enhanced AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and its "cutting-edge AI technologies." Specifically, the lawsuit claims that AppLovin created a false impression that its technology would efficiently match advertisements to mobile games and expand into web-based marketing and e-commerce. However, the suit alleges that AppLovin was instead exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices, including a "backdoor installation scheme," to force unwanted apps on customers. This allegedly inflated installation numbers and, consequently, the company's profit figures. The class action lawsuit further points to the short seller reports released on February 26, 2025, which detailed AppLovin's alleged reverse engineering and exploitation of advertising data from Meta Platforms. These reports also claimed that AppLovin utilized manipulative practices to artificially inflate ad click-through and app download rates, such as self-clicking ads and employing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads.

Title: Trump’s Bid to Transform International Relations May Succeed

Since returning to office in January 2025, US President Donald Trump has aggressively pursued a radical reshaping of US foreign policy. In early March, the State Department terminated foreign assistance programs supporting political opposition and regime change in Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela, as it deemed them no longer in the US’s “national interest.” Trump also reversed the Biden administration’s agreement with Cuba, after it released 553 prisoners, to ease sanctions on the country. In February, the government issued an executive order to dissolve the Inter-American Foundation, an organization that had long promoted economic and community-led development in Latin America. The African Development Foundation is also slated to be eliminated under the executive order. And AFRICOM, the US military command for Africa, could be next. Trump’s sweeping cuts extend to global initiatives like the United States Institute of Peace (USIP), the US Agency for Global Media, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and US support for political prisoners worldwide. Facing a divided opposition, a largely compliant Grand Old Party (GOP) and key loyalists in power, Trump’s teardown of the foreign policy establishment is well underway. In place of the US-led multilateral order, he is embracing a blunt, America First, transactional approach to international affairs centered on military threats, economic coercion through tariffs and sanctions, and stricter immigration policies — stripped of the usual lip service to human rights. One of Trump’s first priorities has been a more aggressive crackdown on unauthorized migration. Weeks into his term, his administration began transferring undocumented immigrants to Guantanamo Bay. While migrant and advocacy groups challenged this action, in March a federal judge “expressed doubts toward those challenging the federal policy,” according to an article by The New York Times. Now, alleged Venezuelan gang members are being sent to El Salvador under a detention agreement with Trump ally El Salvador President Nayib Bukele. Panama, Costa Rica and Honduras have also agreed to accept third-party nationals, under the pressure of tariffs being imposed and other economic measures. Trump is also seeking greater control over strategic infrastructure abroad. In March, a consortium led by US firm Blackrock acquired both Panama Canal ports in a $19 billion deal, which underscores the role of the private sector in realizing his goals. Chinese state-run media criticized the Hong Kong-based seller and labeled the move as “economic coercion.” With Chinese entities removed from the canal, Trump has increasingly hinted at possible military action to secure even broader control over the Panama Canal. In his first term, Trump floated the idea of sending private military companies to Venezuela to topple Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, a tactic that could resurface. Tensions with NATO allies have played out publicly. This has undermined the transatlantic alliance crucial to the US-led global order, with Trump wielding tariffs and even threats of annexation to pressure partners. Trump is also using US aid as leverage to highlight the dependence of partner countries, like shutting off intelligence-sharing and military aid to Ukraine, one of the several pressure tactics used to push Kyiv toward peace talks with Russia. In turn, Senior Advisor to Donald Trump Elon Musk briefly hinted at disabling Starlink services in Ukraine, which are vital for the country’s military communications, before walking back his comments. This pattern of signaling intent is common among Trump allies — before the March 14 executive order was issued to force Voice of America to shut down, Musk publicly called for its closure in February. To continue with his overhaul, Trump must dismantle much of the entrenched civil service and foreign policy bureaucracy, which he struggled with during his first term. Career officials, including some Republicans like John McCain, resisted his agenda through leaks, delays and policy changes. Their efforts were complemented by the GOP’s disdain for the civil service, which has shifted increasingly left in recent decades. In the final months of his first term, Trump issued Schedule F, an executive order that reclassified certain career positions as political appointments, thereby making them easier to dismiss. US President Joe Biden rescinded this order when he took office in January 2021. Dismantling a decades-old political apparatus is no simple feat. Since World War II, Washington has built a vast ecosystem of non-governmental organizations, think tanks and development agencies that shape US foreign policy and diplomacy. Even after the September 11 terror attacks, as President George W. Bush leaned heavily on hard power with the launch of the Global War on Terror, his administration also introduced initiatives like the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the Millennium Challenge Corporation and the President’s Malaria Initiative, to maintain international goodwill while waging unpopular wars. These programs, alongside organizations like the Peace Corps, the US Trade and Development Agency and others mentioned previously, were all repurposed by various administrations, awarded lucrative contracts and had close ties to policymakers. Over time, a revolving door of agencies, contractors and policymakers has reinforced and expanded this system, consolidating funding and influence. Until 2006, USAID’s website openly stated, “The principal beneficiary of America’s foreign assistance programs has always been the United States,” with nearly 80% of USAID contracts and grants flowing to US firms. By 2018, of the $48 billion in official development assistance (ODA), 21% went to governments, 20% to nonprofit organizations, 34% to multilateral organizations and 25% elsewhere. Despite reaching nearly $80 billion in 2023 under the Biden administration, ODA still accounted for just 1.17% of the federal budget. Trump’s efforts to undermine ODA may not just be limited to cutting its spending but also extend to dismantling the core institutions that have driven American foreign policy for decades. Now, in his second term, his purge of the civil service is far more aggressive. After labeling institutions like USIP and the Inter-American Foundation as politicized and aligned with Democratic priorities, Trump has made it harder for Democrats to justify billions of dollars for projects abroad — especially given longstanding concerns over ODA’s efficiency. In 2015, the acting deputy inspector general flagged USAID’s “chronic, systemic weaknesses,” citing poor oversight, weak risk management and human capital issues. By 2017, as Trump intensified scrutiny, the Carnegie Endowment reported that USAID “lacked programmatic focus” and found both the State Department and USAID were overstretched, with little evaluation of their effectiveness. Aid often went to corrupt governments, was too small to make an impact and failed to give Washington meaningful leverage. USIP, originally designed for conflict resolution when introduced in 1984, has increasingly been viewed by critics as a vehicle for nation-building. Similarly, AFRICOM, established in 2007 to promote US national security interests in Africa, has turned its focus toward counterterrorism, with limited results. Aid recipients also face restrictions, often required to purchase goods and services from donor countries like the US. Other areas of ODA, such as global media outreach, promote a more traditional approach favored by Democrats and established foreign policy experts, have also lost their strategic edge as rival powers have undercut their effectiveness. US-backed media outlets like Voice of America, Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty have seen their influence wane amid competition from alternative international networks like Al Jazeera, RT and China’s state-run media. These competitors have reshaped the global information sphere, while decentralized information and social media platforms have proven more effective at reaching audiences. Meanwhile, China’s Belt and Road Initiative has demonstrated the effectiveness of direct infrastructure development investment, offering countries tangible benefits in exchange for strategic concessions, such as port access for Chinese ships. Russia and Israel, in contrast, have shown how unilateral military force can be used to advance foreign policy objectives. Trump views America’s lingering military and economic dominance as key tools for reasserting US power in a changing global order. His more aggressive military stance and mercantilist economic approach prioritize coercion over multilateralism, seeking immediate and concrete gains in the national interest. While previous administrations invested in steady economic and diplomatic maneuvering, Trump’s strategy emphasizes swift tariffs, threats and direct pressure to drive markets and provoke immediate reactions. This approach is unpalatable to the ingrained culture of the current foreign policy bureaucracy. If successful in reshaping American foreign policy, Trump will force a departure from Washington’s historical promotion of free trade. Former US presidents like Bill Clinton, Bush and Barack Obama all reduced tariffs. While Biden eased some with the European Union, he raised them on China. Trump’s global tariff increases and trade wars will have far-reaching implications; it could signal the potential end of the US as a faithful consumer market, challenge the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency and question its commitment to protecting global sea lanes. American democracy promotion, which is never a consistent priority, is now without even rhetorical commitment. While the US has long backed autocrats, Trump’s acceptance of strongman rule extends to adversaries. His recent characterization of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a dictator while avoiding such language for Russian President Vladimir Putin shows a deliberate loosening of ideological constraints. Additionally, the US has long been averse to international law, refusing to ratify the International Criminal Court and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Yet, it has traditionally played a central role in upholding basic global legal frameworks, with Europe often supporting its efforts. Now shunning Europe, Washington’s acceptance of border changes by Russia and Israel signals a growing respect for force, whether from allies or adversaries. China, Iran and others are taking note. They may soon strongly mirror the US’s use of economic and political pressure, reducing the autonomy of smaller countries. Trump’s ongoing dismantling of the foreign policy establishment does not indicate an American retreat from global affairs, but a radical overhaul. Washington is shedding the post-World War II and post-Cold War neoliberal order it created, characterized by multilateralism, in favor of a more confrontational, transactional approach based on unilateral strength. The erosion of institutions is another mark of the end of America’s “unipolar moment” and a return to a more volatile and unpredictable era of global affairs.

ByRachel Wells, Contributor. You may be a liability if you have outdated skill sets. With 2025 breaking records for the most layoffs in February since the pandemic, and the highest number of tech job cuts in April, you’re probably scared that you’ll be the next one receiving a mass email or invited to a suspicious HR call. Increasing numbers of employers are adapting to the AI era, and that means implementing sweeping changes or “restructuring” across their workforce and workflows, and removing employees who don’t align with their agenda or who are costing the company too much money or lack of “efficiency,” as they often term it. Additionally, some like Intel, as reported by TechCrunch, have had lower quarterly earnings than expected, which has necessitated these employers looking across their divisions and seeing what employees are core to the business and which ones they can do without or dispense with. Frankly, when employers make these layoff decisions, there are three top criteria that they evaluate which ultimately influence the specific employees they decide to let go. In an update sent via email, General Assembly interviewed HR directors and managers in tech companies and found that the employees most likely to be let go include those who display these five red flags: It may not be what you want to hear, especially when it comes to remote work, but this is the reality. Thankfully, there are things you can do about it. If you can be replaced by AI, the odds are you will be. And if you’re not sure if your job is prone to being replaced by automation, just check out this list of 21 jobs that are bound to be obsolete by 2030 and are rapidly declining even now. So if you discover that you’re working in a job at high risk of being fully automated, then now is the time to seriously consider making a career pivot. Consider other career paths and job opportunities that leverage your transferable skills and any industry background you have which might be relevant. Think about what you have a passion in, and take time to research what jobs and new skill sets will be in high demand right now, as new job titles are created. Your skills become outdated when you’re not willing to adapt and embrace change. If you remain stuck in the same mindset since you first embarked on your job or career, you will never grow. A growth mindset acknowledges changes that are happening, and instead of ignoring them, seeks to adapt by upskilling, undertaking more professional development, seeking out new opportunities, and reflecting on one’s progress. To ensure your skills are always up to date and in high demand, check out the core skills and rising skills you need in today’s labor market based on recent data from the World Economic Forum, so you can strengthen those areas and include them in your resume. It’s a good idea to periodically check in with your manager to assess how well you’re performing against key indicators and employee standards, including company culture. Don’t just be passive and wait for your boss to inform you when it’s too late. While a good manager will inform you without needing to be asked, some won’t, so you need to be proactive and regularly gauge your performance. Come well-prepared for your one-to-one meetings with your manager. Take time to be self-aware and journal your progress in your job. Note down areas where you could do with some improvement or support, as well as areas where you find you’re exceptionally strong in, and bring these to your line manager. Ask them for support in your weak areas and see if they could recommend or signpost you to peer mentorship or other internal company resources to support your growth. Outside of your job, take time to strengthen your incompetency by undergoing extra training and courses, and attending events if necessary. Of course, there will always be times when a company catches you by surprise and lists your name along with other underperforming employees in a cop-out to cover their atrocious layoffs. You should ensure that you have accurate documentation of your progress and conversations with your manager about your performance so you can challenge this if necessary. If you work in a department that is severely defunded or not receiving due attention and allocation of resources, that’s a strong warning sign that your job is likely on the line. If not now, it will be later. Keep your eyes and ears open for signs of senior leadership dismissing specific departments or projects as not being key priorities. Review your company’s annual statement, its vision, and long-term strategies for the next three to five years. These provide strong indicators of where the company is headed, what areas leadership wants to focus on, and where new job opportunities may arise. If you sense that your role or department might be eliminated in any way, ask your manager to consider how you can progress to another department or role internally. Proactively seek to engage with cross-functional teams and projects, get your hands dirty in everything, and become well-known to several employees within the company at different levels and departments, especially those at the senior leadership level. Make yourself seen and make your presence felt across different projects. This aligns you for better opportunities within the company, so if it decides to cut a project or department, you have already jumped ship to the right place. We’ve already seen this year how thousands of federal employees have been laid off or been threatened with layoffs if they would not comply with the new in-office working stipulations imposed by the Trump administration. Amazon also began mandating all its employees to work from the office five days a week in January, and other companies have also followed. Therefore, if you work within a large company that traditionally embraces hybrid or in-person work, consider yourself a liability. Even if your role is remote right now, there may come a time where it won’t be that way forever, and you’ll be forced to either switch to working more days or hours in the office, or handing in your notice. The safest way to avoid this while continuing to hold on to your remote working status is to opt into freelancing or independent contractor work, particularly where knowledge-based work is concerned. As a freelance professional, you can work on your own terms, on your own schedule, and from whatever location you please, so long as you get the job done. While many employers view remote workers, deprioritized projects, underperformance, outdated skill sets, and automation as valid reasons to lay off their employees, you don’t need to be affected by these red flags. Now that you know what influences the decisions at the top, you can use the tips and resources to future-proof your career and maintain job stability.

Title: News Influencers Are Reaching Young People, and the Media Is Trying to Keep Up

It’s no surprise that young Americans say social media is their preferred way to get news. But a growing number of them are turning to news influencers — those familiar faces who often share frank, relatable, direct-to-camera videos — to learn about what’s going on. In 2024, a Pew Research study found that about one in five Americans (21%) — including 37% of adults under 30 — said they regularly got news from influencers. Divya Nagarajan, 19, a student at Emory University, says that seeing the same people in her feed makes them feel more trustworthy. “It's kind of like the parasocial thing where it feels like I know them,” she tells Teen Vogue. Nagarajan says she favors the conversational tone news influencers use and the personal feel of their content vs. the onslaught of breaking alerts from legacy outlets. Says Rachel Karten, a social media consultant and author of the Link in Bio newsletter, whether it's TikTok or Instagram, people don’t want to leave the platforms where they already scroll, so you have to meet them where they are: "They're not there necessarily to consume news, but if it comes across their feed, they're going to watch it," she explains. "And they're going to start to maybe grow a connection with the person who is reporting that news.” Relatability, perceived trustworthiness, ease of consumption: These are just some of the reasons young people say they’re turning to these influencer voices. Online-first news outlets like NowThis and AJ+ have long understood this; more traditional outlets, however, have only just started experimenting with what has been called “talent-driven journalism,” hiring news influencers who have a strong personal brand to lead their social presence. Influencers can be a great way to connect with new audiences, but there are concerns that social content creators could be fueling the misinformation crisis. According to Pew, 77% of these influencers have no journalism background or affiliation with a news organization, which means they may not have strict standards for vetting the information they share. The growing interest in hiring or promoting camera-ready creators with a strong personal brand is also troubling for journalists who aren’t particularly interested in being social media stars. Of course, talent-driven journalism isn’t exactly new. From familiar names in print to favorite radio hosts to iconic CBS broadcaster Walter Cronkite’s comforting and constant "And that's the way it is" sign-off, people have long preferred voices they recognize. That recognition breeds trust, and it's no different on social media. So some traditional media companies are now bringing influencers in-house, or focusing on growing the followings of in-house creators, to help reach younger audiences. Mayra Báez, an audience strategist and AI consultant, helped launch AJ+, Al Jazeera’s social media news and storytelling project, in 2014, intertwining the outlet’s online brand with journalists' personal brands. In addition to making the news more engaging and approachable, Báez tells Teen Vogue via email, the move put journalists in direct conversation with audiences where they were increasingly spending time: on their phones. “Social media-first newsrooms started doing this over a decade ago; the difference is that legacy media is only now catching up, and not by choice, but out of necessity.” The Washington Post’s social media audience skews younger than its audiences on other platforms, according to the publication’s “TikTok guy” Dave Jorgenson, and audience members feel a personal connection to the account's hosts after seeing them in videos for years. “These people have been with us since they were teenagers, and we take that relationship very seriously,” he says. “We know for a fact that our audience trusts us more because of our presence on TikTok and [YouTube] Shorts.” Jorgenson, who launched the Post’s TikTok channel in 2019, recently spun off a Post-produced series, Local News International, on his personal YouTube channel. The series is designed to be cut down for vertical video and shared on the Post’s other accounts to help grow those audiences. In January, the Post doubled down on its talent-driven strategy, restructuring its public relations division to focus on developing a “star talent unit” — a move that resulted in layoffs at the outlet, which is owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.

Sign up for the Teen Vogue Take Sara Sines, a 24-year-old dancer and performer, says she gets most of her news from influencers on social media, though the content often appears in her feed without her seeking it out. If she recognizes the face of someone whose approach she liked in the past, even if she doesn’t know their name, she stops to hear their take when they pop up on her For You page. For some publishers, social media has been the key to reaching new, younger audience members, like Sines, who may be unfamiliar with an outlet's nonsocial reporting. Morning Brew, which first launched as a business newsletter in 2015, has grown a stand-alone social media audience of millions of followers in part by leaning into creators, says Macy Gilliam, a video producer at the media company. “Young people like to follow people; they don't really like to follow brands,” she notes. "We are people at the brand, so it's kind of like bridging the gap.” Since stepping into an on-camera role two years ago, Gilliam, 24, appears every week in several short videos on Morning Brew’s social channels and has become a recognizable presence. “They'll comment things like, ‘Oh, I love when Macy does this,’ ‘Oh, Macy's always joking about that.’” This familiarity, she says, gives Morning Brew’s audience a stronger affinity for both the creator and the brand. Gilliam, who recently launched a new video franchise under the Morning Brew umbrella, believes introducing creator personalities on an outlet’s existing social channels benefits everyone: In-house influencers bring recognition, personality, and trustworthiness to the brand, creators get the company’s editorial support, and audiences get more engaging content. Talent-driven journalism does present many opportunities. But even as audience strategist Báez acknowledges the positives — news feels more personal, journalists connect directly with an audience, more accessibility, and the chance for people from underrepresented backgrounds to build their own following — she cautions that the practice also poses many challenges for journalists and news-seekers. First, Báez says, social media takes place on “borrowed land,” and is beholden to platforms with changing algorithms that generally deprioritize news. That makes it harder for outlets to ensure their coverage reaches the intended audiences, and for audiences to access the perspectives for which they’re searching. Additionally, Báez points out, not every journalist wants to be a public-facing personality. The shift toward news influencers favors extroverts over highly skilled journalists who do critical behind-the-scenes investigative work. It also increases the likelihood of harassment, burnout, and instability, especially for journalists from marginalized backgrounds. And, as with many shifts in media, this shift favors those who already have social capital, often white, male, well-connected voices, while others still struggle for visibility and support, she explains. Time will tell whether news organizations can invest in influencers to effectively benefit reporters and audiences alike. “Done right, it could strengthen journalism,” says Báez. “Done poorly, it could widen existing inequalities and destabilize an already fragile industry.”

Title: Ben Powell on Market Volatility: Riding the global investment seesaw

BlackRock Investment Institute's APAC Investment Strategist Ben Powell in an interview to ET Now acknowledged market volatility and emphasized that investors must adapt to this new reality. He advised staying calm, avoiding overreaction to short-term movements, and instead focusing on long-term structural shifts to guide investment decisions. Despite ongoing global concerns, market sentiment has recently turned more positive. One of the key contributors has been the continued strength of the AI sector, which is driving growth particularly in the US. India is also benefiting from favorable developments, such as falling oil prices and a more balanced geopolitical position. Notably, the S&P 500 has achieved a nine-day winning streak — a milestone not seen since 2004 — reflecting the strength of current market momentum. Ben Powell attributed the current equity rally to strong earnings, especially from major tech companies. These firms have consistently outperformed expectations, fueled by the ongoing AI boom. Despite widespread concerns, the hard data — particularly earnings reports — has shown resilience. This earnings strength is now the core reason behind the market's recent upswing, rather than sentiment alone. Powell stressed that the global equity landscape has changed dramatically over the past decade. Today, investors need to be more selective and nuanced, especially when considering emerging markets. These markets are not uniform, and in a world increasingly fractured by geopolitical and economic divisions, picking the right markets is essential. Both the US and India stand out as strong contenders in this environment. India is emerging as a key beneficiary of current global shifts. The country stands to gain from the recent decline in oil prices, which supports its macroeconomic stability. Additionally, India’s unique geopolitical stance allows it to negotiate favorable trade arrangements with multiple partners. The Reserve Bank of India may also find more flexibility in its monetary policy, further strengthening the country's economic outlook. Despite recent market gains, risks remain. Powell pointed out that the US economy is still expected to face a contraction, partly due to unresolved trade tensions and potential new tariffs from the US administration. Structural challenges such as labor market disruptions and supply chain issues are also likely to affect corporate earnings and broader economic stability in the coming quarters. Acknowledging the unpredictable nature of the current environment, Powell urged investors to accept that we are no longer in the era of stability seen a decade ago. With rising uncertainty driven by AI, geopolitics, and trade conflicts, the key is to stay grounded and focus on the fundamentals. Even though the headwinds are real, Powell believes the tailwinds — particularly from AI — are powerful enough to keep certain sectors moving forward. Markets are being buoyed by strong corporate earnings, especially in the tech sector, and by transformative forces like artificial intelligence. India continues to benefit from global rebalancing and macroeconomic tailwinds. However, challenges such as an expected slowdown in the US economy and unresolved trade issues remain. In this complex environment, Powell advises sticking to long-term investment principles and recognizing where sustainable growth is likely to emerge.

Title: Buy Or Sell Nvidia Stock Ahead Of Earnings?

WASHINGTON, DC - APRIL 30: U.S. President Donald Trump (L) listens as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaks ... More in the Cross Hall of the White House during an event on "Investing in America" on April 30, 2025 in Washington, DC. Trump was joined by CEOs to highlight companies and their investments in the United States during the event. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is scheduled to announce its Q1 earnings towards the end of May. The consensus estimates earnings of $0.89 per share, reflecting a 45% increase from the previous year, while revenues are projected to rise by 65% year-over-year to $43 billion. This growth is expected to be fueled by sustained high demand for the company’s GPU chips utilized in generative AI applications. In the prior quarter, Nvidia reported having significantly increased the large-scale production of its latest Blackwell AI supercomputers. These new chips, equipped with advanced AI features and premium pricing, could potentially enhance top-line growth throughout Q1 FY’26 (FY’25 concluded in January 2025), while also improving margins. However, investors will keep a close eye on Nvidia’s future projections, especially given the growing uncertainty regarding U.S. trade policies and tariffs affecting key trading partners. The Trump administration is also considering tighter regulations on AI chip exports through newly introduced AI diffusion rules, which could represent a considerable threat to Nvidia’s long-term growth by restricting sales in crucial international markets. Separately, the past three years portend a 60% chance of a positive move, see: How Will D-Wave Quantum (QBTS) Stock React To Its Upcoming Earnings? Nvidia currently has a market capitalization of $2.7 trillion. Revenue over the previous twelve months amounted to $130 billion, alongside an operational profit of $81 billion and a net income of $73 billion. That said, for those seeking upside potential with less volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative, having outperformed the S&P 500 and delivering returns exceeding 91% since its inception. See earnings reaction history of all stocks Here are some insights on one-day (1D) post-earnings returns: Additional data regarding observed 5-Day (5D) and 21-Day (21D) returns following earnings are summarized along with the statistics in the table below. NVDA 1D, 5D, and 21D Post-Earnings Return A relatively less risky approach (though not effective if the correlation is weak) is to examine the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns following earnings, identify a pair that exhibits the highest correlation, and execute the suitable trade. For instance, if 1D and 5D show the strongest correlation, a trader can position themselves “long” for the following 5 days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Here is some correlation data extracted from the 5-year and 3-year (more recent) historical performance. Please note that the correlation 1D_5D refers to the correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns. NVDA Correlation Between 1D, 5D, and 21D Historical Returns At times, the performance of peers can impact the stock's reaction following earnings. In fact, the pricing in may commence prior to the earnings announcement. Here is some historical data comparing the post-earnings performance of Nvidia stock with that of peers who reported earnings just before Nvidia. For a fair comparison, peer stock returns also represent one-day (1D) post-earnings returns. NVDA Correlation With Peer Earnings Discover more about Trefis RV strategy that has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of all 3, the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000), generating strong returns for investors. Additionally, if you are looking for upside potential with a smoother experience than an individual stock like Nvidia, consider the High Quality portfolio.

Title: Microsoft is stealing Amazon's thunder in the cloud — and AI

With almost $10 trillion in combined market cap across Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Meta (META), last week’s Big Tech earnings weren’t just dry corporate updates. They were market-moving events. And despite a few wobbles, the takeaway is clear: AI momentum and operational efficiency are driving a new wave of tech profitability, even as tariffs loom and economic uncertainty lingers. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the widening gap between Wall Street and Main Street, the shift to AI-powered enterprise is shaping up as the gold rush of this decade. Microsoft led the charge, with the stock jumping more than 11% for the week, fueled by surging cloud and AI demand — and management’s clear, detailed take on both in the earnings call. Amazon, for its part, whipsawed before and after its earnings report, but closed the week up about 1%, buoyed by strong margin growth. Only Apple stock slipped, falling 2% as investors weighed a cautious June quarter outlook and a potential $900 million tariff hit. Together, the releases and earnings calls painted a nuanced but largely bullish picture of where Big Tech is headed — and how it’s already reshaping both the market and the macro narrative. If there was one company that seized the AI narrative last week, it was Microsoft. The company delivered a blowout quarter — and an even more confident call — that made clear it’s not just riding the AI boom, but helping define it. Azure cloud revenue grew 33% year-over-year, reaccelerating from the previous quarter and beating both internal targets and Wall Street estimates. Almost half of that growth came from AI workloads — a level of transparency that reinforced Microsoft’s clout in the enterprise AI stack. CEO Satya Nadella and CFO Amy Hood leaned into the idea that AI and non-AI workloads are increasingly indistinguishable, especially among digital-native customers building everything on unified infrastructure. Microsoft’s $80 billion forecast for fiscal 2025 capital expenditures remains intact, with plans to expand further in 2026 — quieting any talk of a slowdown in data center investment. Wedbush called it an “Aaron Judge-like quarter” and raised its price target 8.4% to $515. Crucially, Microsoft didn’t just post strong results — it articulated a confident, forward-looking vision of how AI is already translating into revenue. In a week where every tech CEO had to tell an AI story, Microsoft made its pitch look not just polished, but inevitable. Amazon’s first-quarter results were strong by the numbers: Revenue rose 9% to $155.7 billion, net income rose to $1.59 per share, and operating margins hit a record 11.8%, largely on the back of AWS, Amazon’s profit engine. But with initiatives spanning AI chips, Alexa upgrades, Project Kuiper satellites, Prime Day savings on snail-mucin moisturizers, and even a new James Bond film, Amazon remains a catch-all for tech’s most ambitious threads — which may make its story harder to parse for investors. CEO Andy Jassy emphasized Amazon’s ability to thrive even in a softening economy, pointing to consumer demand strength, faster Prime delivery, and $500 million in customer savings during global sales events. He struck a confident tone on AWS as well, convincinly describing it as a “multi-hundred-billion-dollar” opportunity over time. Still, the cloud business grew just 17% year-over-year — solid, especially off a large base, but slower than Azure’s 33%, and short of the expectations that Microsoft’s blowout quarter had quietly raised. Analysts flagged uncertainty around near-term earnings power, as well as questions about potential tariff impacts and the timeline for Kuiper’s returns. As Deutsche Bank (DB) put it, Amazon’s sheer scale helps it weather global disruption — but that same sprawl can make it tough to gauge momentum or profitability with precision. AWS remains the largest cloud provider — a position it’s held for over a decade, a default authority — and management cited capacity constraints as a limiting factor, though relief may come in the second half of the year. Certainly, the stakes couldn’t be higher. As Jassy noted, we’re still in the early innings of enterprise’s move to the cloud — and that migration is accelerating, powered by AI. Enterprise tech may be the biggest market opportunity of this era, and in that context, “lumpy revenue” is both expected and fair. But with Microsoft setting the pace and reframing what success looks like, Amazon’s longtime dominance feels just a bit less assured. In the meantime, Amazon is betting that its everything-now strategy will pay off later. Of course, this isn’t a zero-sum game: The enterprise AI market is big enough to crown multiple winners, and both Microsoft and Amazon will undoubtedly be among the biggest. But in a moment where narrative clarity matters, Microsoft pulled ahead. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: For GenZers working in clean energy, DOGE's cuts mean finding creative career pivots

In just four months, Aaron Yang's young career in renewable energy had hit the highs and lows you might expect of a more seasoned worker. Yang, 22, graduated from New York University in December and landed a job at the Department of Energy in an office doling out grants to nascent clean technologies like hydrogen, advanced nuclear, and long-duration battery storage. By April, he had been fired, rehired, and accepted a voluntary buyout under President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's efforts to shrink the federal government. Renewable energy programs were a top target, with Trump on January 20 signing an executive order freezing funding authorized by the Inflation Reduction Act, President Joe Biden's signature climate law. Since then, thousands of federal employees working on clean energy, environmental justice, and climate science have been terminated. "Throughout college, I worked toward this career path," Yang told Business Insider in April at a career fair in Washington, DC. "Then I got into the DOE and felt that was a huge achievement. So to then immediately get laid off has been tough to reconcile." Yang is among many Gen Zers entering a job market defined by hiring slumps in industries like tech, finance, and consulting. The upheaval in Washington has further clouded their career paths, particularly in the renewable energy industry, as tariffs and frozen federal funding have led companies to delay new projects or scrap them altogether. White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers cited Friday's strong jobs report to say that Trump was bringing jobs back "and making America the world's manufacturing powerhouse once again." A DOE spokesperson told Business Insider that the department was still reviewing its organizational structure to align with the president's priorities. "The American people provided President Trump with a mandate to govern and to unleash affordable, abundant, and secure American energy," they said, adding, "No final decisions have been made and multiple plans are still being considered." At a job fair during DC's inaugural Climate Week, more than 50 companies and trade associations met some 1,200 job seekers. They lined up to chat with firms including Amazon, the solar manufacturer Qcells, and Arcadia, an AI analytics platform for energy. Zainab Mirza organized the job fair for Clean Energy for America, a trade group that lobbies Congress and the administration on issues like protecting tax credits for renewable energy. Mirza experienced similar career setbacks as Yang. She graduated from American University in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, which thwarted her plans to pursue a career in international development overseas. In February, she was laid off from the DOE's Loan Program Office, where she had just become a full-time employee after being a contractor for two years. The slashed investments go beyond the federal government. In the first three months of 2025, companies canceled, closed, or downsized projects totaling nearly $8 billion in investment. This affected 16 new factories for electric vehicles, batteries, and hydrogen — more than three times the cancellation rate over the previous 30 months, according to an analysis by E2, a business group that advocates for clean energy, and the think tank Atlas Public Policy. "If this self-inflicted and unnecessary market uncertainty continues, we'll almost certainly see more projects paused, more construction halted, and more job opportunities disappear," Michael Timberlake, spokesperson for E2, said in a statement. Between January 2024 and March 2025, the number of new job postings across renewable power — including solar, wind, nuclear, hydropower, and geothermal — dropped by more than 20%, indicating a slowdown in labor demand, an analysis Revelio Labs conducted for BI showed. Some companies continue to invest in the energy transition. In March, 10 solar, EV, and transmission manufacturing plants were announced, which, if built, could create 5,000 permanent jobs. That includes Tesla's plans to build a battery factory near Houston. Despite the hurdles, Mirza was optimistic about the future. While the DOE is expected to be less active and shift away from wind and solar projects, it may help finance nuclear, geothermal, and power grid resilience. Katie Mehnert, CEO of ALLY Energy, an online career and networking platform, said the energy industry is always changing. Mehnert lives in Texas, where layoffs are also hitting the oil and gas sector. The rise of artificial intelligence is ushering in another transformation of how businesses operate. But there will be jobs, Mehnert said. ALLY recently partnered with Parallel, an AI-driven jobs platform that aims to make job hunting more efficient and better match people's expertise to openings. "We need more energy, we need sustainable energy, we need affordable energy," Mehnert said. "And there's plenty of money that's been deployed. Now we need to find the best talent and match them with opportunities quicker. That way, we can minimize the disruption in job marketing and people's personal lives." Mirza, for her part, encouraged young people to be open-minded to positions they may not have considered. "I'm not sure where I want to go next," Mirza said. "I've had a blast putting this event together. I think that people here can meet with employers they might not have heard of or thought about, or a skill that they haven't developed. There are upskilling opportunities. There are incubators. Maybe you've had an idea for so long, and now you can test it out." Yang said he's open-minded, too. Although his time at DOE was focused on long-duration energy storage like batteries, he is open to other technologies. During his undergrad internships, Yang worked on transmission infrastructure, sales teams, and policy development. For now, Yang decided to accelerate his pursuit of a master's in energy, policy, and climate at Johns Hopkins University while looking for a full time job. He's come close several times, but ultimately, someone with more experience was hired. "That's no fault of my own," Yang said. "There are a ton of talented people out there right now, and I haven't worked full-time yet. So I'm cautiously optimistic. I don't know what my future holds." Do you have a story to share?

Title: Market Mayhem and Recovery: Wall Street’s Wild Ride in 2025

On April 2, President Trump stunned the markets by announcing unexpectedly steep tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners. The reaction was swift and severe — the S&P 500 plummeted nearly 12%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost about 4,600 points in just four days. The sudden escalation raised fears that Trump was willing to risk a recession to reshape the global trade landscape.(Source: AP) Despite the initial crash, the U.S. stock market began to recover quickly. By early May, the S&P 500 had climbed back to the levels seen on April 2. While still over 7% below its all-time high, the market’s rapid bounce-back was just as unexpected and dramatic as the fall that preceded it. A major turning point came on April 9 when Trump announced a “90-day PAUSE” on most tariffs, excluding those targeting China. This announcement led to a massive one-day rally, with the S&P 500 jumping 9.5% — one of its best performances ever. However, controversy followed as Trump had posted on Truth Social earlier that day calling it a “great time to buy,” raising questions about timing and market influence. Following the pause, the market saw a mix of optimism and confusion. Trump spoke about both negotiating and enforcing tariffs to bring manufacturing back to the U.S., a seemingly contradictory stance. Still, signs of easing tensions, particularly with China, and the reduction of tariffs on cars and consumer electronics helped calm some investor nerves. The sharp stock selloff after "Liberation Day" also shook other financial markets. U.S. Treasury bond prices fell, and the dollar weakened, reflecting a loss of investor confidence in America’s financial safety. Trump himself acknowledged that bond market jitters contributed to his decision to delay tariffs, as investors grew increasingly uneasy. Despite shaken consumer confidence, economic data painted a stronger picture. April saw 177,000 new jobs added, supporting the view that the economy remained resilient. The Federal Reserve, which had already cut rates three times in late 2024, chose to hold steady, watching the evolving impact of trade policy. Nonetheless, markets continue to price in the likelihood of three more cuts by year-end. Even amid uncertainty, U.S. companies have posted surprisingly strong earnings. Nearly 75% of S&P 500 firms, including giants like Microsoft and Meta, beat profit expectations, with overall earnings growth nearing 13%. However, many CEOs are hesitant about the future, offering cautious or dual forecasts — as United Airlines did — due to unpredictable trade policies. With the tariff pause nearing expiration, volatility could return swiftly if no lasting agreements are reached.

Title: The Degen Banker: When Wall Street Meets Crypto Twitter (Nkahiseng Ralepeli)

Once upon a time, calling yourself a “degen” was financial heresy. It meant you YOLO’d into dog coins, aped into DeFi yield farms with 6,000% APRs, and spent more time in Discord than on Bloomberg. You were a creature of chaos, allergic to compliance decks and powered by memes and Metamask. But times have changed. Today, the degen banker is no longer a contradiction in terms. It’s a job description. It’s also a symptom of something far more seismic: the full-on convergence between crypto-native innovation and institutional finance. And if you’re still under the impression that institutions are sitting this one out, let me offer you a very different reality—one backed by numbers, balance sheets, and, yes, some very large suits chasing digital alpha. From Edge to Centre: Institutional Inflows Are Here Crypto may have been born in rebellion, but it’s growing up in a three-piece suit. In 2024 alone, over $10 billion in institutional capital flowed into digital asset products globally, with Bitcoin ETFs accounting for nearly $5 billion of that figure in just the first quarter of their U.S. launch. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) alone crossed $15 billion in AUM within five months of going live. That’s not degen retail—those are RIAs, wealth managers, and pension funds, slowly but surely embracing exposure. And it’s not just ETFs. 47% of hedge funds now have digital asset exposure, up from just 33% in 2022, according to PwC’s latest global crypto hedge fund report. Meanwhile, tokenized U.S. Treasuries—yes, on-chain government bonds—grew by over 450% in the past year, surpassing $1.5 billion in market cap, with players like Franklin Templeton and BlackRock issuing tokenized bonds on public and permissioned blockchains. Tokenized treasuries have now surpassed the $5 billion mark. What’s more, Bank of America, Citi, JPMorgan, HSBC, and Standard Chartered now all have live pilots or products in tokenization, custody, or blockchain-based payments. No longer science experiments, these projects are tied to core infrastructure upgrades and new commercial models. In 2023, JPMorgan’s Onyx processed over $900 billion in value using blockchain for repo transactions. That’s not weekend degen liquidity; that’s wholesale capital markets saying, “We’ll have what DeFi’s having—but with compliance, please.” Why Institutions Are Frothing to Play Let’s not kid ourselves—institutions aren’t here because they suddenly developed a soft spot for decentralisation. They’re here because: So yes, the gold rush is real. But this time, it's not prospectors with pickaxes—it's institutions with policy teams and quarterly earnings calls. The Great Cultural Merge The cultural tension here is delicious. Imagine a DeFi protocol engineer explaining LP mechanics to a middle-office credit team. Or a banker asking a DAO treasurer how to assess counterparty risk when the counterparty is pseudonymous. But it’s happening. Slowly, messily, and with a lot of mutual mistrust—but it’s happening. This cultural merge is forcing both sides to evolve: And for all the friction, the convergence is producing real-world innovation: programmable bonds, on-chain invoices, stablecoin-based treasury products, and more. So, What’s a Degen Banker, Really? A degen banker isn’t just a meme or an oxymoron. It’s a recognition that the future of finance is hybrid. It’s someone who understands that slippage and spreads matter just as much as smart contract audits. That compliance isn’t a blocker—it’s a moat. That building trustless infrastructure doesn’t mean we abandon trust; it means we rebuild it on different rails. And let’s be honest: the degen bankers are winning. Because while crypto’s early believers were often dismissed as naïve gamblers, it turns out we were early to a fundamental truth: money is information, and the next generation of financial infrastructure would be digital, open, and programmable. Today, institutions are just catching up. Final Word We are no longer in a world of “either/or.” We are living the “both/and.” You can trade options and still mint NFTs. You can issue a bond and wrap it on Ethereum. You can quote LIBOR and know what MEV is. That’s the world we’re heading into. The only question is: are you still watching from the sidelines? Or are you ready to go full degen—in a tie?

Title: The Irish passport at 100: Not just a travel document but a declaration of hope and of reclaiming identity

Weeks after Terence Reynolds, originally from Cloncowley, Drumlish, Co Longford, died at his home in Yonkers in New York, his daughter Christina found an old suitcase in the attic. “[It had] a single identifying label in cream tape with a handwritten writing stating CLONCOWLEY,” she wrote in reply to a request from the Department for Foreign Affairs for stories about Irish passports. The story of Terence Reynolds is one of scores told in an exhibition on the history of the now 100-years-old passport at Epic, the Irish emigration museum on Custom House Quay in Dublin. Throughout, it has not just been a travel document, but often a declaration of hope in a better future for those who left Ireland’s shores, or a reclaiming of identity by many of those in the Irish diaspora today. The suitcase was the one Terence Reynolds, a carpenter, had carried from his Cloncowley home: “Inside, I found what I believe was my dad’s very first Irish passport. It was in pristine condition, frozen in time.” His photograph was one she had never seen before, revealing “a very young, fresh-faced” man “full of hope, ambition, and the quiet determination that would carry him across the Atlantic”. “I sat there imagining this young 20-year-old in 1968 getting on a plane for the first time and landing in 1960s New York, taking up abode in Inwood,” his daughter writes. The contribution by Christina Reynolds illustrates one of the key themes of the On The Move exhibition, says Epic’s historian, Catherine Healy: “We really wanted to tap into the emotions around passports.” The first Irish passports were used by WT Cosgrave, Desmond Fitzgerald and the delegation that went to Geneva in 1923 to take up the Irish Free State’s League of Nations place “to resounding applause”. The public began to apply for the passports from April 1924, although significant tensions emerged between Dublin and London over the terminology to be used. Writing from London, Fitzgerald, the minister for external relations, told the department’s top official, Joseph P Walshe, of a meeting with “a most objectionable” Foreign Office official. The British were insistent that the term “British subject” be used, arguing that any other language breached the Anglo-Irish Treaty and would “cause endless trouble and confusion”. Regarding the Irish passport as “a branch” of the British one, the British side, the records show, “didn’t want Irishmen going around over in the US saying that they’re not British subjects”. The British arguments were a nonsense, Fitzgerald told them, since “the term ‘British subject’ included everyone from (prime minister Stanley) Baldwin to an undiscovered savage in British Guiana”. In the end, an uneasy compromise was reached: “Ultimately, bearers were described as a ‘citizen of the Irish Free State, one of the British Commonwealth of Nations’,” says Healy. The early troubles did not end there because British consular officials sometimes refused to recognise the passport or doctored it if it was handed in to them, writing “British subject” in, she says. The first passport, well finished with a hard cover, cost 1 shilling. For most in the 1920s and 1930s, and later, it was not a declaration of pride but an exit document required for emigration. Now available usually within days, for decades passports took longer to get. “Passport officials were handwriting documents right up until the 1990s,” says Healy. Security has tightened, too. A cabinet illuminated by ultraviolet light highlights just some of the security features of today’s passports, including Celtic imagery invisible to the naked eye. The latest electronic passports now display the holders’ biometric image three times – as a photograph, a laser imprint and a hologram. Tougher security was prompted from the late 1980s following a series of incidents, including the conviction of an Irish official in 1989 who sold passports to North African buyers. In 2010, Micheál Martin, then the Minister for Foreign Affairs, ordered an Israeli diplomat to leave Ireland after Israel’s intelligence agency, Mossad, used Irish passports in the Dubai killing of a leading Hamas figure. [ From the archive: Fake passports? They're part of a very long storyOpens in new window ] The exhibition tells the stories of the famous, and those not so famous. Poet, WB Yeats – by then a senator – travelled on Irish, not British documents, to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature in Stockholm in December 1923. Not every artist thought the same way, however. James Joyce, who lived in Paris in the 1920s and 1930s , never applied for one: “That surprised me,” says Healy. However, he did seek one during the second World War for his daughter, Lucia, who he tried to move to Switzerland from the Parisian mental asylum where she was staying. “German officials were already aware that she had British papers and said that it wouldn’t be possible. She remained (in Paris) until 1951,” says the Epic historian. Joyce never explained his attitude. “It could have been purely pragmatic,” she says, “or possibly resentment against the Free State, which he saw as quite suffocating. “In one of his letters to his son, he says he was advised to get an Irish passport, and he declined and got a British replacement instead. So, he consciously chose not to do so.” For others, however, an Irish passport has been hugely important. Take Abigail O’Reilly, two of whose grandparents, Bill Phillips and his wife, Jean, left Cabra and Fairview respectively for 1960s England. “They were part of the ‘forgotten generation’,” says O’Reilly, telling of how her grandparents “ended up working together on the buses where he was the driver and she the conductor”. During a break in Covid restrictions, O’Reilly moved to Dublin in 2020 for college. “My grandfather and I have forged a really special bond. He has started opening up to me about his childhood,” she says. Suffering from dementia, his childhood memories are now uppermost in his mind; cycling through Moore Street with friends, knowing Brendan Behan. “Ireland now seems to hold a much more romantic and nostalgic place in his mind,” says O’Reilly. A year ago, she received her own Irish passport. “I feel incredibly lucky and proud to have been able to return to a country which my grandparents were not able to remain in. I feel all the more connected to them,” she says. The exhibition also tells of the secrets of the past, including of the adoption of thousands of Irish children who were sent abroad on Irish passports until the 1970s, “With their birth name in the document”, says Healy. She tells the story of Brian Burke, who was born in Dublin to a single mother and spent his first year in St Patrick’s Infant Hospital in Blackrock. “He was adopted by an American couple in the US in the 1950s, even though legislation at the time didn’t allow overseas adoptions. In his photo, he’s just over a year-and-a-half old,” she says. Once adopted, his name was changed to Daniel Doherty. Before his mother died, his adoptive mother shared with him his carefully kept adoption records. Embarking on his journey to discover his Irish heritage, he requested in 2021, when he renewed his passport seven decades later, that both of his names would appear. And now they do. A year later, he returned to Ireland, learning of “an amazing family history”. “I am blessed and thankful for the life I was given and the path I was set on so long ago,” he said. “I am proud to be from Ireland and I value my Irish citizenship. It has been an amazing journey that started 70 years ago with a little green Irish passport.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: The Oracle of Omaha Steps Down

After over six decades at the helm of Berkshire Hathaway, the end of this year marks the finale: Investment legend Warren Buffett is stepping down. Buffett weathered market storms and geopolitical turbulence by translating the Bretton Woods order into a consistent portfolio strategy. As always, it was business as usual: Around 20,000 Berkshire shareholders filled the CHI Health Center in Omaha, Nebraska, to capacity -- the annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholders’ meeting was underway. Known in investment circles as the “Woodstock” of investors, the event traditionally unfolds as a whirlwind tour through the American economy. The accompanying exhibition of Berkshire’s investments showcases what resonates with American consumers: Apple, Coca-Cola, Kraft Heinz, or American Express -- a veritable trade show of national brand leaders. Here, retail and institutional investors alike are reassured that Omaha remains true to its roots: conservative, grounded, quintessentially American, and always in tune with the consumer. This strategy has been managed from Berkshire’s headquarters at Blackstone Plaza. This approach has propelled Berkshire’s stock to a staggering 4.4 million percent increase since its transformation from a textile company into an investment fund in 1962. The never-split original share recently hit a price of $800,000 -- a figure worthy of the Guinness Book of Records. By comparison, the broad S&P 500 index “only” grew by 31,000 percent over the same period. A Routine with a Bombshell Let’s pause the number games and return to Omaha. Attendees of the shareholders’ meeting on May 3, 2025, quickly realized they were witnessing a turning point: At 94, Warren Buffett announced his resignation as chairman. By year’s end, 62-year-old Canadian Greg Abel, currently vice chairman for non-insurance operations, will take the reins. This will take some getting used to, as Buffett is a stock market institution, a calming force in the frenetic world of Wall Street, from which he maintained a safe distance -- not just geographically, with his base in far-off Nebraska. Buffett shaped the investment landscape like few others over his 63-year tenure. His strategy was clear-cut: a heavy focus on equity investments in U.S. market leaders, almost entirely eschewing bonds, and aligning the fund’s cash position with the waves of the credit cycle. Berkshire cashed out investments when strategically prudent or when the economy’s credit engine overheated. This disciplined oscillation between U.S. dollar reserves and aggressive equity buildups after market corrections has outperformed the classic 60/40 stock-bond portfolio by leaps and bounds. A deep understanding of economic cycles, industry growth, and specific company valuations forged an unbeatable alliance that turned countless loyal shareholders into millionaires. Embedded in the Bretton Woods Framework With an estimated fortune of $160 billion, Buffett, the world’s fifth-richest person, remained true to himself. His conservative investment style is mirrored in his personal life: no scandals, three children from two marriages, and he still lives in the Omaha house he bought in 1958. In soccer terms, his strategy might be called a “controlled offensive.” Buffett’s investment thesis was rooted in the post-war Bretton Woods order, betting on the dominant U.S. market -- and he was spot-on. The U.S. dollar’s dominance remains unbroken, still a safe-haven currency in crises. U.S. companies like Apple, Domino’s Pizza, or Chevron lead their market segments, aided by a U.S. regulatory framework that welcomes foreign capital with open arms. In short, Buffett’s framework: Capital is mobile, the U.S. offers an open market system combining liquidity and growth, and the domestic currency, as a cash buffer, never faced serious devaluation risks compared to global competitors. This stability was underpinned by decades of U.S. interventionist foreign policy, leaving no room for doubt. Berkshire became a meta-investment structure, enabling retail investors to back the U.S. market as a whole through government-backed stock ownership programs. Monetary Policy as a Multiplier Berkshire also capitalized on another insight: Investment success hinges not only on analysis but also on systemic factors. These lie in the design of the global monetary order. With the end of the gold standard in 1971 (Nixon Shock), global credit creation accelerated. Since then, the global money supply (M2 -- cash, checking deposits, and short-term savings) has grown by an average of 6.9% annually. The fiat standard -- credit creation without full backing by assets like gold or commodities -- unleashed waves of liquidity. These inflated nominal asset valuations, turning assets like real estate into “savings banks” to preserve purchasing power against currency devaluation. Buffett recognized this liquidity mechanism, effectively “front-running” the money-printing machine with his investment style. A New Investment Regime The handover comes amid significant geopolitical upheaval. With his tariff push, U.S. President Donald Trump has exposed a long-simmering issue: a crisis in U.S. Treasuries as a globally accepted safe asset. Markets are now pricing new risk premiums into asset classes. Volatility is rising, and governments, central banks, and major capital pools are increasingly eyeing safe-haven assets like gold and Bitcoin. Capital rotation into these assets reflects efforts to reduce credit default risks, which lurk like a ticking time bomb under traditional portfolio structures. How will Berkshire Hathaway navigate geopolitical uncertainty and inflation risks? During the COVID lockdowns and expansive monetary policy, Buffett foresaw rising inflation and briefly positioned Berkshire in the gold sector, investing in Barrick Gold in 2020 -- a notable move for the traditionally gold-skeptical Buffett. Yet, by Q4 of that year, the firm exited the position. This brief gold foray and swift retreat seem, in hindsight, like an acknowledgment of an emerging monetary system crisis. However, Buffett’s team may have been reluctant to admit that a radical devaluation of dollar collateral -- a potential regime change -- was already underway. Will Berkshire steer toward safe havens? The question looms: How will the new leadership under Greg Abel handle safe-haven assets in a shifting global landscape? Will Omaha continue to bet on U.S. policy’s ability to consolidate budgets and fiscal frameworks in the spirit of free markets? And will it trust in a U.S. economic comeback under President Trump? Financial analysts, media, and policymakers will closely watch the strategic decisions of Berkshire’s new leadership. For Berkshire’s over one million shareholders worldwide, Buffett’s exit marks the start of a new chapter, fueled by hope that the controlled offensive that made the firm strong will succeed in the evolving financial world. The meeting closed with a cryptic remark from the Oracle of Omaha. Commenting on recent trade policy developments and current crises, Buffett hinted: “It may be that things happen in the United States that cause us to own a lot of other currencies.” Time will tell how this pointed warning will manifest in Berkshire’s portfolio in the months ahead.

These inflated nominal asset valuations, turning assets like real estate into “savings banks” to preserve purchasing power against currency devaluation. Buffett recognized this liquidity mechanism, effectively “front-running” the money-printing machine with his investment style. A New Investment Regime The handover comes amid significant geopolitical upheaval. With his tariff push, U.S. President Donald Trump has exposed a long-simmering issue: a crisis in U.S. Treasuries as a globally accepted safe asset. Markets are now pricing new risk premiums into asset classes. Volatility is rising, and governments, central banks, and major capital pools are increasingly eyeing safe-haven assets like gold and Bitcoin. Capital rotation into these assets reflects efforts to reduce credit default risks, which lurk like a ticking time bomb under traditional portfolio structures. How will Berkshire Hathaway navigate geopolitical uncertainty and inflation risks? During the COVID lockdowns and expansive monetary policy, Buffett foresaw rising inflation and briefly positioned Berkshire in the gold sector, investing in Barrick Gold in 2020 -- a notable move for the traditionally gold-skeptical Buffett. Yet, by Q4 of that year, the firm exited the position. This brief gold foray and swift retreat seem, in hindsight, like an acknowledgment of an emerging monetary system crisis. However, Buffett’s team may have been reluctant to admit that a radical devaluation of dollar collateral -- a potential regime change -- was already underway. Will Berkshire steer toward safe havens? The question looms: How will the new leadership under Greg Abel handle safe-haven assets in a shifting global landscape? Will Omaha continue to bet on U.S. policy’s ability to consolidate budgets and fiscal frameworks in the spirit of free markets? And will it trust in a U.S. economic comeback under President Trump? Financial analysts, media, and policymakers will closely watch the strategic decisions of Berkshire’s new leadership. For Berkshire’s over one million shareholders worldwide, Buffett’s exit marks the start of a new chapter, fueled by hope that the controlled offensive that made the firm strong will succeed in the evolving financial world. The meeting closed with a cryptic remark from the Oracle of Omaha. Commenting on recent trade policy developments and current crises, Buffett hinted: “It may be that things happen in the United States that cause us to own a lot of other currencies.” Time will tell how this pointed warning will manifest in Berkshire’s portfolio in the months ahead.

Title: Arizona Governor Shoots Down Plans for State Bitcoin Reserve

Arizona’s governor has vetoed legislation that would have let the state invest in cryptocurrency. “The Arizona State Retirement System is one of the strongest in the nation because it makes sound and informed investments,” Gov. Katie Hobbs wrote Friday (May 2) in a letter to state Sen. Warren Petersen, president of the state Senate. “Arizonans’ retirement funds are not the place for the state to try untested investments like virtual currencу.” State lawmakers last week approved legislation that would have established a bitcoin reserve, allowing the state to invest as much as 10% of its public funds in digital assets. Republican state Sen. Wendy Rogers told NBC News last week that it was in Hobbs’ best interest to sign the legislation, which would have created the first state-level bitcoin reserve in the country. “Crypto and bitcoin have a huge following nationwide and in Arizona. They are wildly popular with the youth and independents,” Rogers said, adding, “I certainly hope she signs it, because she can take credit and it will make her look good.” She voiced her disappointment with Hobbs on X following the governor’s decision on Friday, writing: “Politicians don’t understand that Bitcoin doesn’t need Arizona. Arizona needs Bitcoin.” The efforts by state lawmakers to establish an Arizona bitcoin reserve mirror plans by President Donald Trump to create a similar reserve on a national level. And as PYMNTS wrote last week, it’s also a sign of the growing mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. “Observers believe it is becoming increasingly held, across Wall Street and beyond, that digital assets may no longer be confined to speculative circles. As bitcoin ETFs become a growing component of diversified portfolios and regulatory frameworks begin to crystallize, the decentralization dream that once defined crypto appears to be giving way to a new era of structured integration. “It’s no longer a novelty to see major investment firms exploring crypto, but this year has seen a turning point. Morgan Stanley is preparing to offer cryptocurrency trading to its vast E*Trade customer base as soon as next year, with the potential to introduce millions of retail investors to digital assets via a familiar platform. “Meanwhile, Charles Schwab is preparing to offer spot crypto trading for bitcoin and ethereum within the year, with the goal of meeting increasing demand from traditional investors. “These moves are not isolated,” the report added. “BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is pushing blockchain technology deeper into conventional finance. The firm recently announced plans to register a new share class of its $150 billion money market fund on a blockchain, a step designed to enhance transparency and operational efficiency.” Arizona Governor Shoots Down Plans for State Bitcoin Reserve Trump's 'Warm Spot' for TikTok Could Extend Ban Deadline Again Airbnb: 50% of Users Turn to AI Bot for Customer Service Wendy's Predicts Diners Will Feel Pressured All Year We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Earnings Season And Waiting On The Fed

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. I write about investing, markets and Berkshire Hathaway. ByBill Stone, Contributor. Beyond tariffs and earnings, the big event will be the Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday. Markets ... More expect no rate changes from the Federal Reserve. The focus will be on Chair Powell’s comments and whether June is a likely time to lower rates again. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) After the busiest week of earnings releases, almost three-quarters of companies have released results. 76% of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. This earnings season slows this week, with 93 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. In addition to earnings, the Federal Reserve (Fed) meets on Wednesday. S&P 500 Earnings Season According to FactSet data, the healthcare, consumer discretionary, communication services, and technology sectors contributed most positively to last week's earnings growth improvement. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the S&P 500’s blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is 12.8% year-over-year, above the 7.2% expectations at the end of the quarter. Notably, the expected earnings and sales growth rates for calendar years 2025 and 2026 have declined despite the better-than-expected first-quarter results so far. S&P 500 Earnings Summary Better tariff news combined with strong earnings sent stocks higher by 2.9% last week. After this week’s rally, the S&P 500 sits 7.5% below its mid-February high. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed last week. The group is 17% below the mid-December all-time high. Market Total Returns Because these companies are critical drivers of earnings growth and account for a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 remains the group to watch this earnings season. Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), and Amazon.com (AMZN) reported last week, and all but Amazon outperformed expectations. While Amazon came up short, the earnings pace was robust, and the stock was still higher for the week. Four of the Magnificent 7 are scheduled to report results this week: Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META) on Wednesday; Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) on Thursday. Nvidia (NVDA) is the last of the magnificent 7 stocks yet to report and is not expected until the end of May. Magnificent 7 Earnings Beyond the Magnificent 7, this week of the reporting season has some notable companies scheduled, including Clorox (CLX), Uber Technologies (UBER), Emerson Electric (EMR), and Walt Disney (DIS). Earnings Insights By Sector According to FactSet data, the healthcare, consumer discretionary, communication services, and technology sectors were the most significant contributors to the increase in earnings. It was a broad-based improvement in earnings as every sector except energy saw better earnings growth rates last week. Earnings Growth By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this early point in the earnings season, sales growth at 4.8% is above the 4.4% expectations. The technology sector is expected to provide the most robust revenue growth. Sales Growth By Sector As discussed in a previous piece, a surge in imports was a massive headwind to GDP growth. Net exports were a whopping 4.8 percentage point drag on the economy. According to Goldman Sachs, this is the most significant drag from net exports on record as companies raced to import goods to avoid the coming tariffs. GDP Components Due to the trade distortion, final sales to private domestic purchasers are a better measure to watch, and they continued to perform well at 3% growth. This measure excludes the impacts of trade, inventories, and government spending, so it does a better job of measuring the activity of the U.S. private sector. Measures Of Economic Activity Monthly nonfarm payrolls grew by an above-consensus 177,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate held steady at 4.2%. Despite the 58,000 downward revision of payroll jobs over the previous months, the monthly jobs report has to be considered solid. Monthly Jobs Report The GDP report, especially when combined with the monthly jobs growth, does not signal an imminent recession despite the -0.3% decline in headline economic activity. This does not mean that we won’t eventually see more economic slowing due to tariffs, but this isn’t it yet. Consumer spending did moderate somewhat, so it is still fair to say the economy was softening a bit even before the tariff impact. Markets will remain very attuned to newsflow around the tariffs since the size and duration of the tariffs impact the extent of the economic growth headwind. Beyond tariffs, the big event will be the Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday. Markets expect no rate changes from the Federal Reserve, especially after the better-than-expected jobs report. The focus will be on Chair Powell’s comments and whether June is a likely time to lower rates again. Expected Fed Rate Cuts Despite the negative GDP results for the first quarter, the economy is not in a recession. This view is further bolstered by the better-than-expected job growth reported last week. The Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) annual meeting and first quarter earnings release on Saturday were eventful. Warren Buffett shocked the crowd with the announcement that he plans to resign from his role as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway at year-end.

Title: Why the Panama Canal is a big, long-term prize in Trump's global trade war

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time The Panama Canal has spent the past few years battling extreme weather, with the El Niño phenomenon and severe drought leading to a water-level crisis. Now, it’s President Trump’s trade war that is threatening the global trade gateway. A critical passage for U.S. East Coast bound ocean freight container traffic, the Panama Canal is facing a potential business slump as a result of Trump’s China tariffs and a rapid decline in manufactured goods being ordered by U.S. shippers. Forty percent of all U.S. container traffic travels through the Panama Canal every year, and in all, $270 billion in cargo annually. The U.S. and China are the top users of the Panama Canal, and its role in global shipping has increased in recent years due to the disruption of global supply chains. The Panama Canal Authority’s revenue hit $3.38 billion last year, despite drought conditions, and revenue has increased every year since 2017. The trade war uncertainty and Trump’s 145% tariff on Chinese goods — which will start to hit goods arriving from China to U.S. ports on May 27 based on the four to six weeks it takes for ocean freight to reach the U.S. from Asia — has already resulted in a massive pause on U.S. imports bound from China. According to data from supply chain intelligence firm Project44, there has been a 300% increase in blank sailings (cancelled freight vessels) from China to the United States since Trump’s so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs announcement on April 2. West Coast ports in the U.S. are already being hit and the impact on East Coast ports is expected to increase, with the pullback in vessels a result of the decrease in manufacturing orders for Chinese factories: less products manufactured translates into less shipping containers for ocean carriers. For the Asia to North America East Coast trade route, Sea-Intelligence has recorded a cumulative blanked capacity of 261,822 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs.) over the last six weeks. This decrease in containers and vessels can impact Panama Canal revenue. The Panama Canal makes its money off of the number of vessel transits and containers moving through the waterway. ″Since close to 75% of our cargo goes to or from the United States, any recession worldwide or in the United States will impact somehow the Panama Canal,” said Boris Moreno, vice president of operations for the Panama Canal Authority. “That’s for sure.″ One of the “Seven Wonders of the Modern World,” according to the American Society of Civil Engineers, the canal has been a lightning rod for controversy in recent years in the battle for global supremacy between the U.S. and China. Trump has claimed the canal’s key ports are being controlled by China and has threatened to reassert U.S. control over the canal, accusing Panama of charging excessive rates. China, along with government of Panama, have denied those claims. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth both visited with Panamanian government officials in recent months. ″I think that Panama over the last five years has inched closer and closer to China and away from the United States,” Federal Maritime Commissioner Louis Sola said in an interview with CNBC earlier this year. “I’ve seen China and Brazil take away $20 billion with direct contracts. We definitely need to at least have a game there.” Ricaurte Vasquez, administrator for the Panama Canal Authority, tells CNBC that with the U.S. being the world’s largest economy, it is reviewing Trump’s concerns. “Whatever is said in Washington has repercussions all over,” said Vasquez. “We try to stay cool, calm and collected.” He added, “It is not true that we are run by Chinese. It is not true that we differentiate rates. It is not true that 38,000 people die in the construction of the Panama Canal. Everyone that wants to sail sails through the Panama Canal. And we are open to the world. That is the neutrality treaty. We have to remain open.” In March, an investment group led by U.S. firm BlackRock announced it was trying to purchase two ports at either end of the canal, as well as about 40 others from Hong Kong based-CK Hutchison. The outcome of that deal remains unclear. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: Why Private Equity Is Betting On Tokenization

ByAzeem Khan ByAzeem Khan, Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Web3 and Digital Assets ByAzeem Khan, Contributor. Close-up of hands of a man viewing balances of Bitcoin, Ether and other cryptocurrencies in a wallet ... More app from popular service Coinbase, Martinez, California, June 26, 2019. (Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images) Over the past decade, private equity became one of the most influential forces in global markets. With interest rates near zero and capital flowing freely, firms like Blackstone, KKR, and Apollo went on an unprecedented buying spree. They acquired everything from single-family homes to hospitals, software companies, and telecom infrastructure. Between 2012 and 2022, global private equity assets under management more than tripled, reaching over $13.4 trillion. That wave of acquisition concentrated enormous value into illiquid and closely held assets. It also created the kind of structural bottleneck that tokenization may now be uniquely positioned to help resolve. But in 2025, the environment looks very different. With Donald Trump back in office, inflation proving difficult to contain, and the Federal Reserve holding rates higher for longer, liquidity is harder to manufacture. IPO windows remain limited, secondary transactions continue to trade at steep discounts, and traditional exits are slow or nonexistent. The era when private equity firms could simply sell portfolio companies to one another, often at inflated valuations, has quietly ended. Tokenization is no longer just a concept being floated at panels. It is becoming one of the few tools large capital allocators are seriously exploring to create flexibility in portfolios that were never designed to stay illiquid this long. Low interest rates are unlikely to return anytime soon. Markets have largely accepted that the Federal Reserve will move cautiously, with traders pricing in fewer than three rate cuts through the end of 2025. Longer-term yields remain elevated, and the days of abundant, cheap capital are over. That capital fueled a decade of leveraged growth in private markets. What remains is a backlog of assets that need new liquidity rails to move. That backdrop makes the push toward tokenization more strategic than revolutionary. With traditional exits constricted and public markets still tentative, financial institutions are actively searching for alternatives. Tokenization has emerged as one. By wrapping illiquid assets such as private equity, real estate, or infrastructure stakes into blockchain-based instruments, firms can fractionalize ownership, enable 24/7 trading, and expand access to a broader pool of global investors. This is not just about efficiency. It is about building new distribution infrastructure for assets that no longer have clear paths to exit. Major financial institutions are already moving in this direction. BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, has filed with the SEC to tokenize shares of its $150 billion Treasury Trust Fund, creating a new class of digital shares recorded on a blockchain ledger. Franklin Templeton has launched the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund, a fully tokenized fund that allows investors to gain exposure through digital tokens. Hamilton Lane has partnered with platforms like Securitize and Republic to offer tokenized versions of its private equity funds in an effort to broaden access to retail investors. For retail investors, this shift presents both opportunity and risk. On one hand, tokenization could finally provide access to asset classes that were once reserved for pension funds and billion-dollar LPs, such as private equity, real estate, and credit. Fractional ownership and 24/7 trading might lower the barriers to entry. On the other hand, the assets being tokenized are often the hardest to value and the least liquid for a reason. Institutions are not turning to blockchain out of altruism. They are using it to create new distribution channels to retail capital for assets they cannot easily offload elsewhere. Without proper regulation, disclosures, and investor protections, tokenization may become a way to transfer illiquidity risk under the appearance of innovation. That does not mean tokenization is inherently flawed. It may still unlock access and improve capital formation in meaningful ways. But it is critical to understand what is motivating the shift. If we focus only on the technology and ignore the incentives behind it, we risk mistaking distribution for disruption and missing the real forces reshaping capital markets. Tokenization is often framed as the next frontier of financial innovation. And it is. But it is also something more urgent and less romantic: a pressure valve. As trillions in private capital search for liquidity in a world where traditional exits no longer work, blockchain infrastructure is quietly becoming the system of last resort. Whether driven by strategy or necessity, this shift is already underway. The financial architecture of the next decade will not be defined solely by regulation or ideology. It will be shaped by who needs liquidity and how quickly they can create new ways to unlock it.

Title: Best Crypto to Buy as Solana Shows Technical Strength amid ETF Buzz

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Solana is ready to pump thanks to strong technical indicators and ecosystem support. The ‘cup’ started forming around November 2022, with the handle emerging during the tariff-induced panic sell-off. Even more encouraging is that this pattern hasn’t popped overnight – it’s taken 2.5 years to form, which makes it a stronger bullish indication. $SOL has risen around 38% since the second week of April, showing good upward momentum. Read on for more reasons investors are bullish on $SOL. We’ll also point you towards the best crypto to buy to benefit from the upcoming bull run. There has also been an increasing push towards stock tokenization on the Solana blockchain. The Solana Policy Institute has submitted a proposal called ‘Project Open’ to the SEC, which will issue tradable tokens for stocks. This would make transactions faster, and billions of dollars stuck in settlement delays can be pumped back into the markets almost instantly, generating more wealth over time. Every stock, every bond, every fund—every asset—can be tokenized. If they are, it will revolutionize investing. – Larry Fink More good news: a Solana exchange-traded fund also looks like a certainty in the near future. Bloomberg has predicted a 90% chance for $SOL ETF approval in 2025 itself. Furthermore, the Solana stablecoin supply is also at an all-time high. It reached $11.7B in February 2025 and further shot up to $13B by May. Note that it was just $5B last year. A hike like this should open up new possibilities in the Web3 and DeFi space. All in all, if you want to ride Solana’s growth, this is the best time to invest. The cryptos mentioned in this guide, especially Solaxy, offer the highest potential for returns. Even though Solana has many positives potentially propelling it to new highs, it’d be difficult for the network to realize its full potential until it can overcome its congestion and scalability issues. Enter Solaxy ($SOLX). Solaxy is a new cryptocurrency and one of the very few offering real-world application. After all, it plans to build the very first Layer 2 scaling protocol on Solana. This Solana L2 will offload some transactions onto a sidechain, which is how it’ll reduce the burden on Solana’s mainnet and speed up the entire blockchain. Additionally, $SOLX will also reduce the transaction fees on Solana by processing a lot of transactions simultaneously, instead of one by one. Currently, however, one $SOLX will only cost you $0.001714. That’s because the token is in presale, where it has raised a staggering $33M. If this is your first crypto presale purchase, check out our guide on how to buy Solaxy. With over $1.5B in market capitalization, Bonk ($BONK) is easily the biggest dog-themed meme coin on Solana. It was also the first-ever dog coin on the network. In case you have any reservations about the potential of dog cryptos, just look at the most successful meme coins of all time. Three out of the top five, i.e., $DOGE, $SHIB, and $BONK, are inspired by ‘man’s best friend.’ What’s more, one of the biggest success stories of recent times, $BROCCOLI, is also a dog-themed coin. Coming to $BONK, its chart suggests that it’s now taking support at the $0.000016 level, which happens to be a previous resistance zone. The crypto is already up over 50% in the last month and can rally further once $SOL takes off. Thanks to a low price of $0.0000161p, $BONK is in contention for the best cheap cryptos to buy now. Created on a suggestion by the Truth Terminal AI chatbot, Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) is one of the most amusing community-driven cryptos on the market. It rewards token holders if they submit hilarious fart jokes. Moreover, there’s an uncanny ‘Gas Fee’ mechanism that emits a fart sound every time a transaction goes through. Quite naturally, crypto degens were quick to send $FARTCOIN soaring; it’s, in fact, one of the best meme coins on the market. The token has jumped over 145% in just the last month or so, and it’s expected to continue its climb with much velocity once it breaks through the $1.20 resistance level. You can buy it now for just $1.09. $SOL’s upcoming upward momentum can indeed drag the best altcoins on its network along with it. However, even though the signs are all there, there’s really no guaranteeing anything in crypto. The market is volatile and full of ups and downs, which is why it’s recommended you DYOR and only invest an amount that’s small enough for you.

May 04, 2025 08:47 ET | Source: Nitric Boost Nitric Boost NEW YORK, May 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- If you’re searching for the best nitric oxide supplements for men, you're not alone. In 2025, nitric oxide (NO) boosters are among the most in-demand health products for men looking to enhance blood flow, energy, athletic performance, and even support for erectile dysfunction (ED). But what exactly is nitric oxide, and why does it matter so much? Nitric oxide is a naturally occurring molecule in your body that plays a crucial role in vascular health. It helps relax and dilate blood vessels, allowing for improved circulation—a function that impacts everything from your stamina at the gym to your performance in the bedroom. Unfortunately, as men age, natural NO production declines, often leading to fatigue, reduced endurance, poor muscle recovery, and even symptoms of ED. That’s where nitric oxide supplements come in. Designed to stimulate NO production through ingredients like L-arginine, L-citrulline, and beetroot extract, these supplements help improve oxygen delivery, nutrient flow, and vascular function. Whether you're an athlete chasing better pumps or someone looking to restore youthful energy and performance, the right nitric oxide booster can make a major difference. And among the dozens of options on the market, one supplement continues to lead the pack in 2025… Enter: Nitric Boost Ultra — a cutting-edge NO supplement formulated for maximum blood flow, energy, and erectile support. This guide explores the science behind nitric oxide, the benefits it delivers for men’s health, and why Nitric Boost Ultra stands out as the best nitric oxide supplement for energy, endurance, and ED support this year. Meet Nitric Boost Ultra – The Best Nitric Oxide Supplement for Men When it comes to choosing the best nitric oxide supplement for men, Nitric Boost Ultra consistently ranks as the top choice in 2025. This advanced formula is specifically engineered to support optimal blood flow, muscle pumps, stamina, and erectile health — making it a powerful ally for any man looking to reclaim energy, confidence, and vitality. Why Nitric Boost Ultra Stands Out Unlike generic NO boosters, Nitric Boost Ultra goes beyond basic L-arginine formulas. It’s designed with a synergistic blend of science-backed ingredients that work together to enhance nitric oxide production, increase oxygen delivery, and improve vascular performance without the crash or jitteriness often associated with stimulant-heavy products.

Ingredients in Nitric Boost Ultra – Why They Matter What sets Nitric Boost Ultra apart from the rest of the best nitric oxide supplements for men is its clean, clinically-informed formula that zeroes in on blood flow, stamina, and vascular performance. Each ingredient has a specific role in increasing nitric oxide levels, improving erectile function, and enhancing overall male vitality. L-Arginine Alpha-Ketoglutarate (AAKG) Primary Function: Boosts nitric oxide synthesisAAKG is a potent form of L-arginine combined with alpha-ketoglutarate, allowing for better absorption and sustained nitric oxide production. It helps dilate blood vessels, improve circulation, and promote stronger erections and muscle pumps. L-Citrulline Malate Primary Function: Extends nitric oxide boost durationL-Citrulline converts to L-arginine in the body and provides a longer-lasting nitric oxide effect. It’s known to improve exercise endurance, reduce fatigue, and enhance erectile performance by promoting better blood flow to sensitive areas. Beet Root Extract Primary Function: Natural source of dietary nitratesBeets are rich in nitrates, which the body converts into nitric oxide. Beetroot extract supports cardiovascular health, reduces blood pressure, and enhances stamina, making it a key ingredient for both gym-goers and those seeking better sexual performance. Tribulus Terrestris Primary Function: Supports testosterone and libidoThis herbal extract may help boost natural testosterone levels, which can enhance libido, energy, and muscle strength. When paired with improved blood flow, it amplifies both sexual and athletic performance. Pine Bark Extract (Pycnogenol) Primary Function: Enhances nitric oxide retentionKnown for its antioxidant properties, pine bark extract helps sustain nitric oxide levels in the blood longer, leading to better vascular tone, improved erectile quality, and faster post-exercise recovery. Niacin (Vitamin B3) Primary Function: Improves blood vessel flexibilityNiacin supports vascular health by reducing inflammation and improving blood lipid profiles. It works synergistically with the other ingredients to optimize circulation and reduce fatigue. Why This Blend Works: This unique combination addresses every aspect of nitric oxide production and utilization — from boosting initial levels to sustaining them longer and improving blood vessel responsiveness. Whether you’re battling low energy, erectile dysfunction, or sluggish recovery, Nitric Boost Ultra helps restore male performance at its core.

Try it today! How Nitric Oxide Works – The Science Behind NO Boosters Nitric oxide (NO) is a naturally occurring molecule in the human body, essential for many physiological processes — especially those tied to circulation, energy, and male performance. Understanding how nitric oxide works helps explain why supplements like Nitric Boost Ultra have become the go-to solution for men looking to improve stamina, blood flow, and even erectile dysfunction (ED). What Is Nitric Oxide (NO)? Nitric oxide is a vasodilator — a compound that signals blood vessels to relax and widen. This increased vessel diameter allows more blood, oxygen, and nutrients to flow to vital areas of the body. NO is synthesized from amino acids like L-Arginine and L-Citrulline and is crucial for: How Nitric Oxide Boosters Work Nitric oxide supplements — like Nitric Boost Ultra — work by supplying the body with precursors that stimulate NO production naturally. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how it works: 1. L-Arginine & L-Citrulline These amino acids are converted into nitric oxide via the endothelial cells lining your blood vessels. This process leads to: 2. Beet Root & Other Plant-Based Boosters Beetroot is rich in nitrates, which convert into nitric oxide through a different pathway — the nitrate-nitrite-NO cycle. This dual approach provides: 3. Synergistic Support from Key Vitamins & Botanicals Ingredients like Niacin (Vitamin B3) help relax blood vessels and improve lipid profiles, while herbs like Tribulus Terrestris and Pine Bark Extract boost natural testosterone and enhance libido — making NO boosters even more effective for male sexual health. Fast-Acting, Long-Lasting Results Once taken, NO boosters quickly absorb into the bloodstream and start enhancing circulation within hours. Over time, consistent use: Nitric Boost Ultra works on all these mechanisms, making it one of the top-rated nitric oxide supplements for men who want to optimize blood flow, muscle function, and sexual performance without pharmaceuticals or side effects. Clinical Studies Supporting Nitric Oxide Supplementation 1. L-Citrulline and Erectile Function A study published in Urology investigated the effects of oral L-citrulline supplementation on men with mild erectile dysfunction (ED). In this single-blind study, participants received a placebo for one month followed by L-citrulline (1.5 g/day) for another month. The results showed that 50% of the men experienced an improvement in erection hardness from a score of 3 (mild ED) to 4 (normal erectile function) during the L-citrulline phase, compared to only 8.3% during the placebo phase. Additionally, the mean number of intercourses per month increased significantly with L-citrulline supplementation. Another study explored the combination of L-citrulline and transresveratrol in men with ED who were already using phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5i). This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover pilot study found that the combination therapy significantly improved erectile function compared to placebo, suggesting a potential synergistic effect. 2. Beetroot Juice and Blood Pressure A systematic review and meta-analysis examined the impact of nitrate-rich beetroot juice on blood pressure in individuals with arterial hypertension. The analysis included seven studies with a total of 218 participants. The findings indicated that beetroot juice supplementation led to a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) by approximately 4.95 mmHg. However, the effect on diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was not statistically significant. Another study focused on the acute and short-term effects of nitrate-rich beetroot juice ingestion in postmenopausal women with arterial hypertension. The results demonstrated that both acute and one-week supplementation enhanced cardiovascular responses following aerobic exercise, highlighting the potential benefits of beetroot juice in this population. Nitric Boost Ultra vs Other Top Nitric Oxide Supplements When it comes to nitric oxide supplements, not all formulas are created equal. While many products claim to boost nitric oxide levels, only a few deliver clinically effective doses, proven ingredients, and measurable results. Here's how Nitric Boost Ultra compares head-to-head with other top-rated nitric oxide boosters in the market. Ingredients & Clinical Doses Nitric Boost Ultra stands out for including clinically validated doses of L-Arginine and L-Citrulline, the two most important amino acids involved in nitric oxide synthesis. Unlike other products that use proprietary blends or underdose key ingredients, Nitric Boost Ultra clearly lists: Most competitors—like SuperBeets or Neo40—rely heavily on beetroot alone, without the dual-action benefits of arginine + citrulline. Pre-workout formulas like N.O. XT may include these aminos but often at lower or less bioavailable doses. Delivery Method Nitric Boost Ultra is delivered in easy-to-swallow capsules, optimized for gradual absorption and longer-lasting effects. This method avoids the rapid spike and crash often experienced with lozenges, powders, or sugary beet-based drinks. Nitric Boost Ultra's capsule format ensures no mess, no mixing, and no blood sugar spikes—just smooth, consistent nitric oxide support throughout the day. Third-Party Testing & Purity Purity and transparency are key when choosing a top nitric oxide booster. Nitric Boost Ultra is: Many other brands skip third-party testing or hide their ingredient doses behind proprietary blends. With Nitric Boost Ultra, what you see is what you get—no fillers, no gimmicks. Price vs. Value While some nitric oxide supplements may seem cheaper upfront, they often cut corners on ingredient quality or dosing. Nitric Boost Ultra offers premium ingredients, clinical dosing, and a comprehensive formula that supports: And all of this is backed by a 60-day money-back guarantee—making it a risk-free investment in your health. Bottom Line: Why Nitric Boost Ultra Leads the Pack If you’re seeking the best nitric oxide supplement for men’s health, especially for ED support, energy, and peak performance, Nitric Boost Ultra delivers where others fall short. With clinical dosing, clean formulation, and proven ingredients, it’s engineered for real results—not just hype.

Feel stronger, think clearer, and live better — take charge of your health with Nitric Boost Ultra today. Nitric Oxide Benefits for Males – Why It Matters Most After 40 As men age, their bodies experience a gradual decline in nitric oxide (NO) production — a key molecule that affects everything from blood circulation to sexual health, muscle performance, and even heart function. By the time you reach 40 and beyond, this drop in NO can begin to show up in ways that directly impact your quality of life. That’s where nitric oxide supplements like Nitric Boost Ultra come in. These boosters are specifically designed to replenish NO levels and restore youthful performance across multiple health areas. 1. Improved Erectile Function and Sexual Vitality One of the most talked-about nitric oxide benefits for males is its direct link to stronger, longer-lasting erections. NO relaxes blood vessels and improves blood flow — a critical factor in achieving and maintaining erections. Men over 40 often experience ED or performance issues not due to lack of desire, but because blood flow is compromised. A high-quality nitric oxide booster for ED, such as Nitric Boost Ultra: This makes nitric oxide one of the best natural alternatives to ED medications — without harsh side effects. 2. Cardiovascular Health and Blood Pressure Support After 40, men are more susceptible to hypertension, heart disease, and circulatory issues. Since nitric oxide plays a key role in vasodilation (the widening of blood vessels), boosting NO levels can: Regular use of nitric oxide supplements has been associated with better heart performance and lower vascular resistance, helping you age with strength and resilience. 3. Enhanced Physical Performance and Muscle Recovery Whether you’re staying fit or just trying to keep up with your kids, muscle fatigue becomes more noticeable after 40. Nitric oxide helps: By improving circulation and oxygen delivery, NO boosters like Nitric Boost Ultra are perfect for maintaining strength and physical ability well into your 40s, 50s, and beyond. 4. Cognitive Function and Mental Sharpness The gut-brain axis and circulatory function also play a huge role in how you think and feel. As NO supports blood flow to the brain, it can improve: This is particularly helpful for aging men juggling careers, families, and health — NO supplements are a hidden gem in natural cognitive support. 5. Energy and Anti-Aging Effects Fatigue and slowed metabolism are common complaints after 40. By supporting mitochondrial efficiency and cellular energy production, nitric oxide helps: The anti-aging effects of nitric oxide go beyond the surface — they’re about staying functional, vibrant, and energized every single day. Why Nitric Boost Ultra Is Ideal for Men 40+ What makes Nitric Boost Ultra a standout choice for men over 40 is its clean, high-impact formulation: Nitric Oxide Side Effects – What You Should Know Before Taking a NO Booster As nitric oxide supplements like Nitric Boost Ultra continue gaining popularity for blood flow support, workout enhancement, and ED relief, it’s essential to understand the potential side effects and how to use them safely. While most people tolerate nitric oxide boosters well, being informed ensures you can maximize the benefits without unwanted surprises. Are There Any Common Side Effects? Generally, natural nitric oxide supplements are considered safe for healthy adults when taken as directed. However, some individuals may experience mild side effects, particularly when first starting or when taking high doses. Possible side effects may include: These effects are usually temporary and tend to subside as the body adjusts. What Causes These Side Effects? Most side effects stem from the vasodilation process, where blood vessels widen due to increased nitric oxide. This can lead to changes in blood pressure or temporary shifts in circulation. Stimulant-free formulas like Nitric Boost Ultra, which uses natural vasodilators (L-arginine, beetroot, pine bark), are generally easier on the body compared to synthetic or caffeine-loaded options. How to Minimize Risk To enjoy the benefits of nitric oxide safely, follow these guidelines: If you have a pre-existing heart condition or are on blood pressure medications, consult a physician before starting any nitric oxide booster. Who Should Be Cautious? Although NO supplements for men offer amazing benefits, they may not be suitable for: Nitric Boost Ultra is non-GMO, gluten-free, soy-free, and made with clinically backed ingredients, which significantly reduces the risk of allergic reactions or sensitivities.

Title: GoDaddy CEO: Focus On Innovation and Customers and The Rest Takes Care of Itself

In a climate of growing scrutiny over digital businesses, GoDaddy Inc. delivered what CEO Aman Bhutani described as “a very strong quarter,” posting results that beat Wall Street forecasts on both the top and bottom line for its first quarter of 2024. Yet, despite the solid quarterly performance and reaffirmed full-year outlook, concerns persist among investors and analysts about the sustainability of GoDaddy’s growth, especially against a backcloth of economic headwinds and wavering consumer sentiment. “We beat across all financial metrics in Q1. So a very strong quarter for us. And we reaffirmed our full-year guidance,” Bhutani told CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” in an exclusive interview. “Our customers are resilient. Our business is durable. I’ve never been more excited about being at GoDaddy.” GoDaddy’s financial highlights for the quarter included better-than-expected revenue and earnings per share, supported by ongoing demand for the company’s suite of digital tools enabling small businesses and entrepreneurs to establish an online presence. But the company’s shares have come under pressure, sliding in the wake of the report as market participants voiced concerns about underlying trends in customer growth and dependency on price hikes for revenue expansion. Analyst Queries Over Customer Dynamics A number of analysts questioned the optics around declining customer counts and whether increases in average order size or “attach rate”—the number of products per customer—can sustainably drive revenue growth in a competitive and sensitive marketplace. “One analyst has pointed out that the optics are that customer count is coming down. There’s a narrative out there that price drove most of the growth in 2024. And there are questions about whether it’s sustainable this year,” said CNBC host John Fortt. Bhutani responded by shifting the focus from absolute customer numbers to the quality and depth of GoDaddy’s customer relationships. “The idea is to bring high intent customers to GoDaddy, not folks who are looking to buy a cheap domain and then not renew or buy any of our other products,” he said. “We’ve really expanded the product suite over the last few years. We want customers that want to use the breadth of products, and that’s what we’re seeing. We’re seeing increased average order size, improved retention rates, and customers using more of our products.” GoDaddy has been investing in product innovation, including the recent launch of Aero, an AI-powered solution designed to help clients quickly access the full spectrum of GoDaddy’s offerings, from domain registration and website design to e-commerce, digital marketing, and payments. Small Businesses: A Barometer for Economic Mood As a linchpin for millions of small business owners and entrepreneurs, GoDaddy’s performance provides a unique window into the mindset of Main Street businesses—often the first to feel the chill of a softening economy but also the first to rebound when optimism returns. The company conducts regular surveys with its customer base, which Bhutani said gives the company “real-time” insight. “There’s a little bit more tentativeness from our customers on the broader economy. But the core story has not changed, and that story is about our customer being resilient,” Bhutani said. “When we ask them about the economy, yes, they’re a little more concerned, but when we ask them about their business, the majority of them continue to be very bullish about their business.” Industry observers note that GoDaddy operates at a critical juncture for small businesses, many of which rely on the company’s low-cost and essential digital infrastructure. “Our customers need us most for marketing,” Bhutani explained. “A domain name, a website, a little email solution, or just a link to take payments…these are the solutions that are going to be the last things customers give up.” That stickiness, he argued, works in GoDaddy’s favor even in downturns. “Even when a business goes down, a customer doesn’t get rid of their domain name. They’re not giving up the dream,” Bhutani said. “They’re going to keep going and try it again or try something different.” Competitive Positioning Amid Digital Heavyweights Even as GoDaddy faces its usual competition from hosting and web development rivals, broader industry trends are shaping its trajectory. The digital tools segment has been lifted by surging demand for online marketing and commerce solutions; tech giants like Amazon, Meta, and Google reported robust advertising growth in their latest quarters, reflecting businesses’ increased willingness to optimize digital spending, even amid economic uncertainty. Amazon’s advertising revenue, for instance, rose 90% year-over-year. Asked how GoDaddy fits into this bigger digital transformation, Bhutani outlined an effort to expand beyond core domain registration into “marketing solutions and commerce solutions.” The company’s newest products are designed to capture a greater share of its customers’ digital spending, with lower overall prices and added value for switching or consolidating services. “We’ve got more and more offerings like marketing solutions and commerce solutions as well,” Bhutani said, hinting at a strategy to position GoDaddy not simply as a domain registrar, but as a one-stop digital partner for small businesses. Stock Under Pressure, But Focus Remains on Execution Despite the strategic narrative and the company’s recent investments, GoDaddy stock remains under pressure. Analysts appear unconvinced that product attach and average revenue per user will be enough to drive sustained growth in the event of waning new customer acquisitions—especially in a challenging macroeconomic environment. Bhutani, for his part, remains focused on execution. “My view is let’s focus on the things that we do. Let’s focus on the innovation. Let’s focus on serving our customers. And the rest takes care of itself,” he concluded. He maintains confidence that share price will eventually reflect what the company sees as underlying business strength and resiliency among its core customer base. For now, GoDaddy will be measured less by the hype that once defined the digital domain industry and more by its ability to deepen and lengthen relationships with existing clients—many of whom, in Bhutani’s words, are “not giving up the dream” even in challenging times.

After blockbuster earnings last week from Big Tech, capped by Apple (AAPL-0.39%), Amazon (AMZN-2.87%), and a weekend of Buffett wisdom at Berkshire Hathaway’s (BRK.A-0.82%) annual meeting, markets are still digesting what it all means. The Dow, S&P, and Nasdaq are rallying, but Main Street signals remain mixed, and inflation, tariffs, and consumer caution continue to ripple through corporate results. The week ahead won’t quite match the mega-cap frenzy, but there’s still plenty to watch — especially in sectors like energy, pharma, and industrials. It may be a big week for Fed news, too, with the Fed making an announcement Wednesday — though no interest rate change is expected at this time. The week kicks off with a closely watched read on the U.S. service sector: the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index for April is due Monday morning. This report tracks activity in industries like retail, health care, and hospitality — which together make up the bulk of the U.S. economy — and can offer key clues about broader momentum, or the lack of it. Earnings slow down from last week’s Big Tech bonanza, but Monday still brings key updates from across sectors. Palantir (PLTR+1.01%) reports after the bell, with analysts expecting EPS double last year’s result, amid continued interest in its AI-driven government and commercial contracts. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX+0.59%) is also due, with EPS forecast slightly down from last year’s. Ford (F-2.22%), expected to post flat earnings, faces scrutiny over its EV roadmap and how it’s handling margin pressure and tariff uncertainty. Tyson Foods (TSN+0.64%) and Clorox (CLX-0.03%) round out the day — both offering windows into consumer behavior as household staples and prices continue to fluctuate. Markets will digest the latest U.S. International Trade Balance report Tuesday morning, offering fresh insight into America’s trade deficit for March. The data comes as tariff rhetoric continues to grab headlines, making this a key release for economists and policy watchers alike. But the biggest event of the week is likely to be the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision. The FOMC meeting begins Tuesday and runs through Wednesday. After last week’s unexpectedly weak GDP print and increased signs of consumer hesitation, markets will be watching closely for any shift in tone. An announcement is expected Wednesday, the second day of the meeting. On the earnings front, Tuesday is a power-packed day across sectors. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD+0.47%) also reports, and all eyes will be on its AI chip roadmap as the company looks to keep pace with Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%). Arista Networks (ANET+0.69%) will offer another read on AI infrastructure demand. Insurance and energy dominate elsewhere: Progressive (PGR+0.80%), Duke Energy (DUK-0.58%), Suncor (SU-1.90%), and Marathon Petroleum (MPC-1.53%) all report, giving investors fresh reads on consumer risk, oil supply dynamics, and refining margeins. Ferrari (RACE-1.06%) and Marriot (MAR-1.04%) round out the day with updates that touch on global demand, tariff impacts, and travel spending. Shopify (SHOP-4.98%) kicks off tech results in the morning, with expectations for steady e-commerce growth. In the afternoon, expect Fed news as the FOMC meeting concludes. While no rate change is expected, the policy statement and press conference could offer clues about future cuts or delays. Coinbase (COIN-3.06%) and Cheniere Energy (LNG-3.98%) headline the afternoon, offering insight into crypto trading volume and U.S. LNG exports, respectively. Anheuser-Busch (BUD+0.91%) will provide insights on global beer demand and pricing strategy, while ConocoPhillips (COP-3.65%) provides an update on oil and gas margins amid geopolitical upheavals. Disney (DIS-1.33%) also reports, with analysts looking to streaming profitability and theme park traffic. Uber (UBER+0.83%) is on deck too, aiming to show continued progress on profitability and margin gains. Applovin (APP-6.88%), DoorDash (DASH-0.70%), and Arm Holdings (ARM+1.07%) all report as well, giving another pulse check on digital advertising, food delivery, and semiconductor demand. Novo Nordisk (NVO+1.61%) will provide updates on weight-loss drug momentum. Thursday brings a fresh wave of earnings from across the globe. Enbridge (ENB-0.27%), Canada’s pipeline giant, headlines the morning, with investors watching closely for updates on energy infrastructure demand and regulatory dynamics. Commerzbank’s release will provide a read on the European banking environment amid ongoing rate and currency volatility. On the economic calendar, markets will digest the latest initial jobless claims data, which could reinforce — or challenge — narratives around a softening labor market following the prior week’s weaker-than-expected GDP print. Again Friday, a range of global earnings reports will provide cross-sector, cross-border takeaways. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Michael Saylor’s $84 Billion Bitcoin Bet: How Is Strategy Doing On Its Current BTC Holdings?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin-first investment strategy has once again taken the spotlight after Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) laid out an ambitious new plan to scale its BTC holdings. The company now owns over half a million bitcoins, making it one of the biggest institutional players in the crypto market. However, the company isn’t done yet, as recent filings shows an ambitious $84 billion plan to acquire more Bitcoins. As the Bitcoin price hovers around $97,000 in early May, the scale of Strategy’s Bitcoin plan is important, not only for its size but also for the significant role it now plays in the company’s trajectory. During its latest earnings call, Strategy introduced what it calls the 42/42 Plan, which is a roadmap aimed at raising $84 billion in capital over the next two years. The funding will be split equally between equity and fixed-income instruments, all designated to be used for further Bitcoin acquisitions. This initiative follows a $21 billion at-the-market equity offering that recently brought in over 301,000 BTC in recent months, sending the company’s share price soaring by 50%. As of April 28, 2025, Strategy holds 553,555 BTC, acquired at a total cost of $37.9 billion and an average price of $68,459 per coin. Of this total, 107,155 BTC have been bought in 2025 alone, making it the company’s most aggressive buying year to date despite only four months having passed. The firm’s internal disclosures also note an average cost of $66,384.56 per bitcoin. The latest acquisition round included 15,355 BTC purchased at an average price of $92,737 on April 28 at $1.42 billion. These aggressive purchases have positioned Strategy as the world’s second-largest institutional holder of Bitcoin, just behind BlackRock. Interestingly, Strategy’s playbook for building a BTC-heavy balance sheet is not slowing down. Even as the company reported its fifth consecutive quarterly net loss, investor sentiment is still optimistic. The company reported an unrealized $5.9 billion loss in the first quarter of 2025. However, its stock is up by approximately 32% since the beginning of the year and has outperformed the Nasdaq 100 index, which is down nearly 6% over the same period. Strategy’s market value is now deeply influenced by Bitcoin’s price direction. The company’s BTC portfolio has yielded a 13.7% return so far in 2025, generating a paper gain of $5.8 billion. Despite the crypto market volatility, the company updated its BTC yield target from 15% to 25% and a $15 billion profit goal by the end of the year. At the time of writing, Strategy’s Bitcoin strategy continues to pay well, and the company’s stock has been rising in tandem with Bitcoin’s recent rally. MSTR is currently up by 3.35% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $394.37. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is trading at $96,500.

Title: Mass protests erupt across China as Trump tariffs trigger economic crisis

China is experiencing severe civil unrest, with tens of thousands of workers protesting in industrial hubs like Shanghai and Inner Mongolia over unpaid wages and mass layoffs, driven by economic turmoil and U.S. tariffs. Trump's escalating tariffs have crippled China's export-dependent economy, causing factory closures, plummeting orders and financial distress for millions of workers, exacerbating existing crises like the property market collapse. The CCP is responding with heavy-handed suppression, deploying riot police and censoring dissent, but protests persist, reflecting growing desperation among workers. U.S. tariffs have accelerated the shift of production out of China to Taiwan, Vietnam and Mexico, further undermining confidence in Beijing's economic management. Beijing has signaled willingness to resume trade negotiations with the U.S. but demands the removal of all tariffs as a precondition.

Beijing has signaled willingness to resume trade negotiations with the U.S. but demands the removal of all tariffs as a precondition. China is facing its worst civil unrest in decades as waves of protests sweep industrial and manufacturing hubs, fueled by economic turmoil exacerbated by U.S. tariffs and a deepening property market collapse. Over the past two weeks, tens of thousands of workers have taken to the streets in cities from Shanghai to Inner Mongolia, demanding unpaid wages and protesting mass layoffs as export-dependent factories buckle under the weight of President Donald Trump's escalating trade war. The latest round of U.S. tariffs has dealt a devastating blow to China's already faltering economy. Export orders have plummeted to levels not seen since the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, forcing factory closures and leaving millions of workers unpaid. (Related: TRADE WAR FALLOUT: Chinese factories slow production as U.S. tariffs bite.) In Tongliao, desperate construction laborers climbed atop unfinished buildings, threatening to jump unless their months of unpaid wages were settled. Near Shanghai, thousands of employees from an LED manufacturing plant blocked highways, demanding back pay dating to January. Similar protests erupted in Dao County after a sporting goods factory abruptly shut down, leaving workers without compensation. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has responded with a heavy-handed crackdown, deploying riot police and censoring online dissent, but the demonstrations show no signs of abating. China weighs U.S. trade negotiations amid calls for "sincerity" Trump, who has made economic confrontation with China a cornerstone of his political platform, has said the impact is intentional. âThey were making from us a trillion dollars a year. They were ripping us off like nobody's ever ripped us off,â he stated in a recent rally. âTheyâre not doing that anymore.â The tariffs, first imposed in 2018 and expanded under his potential second-term agenda, have accelerated a manufacturing exodus from China, with companies relocating to Taiwan, Vietnam and Mexico. The shift has eroded confidence in Beijing's economic stewardship, compounding existing crises, including supply chain breakdowns from Shanghai's draconian COVID lockdowns and a real estate collapse that has left millions of homeowners in financial ruin. As a response to the crisis, China's Ministry of Commerce announced on Friday, May 3, that it is considering renewed tariff negotiations with the United States. "China has noted the repeated statements from senior U.S. officials expressing a willingness to negotiate with China on tariff issues," a ministry spokesperson said. "At the same time, the U.S. side has recently taken the initiative to relay messages to China through relevant channels, expressing a desire to engage in talks. China is currently evaluating this matter." However, Beijing made clear that any negotiations must be accompanied by concrete actions, including the removal of all unilateral tariffs imposed on Chinese goods. "If the U.S. refuses to correct its erroneous unilateral tariff policies, it would only prove its complete lack of sincerity and further undermine mutual trust," the spokesperson said. "Saying one thing while doing another or even using talks as a cover for coercion and extortion â China will not accept this. China's position has been consistent and clear. We will fight to the end if forced to, but our door remains open for talks." Follow Collapse.news for more news related to this.

Canada-U.S. trade war escalates: Maxime Bernier warns against tariffs, calls for free trade revival. Sources include: YourNews.com TimesNowNews.com SCMP.com Brighteon.com The latest round of U.S. tariffs has dealt a devastating blow to China's already faltering economy. Export orders have plummeted to levels not seen since the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, forcing factory closures and leaving millions of workers unpaid. (Related: TRADE WAR FALLOUT: Chinese factories slow production as U.S. tariffs bite.) In Tongliao, desperate construction laborers climbed atop unfinished buildings, threatening to jump unless their months of unpaid wages were settled. Near Shanghai, thousands of employees from an LED manufacturing plant blocked highways, demanding back pay dating to January.

As a response to the crisis, China's Ministry of Commerce announced on Friday, May 3, that it is considering renewed tariff negotiations with the United States. "China has noted the repeated statements from senior U.S. officials expressing a willingness to negotiate with China on tariff issues," a ministry spokesperson said. "At the same time, the U.S. side has recently taken the initiative to relay messages to China through relevant channels, expressing a desire to engage in talks. China is currently evaluating this matter." However, Beijing made clear that any negotiations must be accompanied by concrete actions, including the removal of all unilateral tariffs imposed on Chinese goods.

Title: Costco, Levi's, and Other Companies Stubbornly Cling to DEI Policies
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2025/05/03/costco-levis-other-companies-stubbornly-cling-dei-policies/

While the populist consensus is that MAGA is killing off diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in corporate America, that may not always be the case in some of the nation’s biggest companies. According to one report, shareholders of some leading companies, including Costco, Apple, Levi’s, John Deere, Goldman Sachs, and others, have voted against proposals targeting DEI programs. Those proposals included asking companies to ditch their DEI policies and examine the legal risks of pursuing them. Two conservative think tanks, the National Center for Public Policy Research and the National Legal and Policy Center, are reportedly behind most of the DEI-killing measures. In January, Breitbart News noted that Costco had dug in its heels after a shareholder proposal urged the “wholesale club operator to conduct an evaluation of any business risk posed by its” DEI practices, according to AP. “‘But Costco’s board of directors voted unanimously to ask shareholders to reject the motion,’ an AP report stated, noting their message to shareholders claimed that having a diverse workforce and suppliers resulted in greater customer satisfaction.” DEI in the workplace results in employee training, resource networks, and recruiting practices that advance representation of different races, genders, and classes, people with disabilities, veterans, and other groups. But opponents like Elon Musk, the Tesla and X CEO, and President Donald Trump himself, say DEI is unfair to qualified workers and represents “reverse racism.” Dozens of companies, including Target and Meta, have dialed back or eliminated their diversity programs in recent months under pressure from the Trump administration. Opponents sometimes cite that DEI violates the spirit of a 2023 U.S. Supreme Court decision that stated racial preferences in college admissions violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution. But as Breitbart reported at the time, that decision only applies to state governments and institutions. Shareholder votes are where DEI opponents are losing, reported CNN Business. The rejections of anti-DEI proposals “reveal that the investor community doesn’t think that having a tough stance on DEI makes financial sense,” Matteo Gatti, a professor of law at Rutgers University who studies corporate governance, told the network. “Investors are saying they don’t want ideological shareholders to drive business.” That “community,” however, appears to be dominated by Wall Street’s big players. “Large institutional investors” apparently call the shots at many multinational corporations. Mega investors “such as BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street are the top shareholders of most companies. “They typically oppose outside shareholder resolutions,” the network reported, “siding with company management in around 90% of the votes.” Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.

Title: Doctor Who ‘Lucky Day’ review: Pete, I owe you an apology
URL: https://slashdot.org/firehose.pl?op=view&amp;id=177288347
Time Published: 2025-05-03T19:12:16Z

Spoilers for “Lucky Day.” When the writers for this season of Doctor Who were announced, one name in the roster put me instantly on edge. Pete McTighe may have a distinguished filmography but, in this house, he’s known as the person who wrote “Kerblam.” That’s the Chibnall-era episode summed up as “Space Amazon is great and the people protesting poor working conditions and mass-layoffs are the real villains.” Imagine then, my delighted surprise when “Lucky Day” doesn’t just get its politics right, but it does so with molotov cocktails in hand. It’s 2007 and the Doctor and Belinda land in London as the clock strikes midnight on New Year’s Day. The Doctor, Vindicator in hand, gets another set of coordinates before realizing a small boy, Conrad Clack, saw the TARDIS land. He hands Conrad a 50 pence piece and tells him it’s his “lucky day,” before the boy sprints back to his mother. But she’s not interested in his story about a magical blue box, striking the boy and saying she’s had enough of his lies. Conrad next encounters the TARDIS 17 years later when he spots it parked down a dark alley. There's a nearby door with a broken lock and he ventures inside to a closed down department store, where he’s stalked by an unseen monster. After a few seconds, the monster brushes past Conrad, leaving green slime on his neck — which is how it marks its prey. When the creature, the Shreek, emerges into the open ready to strike, it’s zapped away by the Doctor and Ruby. From the shadows, Conrad watches the Doctor hand Ruby a vial of antidote as she, too, was marked as prey. He stalks them back to the TARDIS and overhears their conversation — half an hour prior, she was hanging out with the Beatles, putting this just after “The Devil’s Chord.” He snaps a picture of Ruby and puts it online, asking the internet if anyone has seen this woman. He tracks down Ruby at some point after she stops traveling in the TARDIS, and invites her onto his podcast. Conrad tries to flirt with his guest, and a quick montage shows them date and start to get serious about each other. He even confesses he was present during that first encounter with the Shreek, and Ruby hands him a vial of antidote. She says the Shreek, which had tagged him with green slime, was preparing to return to this dimension to hunt him again. But UNIT — the Doctor’s military allies here on Earth — captured it (off-screen). The pair go to a countryside village where Conrad introduces her to his friends in a quiet pub. But, as night draws in, the lights begin to flicker, and the blink-and-you-miss-it blurs of scary monsters appear outside. One of Conrad’s friends, Sparky, goes missing, and Ruby calls UNIT who leap into action despite no signs of a Shreek incursion. Conrad confesses to Ruby he didn’t take the antidote, wanting to prove to her he was as brave as the Doctor to win her heart. When UNIT arrives, soldiers face off with a pair of Shreek monsters until they reveal they’re just Conrad’s stooges in rubber suits. Conrad isn’t an innocent caught up in a crisis he can’t comprehend, he’s a conspiracy theorist streamer claiming UNIT is a sham organization. He’s the type to engineer stunts and deceptively edit the resulting footage to smear his targets. I won’t name the real world figures Conrad is inspired by as we’d get angry emails from their lawyers, but I’m sure you can work out who they are. Conrad’s encounter with UNIT was livestreamed, and there’s another montage of people talking to their generic social media followers decrying the organization. He’s arrested, but quickly released, and given a welcome press tour by the British media, including a favorable BBC News report and a joke on the UK version of The Masked Singer. Conrad even gets consoled during an interview on The One Show — a prime time talk / magazine show — by its real presenter Alex Jones (not that one). UNIT’s overseers in the UK government and Geneva buckle to public pressure to put UNIT under close scrutiny. As its head, Kate Lethbridge-Stewart says, imagine the fate of the world if any dictator got their hands on UNIT’s arsenal of captured alien technology. Someone senior at UNIT demands the caged (and real) Shreek captured off-screen be removed from London and brought up to the helipad ready for transit. Meanwhile, Conrad has a man on the inside, who has been radicalized into believing his own employers are a sham, who helps him break into UNIT HQ. Kate refuses to lock the building down, insisting that it’s time the issue was solved once and for all. Conrad, with a stolen UNIT rifle in hand, tries to bait Kate into attacking her on camera with some vicious slander about her father, the legendary Brigadier. Kate is happy the Doctor isn’t here, since he won’t stop her from doing what the audience has been demanding she do for the last few minutes. She opens the cage holding the Shreek and lets it go for Conrad. Like all two-bit bullies, Conrad crumbles in the face of real danger and starts begging for mercy but Kate refuses. Sadly, Shirley hands Ruby a taser, which she uses to knock out the Shreek before it can bite Conrad’s head off. Now that his life has been saved, Conrad goes back to playing up for the livestream, boasting that UNIT’s “special effects” have gotten better. At which point the Shreek wakes up and bites his arm off. There’s a sharp cut, and next we see Conrad waking up in a prison cell with a contraption around his arm, presumably keeping it joined to his elbow. Suddenly, he hears the TARDIS noise and is brought aboard for the Doctor to tell him that he’s a bitter, sad person who will die in prison. But Conrad is unrepentant and says he “rejects” the Doctor’s “reality.” After he’s returned to the cell, he’s visited by Mrs. Flood, who confirms what he saw was real, and that she’s letting him free as it’s his “lucky day.” It does appear as if I owe Pete McTighe a fulsome apology and must assume he isn’t at fault for all of the reactionary politics of “Kerblam.” “Lucky Day” is both a worthy sequel to “73 Yards” and a sign that, if Doctor Who is just weeks from an enforced hiatus, then it’s going out swinging. It’s got a lot of targets, including the BBC’s habitual reputation-laundering of unsavory characters. The notion of who is in “the wrong” is made explicitly clear here, too, and Conrad occupies the same political (and narrative) circles as Roger ap Gwillam (Albion TV gets a reference). Like a lot of this year’s run, the episode feels like an overstuffed script which was then cut down to fit a specific runtime. But the structural work underpinning things feel more solid here, so while a lot of the connective tissue is absent, it’s not to the detriment of the story. Kate’s decision to unleash the Shreek may have been well-telegraphed but it’s better than the solution appearing out of nowhere because there’s five minutes left to run. There’s an element of the show playing to its strengths, and the genre savviness of its audience here as well. If you know the beats of a girl-meets-boy romance movie, then you’ll spot this is a cracked-ish mirror version of that. And we don’t need much evidence of Conrad’s villainy — calling the Doctor, UNIT and Kate a bunch of frauds to make money from his online audience — since we know they are our heroes. Plus, anyone who slanders Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, after all, deserves to get what’s coming to them. “Lucky Day” is smart about how it introduces us to Conrad, too, giving us obvious red flags from the get-go. Adult Conrad has no reservations about taking a picture of a stranger and sharing it online for the internet to identify on his behalf. There’s a hint of judgment in how he asks about her relationship to and with the Doctor, mirroring the way Alan Budd flirted with Belinda in “The Robot Revolution.” In fact, it’s an interesting counterpoint to that episode, since we get enough time with Conrad early on to learn to at least be wary of him, rather than it being a fairly unsupported third-act twist. If there’s one downside, it’s that the episode leans on the trope that survivors of abuse perpetuate that cycle of abuse. Conrad gets hit in the head by his mother and while it’s hard to assume a pattern of behavior from one scene, it didn’t seem like it was the first time. Much as we saw in “Lux,” there are limits to the storytelling possibilities inherent in a series about an immortal science clown traveling anywhere in time and space in a blue box. This episode is also focused on Ruby’s post-TARDIS life, which has left her in a vulnerable position. As she admits at the end of the episode, her time with the Doctor was spent in a constant state of panic and peril. She’s tired, she’s alone and the first man she tried to form a relationship with turned out to be using her. That’s bound to leave a scar, but the after effects of a trip in the TARDIS is rarely discussed in the context of the series itself. The majority of the classic series' companions lacked detailed interior lives, while modern day ones often move on to other “exciting” things rather than back to a normal life. It does appear as if the structure of the series isn’t just Russell T. Davies relying on a familiar rhythm but something more deliberate. “Lucky Day” is the fourth in a row that shares themes and elements with the same numbered episode in last year’s lineup. It’ll be interesting to see how much of next week’s “The Story and the Engine,” and the following week’s “The Interstellar Song Contest” shares with their counterparts from the first series. It’s plausible that the time fracture that was featured in “The Robot Revolution” has, somehow, knocked the series off its previously-planned course. That either within the show’s fiction or in its metafiction, we’re explicitly seeing parallel versions of those previous episodes. If you recall from that episode, too, the Doctor says he was told to meet Belinda by an unknown person. What if he was chasing down Conrad’s lead, and if so, would that be enough to create a paradox (even if the TARDIS can avoid such obstacles)? Then there’s the fact Conrad says he explicitly rejects the Doctor’s “reality,” which feels like a telling way of wording things. Especially as this season’s two-part finale is titled “Wish World” and “The Reality War,” although that title is hardly a massive clue. After all, last season’s finale was “Empire of Death,” as opposed to “The one in which it turns out Stuekh has been clinging to the TARDIS roof for God knows however long.” I’m not sure I want to read too much into Mrs. Flood releasing Conrad since that, like last week, could simply be a topper to the story. It may be that she’s simply letting him out to wreak more havoc and undermine UNIT and the Doctor’s goals rather than anything specific. Not to mention that if Mrs. Flood is a dimension-surfing entity hell-bent on destroying the Doctor, she’s hardly going to have much use for a schmucky YouTuber. This week, the BBC announced that “The Reality War” would not be getting its customary early in the day stream online. Instead, it’ll hit the iPlayer and Disney+ at the same time as the UK broadcast, and both episodes are being lined up for a small cinema release. That’s reserved for big event episodes, and it adds more weight to the rumor Gatwa has already left the show. Not to mention he’s starring in the play Born With Teeth from August 13 through November 11 — which would prevent him from shooting a season for 2026. Outside the mystery box elements of the show, this season feels as if it’s having a meta conversation with itself. “Lucky Day,” for instance, takes a similar premise as “Love and Monsters,” a Doctor-lite episode focusing on one of the so-called ordinary people who are peripherally involved in the Doctor’s adventures. Conrad is initially presented as one of the lost souls who are drawn to the Doctor — you could almost describe them as fans — but who don’t shine brightly enough to get the Time Lord’s special attention. Oh, and I can’t think of any reason beyond silly fan service that Conrad’s streaming outfit is called “Think Tank” beyond a deep cut nod to 1974’s “Robot.” After all, there’s almost nothing in common between the two entities and their goals are ostensibly in conflict.

Title: Rhode Island-Based Brown University Joins Bitcoin Rush, Reporting $5 Million Investment In BlackRock’s BTC ETF

Rhode-based Ivy League Institution Brown University disclosed in a recent regulatory filing that it is holding exposure to Bitcoin via BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) shares. This marks the first time the academic institution has sought exposure to the world’s oldest and largest cryptocurrency. Add Brown University to the list of institutional investors taking a shine to Bitcoin. A new 13F-HR filing with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission shows the university owned 105,000 shares of IBIT, worth roughly $4.9 million, as of March 31. The IBIT shares were not listed in the previous quarter’s filing. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is credited with rekindling the spot BTC ETF movement, after the SEC time and again rejected such products since 2013. These novel investment products give traditional investors access to Bitcoin without the hassle of buying and storing it themselves. Pundits believe the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs marks one of the most successful financial product launches in history. Notably, IBIT is currently the biggest spot Bitcoin ETF, with a staggering $57 billion in assets under management. It’s worth mentioning that Brown is not the first university to have exposure to Bitcoin. The University of Austin (UATX) partnered with Bitcoin services company Unchained in May 2024 to launch a $5 million Bitcoin endowment. Then, in October of the same year, Atlanta-based Emory University disclosed ownership of more than $14 million worth of shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust. Showcasing the growing appetite for digital asset exposure, increasingly more institutional funds, publicly listed companies, and nation states are racing to gain access to the apex crypto. The Bitcoin price soared above $97,500 on Friday for the first time since February, rebounding from a local low around $75,000 in early April. The asset is currently trading hands at $96,170, according to data from CoinGecko.

Title: 5 Low-Volatility Dividend Stocks Yielding Up To 11.1%

ByBrett Owens ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Brett uses “second-level thinking” to find dividend stocks to buy. ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Businessmen Characters Investors Riding Roller Coaster on Red Chart, Fall on Uncertainty, Volatile ... More Up and Down Arrow Profit Graph, Trading Risk, Invest Economy Panic Cartoon People Vector Illustration Dividends over drama, please — like these five low-volatility dividend stocks that yield 7.2%, on average. Back in college they taught us that to increase returns, investors had to take on additional risk. This was a financial engineering class, by the way. The material arguably should have been presented differently, but it wasn't, because it was structured from a research perspective, not an investing one. It’s a common mistake in academia, and those who try to invest “buy the book.” The book says more beta means more returns. Well, this text can often be wrong. Big dividends and low volatility are a beautiful combination. Volatility can be measured in several ways. I find that “beta” is one of the best ones for regular investors because it’s easy to understand, and because it’s widely available from just about every market data provider. Beta measures an investment’s volatility against a benchmark. The benchmark (for instance, the S&P 500) will always have a beta of 1. So: Importantly, the reverse tends to be true—high-beta stocks generally fall more sharply than the market, while low-beta stocks often decline by less. So if we want some peace of mind, especially in a market like this, we want low-beta stocks. And if we really want to improve our chances of enjoying upside in downturns, we also want high yields. That’s in part because of the income return potential itself, but also because that income tends to attract more buyers during market scares. So let’s review several stocks that: Let’s start with B&G Foods (BGS, 11.1% yield), which we’ve discussed very recently, because it serves as a perfect warning about the dangers of relying on headline numbers alone. A stock can look like a perfect candidate in a screener, only to fall apart after just a little bit of scrutiny. B&G Foods is a consumer staples stock whose brands include pantry regulars like Crisco and Cream of Wheat. It has an 11% yield. Its 5-year beta is 0.8. Its 1-year beta is negative 0.6, which implies that when the market zigs, it zags—exactly what we want in a down market. And B&G is killing it in 2025. The market is off about 10% since its Feb. 19 high; BGS shares are up by more than 10%. What’s not to love? BGS Total Returns It’s arguable that the only reasons BGS has defied the market’s gravity lately are its yield and positioning in the staples sector. Past that, though, B&G earned less than it paid out in dividends last year, and it’s projected to do so this year and next. It’s also just a couple months removed from having to write down the worth of several of its best brands. Great headline metrics, but it’s downhill from there. Clearway Energy (CWEN/CWEN.A, 5.8% yield) is a different story. CWEN owns a portfolio of non-regulated clean energy generation assets representing 11.8 gigawatts of gross capacity—9 gigawatts from wind, solar, and battery energy storage systems, and 2.8 gigawatts of conventional dispatchable power capacity. So while it’s technically in the utility sector, its operations aren’t the same as our garden-variety power-or-gas “ute.” However, like utilities, Clearway is enjoying a surge in demand from data centers. It’s already developing traditional data center agreements, but it’s also beginning to scope “behind-the-meter” agreements, where data centers generate energy on-site using renewables rather than tapping into a traditional utility grid. CWEN has also been re-contracting its gas portfolio, which takes some important question marks off the board for the next few years. Clearway seems to have plenty of firepower to support its 5% to 8% annual dividend growth goal. That’s a fine level for a stock that’s already yielding nearly 6%, and better still, shareholders have been enjoying those raises on a quarterly basis for years. In addition to the dividend, shareholders have enjoyed relative stability of late—CWEN’s five-year beta of 0.9 is a hint less volatile than the market, but its shorter-term beta of around 0.4 reflects much smoother sailing over the past year. W.P. Carey (WPC, 5.8% yield) is another quarterly dividend raiser, but its smooth path has quite the hiccup in it. WPC Total Returns W.P. Carey is a massive, diversified net-lease real estate investment trust (REIT) that boasts more than 1,600 properties leased out to more than 360 tenants in 90 industries. More than a third of its portfolio is made up of industrial real estate, another quarter is warehouses, about 20% is retail, and the remainder is scattered across other property types including self-storage. What’s missing there is office properties, which W.P. Carey exited in September 2023 by spinning them off into Net Lease Office Properties (NLOP). Alongside that plan was a necessary “reset” of the dividend policy to account for the shift in assets. In other words, WPC’s dividend “cut” was merely a technicality—the dividend itself is quite healthy. That’s in part because virtually its entire portfolio (99.6%) includes rent escalators; high occupancy of 98%-plus helps, too. Five- and one-year betas of 0.8 and 0.3, respectively, reflect W.P. Carey’s status as a historically cool cucumber, too. Another REIT, LTC Properties (LTC, 6.4% yield), offers up the gold standard in dividend delivery: monthly payments. LTC, which stands for “long-term care,” boasts 190 properties in 25 states, with its investments split roughly 50/50 between assisted living properties and skilled nursing facilities. These were promising businesses until COVID-19 ruptured the space; operations are recovering, though. The stock actually managed to hit its pre-COVID high back in 2023, but that was short-lived. But its second attempt, which started six months ago, is looking better—and shares are stabilizing while the rest of the market falters. LTC not only boasts a five-year beta of 0.7 (good), but an extremely low one-year beta of just over 0.1 (great). That said, LTC is walking into a whirlwind of uncertainty—though possibly for the better. The company plans on pivoting to a RIDEA structure, which stands for the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act. Without getting too far into the weeds, this act lets REITs participate in net operating income, and it’s where LTC believes the majority of external growth opportunities in assisted living remain. Specifically, the company expects to convert $150 million to $200 million of gross investment assets to RIDEA-structured contracts by Q2 2025. It’s a potentially transformative structure, but also a complete unknown. One vital sign to look out for? A long, long-needed increase in its dividend, which has remained stagnant for nearly a decade. Sabra Health Care REIT (SBRA, 6.9% yield) is similar to LTC in that it’s a senior-focused healthcare play. Roughly half of Sabra’s portfolio is in skilled nursing and transitional care facilities, though it also has large allocations to managed senior housing (20%), behavioral health (14%) and leased senior housing (11%). A big signal of improvement in Sabra’s operational health came a little more than a year ago when it provided full-year guidance. Yes, that guidance missed estimates, but it actually released guidance—something it wasn’t able to do a year before that. That said, like LTC, while we’re seeing improvement in the underlying business, we need to see that improvement in our pockets, too. Still, SBRA ended up returning more than 30% in 2024, crushing the VNQ and its piddly 5% advance. Shares have cooled off in 2025 but are still up a few percentage points since the February 19 market peak. They also offer a high yield of nearly 7%, and extremely low volatility—a beta of 0.9 over the past five years isn’t much to look at, but it has registered a nearly unconscious beta of 0.2 over the past 52 weeks. And health care REITs could continue to be defensive if the economic environment continues to worsen. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: AppLovin (APP) Under Pressure: Analyst Downgrades Follow Short Seller Barrage, Investor Lawsuit – Hagens Berman

May 03, 2025 09:22 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, May 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Just months after basking in the glow of a meteoric 700% stock surge, fueled by investor enthusiasm for its artificial intelligence technology and burgeoning ad business, AppLovin Corp. (NASDAQ: APP) is facing a shift in sentiment on Wall Street. Several prominent investment banks have significantly lowered their expectations for the stock following the release of multiple critical reports from short-selling firms about the mobile advertising technology firm. Adding to its woes, AppLovin is now facing a securities class action lawsuit. Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Analysts Downgrade APP Shares The latest blow came on Friday, April 11, when The Goldman Sachs Group slashed its price target for AppLovin from a lofty $500.00 to a more sobering $335.00. This downgrade followed a similar move by UBS Group earlier in the week, when the firm reduced its price target on AppLovin from $630.00 to $450.00. Short Seller Onslaught: Allegations of Data Exploitation and Inflated Metrics These downward revisions follow a barrage of critical reports from short sellers. Most recently, on March 28, Muddy Waters Research alleged that AppLovin's ad technology "systematically" violates app store rules by "impermissibly extracting proprietary IDs" from major platforms to deliver targeted ads without user consent. The report also claimed a significant churn rate among e-commerce advertisers, contradicting company statements. Earlier, in February, Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research had also critiqued AppLovin's AXON software, with Fuzzy Panda later urging the S&P 500 committee to exclude the company due to alleged "data theft" and "revenue fraud." Securities Class Action Alleges Misleading Statements Adding to AppLovin's challenges, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against the company. The lawsuit alleges that AppLovin misled investors about the capabilities of its enhanced AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and its "cutting-edge AI technologies." Specifically, the lawsuit claims that AppLovin created a false impression that its technology would efficiently match advertisements to mobile games and expand into web-based marketing and e-commerce. However, the suit alleges that AppLovin was instead exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices, including a "backdoor installation scheme," to force unwanted apps on customers. This allegedly inflated installation numbers and, consequently, the company's profit figures. The class action lawsuit further points to the short seller reports released on February 26, 2025, which detailed AppLovin's alleged reverse engineering and exploitation of advertising data from Meta Platforms. These reports also claimed that AppLovin utilized manipulative practices to artificially inflate ad click-through and app download rates, such as self-clicking ads and employing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads. Following the release of these reports, the price of AppLovin shares reportedly fell by more than 12%. Hagens Berman’s Investigation Prominent shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the claims. “The allegations detailed in the short reports and outlined in the recently filed class action complaint, detailing the purported exploitation of user data and manipulative installation schemes, raise serious questions about the integrity of AppLovin's reported growth and the accuracy of its disclosures to the investing public,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Title: Is this real estate and data centre player a worthy investment?

A major additional driver for the stock was the company’s foray into the data centre business, though the segment itself is yet to contribute significantly to overall revenues. After a relentless run, the stock is down over 50 per cent from its recent peak in January. While the correction in the broader markets triggered by FPI selling, corporate earnings weakness and US trade tariff challenges led to an up to 25 per cent correction in mid- and small-cap indices, some stocks in this space suffered a lot more. There was also excessive pessimism on the prospects of the nascent cloud/storage business of the company after the DeepSeek AI announcement led to fears that data centre capex the world over would face a reduction (this aspect will be discussed later). At ₹450, the stock trades at 25 times its per share earnings for FY26, making it a reasonable bet for investors with a two-three-year perspective, especially given the elevated valuations that most of the relatively-larger real estate companies trade at currently. The BSE Realty trades at a PE multiple of over 48 times. Robust traction in its residential construction business spanning luxury and affordable segments, visibility in its commercial division and healthy demand in its data centre offering, expected to start contributing to revenues significantly in the coming two-three years, are positive factors. The company also has a healthy balance sheet with very insignificant net debt levels. Over FY21-25, Anant Raj’s revenues grew at 69.4 per cent compounded annually to ₹2,060 crore, while net profits rose at 149.5 per cent to ₹426 crore in FY25. Revenue grew at 38.9 per cent and net profit expanded at 60.1 per cent year on year in FY25. The firm is largely a real estate player focused on the NCR region (mostly in Gurugram). Residential luxury projects, group housing, affordable housing (in Tirupati), plots and villas are areas that it specialises in. There are projects spanning 220 acres of integrated development in Gurugram. About 10.87 million sq ft of ongoing and planned projects are on the horizon, with a total expected revenue of ₹22,000 crore over the next several years. Since it operates in a high-end area of Gurugram, realisations on residential projects are high. In its group housing project, for example, the average selling price is ₹18,000 per sq ft. Anant Raj also has a commercial spaces segment spanning hotels, IT parks and office spaces. These businesses have steady rental income visibility for the foreseeable future. Anant Raj has been providing co-location services since 2019. In recent years, it has also started offering cloud services (infrastructure as a service) in association with Orange Business. It intends to get into AI-enabled solutions as well. By Q1FY26, the company expects as much as 28 MW of data centre capacity to be operational. Over the next five-odd years, it expects to have over 300 MW up and running. Revenues from the segment are insignificant currently. However, after the 28 MW capacity gets operationalised, the data centre segment may contribute significantly (more than 10 per cent) of the revenues by FY26. Over the next two-three years, as more capacity comes on stream, about 25-30 per cent of the company’s revenues may be generated from the segment. The key aspect to note here is that the data centre business generates an operating margin of 75 per cent or more. So, when more revenues flow in, company margins would expand. Anant Raj mostly had public sector companies as clients in its data centre business thus far, but increasingly even private firms are seeking its cloud services. Rising e-commerce usage, faster 5G rollout, cloud computing explosion and data protection law compliance are growth triggers for the company. AI and machine learning would be future drivers. Anant Raj has the added advantage of having its own real estate to house data centres by virtue of its large land bank. India’s data centre capacity crossed 1 GW in 2024, according to a recent report from JLL India, tripling from 2019-levels. Much of the capacity is absorbed. Another 795 MW is expected to be added over 2025-27. Average rents per kVA per month for a 5-20 MW capacity data centre are ₹7,000 in Mumbai. One MW is 1,000 kVA. According to another Anarock Capital report, the Indian data centre industry is worth $10 billion currently and generated an estimated $1.2 billion for operators in 2023-24. On DeepSeek’s entry reducing data centre requirements due to lower computational infrastructure requirements to train large language models, a recent report from Goldman Sachs provides clarity. It notes that questions remain on DeepSeek’s training, infrastructure and ability to scale. The report notes that AI-dedicated data centre is an emerging class of infrastructure and that very few exist currently. Global power demand from data centres will increase 50 per cent by 2027 and by as much as 165 per cent by the end of the decade (compared with 2023), as per Goldman Sachs Research estimates. Further, recently-reported March quarter results and CY26 outlook from US Big Tech companies — Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Amazon also confirm this. Their CY26 mega capex plans related to AI data centre/cloud remains intact, as customer demand remains strong in this segment. Anant Raj has been reducing debt in its balance sheet steadily over the past few years. In FY25, its net debt is just ₹50 crore and the net debt-to-equity ratio is insignificant. The company enjoys a high EBITDA margin of 25 per cent and a net margin of over 20 per cent, which compares favourably among the best in the industry. Once the high-margin data centre business starts contributing significantly to the financials from FY26, margins would further head north.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / MAY 03 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction.

And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare.

In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 75 – Breaking Analysis: Unpacking Oracle’s Autonomous Data Warehouse Announcement – On February 19th of this year, Barron’s dropped an article declaring Oracle a cloud giant and explained why the stock was a buy. Investors took notice and the stock ran up 18% over the next 9 trading days and peaked on March 9th, the day before the company announced its latest earnings. The company beat consensus earnings on both top line and EPS last quarter. But Investors didn’t like Oracle’s tepid guidance and the stock pulled back..but is still well above its pre-Barron’s article price. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 74 – Breaking Analysis: NFTs, Crypto Madness & Enterprise Blockchain – When a piece of digital art sells for $69.3M, more than has ever been paid for works by Paul Gauguin or Salvador Dali, making its creator the third most expensive living artist in the world, one can’t help but take notice and ask: “What is going on?” The latest craze around NFTs may feel a bit “bubblicious,” but it’s yet another sign that the digital age is now fully upon us. In this Breaking Analysis Dave wants to take a look at some of the trends that may have observers and investors scratching their heads, but we think still offer insight to the future — and possibly some opportunities for young investors. And we’ll briefly touch on how these trends may relate to enterprise tech. Watch the full video analysis.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / MAY 03 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / MAY 03 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world.

Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell.

At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations.

Title: Is Nvidia the next MicroStrategy? Why Bitcoin could be its next big bet!
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/is-nvidia-the-next-microstrategy-why-bitcoin-could-be-its-next-big-bet/
Time Published: 2025-05-03T05:00:42Z

By adding BTC, Nvidia might tap into the digital finance trend. Crypto Twitter is abuzz with speculation that Nvidia may be considering a strategic allocation of Bitcoin [BTC] to its corporate treasury. According to AMBCrypto, this thesis isn’t far-fetched though. In fact, key macro and market dynamics suggested this could be a calculated move to diversify balance sheet exposure and hedge against fiat depreciation. If confirmed, such an allocation could act as a significant bullish catalyst for Bitcoin. In fact, it has the potential to attract more institutional investors into the market. The U.S. economy is only halfway through Trump’s re-election cycle and yet, top public company stocks have fallen by over 20% in Q1. Nvidia, ranked among the top three public companies with a market cap of $2.72 trillion, is no exception. At press time, its stock valuations were down 24.44% from its Q1 opening of $138. However, this could just be the beginning of a larger decline. Source: TradingView (NVDA) As a tech giant deeply invested in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Nvidia is squarely positioned at the intersection of the U.S.-China trade war. This exposes the company to potential geopolitical risks that could further pressure its stock price. Moreover, with rising inflation eroding the purchasing power of the U.S Dollar, Nvidia could face higher operational costs, particularly for components and supply chain logistics. Given these macroeconomic pressures, it’s no surprise that more publicly traded companies are turning to Bitcoin to hedge against these risks. In fact, Metaplanet recently issued 3.6 billion JPY in 0% ordinary bonds to acquire additional Bitcoin. It is positioning itself as part of the growing trend of companies adding crypto assets to their corporate reserves. MicroStrategy’s [MSTR] stock has seen a staggering 3,000% return over the past five years, largely driven by its Bitcoin exposure. It has significantly outperformed most tech equities. This has translated to an annualized growth rate of 600%. In comparison, Nvidia’s stock posted returns of “just” 916%. Even though it trails MicroStrategy by a significant margin. Source: X This stark divergence highlights the outsized impact of Bitcoin on MicroStrategy’s performance. Bitcoin’s surge from $10,000 in 2020 to $96,172 at press time, reflecting a year-to-date price gain of 715%, further substantiates its role as a critical driver of portfolio returns for firms like MicroStrategy. With results like these, it’s no wonder that other big players might soon jump on the bandwagon. And guess what? Nvidia looks like it’s next in line to make that bold move!

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Auto workers supported tariffs to protect their jobs. They caused layoffs instead. by Miles Bryan Pennsylvania’s Lehigh Valley was once synonymous with America’s industrial might. The region was known for its booming manufacturing economy anchored by companies like Mack Trucks and Bethlehem Steel, the latter of which employed over 30,000 workers at its peak in the 1950s. But manufacturing began to struggle in the 1970s and collapsed by the turn of the century. Bethlehem Steel went bankrupt in 2001 (the site now houses a casino). All of this made the Lehigh Valley into a symbol of the ills of de-industrialization. There’s even a Billy Joel song about it. Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins. President Donald Trump has said his ongoing trade war is meant in large part to bring manufacturing jobs back to communities like this. But, in the Lehigh Valley, it’s having the opposite effect: Last month, Mack Trucks announced it would be laying off about 10 percent of its unionized workers at its Lehigh Valley plant, and pointed to tariffs and the economic uncertainty they’ve caused as the reason. “We were very surprised,” Mack Trucks employee and UAW Local 677 District 1 Committeeperson Dan Hand told me. “We have people that just started working on the shop floor Monday of last week. … They’re scared.” When I saw a local news story about these layoffs, I knew I had to drive up to the valley from my home in Philadelphia to talk to Hand and his coworkers in person. I expected them to be mad. But I found a more complicated story — and more complicated feelings about the tariffs. Last summer, Mack Trucks’ parent company, Volvo, announced it was building a massive new truck plant in Mexico. The company said it planned to supplement its American workforce, not replace it, but Hand and his union members were upset and scared that their jobs, like so many others in their industry, would eventually move south of the border. In March, UAW 577 put out a press release blasting Mack’s decision and endorsing tariffs as a tool to fight it. Now, even with the impending layoffs, Mack’s Lehigh Valley workforce is split on Trump’s tariff policy. “It doesn’t seem like there’s a good game plan,” said Hand, who voted for Trump in 2016, but then soured on him because of his treatment of organized labor in his first term. John Taniser, on the other hand, told me short-term pain is worth it for long-term change. He voted for Trump in 2024 and remains confident in the president’s vision. “It could be a year. It could be two years. But what we’re looking for is a path forward to thrive and not just sustain and exist,” said Taniser, a 27-year veteran of Mack’s production line. “In this economy that we’re in currently, there’s no going forward.” Nearly all economists agree that it’s unlikely manufacturing will ever play as big a role in the American economy as it did in the mid-20th century. My colleague Dylan Matthews wrote an article recently about how, as countries get richer, they all see manufacturing jobs replaced with service industry jobs. That was the case across the US over the last century, and that’s true in the Lehigh Valley too: The largest employers in the county now are hospitals and Amazon warehouses. Manufacturing itself has changed over time, too. Even if companies like Mack buck the trend and invest more in the United States, that ultimately won’t translate into many new jobs: As manufacturing technology has improved, factories need fewer and fewer human workers. But that’s a hard pill to swallow for people in communities that were built around manufacturing and that have suffered from its decline. Many hope tariffs will still, despite what experts say, rewind the clock and reverse that decline. “Those great jobs — they built the Valley,” Taniser said. “Those workers are the ones who bought all these homes, who shopped at all these stores. It’s not there anymore. And we want to bring it back. I want it back.” This piece originally ran in the Today, Explained newsletter. For more stories like this, sign up here.

Title: China’s “Manhattan Project”
URL: https://dailyreckoning.com/chinas-manhattan-project/
Time Published: 2025-05-02T22:00:36Z
Full Content:
By Adam Sharp PostedMay 2, 2025 Tech stocks have staged an impressive comeback since their recent mini-crash. Is the dip over? Back to normal, with the Mag 7 once again taking center stage? Not so fast. American tech stocks face a number of challenges which could stop a new bull market in its tracks. The risk we’re going to discuss today is the possibility of another surge in Chinese AI technology. You may recall that earlier this year the release of Chinese AI model DeepSeek R1 caused quite a stir. R1 was the first state-of-the-art “reasoning” AI model which was open source, meaning it was free for anyone to use or modify. DeepSeek R1 was trained on a budget about 95% smaller than a typical American model. So this naturally caused concern about demand for NVIDIA’s AI chips (nearly all leading AI models are built using NVIDIA chips). After the release of R1, NVIDIA (NVDA) shares crashed from over $147 down to $118 in just a few days. Shares briefly dipped below $100, and currently trade around $114, so still haven’t fully recovered. DeepSeek R1 rocked the world. The prior assumption that China is years behind in AI technology was forgotten. It became clear that DeepSeek has a cutting-edge team and is breaking new ground. And despite the AI chip restrictions placed on China, they had figured out how to make competitive models anyway. DeepSeek’s next major model, R2, will likely be released in the next few weeks. It will certainly be a major improvement from R1. And that’s a disturbing thought for American tech firms. There are a few ways in which R2 could be a major shock to the U.S. tech system. R1 was a major technological breakthrough, but it was still trained on American NVIDIA AI chips. What if R2 is trained on Chinese AI hardware? China’s leading AI chip maker, Huawei, has made major advances in recent months, and is catching up to NVIDIA. Reuters recently reported that NVIDIA met with U.S. lawmakers to discuss the rising threat of Huawei. Here’s Reuters: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang discussed concerns about Huawei Technologies Co.’s growing artificial intelligence capabilities with U.S. lawmakers, according to a senior congressional committee staff source. The issues were raised during a closed-door meeting between Nvidia executives and the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee on Thursday. Among the topics discussed were Huawei’s artificial intelligence chips and how restrictions on Nvidia’s chips in China could make Huawei’s chips more competitive. “If DeepSeek R1 had been trained on (Huawei chips) or a future open-source Chinese model had been trained to be highly optimized to Huawei chips, that would risk creating a global market demand for Huawei chips,” the senior staff source said. Meanwhile, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang was recently in China and made the case that China is “not behind” in AI. He also called Huawei “one of the most formidable technology companies in the world”. This is the type of honesty required to face China as a rising competitor. We underestimate the country at our own peril. As Huang recently noted, 50% of the world’s AI researchers are Chinese. For years now, the U.S. has been restricting the flow of American and European semiconductor tech to China. This has led directly to China launching a Manhattan Project sized effort to build their own capabilities. In May of 2023 NVIDIA CEO Huang warned that “If [China] can’t buy from … the United States, they’ll just build it themselves.” Now we’re seeing this play out in real-time. DeepSeek R2 will be released in the near future. If it turns out to be a breakthrough model built on Chinese AI hardware, be prepared for a double shock to American tech firms. DeepSeek R1 signaled the end of America’s monopoly on state-of-the-art AI models. A DeepSeek R2 built on Huawei hardware would also signal the end of NVIDIA’s monopoly on deep-learning chips. And if R2 isn’t built on Chinese hardware, my guess is that R3 will be. Don’t get me wrong, NVIDIA, and other American tech firms, will maintain big market shares going forward. But in NVIDIA’s case, going from 98% to 70% market share in AI training would be a severe shock. Additional competition means less pricing power, lower profit margins, and a lesser network effect. In other words, it could derail one of the greatest stock runs of all time. We’ll keep an eye on this story and report back with any major updates. Have a great weekend, everyone.

Title: Amazon-backed creator startup Spotter lays off staffers. Read the memo from its CEO.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-backed-creator-startup-spotter-lays-off-staffers-2025-5
Time Published: 2025-05-02T21:44:18Z

Spotter, a startup that works with some of YouTube's biggest stars, laid off staff this week, the company confirmed to Business Insider. BI was unable to determine the exact number of employees affected, but the layoffs impacted teams across the company. "As the macroeconomic environment continues to evolve, we've made the difficult but strategic decision to implement organizational changes, including a reduction in the size of our team," a spokesperson for Spotter told BI. The spokesperson said the cuts will help "accelerate our path to profitability by the end of this year." Spotter is a major player in the creator space. Last year, it attracted funding from Amazon as part of a larger deal to work with Spotter's creator partners. The company's talent pool includes MrBeast, Dude Perfect, and Ryan Trahan. Spotter, which was founded in 2019 and is also backed by SoftBank, built a business buying the rights to license creator content. In March, the company said it had paid out over $950 million to creators. That month, Spotter hosted a splashy pitch event in New York for creators and advertisers. The company said this week's layoffs did not impact Spotter's advertising sales team. The cuts mark Spotter's second round of layoffs in the last six months. The company laid off employees in November, a spokesperson previously told The Information. Spotter is not the only creator content licensing startup to cull staff in the past year. Jellysmack, a competitor that shares Softbank as an investor, made cuts in October amid a restructuring. Some startups focused on creator services have failed to meet growth expectations, industry investors previously told BI. Spotter also offers AI-powered products to help creators come up with video ideas, titles, and thumbnails. It runs an advertising business connecting brands with creators as well. Read the email Spotter's CEO Aaron DeBevoise sent to employees this week announcing the job cuts: Team, Today, we've made the difficult decision to part ways with some of our teammates. I understand today is challenging - particularly for those impacted. These changes were thoroughly considered, particularly given recent economic uncertainty and volatility, which have further impacted investors' demand for efficiency and profitability. Despite our success in Q1, it has become clear that in light of the economic environment, we must make targeted changes to accelerate our path to profitability and control our own destiny. To our impacted teammates: We are so thankful for your contributions which have been critical to advancing our mission to help Creators win. We have already sent calendar invites to all impacted employees for conversations today where you will learn about next steps. We are committed to supporting these team members as they transition to their next opportunities. Thank you. Aaron Jump to

Title: S&P 500 Notches Longest Winning Streak Since 2004 As Stocks Claw Back From ‘Liberation Day’ Crash

ByDerek Saul ByDerek Saul, Forbes Staff. Derek Saul has covered markets for the Forbes news team since 2021. ByDerek Saul, Forbes Staff. Stocks rallied again Friday on a key data point showing strength in the U.S. economy and optimism about trade talks between the U.S. and China, sending the S&P 500 index to its longest winning stretch in two decades, completing the v-shaped recovery from President Donald Trump’s tariffs which briefly crashed U.S. stocks. The AI trade is back in vogue, with the likes of Meta, Palantir and Tesla all gaining at least 20% ... More since last Monday. The S&P rose 1.5% to 5,686 Friday after April’s jobs report revealed better jobs growth than economists forecasted and Beijing indicated it’s open to addressing Trump’s concerns on the country’s role in fentanyl production, opening a potential path to a trade deal with the White House, according to the Wall Street Journal. This was the ninth consecutive positive trading session for the S&P, the longest winning streak for the benchmark since November 2004, according to Barron’s. Following the end-of-week rally, the S&P closed at its highest price since March 28, a week before President Donald Trump announced country-by-country tariff rates in his so-called “Liberation Day” event April 2. The S&P plummeted more than 12% from April 2 to April 8, but stocks have steadily recovered since Trump paused his most hawkish trade policies April 9 and his administration further backed down on tariffs in the following weeks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and tech-heavy Nasdaq also gained more than 1% Friday and are up big from their tariff-driven April lows, as the Dow is up 10%, or more than 3,600 points, since April 8 and the Nasdaq is up 18% during the time frame. Among the most notable risers Friday were Spotify, Delta Air Lines, Arm Holdings and Palantir, as shares of all four companies gained at least 5%; also jumping were Facebook parent Meta and Microsoft, which both enjoyed more than 2% bumps as a continuation of their rallies following robust earnings reports Tuesday. The S&P is still down 7% from its February record high and 5% since Trump’s second presidency began. The stock market yardstick suffered its worst 100-day start to a presidential term since Richard Nixon’s second term in 1973, according to the Wall Street Journal. “If the labor market holds up and the Trump administration walks back the most egregious tariffs, the economy could skirt a deep recession,” LPL Financial chief economist Jeffrey Roach in emailed comments. About 90% of the 500 companies listed on the S&P have gained during the winning streak stretching back to last Tuesday. The top percentage gainers are all artificial intelligence players: AI-focused government contractor Palantir, AI hardware maker Arista Networks and AI data center power provider Vistra. Among the U.S.’ three dozen “mega-cap” companies valued at $200 billion and above, the biggest winners are Palantir, Elon Musk’s Tesla and Larry Ellison’s cloud computer Oracle. Shares of both Meta and Microsoft have also gained more than 20%. Not taking part in the Friday rally was Apple, as shares of the iPhone maker slid 4%. The big technology firm reported first-quarter earnings Thursday afternoon and nodded to the damaging effects of tariffs to its bottom line, warning of a $900 million direct profit hit from tariffs. A slew of companies have lowered or suspended financial guidance in light of tariff uncertainty.

Title: New Listing Reveals Costco’s Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller Discount (And It’s Great News)

The Switch 2 Pro Controller will be cheaper for Costco shoppers. By Amanda Kay Oaks Late last week, Costco added a listing for the Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle, confirming the retailer would carry the console at launch. While we still don’t have an exact price for that bundle, it’s likely to be at a bit of a discount for members, given that that’s kind of Costco’s thing. However, a new Switch 2 listing on Costco’s website today does come with a price tag attached, and it’s exciting news for fans struggling with those Switch 2 accessory price hikes. The Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller is now up on Costco’s US website, and this time, we’ve got the exact price along with the details. The controller will be available for Costco members on June 5th alongside the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2. And thanks to @Wario64 and their Costco membership, we have confirmation that the Switch 2 Pro Controller will cost $69.99 for Costco members. Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller will be $69.99 at Costco (releasing June 5) buff.ly/KGizwJW While that price might not be the most exciting number to see, it’s certainly a steep discount compared to other retailers. Following the accessory price increases announced due to U.S. Tariffs, the Switch 2 Pro Controller is listed for $84.99 at most retailers that have it up, including Best Buy and GameStop. That means the Costco listing shows off an impressive $15 discount on the new Pro Controller. For those who want to get ahold of the updated version, this is excellent news, so long as you’ve got a Costco membership to get your hands on it. The Pro Controller is, so far, the only Nintendo Switch 2 accessory listed for sale at Costco. It joins the listing for the Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle for a grand total of two Switch 2 listings at the retailer so far. Given that there’s still a little over a month to go, it’s possible we could see additional Switch 2 options and accessories added to the list at Costco. That said, the retailer does tend to offer fewer accessories compared to other stores that specialize in gaming items. Currently, there’s a good list of new accessories launching alongside the Switch 2 on June 5th. This includes the new Switch 2 camera to use with the Game Chat feature, Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Cons, a Switch 2-specific Carrying Case and Screen Protector, Joy-Con straps and charging grips for the Switch 2, and the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller. All of these items saw a price increase following the original announcement, making them a bit more expensive than players initially expected. With any luck, a few more of those accessories could wind up with a similar Costco discount to what we’re seeing for the Switch 2 Pro Controller. Otherwise, getting everything you want to go along with your shiny new Switch 2 console could wind up being pretty pricey in 2025. The Nintendo Switch 2, along with several new accessories, will launch on June 5th. For now, most retailers have closed or run out of stock on pre-orders, so gamers who haven’t yet secured the console will need to wait for June 5th to get one from their preferred store. Those buying directly from the Nintendo shop online should start getting purchase invites next week, as they’re set to start going out on May 8th.

Title: What To Buy Before Tariffs Raise The Price Of Everything

Since the second Trump administration announced sweeping global tariffs on April 2, 2025, it has been a dizzying process trying to track what duties are actually active and on what nations, goods and resouces. What is clear, according to numerous experts we consulted, is that the prices Americans will soon be paying on all sorts of products—from sofas to washing machines—are going to rise; that’s because tariffs, often positioned as taxes levied on foreign countries and companies, are, in fact, paid by American businesses importing the goods, with some level of elevated consumer prices following on. Prices are going to rise on products ranging from washing machines to bath towels to chocolate bars. ... More We spoke to the experts to find out what to expect and when. To better understand what the effects of these policies will be and how our readers’ lives may change, we spoke with multiple economists and finance researchers to find out what developments we can expect to see across the many products we test and recommend at Forbes Vetted. These experts also shared their advice on how to think about consumer purchasing in the short term, and gave guidance on how to navigate this tricky and uncertain time. Currently, there is a 10% baseline tariff on everything imported to the United States, with higher tariffs imposed on various industries based abroad. Many of these tariffs are nearly as high as 50%, per data sourced from the government. “A baseline tariff is a tariff rate set by our government on all countries,” says Professor Albert Williams, Ph.D, Finance Chair of the Wayne Huizenga College of Business at Nova Southeastern University. On the other hand, he explains that a reciprocal tariff is a further elevated duty imposed as either a retaliation or a punitive measure implemented based on perceived unfair trade practices. Few of those elevated reciprocal tariffs are currently in place, though, as the White House granted a 90-day freeze on April 9, temporarily keeping things at that baseline 10%. (Some industries, like automobiles, steel and aluminum, and as of April 14, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, might see levies go into effect despite this.) One other—and quite notable—exception to this reprieve is on imports from China, who has the world’s second-largest economy. “The entire menu of tariffs currently in effect is well over 100% on China,” says Professor Jason Miller, Ph.D, with Michigan State University’s Eli Broad College of Business. He adds: “There are tariffs on [almost everything] except for carveouts for [products like] lumber and wood products and copper,” Miller says. “A great many products are affected,” he adds. What won’t be affected, at least for now, is a selection of tech products. Scarcely a week after imposing wide-ranging blanket tariffs on China, the Trump Administration announced exemptions on smartphones, computers, computer chips and several other high-tech product categories, making them subject to much lower duties than the rest of China’s imports. This is seen as a direct but short-term assist to American tech giants, chiefly Apple. But it might be a short-term gift, as the White House has said tariffs on these items are “coming soon.” They will now. In the past, orders coming from China (which has been levied with a formidable 145% tariff rate) were exempt from tariff fees if the total value of the order was under $800 USD. This was because of a rule known as the “de minimis exemption," the Merriam-Webster Dictionary definition literally meaning “lacking significance or importance; so minor as to merit disregard.” That exemption is no more. As of May 2nd, 2025, even these smaller orders will be assessed with fees that more than double the cost paid at the time of import, and those costs will generally be passed on to consumers within the United States. According to an official White House press release: “On average, CBP [Customs and Border Protection] processes over 4 million de minimis shipments into the U.S. each day.” It remains to be seen how much profit, if any, the new fees will actually bring to American coffers, as it often costs more for CBP to process smaller orders than the revenues raised cover. And according to PBS, orders will likely take longer to get to your door. According to Professor Babak Hafezi, who teaches International Business at American University, “How these tariffs have been imposed will cause nearly everything to increase in price.” He adds that “We have to understand that we have a globalized supply chain with parts being made all over the world and [products] assembled in other countries.” While the exemption of many high-tech devices might keep the price of iPhones, laptops, and other hardware stabler than previously expected—at least for now—you can expect higher price tags for things like appliances, TVs and other complex manufactured goods. Imported foods, apparel, luxury items and more will become pricier, including everything from French wine to Italian leather. And coffee and chocolate will no doubt be more expensive, too. Ironically, tariffs levied on foreign goods often prompt an increase on domestically produced goods as well. If a retailer raises the price on a pound of French cheese by five dollars, for example, they may well elevate the cost of a comparable American product by two or three dollars, since it will still seem like the better bargain. The same is true for other domestically produced products, from apparel to technology to toys. And in addition to higher prices for the consumer, tariffs may lead to supply chain disruptions for both internationally and domestically produced products. This is, in part, because China has vastly limited its exports to the United States in response to the reciprocal tariffs placed on its manufacturers. As an example, our recommendation for one of the best couches, the Rose Sofa from Chicago-based custom sofa maker Interior Define is temporarily unavailable due to trade fluctuations borne by the tariffs. We may see more brands and items follow suit as raw materials become prohibitively expensive or altogether unavailable. While we may see some price increases immediately in anticipation of tariffs, the majority of these will take place a few months after they fully go into effect, “once existing inventories are cycled through and the tariffed items are now being sold,” says professor Miller. That means that with the White House’s current delays, we should see an impact by the summer. And as for whether to stock up before that time, professor Miller advises proceeding with some nuance: “Given all the uncertainty about what tariffs will actually be, I would tell folks only to go forward on purchases for something like a smartphone if they were planning on replacing that phone anyway in the next few months. The same applies with items like laptops.” Long story short, if you were about to buy something you need, go ahead and make the purchase, especially for already pricey items that may be subject to additional price hikes soon. Also shop for those intentional items when you see a meaningful discount; while it’s still too early to tell how shopping events later in the year, like Amazon Prime Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday will ultimately be affected, it’s smart to pick up what you truly need if you can get it for a good deal. (We’ll continue to track these savings in our ongoing sale coverage.) That said, if you’re not actively in the market for a given product, don’t panic buy early—even if it’s currently discounted. While we’re still waiting to see how drastic and widespread price increases may be in coming months, here are some of the items we’re keeping an eye on, and that you may want to consider purchasing now if they need to be replaced: The back-and-forth over whether smartphones, computers and other technology will be impacted by tariffs means nothing is certain; if you are in the market for a new device, such as the iPhone 15 Pro Max or a new Android phone, you may want to buy it. The same goes for laptops, printers and other electronics like our top-recommended TVs. Apple According to the Alliance for American Manufacturing, about 75% of all furniture sold in America is produced overseas. If you’re in the market for a new desk, bedroom set or living room seating, such as one of the best sofas Forbes Vetted team spent more than a year testing, this is a good time to go for it. Sundays The vast majority of shoes, such as Forbes Vetted reader-favorite Hoka walking shoes, are made overseas, and the price on shoes of all types is likely to rise when tariffs hit and new designs come out. This is also the case for things like men’s shorts, crossbody bags, bath towels and other clothing, accessories and textiles we test and recommend. Frontgate We regularly cover home appliances, such as whole-house humidifiers, stackable washers and dryers, and other hardware that can be quite expensive even without tariff-induced price hikes. If you have already budgeted for a home appliance, it could be a good idea to buy now before prices rise further. You can all but count on higher prices on numerous foods and beverages, such as the aforementioned chocolate, coffee and wine subscriptions, but also on other imports like olive oil and flowers. Maeve Chocolate Contrary to common misconception, tariffs are not paid by foreign countries or foreign companies; they are paid by the company importing goods from overseas or by an agent for the domestic company. In other words, in the case of these recent tariffs, they will be paid for by American businesses. The money raised goes through the United States Custom and Border Protection agency and becomes federal government revenue. “Tariff taxes collected are added to the government’s revenues, which are then used for education, social programs, military, healthcare spending and more,” says professor Williams. Some of the costs incurred by those importers are absorbed by the companies affected, but the rest are largely passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. In effect, everyday consumers eventually shoulder some burden of increased prices triggered by tariffs. A “recession” is defined as two or more consecutive quarters of decline in economic activity significant enough that the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP) shrinks. The types of economic activity tracked include a higher unemployment rate, a slowdown in industrial production, reduced consumer spending and reduced business investment and profit. Some economists warn that the current tariff program may lead to a recession. “This is what most economists are worried about,” says professor Hafezi. “If we have rising prices because of tariffs and enter a recession, we could enter a timeframe of stagflation. This is a staggering economy that cannot rebalance because tariffs impose an artificially high rate on prices, and discounting will be minimal because the supply chain will have taken all discounts possible to keep prices down as much as possible. This staggering economy is happening while you have further inflationary elements that dampen economic activity. Furthermore, companies will take multiple quarters to move their supply chains to rebalance production to countries that are not tariffed or are less so. This will take time.” Bottom line: During times of recession, consumer spending tends to drop, which further slows the economy. As a result, merchandise prices often drop to accommodate that lowered demand, and while cheaper phones, toilet paper and office chairs might seem like a good thing, reduced prices also often mean less profits for retailers, which can cause hiring freezes and layoffs. These only make a potential recession worse and more protracted.

Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce.

Amazon (AMZN-2.87%) founder Jeff Bezos will sell billions of dollars in Amazon stock over the next year, according to a regulatory filing. The former Amazon CEO and current executive chair will sell up to 25 million shares between now and May 2026, according to the SEC disclosure, which was made publicly available Friday. The value of those transactions would amount to about $4.8 billion at Amazon’s current stock price. The filing says Bezos adopted the plan in March. The disclosure comes a day after Amazon reported its first-quarter earnings. Net sales rose 9% to $155.7 billion, while net income reached $17.1 billion, or $1.59 per share, easily topping Wall Street’s forecast of $1.37 earnings per share. Amazon’s North American sales came in at $92.9 billion and international sales hit $33.5 billion, climbing 8% and 5% over last year, respectively. AWS posted $29.3 billion in revenue, with segment operating income climbing to $11.5 billion — suggesting that demand for cloud and AI workloads remains strong. Ad sales also surpassed estimates, rising 19% year-over-year. Still, Amazon shares were up only 0.2%, to 190.62, on Friday afternoon. The stock is down 13.5% since the start of the year. Bezos unloaded about $13.5 billion worth of Amazon stock last year, the first time he’d sold his shares since 2021. That included 50 million shares in the span of nine trading days in February 2024 and another 25 million shares in July, when the stock was near its all-time high. The timing of those sales coincided with Bezos’ full-time move from the Seattle area, where Amazon is headquartered, to Florida. If he still lived in Washington state, where a 7% capital gains tax was enacted in 2022, those transactions would have cost Bezos nearly $945 million. Bezos didn’t mention Washington state’s new capital gains tax as a reason for his move. But while living there, the billionaire didn’t sell any Amazon stock in 2022 or 2023 after the tax was enacted, Fortune reported. —Catherine Baab and Bruce Gil contributed to this article.

Title: Why prices on some of Americans’ go-to shopping sites are suddenly spiking

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? The end of the de minimis exemption, briefly explained. by Nicole Narea Cheap goods from China on Americans’ go-to websites — from Amazon to Temu — are suddenly way more expensive. That’s because the “de minimis” exemption for Chinese imports expired Friday by order of President Donald Trump. Under that exemption, shipments of goods whose total value is less than $800 were exempt from tariffs — a threshold that included for most purchases individual Americans make from China. Those days are over. As of Friday, Chinese imports that would have previously fallen under the de minimis exemption are “subject to a duty rate of either 30% of their value or $25 per item (increasing to $50 per item after June 1, 2025),” according to the White House. Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins. Americans will pay the price as retailers pass on increased import costs to consumers. And given how many de minimis shipments arrive in the US every day, that price could be high. A growing number of foreign imports have fallen under the de minimis exemption in the last decade. Between 2015 and 2024, the volume of de minimis shipments increased from 134 million to nearly 1.4 billion. China accounted for the majority of them by far. In 2023, 62 percent of all de minimis shipments, valued at roughly $33.8 billion, came from China. A few factors might be behind the explosion in de minimis shipments, especially from China. For one, the de minimus exemption has been on the books since 1930, but Congress raised the threshold for qualifying goods in 2016 from $200 to $800. That made it cheaper to import more relatively low-value items. The way Americans shop has also changed. Online, direct-to-consumer retail and dropshipping — when a business does not keep inventory in stock but turns to a third-party supplier to send items to its customers — has ballooned in recent years. Many of these businesses rely on Chinese suppliers being able to fulfill and send orders to the US cheaply under the de minimis exemption. In anticipation of the exemption ending, Chinese retailers Temu and Shein announced that they are starting to raise prices. Price hikes vary by category of goods, but Bloomberg reported that Shein prices rose by about 10 percent in a two-day span last week. Temu added “import charges” of 145 percent of an item’s cost and then announced that it would stop selling goods imported directly from China to US consumers entirely. The end of the de minimus exemption doesn’t just affect big retailers, but also small- to medium-sized businesses in the US — for example, individual sellers on Etsy and Shopify. Some such businesses have had to raise their prices and are now reporting a significant decline in US orders, requiring them to diversify beyond the American market if they can, according to CNBC. But the loss of US customers might also force many small businesses to close entirely. For consumers, that means fewer and more expensive options — hardly a sign of the economic revival that Trump promised. Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins. The vaunted news program is under attack. Gold has become a rare safe bet in Trump’s economy. Trump’s podcasting and new media allies in the “manosphere” don’t know what to make of his tariff policy. The inconvenient truth about trade. Everyone likes cheap consumer goods that will get more expensive under Trump’s tariffs. Roku, Amazon, and practically every company in the streaming business are inventing new ways to make money off your data. © 2025 Vox Media, LLC. All Rights Reserved

Amazon (AMZN) wavered between gains and losses Friday after the e-commerce and cloud computing giant issued a cautious outlook amid uncertainty about the economy, offsetting strong quarterly results. During the company’s earnings call, CEO Andy Jassy told analysts the company hasn’t seen any significant impact from tariffs denting consumer demand or sellers setting product pricing, but cautioned that may change. He also said that Amazon has remained proactive to keep prices low. Amazon shares had lost 13% since the start of the year through Thursday's close and dropped 22% from their record high established in early February, weighed down by concerns that the company could get caught in the crosshairs of a protracted U.S.- China trade war. The stock was up about 1% at $192 in early-afternoon trading Friday, recovering from losses earlier in the session. Below, we break down the technicals on Amazon’s chart and point out key post-earnings price levels worth monitoring. Since bottoming out last month, Amazon shares have consolidated within a rising wedge. More recently, the price has rallied toward the wedge’s top trendline and 50-day moving average (MA), a move that has coincided with the relative strength index (RSI) crossing back into bullish territory. Let’s identify several key support and resistance levels on Amazon’s chart that will likely gain investors’ attention. A decisive breakdown below the rising wedge pattern's lower trendline could see the shares drop to around $170. This area on the chart would likely provide support near the late-April low and the trough of a minor pullback to the 200-day MA last August. Selling below this level brings lower support at $152 into play. Bargain hunters could seek buying opportunities at a location near last year’s early August sell-off low. This region also roughly aligns with a projected bars pattern downside target that extracts the trend lower that preceded the rising wedge and repositions it from the pattern’s top trendline, speculating where the shares may be headed if a continuation move lower plays out. A breakout above the rising wedge pattern’s top trendline would likely see the stock test overhead resistance near $199. The shares may run into selling pressure in this area near a horizontal line that connects a range of corresponding trading activity on the chart extending back to early July last year. Finally, a more bullish move higher in Amazon shares could propel a move up to $216. Investors who bought at lower levels may see this as high probability area to place sell orders near the stock’s November peak and January trough.

ByDerek Saul ByDerek Saul, Forbes Staff. Derek Saul has covered markets for the Forbes news team since 2021. ByDerek Saul, Forbes Staff. Stocks rallied again Friday on a key data point showing strength in the U.S. economy and optimism about trade talks between the U.S. and China, sending the S&P 500 index to its longest winning stretch in two decades, completing the v-shaped recovery from President Donald Trump’s tariffs which briefly crashed U.S. stocks. The AI trade is back in vogue, with the likes of Meta, Palantir and Tesla all gaining at least 20% ... More since last Monday. The S&P rose 1.5% to 5,686 Friday after April’s jobs report revealed better jobs growth than economists forecasted and Beijing indicated it’s open to addressing Trump’s concerns on the country’s role in fentanyl production, opening a potential path to a trade deal with the White House, according to the Wall Street Journal. This was the ninth consecutive positive trading session for the S&P, the longest winning streak for the benchmark since November 2004, according to Barron’s. Following the end-of-week rally, the S&P closed at its highest price since March 28, a week before President Donald Trump announced country-by-country tariff rates in his so-called “Liberation Day” event April 2. The S&P plummeted more than 12% from April 2 to April 8, but stocks have steadily recovered since Trump paused his most hawkish trade policies April 9 and his administration further backed down on tariffs in the following weeks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and tech-heavy Nasdaq also gained more than 1% Friday and are up big from their tariff-driven April lows, as the Dow is up 10%, or more than 3,600 points, since April 8 and the Nasdaq is up 18% during the time frame. Among the most notable risers Friday were Spotify, Delta Air Lines, Arm Holdings and Palantir, as shares of all four companies gained at least 5%; also jumping were Facebook parent Meta and Microsoft, which both enjoyed more than 2% bumps as a continuation of their rallies following robust earnings reports Tuesday. The S&P is still down 7% from its February record high and 5% since Trump’s second presidency began. The stock market yardstick suffered its worst 100-day start to a presidential term since Richard Nixon’s second term in 1973, according to the Wall Street Journal. “If the labor market holds up and the Trump administration walks back the most egregious tariffs, the economy could skirt a deep recession,” LPL Financial chief economist Jeffrey Roach in emailed comments. About 90% of the 500 companies listed on the S&P have gained during the winning streak stretching back to last Tuesday. The top percentage gainers are all artificial intelligence players: AI-focused government contractor Palantir, AI hardware maker Arista Networks and AI data center power provider Vistra. Among the U.S.’ three dozen “mega-cap” companies valued at $200 billion and above, the biggest winners are Palantir, Elon Musk’s Tesla and Larry Ellison’s cloud computer Oracle. Shares of both Meta and Microsoft have also gained more than 20%. Not taking part in the Friday rally was Apple, as shares of the iPhone maker slid 4%. The big technology firm reported first-quarter earnings Thursday afternoon and nodded to the damaging effects of tariffs to its bottom line, warning of a $900 million direct profit hit from tariffs. A slew of companies have lowered or suspended financial guidance in light of tariff uncertainty.

Title: Costco, Walmart and other places to buy gold this May

Watch CBS News We may receive commissions from some links to products on this page. Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms. May 2, 2025 / 11:21 AM EDT / CBS News The benefits of gold investing have long been clear, and they remain relatively unchanged, even in the unpredictable economic climate of early 2025. Historically known as a smart inflation hedge, thanks to its ability to maintain its value during inflationary periods, gold has maintained that feature in recent years, as demonstrated by a consistent rise in price as inflation spiked. It's also stayed reliable as a portfolio diversification tool, as was seen in recent weeks, as the price broke numerous records while stock market uncertainty was particularly high in April. While the features of gold remain relatively well-known and particularly pronounced, how to get started with a gold investment can remain elusive and less clear to prospective investors. It's not something that can be as easy to invest in as stocks, bonds and even real estate. Or at least, historically, it wasn't. But now, in early 2025, there are multiple places in which investors can buy physical gold bars and coins. And that purchase doesn't need to be complicated, as it can take place at a local trusted retailer or even from the comfort of your home. Below, we'll compile a list of places in which you can buy gold from this May, and begin the process of protecting and diversifying your wider portfolio. Start exploring your top gold investing resources here now. Ready to invest in physical gold? Prefer the tangibility of gold bars and coins, specifically? Then consider buying the precious metal from one or more of the following locations: Multiple gold individual retirement account (IRA) companies do business online, offering you the comfort of completing your transaction with a trusted and verifiable organization. These companies can be reviewed online and many offer free guides and the chance to speak directly with a specialist who can answer your questions and help you get started with a customized gold investment. The range of investment types tends to be wider with these companies as well as they offer gold bars, coins, IRAs and more. Some even offer alternative precious metal investments, like silver, for those who don't want to pay the elevated price gold is currently selling for. Just be sure to compare offers from multiple companies to determine which one is truly offering the most cost-effective investment options. Research the top gold companies online today. Costco got into the gold market in 2023, notably selling out of 1-ounce gold bars relatively quickly. By last spring, it was selling $200 million in gold (and silver) each month. And it's easy to understand why. Costco is a trusted brand, known for its affordable prices, bulk sales and ease of in-person shopping. Their gold selection also comes from authorized dealers and trustworthy mints, making a gold addition to your shopping cart, whether it be online or in the store, both valuable and reliable. More of a Walmart shopper instead? The retailer also offers gold to customers now in the form of bars and coins. And, like Costco, it can be purchased online or in select stores for those who prefer to examine their gold investment prior to purchasing. And with options ranging from 1-gram gold bars to 1-ounce gold bars, there's likely a type for each prospective gold investor, regardless of their budget. If you want to avoid the crowds of big box stores but aren't well-versed or don't want to spend time researching your gold IRA company options, consider heading to your local jeweler this May. With gold prices in the news on a near-daily basis, they're likely well-versed in the intricacies of gold investing right now and can offer you a more personalized approach than you may be able to get with Costco or Walmart. That said, they may also tack on a bigger markup than you'd pay elsewhere, so it's important to visit these stores with a realistic price in mind — and be willing to walk out if the jeweler isn't willing to sell you the gold for the same (or better) price that you can secure with one of the other options on this list. With gold ubiquitous right now, prospective investors or those looking to bulk up their current gold investments have plenty of viable options to explore. Just don't let the wide range of options overwhelm you, either.

Title: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang got his first raise in a decade

The chief executive of the world’s biggest chipmaker is getting his first raise in a decade. Nvidia (NVDA-1.54%) CEO Jensen Huang’s total pay rose to $49.9 million in 2025, according to an SEC filing first spotted by CNBC. His base salary increased 49% to $1.5 million, his variable cash rose by 50% to $1 million, and his stock awards grew to $38.8 million. It’s Huang’s first base salary increase in 10 years, according to the filing, which also noted that Nvidia’s compensation committee “believed this was appropriate in consideration of internal pay equity with the base salaries” of other top executives. Huang, who co-founded Nvidia in 1993, owns an approximately 3.5% stake in the company for a value of about $94 billion. That helps explain why his 2025 pay also includes $3.5 million in residential security and consultation fees as well as driver services. Those fees totaled $2.2 million in 2024, according to the filing. Nvidia’s market capitalization has ballooned in recent years as the Santa Clara, California-based firm leads the charge in AI chipmaking. The company’s full-year revenue reached $130.5 billion in the 2025 fiscal year, a 114% jump year-over-year. Its stock price multiplied ninefold between the end of 2022 and the end of 2024. Still, the company has faced headwinds in recent months. Under both President Joe Biden and President Donald Trump, the U.S. has tightened restrictions that limit chip exports to China, thereby limiting Nvidia’s potential market. Nvidia designed its H20 chip, in particular, to comply with U.S. export rules — but those rules became even stricter and barred Nvidia from selling them in China. Huawei, one of China’s biggest tech companies, is getting ready to test powerful, new AI chips that could rival Nvidia’s, according to a report last month. The firm will receive its first shipment of Ascend 910E chips, its most powerful AI semiconductor to date, from manufacturers as soon as the end of May. Huawei has made persistent technological advances in recent years despite U.S. sanctions against it and could threaten Nvidia’s AI chipmaking dominance. Shares of Nvidia were up 2.3% Friday morning but are down 17.4% since the start of the year. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

ByTy Roush ByTy Roush, Forbes Staff. Ty Roush is a breaking news reporter based in New York City. ByTy Roush, Forbes Staff. Ferrari on Tuesday said tariffs imposed by the U.S. pose a potential risk to the luxury car maker’s profitability, becoming the latest company to warn about a hit to earnings or cut financial forecasts as many cite market uncertainty aggravated by President Donald Trump’s levies. Ferrari joins other companies warning about the potential impact of Trump's tariffs. May 6Ferrari noted in its first-quarter financial report the company was subject to a “potential risk” of a 50 basis points reduction to earnings in 2025, as the luxury car maker cited the “introduction of import tariffs on [European] cars” into the U.S. May 5Mattel’s CEO Ynon Kreiz reportedly said “it’s hard to tell where things will land and how the tariff situation will evolve,” and the toy company announced it is pausing its full-year guidance until it “has sufficient visibility, given the volatile macro-economic environment and evolving U.S. tariff situation,” and may raise prices of its toys “where necessary.” May 5Ford announced it expects tariffs to reduce its earnings before interest and taxes by about $1.5 billion in 2025, and said it is suspending its full-year guidance, citing “the potential for industrywide supply chain disruption impacting production” along with “the potential for future or increased tariffs in the U.S.,” potential retaliatory tariffs by other countries and more. May 5Cummins withdrew its forecast for 2025, as CEO Jennifer Rumsey said the truck engine maker faced “growing economic uncertainty driven by tariffs” and as customers endured an “increasingly challenging environment.” May 1Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company expects Trump’s tariffs will cause a $900 million hit to the company’s bottom line during its second quarter, saying it will be “very difficult” to predict beyond June “because I’m not sure what will happen with tariffs,” as Apple’s sales in China dropped below projections. May 1Amazon said in its first quarter earnings report Thursday that its future results are “inherently unpredictable” because of factors including “changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions” and “tariff and trade policies,” the latter of which was a not a reason included in its last quarter report. May 1General Motors, which earlier said it would reassess its financial guidance for 2025 to include the “potential impact of tariffs,” lowered its forecast for earnings to between $10 billion and $12.5 billion, down from $13.7 billion to $15.7 billion, as CEO Mary Barra said the company was adjusting to “the new trade policy environment.” May 1McDonald’s reported a 3.6% decline in U.S. same-store sales through its first quarter in 2025, the largest decrease since an 8.7% dip in 2020, as the fast food giant said consumers were “grappling with uncertainty.” April 30Stellantis suspended its full-year financial guidance for the 2025 fiscal year because of “tariff-related uncertainties,” and noted the company was “highly engaged with policymakers” about tariffs and has “[taken] action to reduce impacts.” April 30Mercedes pulled its full-year outlook for the 2025 fiscal year because the “volatility with regard to tariff policies” had become “too high to reliably assess” the automaker’s business development for the remainder of the year, adding estimates could not be made “with the necessary level of certainty.” April 29UPS pulled its full-year guidance after previously forecasting revenue of $89 billion for 2025, citing the “current macro-economic uncertainty” as the shipping giant also announced it would lay off 20,000 workers by the end of the year. April 29Kraft Heinz CEO Abrams-Rivera said the company had lowered its full-year outlook as the “operating environment remains volatile,” and they would monitor the “potential impacts from macro-economic pressures such as tariffs and inflation.” April 29JetBlue CEO Joanna Geraghty announced the company had pulled its full-year outlook for 2025 because of “macroeconomic uncertainty,” while JetBlue president Marty St. George said the airline expected “softened demand” to continue. April 29Snap declined to issue guidance for its second quarter, as the company behind Snapchat said “uncertainty with respect to how macro economic conditions may evolve in the months ahead” could impact advertising demand. April 29Volvo warned 2025 would be a “challenging and transition year” as a result of “macroeconomic, geopolitical and market developments,” including the effects of tariffs on profits, while pulling its guidance for the year and 2026. April 24PepsiCo lowered its earnings forecast for 2025 as the company expects “more volatility and uncertainty,” CEO Ramon Laguarta said, as PepsiCo said it faces higher supply chain costs because of tariffs, “elevated macroeconomic volatility and a subdued consumer backdrop.” April 24Procter & Gamble, the owner of Tide and Charmin, among others, lowered its sales growth projections for the year despite previously expecting growth up to 4% in 2025, while CEO Jon Moeller warned of a “challenging and volatile consumer and geopolitical environment.” April 24American Airlines CEO Robert Isom told investors the airline was “taking a very cautious, even a negative approach to growth” after pulling its full-year guidance, while CFO Devon May said economic uncertainty worsened by Trump’s tariffs brought “significant weakness in our main cabin demand.” April 24Skechers pulled its full-year outlook while citing “macroeconmic uncertainty stemming from global trade policies,” as CFO John Vandemore likened the economic environment to the pandemic. April 23Thermo Fisher Scientific withdrew its full-year profit forecast while the medical equipment maker expects to take a $400 million hit in sales to China, as Trump’s tariffs would likely raise the cost of parts the company sources in China. April 23Chipotle, which reported same-store sales well below analyst expectations, according to FactSet, lowered its full-year same-store sales growth for the year because the company expects customers to spend less as concerns about the economy became “overwhelming,” CEO Scott Boatwright told investors. April 23Alaska Airlines pulled its full-year 2025 guidance because of “recent economic uncertainty and volatility.” April 23Southwest Airlines, while maintaining some of its projections for its second quarter, withdrew guidance for 2025 in its first-quarter report while citing “macroeconomic uncertainty” that makes it “difficult to forecast given recent and short-lived booking trends.” April 15United Airlines held its full-year forecast, though the company also issued a second guidance featuring far lower earnings in 2025 because United believes the economy is “impossible to predict this year with any degree of confidence.” April 11Logitech withdrew its outlook for its 2026 fiscal year because of the “continuing uncertainty surrounding the tariff environment.” April 9Walmart announced it would pull forecasts for operating income in its upcoming first-quarter report on May 15, as the “range of outcomes” grew as Trump’s tariffs were implemented in trade. April 9Delta, after previously cutting first-quarter earnings projections by 40 to 50 cents a share, pulled its full-year guidance “given the broad macro uncertainty,” as it was “premature to project the full year,” the airline and CEO Ed Bastian said.

Several companies have announced layoffs while citing the impact of Trump’s tariffs. Mack Trucks and Volvo Group told Forbes earlier this month that a combined 800 employees were laid off at facilities on the East Coast, with both automakers citing “market uncertainty,” the likelihood of “possible regulatory changes” and the “impact of tariffs.” Stellantis and Estée Lauder also announced layoffs. Goldman Sachs wrote in a note on April 15 that about 100,000 manufacturing jobs would be created because of Trump’s tariffs, though they would also likely remove up to 500,000 jobs across all industries. Trump levied tariffs across U.S. trade partners during his so-called “Liberation Day” earlier this month. A 90-day pause on the tariffs was announced on April 9, though a baseline 10% would remain, except for China, whose imports face 145% tariffs. The White House said Tuesday that Trump would also offer a reprieve to automakers by exempting them from paying additional tariffs, like those on steel and aluminum. Some industry leaders have said Trump’s tariffs would raise consumer prices and create market volatility, including Ford CEO Jim Farley, who warned Trump’s 25% tariffs on imported cars and car parts would “blow a hole in the U.S. industry that we’ve never seen.” Vice President JD Vance said the Trump administration is trying to “rebalance global trade” as the U.S. carries out tariff negotiations. Vance suggested the U.S. “want[s] to partner with people and countries” to create “a system of global trade that is balanced, one that is open, and one that is stable and fair.” Tariff Layoff Tracker: Mack Truck, Volvo Cut Hundreds Of Jobs As Trump’s Levies Pose ‘Market Uncertainty’ (Forbes) Trump Offers Automakers Tariff Reprieve—Latest Big Tariff Flip-Flop Since ‘Liberation Day’ (Forbes) Correction (5/1): This story has been updated to reflect that McDonald's reported a decline in sales.

Title: Forbes Daily: Amazon Beats Expectations But Warns Of Tariff Impacts

ByDanielle Chemtob andForbes Daily ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. This year has seen the most layoffs since 2020, due in large part to DOGE’s cost-cutting efforts. U.S. employers slashed 105,441 positions in April, which is less than March, but still a year-over-year increase of more than 60%, per a new report from career services firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The government has had the most layoffs of any sector in 2025, though mostly in February and March, and 48% of all job cuts have been either directly or indirectly related to DOGE’s actions. DOGE’s work has supposedly saved taxpayers an estimated $160 billion, according to its website, though it’s a far cry from Elon Musk’s original goal of $2 trillion. Amazon topped estimates for its financial results in the first three months of 2025, but issued weaker-than-expected guidance for the next quarter, citing “tariff and trade policy” among the complicating factors. Amazon and Apple are among the U.S. companies with the biggest exposure to China tariffs, and shares of the retail giant fell more than 4% in after-hours trading. Apple also reported an uptick in iPhone sales in its earnings Thursday, though its China sales and services fell short of expectations. The quarter also doesn’t include the volatile April that saw President Donald Trump unveil his “Liberation Day” tariffs, though the White House has since lowered tariffs on Chinese smartphone imports from 145% to 20%. Khosla Ventures is in talks to lead a $100 million funding round into buzzy drone startup Mach Industries, Forbes has learned, a deal that could value Mach as high as $400 million, one person said. An investment in Mach, founded by Forbes 30 Under 30 alum Ethan Thornton, would be the latest in a string of huge deals for Silicon Valley defense companies that are hoping to secure major Pentagon contracts. President Donald Trump, accompanied by U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, takes a question ... More from a reporter. Hours after reports circulated that national security advisor Mike Waltz would depart his role, President Donald Trump announced he would nominate Waltz for United Nations ambassador and have Secretary of State Marco Rubio serve as interim national security advisor. Some lawmakers had previously called on Waltz to resign after The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg said Waltz added him to a Signal group chat where Waltz and other Trump officials discussed upcoming strikes on Yemen. Trump’s attempts to use the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged gang members hit a roadblock Thursday, as a federal judge issued the first permanent injunction against the administration’s use of the law. The ruling argues the administration is not using the law properly, as it can only be invoked when there is a declared war or an “invasion of predatory incursion” carried out or threatened against the U.S. by a foreign nation. It’s unclear how the government will respond, but it’s possible the case could end up before the Supreme Court. Chinese officials said Friday they are examining purported U.S. efforts to initiate trade talks, signaling a shift in tone by Beijing and prompting a rise in U.S. stock futures and European markets. A Chinese official emphasized that Beijing expects any dialogue or talks to lead to a reversal of Trump’s steep 145% tariffs on Chinese goods and if this is not done it will “further damage trust” between the two sides. In the latest sign that economic unknowns are weighing on the travel sector, Hilton, Hyatt and Wyndham cut their full-year outlooks this week, following in the wake of major airlines. Wyndham CEO Geoff Ballotti told Wall Street analysts that “consumer sentiment resulting from the macro uncertainty” was weighing on the leisure segment. Cheap goods from websites like Temu, Shein and eBay could get more expensive, as the government closes the “de minimis” trade exemption today, which allowed U.S. companies to import packages valued at $800 or less without paying duties or certain taxes. The U.S. Postal Service will reportedly choose whether to charge a 120% tariff on low-priced packages shipped from China and Hong Kong or include a flat fee of $100 per shipment. After multiple delays, travelers will finally need a REAL ID or an alternative form of identification to get through TSA checkpoints starting May 7. If you don’t have a REAL ID—typically marked by a star in the upper right corner, though every state looks different—passengers can also use roughly a dozen other forms of compliant identification, including passports and military IDs. Anyone going to see Marvel Studios’ Thunderbolts* can expect to watch eight—perhaps even 10—movie trailers before the feature begins. That may seem like a drag to an audience, but those are highly valuable minutes to both the movie studios and the theater chains. In an era when theatrical attendance continues to decline—the domestic box office grossed $8.7 billion last year, a dip of more than 3% from 2023, and ticket sales dropped 7%—trailers remain the top driver of awareness and decision-making for most moviegoers. According to National Research Group’s biannual survey, 36% of those between the ages of 12 and 74 say they first heard about the most recent movie they saw in theaters through a trailer, more than any other source. Because Thunderbolts* is the first anticipated blockbuster of the summer movie season—which accounts for 40% of the annual box office total in the U.S. and Canada—its preview space is one of the most important marketing opportunities for the biggest releases. With fierce competition for these theoretically finite slots, there’s another reason for the increased number of trailers—theater chains are selling preview time to the highest bidder. Hollywood’s major studios routinely strike year-long marketing agreements with the three major theater chains—AMC, Regal and Cinemark—to guarantee trailer play in front of the biggest releases. Those deals range from $2 million to $5 million each, proportionate to the size of the chain, and can include other in-theater marketing opportunities such as ads on concession stands or theater marquees. What exactly that money buys, however, is not always clear. Most moviegoers would assume the trailer system would be similar to any other advertising expenditure, but in practice studio executives say it can often feel closer to a bribe. WHY IT MATTERS “With theatrical moviegoing in decline, it’s not hard to imagine why theaters might increase their number of valuable trailer slots—or why studios might pay to fill them,” says Forbes reporter Matt Craig. “But as previews continue to expand to nearly a half-hour, one has to wonder just how much moviegoers are willing to accept.” MORE Why This Film Financing Company Is The Safest Bet In Hollywood Despite the publicity around its immigration enforcement, Trump Administration officials have provided an incomplete picture of the number of deportations since the president took office. While ICE reports deporting fewer people per day than the Biden Administration, in recent weeks, the Department of Homeland Security has started to release new figures that are more than double the ICE data: 660: The average number of people deported per day during Trump’s first 100 days, according to ICE, compared to a daily average of 742 under Biden last year 7,181: The number of people crossing the southern border illegally and being apprehended by Customs and Border Protection last month, compared to 137,473 under Biden in March 2024 “It’s one thing to play politics with politics—it’s another to play politics with the data,” Austin Kocher, an immigration data analyst and researcher at Syracuse University told Forbes Feedback is essential in the workplace, but sometimes the delivery can feel like a personal attack rather than constructive criticism. It’s important not to let such critiques define you, and don’t attach your self-worth to who you are at work. The next time you get unhelpful feedback, reflect on the boundaries you can set with that person so it doesn’t happen again.

Title: Is Amazon Stock A Buy At $190?

Building a platform to do the job of 1 million analysts ByTrefis Team, Contributor. 29 April 2025, Bavaria, Munich: The logo and lettering of the global online mail order company ... More Amazon can be seen under the blue sky on the façade of Amazon Germany's headquarters in Parkstadt Schwabing in Munich (Bavaria) on April 29, 2025. Photo: Matthias Balk/dpa (Photo by Matthias Balk/picture alliance via Getty Images) Amazon stock (NASDAQ: AMZN) declined approximately 3% in after-market trading Thursday following the company’s March quarter results. While the company beat overall sales and earnings expectations, its cloud revenue came in at $29.27 billion, falling short of the anticipated $29.42 billion. Separately, see 1 Metric More Scary Than U.S. Trade Deficit Or Debt. The company’s Q2 outlook presented a mixed picture. Sales forecasts of $161.5 billion slightly exceeded analyst expectations of $161.2 billion, but projected operating income of $15.3 billion fell significantly below the consensus estimate of $17.6 billion. Amazon’s management acknowledged uncertainties around tariffs but reported no current slowdown in demand. Now, if you are looking for an upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. These kinds of diversified investment options may provide a buffer against the volatility that single stocks like Amazon could experience amid economic uncertainties. The moderate stock decline occurs against a backdrop of increasing economic challenges. The U.S. economy contracted in Q1 2025, and President Trump’s recently implemented tariffs on key trading partners raise inflation concerns. In an environment of slowing economic growth, these pressures could lead companies to cut costs, potentially impacting cloud spending. This would negatively affect AWS, Amazon's most profitable business segment. Furthermore, a significant portion of products sold on Amazon's marketplace are sourced from China. The implementation of higher tariffs would likely force Amazon and its third-party sellers to raise prices for consumers. This price inflation could dampen consumer purchasing power and overall demand, potentially impacting Amazon's core e-commerce revenue. While Amazon has a diversified supply chain, the scale of Chinese imports makes the company particularly vulnerable to escalating trade tensions. Despite these challenges, AMZN stock currently trades at 3.1x trailing revenues, in line with its four-year average P/S ratio of 3.2x. However, the growing AWS business is improving Amazon's overall profitability, suggesting the stock deserves a higher valuation multiple than its historical average. With the stock now down over 20% from February highs, we believe tariff-related risks are somewhat priced in. We consider AMZN a strong long-term investment opportunity at prices around $190. Still, investing in a single stock like AMZN can be risky. On the other hand, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index, less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Meta (META) plans to boost its spending on AI. That didn't cool enthusiasm for the social media giant's stock. Shares of the Facebook parent surged more than 4% to just over $572 Thursday after the social media giant a day earlier eported better-than-expected quarterly results and pointed to growth in advertising—which accounts for the bulk of Meta's revenue—aided by its investments in AI. The reaction marks a departure from the same time last year, when shares had tumbled after Meta said it planned to spend more on AI, amid worries about whether the spending would be justified. “AI has already made us better at targeting and finding the audiences that will be interested in their products than many businesses are themselves, and that keeps improving,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors during Wednesday’s earnings call. People are spending more time on Meta’s apps as a result of improvements to its recommendation systems, Zuckerberg said, with users now spending 7% more time on Facebook. Instagram saw a 6% jump. Time on Threads—which launched in 2023—jumped 35% as users also grew. Analysts—including those from Citi, JPMorgan, Wedbush, and Jefferies—raised their price targets for the stock Thursday, pointing to Meta's engagement and targeting gains. Analysts from Bank of America bumped their target to $690 from $640, citing Meta's “tangible business results” from AI. Morgan Stanley analysts, who raised their target to $650 from $615 said Meta’s “best in class and still improving ad product and relative [return on investment] are delivering results.” “Even with our significant investments, we don't need to succeed in all of these areas to have a good ROI," Zuckerberg said during Wednesday call. “But if we do, then I think that we will be wildly happy with the investments that we are making.”

Title: Spotify was great at helping you discover new music. Then the staff cuts began.

Time Published: 2025-05-02T08:10:01Z

Spotify cut costs to turn a profit. Now subscribers are being flooded with music they hate. The music app I've been using for the last 14 years recently decided that I'm obsessed with rainstorms. When I last listened to my Spotify Release Radar playlist — which for years reliably curated a decent selection of newly released music informed by my favorite artists — the lineup quickly took a turn for the worse. After new songs by familiar indie pop names like Japanese Breakfast and The Marias, there was a five-minute recording of rain falling followed by a short, ambient instrumental by a little-known alternative rock artist. Then, for its remaining 25 tracks, my playlist delivered a succession of rainstorms, nature sounds, and brown-noise frequencies — not exactly the stuff of a killer music festival lineup. When Spotify launched Release Radar in 2016, it promised "a weekly selection of the newest releases that matter the most to you." Not only was the feature designed to delight music fans upon first listen, but it would get better over time, the company promised. So why, nearly a decade later, was my latest Release Radar delivering 85% noise? Sure, my girlfriend and I had recently started listening to "sleep sounds" — things like ocean waves and the hum of an airplane's engine — at night, but that didn't fully explain the issue. The algorithm hadn't made such a crucial curation error before. I'm hardly the first Spotify subscriber to notice that the gears of its music recommendation engine have gotten rusty. Over the past year, fans have taken to Reddit, LinkedIn, and other platforms to complain that curated, for you playlists like Release Radar, Discover Weekly, and Daily Mix have gone downhill, resulting in what many describe as an "echo chamber" that feels more repetitive or off the mark than it once did. Random tracks from white-noise playlists or kids' music albums are popping up where they don't belong, ruining the listening experience. Molly Holder, Spotify's senior director of product for personalization, disagreed that the quality of these curated playlists has declined. "People are discovering more new music and spending more time doing so," she said in a statement, adding that the company listens to user feedback, continues to enhance personal recommendations, and that listener engagement metrics are up. But after talking with former Spotify employees, it seems likely that a combination of layoffs and shifting business priorities has hollowed out the platform's music discovery product. Essentially, in a quest for profitability, Spotify broke its algorithm. One of the features that set Spotify apart from its intensifying competition over the years was the platform's man-meets-machine approach to music curation, especially its personalized, algorithmically curated playlists. Discover Weekly promised to introduce listeners to new music that they might like, Daily Mix turned their tastes into themed playlists, and Release Radar highlighted freshly released tracks. For years, these features seemed to elicit near-universal praise online and gave Spotify a competitive advantage just in time to fend off competition from giants like Apple and Amazon. The music discovery features are likely one reason it's been able to lead the global music subscription market. A recent EMARKETER report found that Americans spend over nine times as much time on Spotify as the next closest competitor. Lately, though, those same features have inspired frustration. For many, Discover Weekly has gotten worse at delivering songs that align with their musical tastes, sometimes including songs they've already listened to on Spotify. Other users report that Release Radar misses new releases from artists they like or mistakenly includes tracks that came out weeks earlier. Release Radar has also started including less relevant music from what one Reddit user described as "random artists with under 50k listens" that seemed to come out of nowhere, while others bemoan the inclusion of what sounds like "AI garbage." The most audible groan of disapproval came with the arrival of Spotify Wrapped last year. While the personalized year-end recap playlist had historically sparked a tsunami of positive online buzz each year, the 2024 edition prompted a far more mixed reaction. Listeners said it lacked personality and interesting insights into their music habits. Jeffrey Smith, a self-described "Spotify diehard" who leads marketing for the online music marketplace Discogs, has become so frustrated by the platform's declining music discovery feature that he's considering switching to Apple Music. "Over the last couple of years, Spotify has met my needs less and less," Smith said. "It's not really reflective of my listening behavior as much as it is reflective of what they want me to listen to. It's just a listening machine at this point, not a music platform." Smith's affinity for Spotify started fading when he noticed one song — "Back on 74" by Jungle — kept popping up on his personalized Spotify playlists. While it's possible that he had checked the song out at some point, it wasn't something he enjoyed or actively listened to. Still, the song made its way from one personalized music recommendation feature to another and even started inspiring Spotify's algorithms to play similar songs. "It just continued until I finally said, 'I can't take it,'" Smith said. As a music obsessive working at a major marketplace for vinyl records, Smith has no shortage of sources of quality music recommendations. But the days of Spotify augmenting his organic music discovery appear to be over. If he keeps his Spotify subscription at all, he says it will be for the podcasts and audiobooks the company has added to its premium tier. I've found myself in a similar conundrum. After largely dismissing the 2015 launch of Apple Music as a then-satisfied Spotify subscriber, I recently decided to give Apple's music service another try. Since its debut, Apple Music has prioritized human editors over algorithms for music curation. Where it does use data-driven personalization, the results are pretty solid, and crucially, free of rainstorms. While Spotify's new audiobook library makes it tempting to stay, its playlists no longer feel like the best in the business. Once my free trial of Apple Music is over, I'm planning to make the switch. Music subscription services like Spotify spend an extraordinary amount of money — last year, the company said it spent $10 billion — to license their massive music catalogs from record labels, publishers, and other rightsholders. These high costs make it more challenging to turn an enduring profit, something Spotify only managed to do for the first time in 2024. From Wall Street's perspective, Spotify is killing it as year-over-year metrics like subscribers and revenue continue to grow. But in the quest to please investors, some ex-Spotify employees think it has abandoned too much of the human element that makes music and the culture around it so special. Doug Ford was a Spotify executive who oversaw editorial playlist curation from 2013 to 2018. He arrived via Spotify's acquisition of Tunigo, a Swedish company that specialized in expert-curated music playlists based on different genres and moods. The next year, Spotify acquired Echo Nest, a music data startup founded by MIT grads that used a mix of machine learning and data filtering to build Pandora-style music recommendation algorithms. Both teams built out Spotify's man-meets-machine music discovery system, which helped the company successfully weather new competition from tech giants like Apple and Amazon as it started to explore the possibility of going public. "That was a really beautiful moment in Spotify's history," Ford said. "That mix of the intentional algorithmic and human curation to make a really deep product was great." The results spoke for themselves. Spotify said the 2015 launch of Discover Weekly yielded 1.7 billion streams in its first five months and generated a weekly wave of social media buzz when listeners' Discover Weekly playlists were refreshed. "Our goal with Discover Weekly was to make something that felt like a friend or someone who knew you well was making you a mixtape," Spotify's product lead at the time, Matt Ogle, told me in an interview. To accomplish that feeling, the algorithm drew heavily from how real flesh-and-blood music enthusiasts were curating playlists on the platform. "That's why that thing was so good," Ford said. "It was taking all the inputs equally and letting things happen normally with the audience. Now it feels a little bit different." Ford said things started changing in the lead-up to Spotify's 2018 initial public offering and the ensuing pressure to prove to investors that profitability was possible in the notoriously tight-margined music streaming business. "The culture changed because it had to become a business," Ford said. "You need to be a successful business in order to offer this utility to people. But they've discarded some of the human aspects of it, for sure." One way the company shifted was by finding cheaper content to use. As the journalist Liz Pelly outlines in her book "Mood Machine," Spotify's pre-IPO years saw an increasing reliance on what is known internally as "perfect fit content," a euphemism for cheaper-to-license audio and mood-specific stock music that is optimized for longer listening sessions. As more listeners turned to streaming services like Spotify for "chill vibes" playlists and background music for studying, the company realized it could save money on royalty costs by populating those playlists with the cheap stuff. That would certainly explain the astonishing number of rainstorm audio tracks being released in a given week. Ford watched with dismay as the platform became flooded with generic mood music. Around the same time, he said, respected colleagues started leaving the company. After what he describes as "a particularly bad stretch" of feeling frustrated by what he saw as a dramatic culture shift, Ford accepted an offer from YouTube to lead content for its music subscription service in 2018. In the years since, Spotify's music programming strategy has only skewed more heavily toward automation. Pelly writes that by late 2023, the number of Spotify employees working on editorial music curation (about 200 people globally) was less than one-third the size of the team focused on algorithmic curation and personalization, according to an internal org chart. Notably, that head count was before Spotify laid off 17% of its total workforce in December 2023, a drastic cost-cutting measure that CEO Daniel Ek later admitted "did disrupt our day-to-day operations more than we anticipated." Holder said that there are now over 130 employees working on editorial music curation. One of the more palpable victims of Spotify's 2023 cuts was Glenn McDonald, the company's data alchemist (his real job title), who came from the original Echo Nest team and designed and built much of the original data infrastructure and algorithms powering Spotify's music recommendation engine. He designed the system that identifies a song's genre, which was crucial to effectively sort and recommend music and understand listeners' tastes. "The genre system was human-guided," McDonald said. "After they laid me off, they replaced it with a system that is not human-guided. It's just machine learning. It looks at patterns of words in the titles and descriptions of playlists. That's objectively worse." McDonald said the ripple effects of this change could be felt across Spotify's listening experience. Music was often misclassified, like when Swedish folk-metal bands were suddenly lumped in with all other folk artists. He said it took Spotify engineers a year to fully deactivate and replace the genre system he built, according to data output from the company's public API. One of the many data-filtering tools he built during his tenure at the company was a set of filters designed to fine-tune the music recommendations presented by Discover Weekly and Release Radar — and crucially, prevent things like nature sounds and ambient noise frequencies from showing up where they don't belong. "They would have been flagged as anomalies on those dashboards, and I would have followed up with the teams in charge of those recommendations," McDonald explained. "Without those dashboards, probably nobody is even watching for these issues." Holder said that Spotify's approach to classifying genres and subgenres has "evolved" from the legacy system built by McDonald and other Echo Nest engineers, but declined to get into technical specifics of how it works now or what advantages the new system introduces. "We're always laser-focused on continually enhancing personalized recommendations," she said. Recent updates include improvements to genre accuracy and Discover Weekly recommendations, she added. Ford said the changes at Spotify are part of a broader industry shift away from costlier human curation. "There's been a tradeoff in favor of high metrics, long listening sessions, and music that's just 'good enough,'" he said. "It's happening everywhere." The result is what Ford calls a "rampant wave of algorithmic fatigue" among listeners, who are clamoring for more meaningful cultural experiences as online platforms become increasingly hyper-automated. While the occasional bug and ongoing iteration are to be expected in any product, some longtime subscribers find it odd that Spotify would need to fix or enhance features that worked so well in the first place. My Release Radar delivering mostly white noise and rainstorms, for instance, feels like a fundamental failure of what that feature used to do so well. Over the course of reporting and writing this story over the last few weeks, I've checked back with my Release Radar. Each week, it has a few new songs, but it's still mostly rainstorms.

Title: The 30s (in the weather and the polls), K.M.’s investment meetings, the high-profile guest from the Emirates, and the BOAK contract signings

Full Content:
– Hello, happy new month and enjoy the break to those of you who are in the middle of a long weekend — it looks like there are quite a few of you. Besides, the weather’s improving a lot starting tomorrow, and next week we’re heading for proper summer heat. I mention it because my source at M.M. jokingly said yesterday: “Let the temperature hit the 30s, so we can hit the 30s in the polls too.” Before I get into current affairs, let me make a quick — and timely — comment triggered by the violent incidents at the Law School, where some thugs attacked professors and students in a lecture hall. I heard Chrysochoidis on TV yesterday say that since 2021 there’s been a law requiring university administrations to control who comes in and out of campuses, but it’s just not being enforced. So now I ask, seriously — who enforces the laws (or doesn’t)? The government, or… my uncle? So basically, what we’ve got is that no one is really pushing rectors to do their jobs (most of them, anyway), and the government still doesn’t seem interested in putting an end to this outrageous, globally unheard-of situation that I’m struggling to find happening anywhere else! K.M – Investors – So, moving on to other current matters, yesterday was quite a productive day for M.M. since K.M. went in the morning to meet with the heads of CVC at a conference held in Athens. This major American fund used to hold its annual gathering in a different country each year, but last year they went nuts over Athens and the Four Seasons in Vouliagmeni — so they came back again this year. Now, I don’t know exactly what was discussed with Mitsotakis, but CVC does have business interests in Greece and continues to be very bullish on investing here. Livanios – Papastergiou – Yesterday, there was a meeting at M.M. ahead of the announcement of the citizen-led evaluation of public services, which kicks off next week. Present at the meeting were Theodoros Livanios and Dimitris Papastergiou, the two ministers responsible for unveiling the evaluation platform next Tuesday. There’s a chance Kyriakos Mitsotakis will attend the press event himself, as he wanted a technical briefing on the system’s readiness. The government sees this evaluation as a major “poll” on how citizens view public services — and clearly as a “magnifying glass” on the problems. Meetings between the Sultan and Government/Business Figures – Today, K.M. will continue his meetings with major foreign investment players as he’s scheduled to meet at M.M. with Al Jaber, the UAE’s Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology — and as you know, the Emirates have large-scale investments in Greece (TERNA Energy, HHG). Sultan bin Ahmed Al Jaber, Chairman of Masdar, CEO of ADNOC Group, and Executive Chairman of XRG — and Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology of the UAE — is expected to meet not only the Prime Minister but also Deputy PM Kostis Hatzidakis. Two months ago, K. Mitsotakis visited Abu Dhabi as part of efforts to deepen the strategic bilateral ties established in 2020, which were followed in 2022 by the Strategic Investment Cooperation Agreement between the Hellenic Development Bank of Investments and ADQ, the UAE’s sovereign fund. Later today, Sultan bin Ahmed Al Jaber will visit the HQ of TERNA Energy, which is now part of the Masdar Group, accompanied by Mohamed Jameel Al Ramahi, CEO of the UAE energy giant. Masdar, which finalized its €3.2 billion acquisition of 100% of TERNA Energy just weeks ago — one of the largest renewables deals in Europe — plans to build a massive 10 GW portfolio across Greece and abroad by 2030. The Arab company will provide funding and international expertise to boost TERNA Energy’s growth and help it meet the target of 6 GW of installed renewable capacity by 2029. Also on the agenda are one-on-one meetings at a central Athens hotel with several ministers and Greek entrepreneurs. Presentation on Juvenile Violence – Next Monday morning, the postponed presentation of the National Strategy for the prevention of violence and juvenile delinquency will take place at M.M. The plan has been put together by Skertsos’ team along with a team of experts led by Professor Vasso Artinopoulou. Right after the presentation, a press conference will be held at the General Secretariat of Information by the relevant ministers to present the new policies and measures of the national strategy, with a horizon extending to 2030. Kostis Staying Put – Elections may still be a ways off, but the creative scenarios have already started flying — about constituencies and such. Some say that Kostis Hatzidakis won’t run in the Northern Sector of Athens B and will instead go on the ND’s national party list. However, I spoke with the Deputy Prime Minister himself, who flat-out denies this and confirms he’s staying in the North, where he was (by far) the top vote-getter in both 2023 and 2019. Leventopaido Aristo, step inside the shop and shut it down – On April 29, the Hellenic Capital Market Commission announced the imposition of fines on four companies for violating paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 9 of decision 1/506/8.4.2009 of the Commission, due to the late submission of their external auditors’ reports on the adequacy and effectiveness of procedures to prevent money laundering. In plain Greek: the companies were fined for missing deadlines and compliance steps to prevent money laundering. One of them — which got the largest fine — was “OPENFUND AEDAKES.” The representative of OPENFUND is Aristidis (Aristos) Doxiadis, a social scientist and economist, Vice President of the National Council for Research and Innovation, and for exactly 32 hours, Deputy Minister of Innovation. For a Harvard graduate — whose motto, by the way, is the Latin word for “truth” — Aristo Doxiadis hasn’t been doing so hot lately. First, he forgot some debts to the state, and now he’s missed the anti-money-laundering deadlines too. Executive Moves – Nikolas Valantasis has joined the investment banking division of Euroxx. The market knows him from his last role as Deputy CEO of the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund, but before the HFSF, Valantasis had a 20-year career both in Greece and abroad with Mckinsey, Citigroup, Eurobank, and Barclays. BOAK Contract Signings – Next week — barring any surprises — the contracts for the Northern Road Axis of Crete (BOAK) project are expected to be signed, specifically for the Chania–Heraklion section. The budget is €2 billion, and with the other two sections included, the total budget reaches €4.5 billion. It’s a construction-concession project with complex requirements, as construction and operation will happen simultaneously. Generally, the most interesting business developments will begin once the contract is signed. Qualco Knocks on the Stock Exchange Door – The increased market volatility didn’t faze Orestis Tsakalotos, and Qualco is preparing to enter the Athens Stock Exchange in the first half of May. The company, which provides tech solutions for the credit sector, has a 25-year history and a presence in 30 countries across Europe and the Middle East. Through its public offering for the main market listing, it aims to raise up to €70 million, mostly to fund acquisitions. The Stock Market Climbs the Wall of Worry – After the three-day sell-off triggered by Trump’s tariffs in early April, it was hard to imagine that the month would end with a positive outcome for the Athens Stock Exchange. The General Index hit its lowest point (1,455 points) on April 7, falling at least 200 points from the March close (1,685 points). However, the comeback came soon after, with some ups and downs, but also several daily “leaps” that brought the General Index back to the 1,700-point range. This marked the sixth consecutive month of growth, a streak not seen since the profitable seven-month period between January and July of 2019. If the market moves contrary to the famous stock market saying “sell in May and go away” and especially against the worsened macroeconomic data from the U.S. economy, the aforementioned rally might be leveled out. In large part, the course of the Athens Stock Exchange will be determined by foreign trends, although May has certain milestones of Greek interest, such as bank results, which – according to market information and estimates – will show stability, as the reduction in euro interest rates was accompanied by an increase in lending – mainly to businesses but also individuals. We also have the Fitch rating on the 16th of the month and the Scope rating on May 30. Nevertheless, most analysts believe that the 1,750-point mark is hard to surpass unless there are significant economic and business events. This is why the last few sessions have been characterized by caution and rushed moves. Yesterday, only the stock exchanges of London and New York were open due to May Day, with relatively low trading volumes. Which Stocks Played Defense – Despite the aftershocks from the contraction of the U.S. GDP, some “heavy hitters” played defense, staying on an upward trajectory and even setting new records. First and foremost, Coca-Cola HBC closed above €45 for the first time ever, propelled by the strong Q1 results. The rise for OPAP and OTE was “quiet,” but enough to push them to 16-year and 3-year highs, respectively. Sarantis hit a 7-year record, trading today without the right to the €0.299 dividend per share. Meanwhile, buyers continued to place bets on the stocks of the two port authorities. Piraeus Port is very close to breaking the €40 mark, while Thessaloniki Port finished Wednesday’s session at its highest point in 17 years. The First by Spyros Theodoropoulos – The president of SEV, Spyros Theodoropoulos, is reintroducing the institution of regular press conferences to “communicate” the views of employers representing a capital of €416 billion and declaring taxable profits of €14 billion. Next Wednesday, SEV will hold its first press conference at its headquarters on Xenofontos Street. Already, the initiative of SEV’s President to unite and activate entrepreneurs in the broader “defense” sector led to the first productive meeting with the Prime Minister and government officials. Tête-à-Tête Between Theodorikakos and Supermarket Owners – The two-month extension of the regime with the cap on profit margins, which the government decided on Wednesday, shows its willingness to end this measure. Minister Theodorikakos promised the Prime Minister a new, more modern framework for price control (a bill is being prepared) and stricter enforcement of anti-profiteering fines. Before making this decision, the Minister of Development met with representatives of the Food Industry, and today, Friday, he will meet with supermarket owners. The cap is coming to an end. But not today. From summer… The Headaches of the German Debt Agency – The German public debt does not exceed 63% of GDP, but the new ambitious defense program of the Merz government will require increased borrowing. The German Debt Agency (Deutsche Finanzagentur DFA) plans to issue 50-year bonds for the first time, and has already announced the issuance of 30-year bonds worth €26 billion for 2025, along with other 20-year and 10-year Bunds. Recently, the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) boldly issued a further 100-year bond to cover its needs, and the markets responded with an interest rate below 2%. The discussion around a 50-year Bund (government bond) – following in the footsteps of France – has already raised yields on euro swaps. The difference between the 50-year and 30-year German SWAP has risen sharply to a new multi-year high. The Discussion on Elon Musk’s Departure from TESLA – Everything started from a report by the Wall Street Journal, which stated that “tensions had increased” at Tesla when the board started looking for a successor to Elon Musk. Tesla officially and categorically denied the rumors about Musk stepping down as CEO. The company’s chairperson, Robyn Denholm, stated that there had been no contact with headhunters for a replacement, despite rumors that the board had considered this possibility due to concerns about the time Musk is dedicating to his governmental duties. Since mid-December 2024, the stock price has fallen by around -48% from the historic high of $488.54, and so far in 2025, it has recorded a decline of around -40%. Today, at $283, Tesla is worth about $908 billion, having quintupled its market value in the last 5 years. Musk denies that he will resign from the ambitious DOGE plan, while some analysts believe a “graceful exit” to the chairmanship of the Board of Directors could be a possibility. Mark Zuckerberg’s Promises to Facebook Shareholders – Microsoft and Meta Platforms announced great results for Q1 2025, but times on Wall Street have changed. Analysts no longer focus on the past but primarily on the future, particularly capital expenditures related to artificial intelligence projects. Microsoft reported capital expenditures of $16.7 billion in Q1. Meta, Mark Zuckerberg’s company, stated it would invest between $64 and $72 billion in capex annually. Interestingly, CEO Mark Zuckerberg began his presentation to analysts with a promise of future returns on all this capital investment in 5 key areas: “Improved advertising, more attractive experiences, business messaging, new Meta AI devices, and more Artificial Intelligence. These are long-term investments to create top-tier AI models and infrastructures. Even with our significant investments, we don’t need to succeed in all these areas to have a good return on investment (ROI).” “The pace of progress across the industry and the opportunities ahead of us are overwhelming.” A Crazy Year for the World’s Largest Stock Exchange – When markets don’t know where they’re heading, when data changes day by day, indexes even at the most “solid” stock exchanges rise and fall like a trampoline. In ¼ of this year’s stock exchange sessions, the S&P 500 in New York has experienced an intra-session change of more than +/- 2%. This phenomenon has occurred at least once a week so far. According to Bloomberg, April appears to be the third most volatile month on record, following October 2008 and March 2020 in the U.S. stock market. In this backdrop of constant volatility, gold appears as a safe harbor. That’s why it continues to make history. Gold prices have outperformed the S&P 500 by 32.6 percentage points since the beginning of the year. This is the largest deviation since 1975, even greater than during the pandemic crisis in 2020. Gold prices have risen by +26.5%, while the S&P 500 index has fallen by -6.1% so far this year. Since the lows of October 2022, gold prices have returned +102%, almost double the gain of +54% from the S&P 500. Explore related questions

Here, Reuters intentionally misleads the public into believing that President Trump’s policies are leading to 20,000 layoffs at UPS: April 29 (Reuters) - United Parcel Service said on Tuesday it would slash 20,000 jobs and shut 73 facilities as part of a planned reduction in deliveries for Amazon.com, and amid U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs that are roiling global trade. This couldn’t be further from the truth. The layoffs are occurring because UPS and Amazon are greatly reducing shipping volume (50%) from Amazon: A UPS (UPS.N), opens new tab spokesperson said the layoffs are due to shedding 50% of shipping volume from Amazon.com (AMZN.O), opens new tab, its largest customer, as well as ongoing cost-cutting and efficiency projects under a major operational restructuring. My guess is that UPS was losing its shorts on this deal, and cuts have been in the works for a long time. The media and other Democrats are also blaming Trump’s tariff policies for causing a negative print on GDP but, of course, they aren’t telling the public the details of what caused the decline. The trade deficit has been deteriorating for decades, and in the first quarter the deficit hit a record high that shaved a “whopping” 4.8% off growth. The media and other Democrats oppose all of Trump’s efforts to correct this long-term disaster. For four years, the Biden administration spent and printed massive amounts of money jacking up federal spending. This spending and borrowing masked a deteriorating private sector. In the first quarter, federal spending went down 5.1%, which reduced GDP growth by .3%. So, without those two components GDP would have been exceptionally strong at over 5%. The media can’t allow the public to see the truth. As Trump has announced trillions in private investments, the media and other Democrats are repeating the talking points (lies) that companies and countries are scared to invest in America because of Trump’s policies. But here is what investments actually did in the first quarter according to Google AI: investments soared (but the public can’t be allowed to see the truth). In the first quarter of 2025, business investment increased by 21.9% compared to the previous quarter. This increase followed a 5.6% decline in the fourth quarter. Nonresidential investment was up 9.8% in the quarter, with a 22.5% increase in equipment spending. Before and after the election, the media told the public that inflation would soar because of tariffs, and most Americans believe it. But commodity prices are falling, in many cases rapidly: World Bank sees commodity prices falling to pre-COVID level World Bank: Commodity prices to fall 12% in 2025, 5% in 2026 Falling commodity prices could moderate inflation risks from rising trade barriers-World Bank World Bank report forecasts Brent crude at $64/barrel in 2025 vs $81 in 2024 Crude oil, for example, is down over 25% since January, and crude oil and energy prices essentially affect everything. So, what happened the last time commodity prices were this low? Trump was president Inflation was lower than 2% Real wages were rising rapidly for all races, especially for those at the bottom. And the media and other Democrats were opposing Trump’s policies at every turn and continually trying to impeach him. In other words, they haven’t changed. Results don’t matter. When is Jerome Powell going to pay attention to facts that commodity prices are actively falling, instead of predictions? Powell seems to have been unable to analyze the causes of the higher inflation that marked the Biden years, but somehow has an ability to recognize what substantially lower energy and other prices do to inflation. Two-year, five-year, and ten-year bond rates are all substantially lower than what the Federal Reserve is paying banks for one-day rates. They are losing billions because of this ridiculous policy that appears meant to hurt Trump. It certainly would make buying a house more unaffordable if they sensibly reduced rates. A favorite word of the media and other Democrats these last few months has been “chaos” — but they didn’t use the term during four years of unprecedented chaos under Biden-Harris. They told Americans Biden had returned America to normalcy. Here are some examples of what chaos looks like: An open border which floods cities and states with millions of unvetted people including terrorists and gang members. Cartels getting rich off of trafficking millions of people, especially children for sex. Schools and businesses being closed by things Fauci said, not science. Firing people for choosing not to take a vaccine. High inflation. Running up massive debt during a period of supposed good growth. The Afghanistan withdrawal. The reignition of the Russo-Ukrainian war. Hamstringing Israel from obliterating the terrorists of Hamas. Terrorists attacking ships in the Red Sea. Building up Iran as it seeks to build nuclear weapons and makes “Death to Israel” and “Death to America” a primary focus. Seeking to destroy energy sources. Using the Justice Department to go after parents who oppose pornography in schools, Catholics, and peaceful pro-life supporters. Having unelected bureaucrats run the government and sign documents because Biden was incompetent. Making women compete and share locker room space with men. Here is a sample of what chaos doesn’t look like: Enforcing the border and deporting illegals. Bringing investments and manufacturing back. Getting control of the bloated federal government. Getting the price of energy down. Image: Free image, Pixabay license.

Title: Customer First, Agentic AI Next. Amazon Lays Out Its 2025 Road Map

Most earnings announcements and ensuing analyst calls are spent discussing all the money — or lack of it — the host company made during the previous quarter. Not so at Amazon on Thursday (May 1). It spent most of its first-quarter earnings call talking less about the dollars it made and more about how it intends to keep winning the battle for the consumer’s trust. It sounded its traditional theme of the customer experience early and often. So far, anyway, that customer is proving to be fairly resilient. By the numbers, revenue rose 10% from a year earlier to $155.7 billion, with worldwide paid units up 8%, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky told analysts. Still, executives struck a cautious note about spending patterns. Deal events such as the Big Spring Sale and Ramadan promotions “helped customers save over $500 million,” CEO Andy Jassy said, adding that price sensitivity is elevated “with this being an uncertain moment for consumers.” Everyday Essentials — groceries, household staples and the like — grew more than twice as fast as the rest of the mix and now make up 1 of every 3 U.S. units sold, a sign that shoppers remain value-focused even as they keep clicking “buy.” For the current quarter, Amazon forecasts net sales of $159 billion to $164 billion and operating income of $13 billion to $17.5 billion, a bounce of between 7% and 11%. The wide range, Olsavsky noted, “reflects the complex external environment,” including tariffs and a seasonal jump in stock-based compensation. Pressed repeatedly on the potential for higher tariffs, Jassy said demand had not yet softened. If anything, he said, Amazon has seen “heightened buying in certain categories that may indicate stocking up in advance of any potential tariff impact.” The company pulled forward inventory in the first quarter, while many marketplace merchants accelerated shipments to U.S. warehouses, a tactic aimed at insulating customers from price spikes. Amazon’s risk, he argued, is muted relative to rivals. Many traditional retailers buy from middlemen who themselves import from China, “so the total tariff will be higher for these retailers than for China-direct sellers” on Amazon’s platform, Jassy said. With more than 2 million global sellers and “hundreds of millions of unique SKUs,” Jassy expects that breadth to cushion any sudden shifts in sourcing or consumer tastes. “When there are uncertain environments, customers tend to choose the provider they trust most,” he said. Behind the scenes, Amazon is pushing through the next wave of efficiency projects that helped power its recent margin rebound. Rearchitecting the inbound freight network to align with the regional fulfillment model “drove productivity in our fulfillment and transportation network,” Olsavsky said, allowing record one-day and same-day delivery volumes while holding down per-package costs. Excluding one-time charges tied to returned merchandise and early tariff buys, first-quarter operating margins would have been 7.2% in North America and 3.7% internationally. Looking ahead, Amazon will “build out same-day delivery sites, expand our rural delivery network, and add robotics and automation,” Olsavsky said, noting that the investments designed to protect profitability even if consumer demand slows. Much of the call’s second half shifted from logistics to artificial intelligence. Jassy called the technology a once-in-a-generation platform shift and said Amazon Web Services already commands a “multibillion-dollar annual revenue run rate” in generative AI services, growing triple-digit percentages despite capacity constraints. To satisfy developers, AWS has layered its Bedrock service with models from Anthropic, Meta, Mistral and Amazon’s in-house Titan family, positioning the cloud division as what Jassy called the “infrastructure for agentic AI.” The most visible proof point is Alexa. A new version, free to Prime members or $19.99 a month for others, is rolling out to more than half a billion installed devices. Unlike earlier voice assistants that merely answered questions, the upgraded Alexa can orchestrate complex routines, Jassy said. “You can say, ‘Open the shades, raise the temperature five degrees and pick dinner music,’ and she just does it. … It really is like having a great personal assistant, which most people in the world don’t have.” Early user feedback, he added, has been “very positive.” Amazon’s playbook for 2025 looks familiar: lean harder into price, speed and selection while pouring capital into technologies — particularly AI — that can widen those same moats. Whether tariffs tighten or the consumer softens, executives argue that the company’s diversified supplier base, sprawling fulfillment network and fast-growing advertising and cloud franchises give it unusual flexibility. As Jassy summed up, “We have emerged from past periods of uncertainty with more relative market segment share than we started — and I’m optimistic this could happen again.” Customer First, Agentic AI Next.

The gross GST Collections for April 2025 have scaled a new high of Rs. 2.37 lakh crores, against the previous high of INR 2.10 lakh crores in April 2024. The growth in GST collections for April is expected since GST on transactions during March, which is the last month of the fiscal year, is payable in April. Due to significant number of year end transactions which take place in March, traditionally, GST collections for April are significantly higher. However, specifically for April 2025, another indicator, which led to anticipation of significantly high GST collections was the 20.2% growth in generation of e-way bills in March 2025, as per data in the monthly economic review for March 2025 released by the Department of Economic Affairs. This is since increase in e-way bills generation is typically correlated with higher economic activity and consequently, higher GST collections.

Regards Viral Shah, IIFL The Bank of Japan (BOJ) kept interest rates steady on Thursday and sharply lowered its growth forecasts, signaling prolonged caution due to the uncertain global trade environment. With concerns over U.S. tariffs and weak exports weighing on sentiment, the BOJ suggested that conditions for future rate hikes may take time to materialize. As a result, the yen weakened to a four-week low, with the dollar climbing 1.7% to 145.45 yen, buoyed by renewed optimism surrounding potential trade agreements between the U.S. and its partners. Meanwhile, in the U.S., manufacturing remained under pressure, contracting for the second consecutive month in April. The ISM Manufacturing PMI fell to 48.7—its lowest in five months—from 49.0 in March. Tariff-related disruptions to supply chains pushed up input costs, forcing some firms to cut jobs, even as overall layoffs announced by employers declined. On the diplomatic front, a Chinese state media outlet reported that the U.S. had reached out to Beijing through multiple channels to resume talks and defuse the ongoing tariff dispute. The outreach hints at a potential thaw in the standoff that has rattled global markets. In China’s property sector, the average resale home price across 100 cities dropped by 0.7% MoM in April, as more inventory entered the market, intensifying competition. YoY, resale home prices plunged 7.2%. In contrast, new home prices rose by 2.5% over the same period, underlining a divergence in market trends. South Korea offered a mixed picture, with exports showing surprising resilience despite external headwinds. Driven by robust semiconductor demand, exports rose 3.7% year-on-year in April to $58.21 billion—the fastest pace in four months. However, signs of strain emerged in the automotive sector, which has started to feel the heat of rising global trade tensions. On the domestic front, Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections hit an all-time high of Rs 2.37 lakh crore, rising 12.6% year-on-year Domestic GST collections grew 10.7% to Rs 1.9 lakh crore, while revenue from imports surged 20.8% to Rs 46,913 crore. Net GST revenue stood at over Rs 2.09 lakh crore, up 9.1% year-on-year, reflecting strong economic momentum and fiscal year-end reconciliations. India’s external sector also reached a milestone, with total exports of goods and services touching a historic high of $825 billion in FY25. This was largely fueled by a record $386.5 billion in services exports. In March alone, services exports jumped 18.6% to \$35.6 billion, defying global trade headwinds. On the inflation front, retail price pressures eased for rural India. Inflation for farm workers dropped to 3.73% in March 2025, down from 4.05% in February. Similarly, inflation for rural workers eased to 3.86%, compared to 4.10% a month earlier, as per official data—offering relief to households in the hinterlands.

On the diplomatic front, a Chinese state media outlet reported that the U.S. had reached out to Beijing through multiple channels to resume talks and defuse the ongoing tariff dispute. The outreach hints at a potential thaw in the standoff that has rattled global markets. In China’s property sector, the average resale home price across 100 cities dropped by 0.7% MoM in April, as more inventory entered the market, intensifying competition. YoY, resale home prices plunged 7.2%. In contrast, new home prices rose by 2.5% over the same period, underlining a divergence in market trends. South Korea offered a mixed picture, with exports showing surprising resilience despite external headwinds. Driven by robust semiconductor demand, exports rose 3.7% year-on-year in April to $58.21 billion—the fastest pace in four months. However, signs of strain emerged in the automotive sector, which has started to feel the heat of rising global trade tensions. On the domestic front, Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections hit an all-time high of Rs 2.37 lakh crore, rising 12.6% year-on-year Domestic GST collections grew 10.7% to Rs 1.9 lakh crore, while revenue from imports surged 20.8% to Rs 46,913 crore. Net GST revenue stood at over Rs 2.09 lakh crore, up 9.1% year-on-year, reflecting strong economic momentum and fiscal year-end reconciliations. India’s external sector also reached a milestone, with total exports of goods and services touching a historic high of $825 billion in FY25. This was largely fueled by a record $386.5 billion in services exports. In March alone, services exports jumped 18.6% to \$35.6 billion, defying global trade headwinds. On the inflation front, retail price pressures eased for rural India. Inflation for farm workers dropped to 3.73% in March 2025, down from 4.05% in February. Similarly, inflation for rural workers eased to 3.86%, compared to 4.10% a month earlier, as per official data—offering relief to households in the hinterlands.

BEL's shares rise as investors react positively to India's defence sector growth forecasts, highlighting significant opportunities for BEL. 1) Fivestar’s PAT beat IIFLe/consensus by1%/4% as NIM compression (-52bps qoq) and higher opex was offset by stronger non-II (+26% qoq) and lower CC vs expectation. But, AUM/disbursement growth as well as underlying AQ was weaker primarily due to the impact from the KA MFI bill. 2) Net slippages increasing by 31bps qoq to 1.7% (ann.), unique CE declined 50bps qoq and 30+ DPD increased by 50bps qoq to 9.65%. Credit costs increased by 4bps qoq to 88bps even as PCR on stage 1+2 reduced by 14bps qoq. 3) Additionally, we are also watchful of recently proposed TN bill (29% of AUM) that restricts coercive recovery practices like in KA that can impact AQ as well as growth. 4) Retain BUY from medium term perspective with TP of Rs880 (18% upside, unchanged) given Five Star’s attractive business model that can deliver ~6-7% ROAs and ~18-20% steady state (delayed due to slower growth) with less volatile spread/credit costs vs its AHFC/MFI peers and higher growth runway vs Gold NBFCs. Regards Viral Shah, IIFL The Bank of Japan (BOJ) kept interest rates steady on Thursday and sharply lowered its growth forecasts, signaling prolonged caution due to the uncertain global trade environment. With concerns over U.S. tariffs and weak exports weighing on sentiment, the BOJ suggested that conditions for future rate hikes may take time to materialize. As a result, the yen weakened to a four-week low, with the dollar climbing 1.7% to 145.45 yen, buoyed by renewed optimism surrounding potential trade agreements between the U.S. and its partners. Meanwhile, in the U.S., manufacturing remained under pressure, contracting for the second consecutive month in April. The ISM Manufacturing PMI fell to 48.7—its lowest in five months—from 49.0 in March. Tariff-related disruptions to supply chains pushed up input costs, forcing some firms to cut jobs, even as overall layoffs announced by employers declined. On the diplomatic front, a Chinese state media outlet reported that the U.S. had reached out to Beijing through multiple channels to resume talks and defuse the ongoing tariff dispute. The outreach hints at a potential thaw in the standoff that has rattled global markets. In China’s property sector, the average resale home price across 100 cities dropped by 0.7% MoM in April, as more inventory entered the market, intensifying competition. YoY, resale home prices plunged 7.2%. In contrast, new home prices rose by 2.5% over the same period, underlining a divergence in market trends. South Korea offered a mixed picture, with exports showing surprising resilience despite external headwinds. Driven by robust semiconductor demand, exports rose 3.7% year-on-year in April to $58.21 billion—the fastest pace in four months. However, signs of strain emerged in the automotive sector, which has started to feel the heat of rising global trade tensions. On the domestic front, Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections hit an all-time high of Rs 2.37 lakh crore, rising 12.6% year-on-year Domestic GST collections grew 10.7% to Rs 1.9 lakh crore, while revenue from imports surged 20.8% to Rs 46,913 crore. Net GST revenue stood at over Rs 2.09 lakh crore, up 9.1% year-on-year, reflecting strong economic momentum and fiscal year-end reconciliations. India’s external sector also reached a milestone, with total exports of goods and services touching a historic high of $825 billion in FY25. This was largely fueled by a record $386.5 billion in services exports. In March alone, services exports jumped 18.6% to \$35.6 billion, defying global trade headwinds. On the inflation front, retail price pressures eased for rural India. Inflation for farm workers dropped to 3.73% in March 2025, down from 4.05% in February. Similarly, inflation for rural workers eased to 3.86%, compared to 4.10% a month earlier, as per official data—offering relief to households in the hinterlands. Asian market Asia market opened mixed today even as all three key benchmarks on Wall Street advanced overnight on optimism that a slowdown in the global economy will not impede the progress of developments in artificial intelligence.
