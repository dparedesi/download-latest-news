Title: Data Centers Continue to Vacuum Up the Investment Dollars — Is the Return Worth It?

© 2026 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy If 2025 will be remembered for anything — outside of the return of President Donald J. Trump and the rise of New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani — it will undoubtedly be the establishment of artificial intelligence across the American economy. And with this revolutionary technology has come the concomitant explosion of U.S. data center development — real estate assets solely capable of operating, and powering, the new landscape of AI technology. An S&P Global study from December, first reported by CNBC, found that more than $61 billion of new investment capital flowed into the data center space in 2025, which is just ahead of the $60.8 billion that entered the space in 2024. Ratings giant Moody’s expects global investment in new data centers will reach $2.2 trillion combined in the five years preceding 2028, while U.S. Census Bureau data forecasts that data center construction spending will surpass all U.S. office building construction spending by next year. One major player, Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta (neé Facebook), estimated it spent between $70 billion and $72 billion in building out AI infrastructure in 2025, per third-quarter earnings. “Everything’s moving into data centers,” said Jay Neveloff, chair of U.S. real estate at HSF Kramer, the global law firm. “So, what I’m telling clients is, at some point, we’re going to be oversaturated with data centers, and I don’t quite know what the exit strategy is for being in the data center space. “Having said that, I think we’re really at the infancy of that industry,” he added With money flowing this quickly, and in such large amounts, into a single commercial real estate asset class — an untraditional one, by any measure, that fuses land, utilities, power and fossil fuels, big tech, local politics and Wall Street under one big umbrella — questions are starting to emerge as to whether a bubble is forming around AI data center spending. “The projections of data center development by major tech players are truly eye-popping,” said Chris Russo, vice president of the energy practice at Charles River Associates, an economic consulting firm. “But there’s a growing number of questions whether the projections are, in fact, real, and if the investments being made by Meta, Google, Microsoft, among others, can be justified by future revenue.” This concern about revenue and monetization lies at the heart of the data center development conundrum. For instance, OpenAI, the Silicon Valley firm that initiated the AI wave three years ago through its revolutionary ChatGPT large language model (LLM) application, is not merely one of the biggest players in the data center space. It’s an underwater one, as well. The fact is, despite the hype, OpenAI is currently generating the largest cumulative losses ever for any startup before turning a profit. A Dec. 4, 2025, study by Deutsche Bank economists found that OpenAI has revenue forecasts of $345 billion between 2024 and 2029, but it comes after $488 billion in spending on data center computer power. That means the firm will run a cash-flow of negative $143 billion. Patrick Wilson, a portfolio manager at CenterSquare Investment Management, said the largest hyperscale data center developments haven’t yet been able to monetize AI technologies, and that, at some point, capital expenditures will start to plateau if investors continue to spend like this. That would signal a risk to investors who are paying for enormous valuations without much in the way of consistent and long-term revenue streams. “At some point, by 2027 or later, the market will want to see some sort of path to monetization for a lot of this spending because the return on investment capital is so paltry, if not nonexistent,” Wilson said. “So I do start to get concerned.” Investors aren’t scared yet. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts found that publicly traded real estate companies increased investments into data centers by 15 percent last year, while research from Refinitiv, part of the London Stock Exchange Group, found that debt market players borrowed $100 billion for data center development in 2025. “2025 was a bit of the early stage of a gold rush, per se, with tons of new entrants, operators, capital providers and tenants,” said Andrew Kaskel, head of data centers advisory at Walker & Dunlop. “While there certainly were a lot of projects announced and funded, it’s really still the early stage of a big growth cycle.” But is it a bubble? Kaskel admitted that, sure, there’s always a chance we’ve entered into a bubble and that things will go south once interest rates rise and demand shifts, as has happened before, particularly during the 1999-2001 dot-com bubble. But this rush of data center development, and AI spending, is fundamentally different for one critical reason. “What we see, day in and day out, and across the data center space, is that the majority of the capital being allocated and invested is backed by the largest, most stable companies in the world, with the healthiest balance sheets on the planet,” said Kaskel. “It’s foundationally built upon really secure companies for the long term.” JLL research found that of the 8 gigawatts of U.S. data centers currently under construction, 73 percent is pre-leased, while vacancies are expected to remain below 5 percent into 2027, and likely hold closer to 2 percent. “Looking at the fundamentals, there is no bubble,” said Sean Farney, vice president of Americas data center strategy at JLL. “Ninety-seven percent of the existing product is utilized, we are the envy of every other industry on Earth. … So the fundamental demand for the product is there, and it’s only getting higher as supply is getting lower.” Even so, this same JLL research report concluded that data center co-location vacancy rates that sit near zero percent are “constraining economic growth and undermining national security,” and that the “restrictive market conditions are counterproductive over the long term.” So, while the money is there, questions abound and answers are few as to who wins and loses as U.S. data center development explodes — with all eyes on the uncertain path the hyperscalers might chart to monetization as the central metric of whether the hundreds of billions of dollars in investment capital will actually be paid back. “We’re a big believer in AI and data enters over the short term, the medium term and the long term,” said Rich Hill, global head of real estate research and strategy at Principal Asset Management. “But every single data center investor might not have a good experience.” Whole new ballgame To understand where data centers might be going, it’s important to understand what they are as an asset class, as like any piece of real estate there is nuance in the bricks and mortar. Since emerging out of the telecommunications building boom that laid the groundwork for the rise of the internet in the 1990s and 2000s, data centers have evolved today into an asset of three distinct classes. There are cloud data centers, which are used to power Americans who shop on Amazon, or search Google, or use their iPhones to save photos on an invisible cloud network. Then there are AI inference data centers, which power the large language models of ChatGPT. Finally, there are much physically larger (and prohibitively more expensive) generative AI data centers, or factories, which are a training model for future AI use — often referred to as “neocloud” — that is still unknown. Data centers within these three classes are either leased to hyperscalers, like Oracle or Meta, or are co-locations, meaning multi-tenant tenant spaces that could include up-and-coming cloud platforms like CoreWeave and Fluidstack. “There’s a lot of money going into generative AI data center development, and we view it as much more speculative, with not as much pre-leasing occurring,” said Principal’s Hill. “I’m not here to tell you if it’s good or bad, a bubble or not a bubble, but we think it’s a much better risk-adjusted return focusing on cloud and AI inference data centers.” Today there are 4,165 data centers in the U.S., an average of 83 per state. The nearest countries by count — the United Kingdom and Germany — have only 499 and 487, respectively, per Statista, a statistics website. Those numbers themselves suggest room for foreign competition on the data center front, and on AI, adding another level of uncertainty to the growth and demand in the U.S. Kristina Metzger, vice chairman at CBRE’s data center capital markets, said national core data center fundamentals are “fantastic,” with less than 2 percent vacancy, 80 percent of the development pipeline pre-leased, little to no speculative development, growing rents, and positive earnings (15 percent year-over-year), all on the back of cloud computing. But it’s the gen AI hubs that have given her pause, mainly due to questions on long-term use and overall business models. “What we’re now working through are new facets of the industry with these AI factories, and neocloud operating models, and those [business models] remain to be determined,” she said. “There isn’t the same overall story as there is in core data centers.” Dave Powell, a partner at law firm King & Spalding, specializes in data centers. He noted that there are numerous expensive questions associated with any data center development. For instance, is an end-user lined up? Is it a big tech firm or not? Will it be a hyperscale site or co-location? And, most importantly, is there a reliable source of power to make the investment pencil? “We really see that it’s all about power — electricity generation is reaching new heights … and with respect to electricity, it’s divided up by markets, and not all markets are created equal,” said Powell. “To develop a data center, you need reliable electricity, which should be relatively inexpensive, you need land, you need to be near a major metropolitan area with favorable, or non-penalizing, regulations from the local government.” Even after all these questions are answered, and the data center is finally built (in compliance with the maze of local zoning codes, of course), perhaps the biggest open-ended question is how investors will make money on an asset class whose tenants still haven’t figured out how to monetize the actual “data” propping up the multibillion-dollar “center.” “It’s a question we hear day in and day out: What is the exit and how do people ultimately get returns? And it’s still to be determined,” said Walker & Dunlop’s Kaskel. “Right now, so much of the capital is being invested on the construction and development side, and these projects are three- to five- to 10-year developments before they reach 100 percent stabilization.” Generational dollars Even amid a laundry list of uncertainties, money has poured into the space since ChatGPT came online in 2022. By 2025, even after years of Wall Street capital behind it, what pushed data centers to another level was the Trump administration’s support for the industry, primarily Trump’s announcement of a $500 billion private sector investment in the construction of 20 new data centers, collectively spanning 10 million square feet, on his first full day back in office. “We have a clear policy to support the data center builds and the recognition that data centers are part of a strategic advantage,” JLL’s Farney said of the nation at large. “[The industry] came into its own in 2025, where there was wide recognition, not just in [big tech] but in financial services, that AI is a critical component of the economy and the value-prop for every company on the face of the Earth.” The evolution of AI has come as the data center space has experienced its own metamorphosis in recent years when it comes to investment capital. Previously, data centers as an asset class were a long-term, buy-and-hold play by public real estate investment trusts (REITs), which don’t tend to sell. But the public REITs eventually realized that cash flows on data centers tended to plateau once they were leased, making them a dilutive investment for public market investors always under the gun to raise debt or equity to acquire more assets and generate quarterly returns. Cue the private equity music. The early 2020s saw Blackstone buy REIT QTS for $10 billion, American Tower purchase CoreSite for $10.1 billion, and KKR scoop up CyrusOne for $15 billion. In 2024 and 2025, the big deals continued. DigitalBridge and Silver Lake bought Vantage Data Centers, a hyperscale data center developer, in a $9.2 billion equity investment, while a consortium backed by NVIDIA, Microsoft, BlackRock and xAI purchased Aligned Data Centers for $40 billion, the largest deal to date. For many of these acquisitions involving the big-name hyperscalers, the money is chasing profits in the nebulous AI factory space, where many risks remain. “AI factories are quite sizable, so you’re looking at construction budgets north of $20 billion in many instances, so from an equity perspective that takeout remains to be determined, or if it’s something better suited for the public markets,” said CBRE’s Metzger. “There’s just some unknowns. None of these have delivered yet, so that process of overall monetization hasn’t taken place yet … and for some investors these might be very long-term holds.” One reason why investors have jumped so eagerly into the data center space, including the generative AI factory arena, is because of the valuations hyperscalers have experienced in the last five years, especially since AI went mainstream in 2022. Since December 2020, Google’s stock price has increased 258 percent; Microsoft’s has risen 119 percent; Meta’s 144 percent; Apple is up 105 percent; and Oracle’s stock price is 205 percent higher. “People have a general sense of a bubble, but for me it’s irrational investment behavior, and that can be both on the investment side, with capital going in, but also irrational valuations around the companies that are in there,” said CenterSquare’s Wilson. Wilson emphasized that before 2025, public REITs drove the capital into the sector. But today, with hundreds of billions of dollars required for development platforms, REITs are “incredibly small scale” compared to the private players, particularly the Big 4 Silicon Valley firms. He said Amazon, Google parent Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft were estimated to deploy $350 billion into the space through 2025 and are expected to invest another $511 billion in 2026. “There’s some thought it might go up, but it will get tougher and tougher to deploy starting in 2028,” he added. “A lot of the physical space will be taken up and installed, there’ll be tremendously tighter markets, and you’ll be going into the tertiary markets in North Dakota, Louisiana, west Texas, and so you do start to bump up against the level where capital expenditures plateau.” Snap, crackle and pop To even a true data center bull like JLL’s Farney, ever since Wall Street jumped into the industry in the early 2020s, the valuations for AI and data centers have been “bonkers,” but that doesn’t mean they’re dangerously priced. “Absolutely, there’s a bubble in equity pricing, along the entire value chain, but when it comes to the fundamentals of business, it’s in no way [a bubble],” he said. “No one can show me the demand is not there.” Sure, demand is all well and good, but industry experts like Chris Russo, who makes a living advising on data center economics, argue there are major, existential questions on how generative AI will be monetized. It could come in the form of all of corporate America adopting a gen AI Microsoft Co-Pilot, which is powered by ChatGPT, or life sciences firms adopting AI hyperscaler technology for research, or every white-collar business in the country automating its human workers as AI chatbots. But those remain theories, if not science fiction. “All of the investment in AI is to ultimately produce LLMs, or AI generative intelligence, but at some point people need to pay to use it as a product,” Russo said, emphasizing that revenue must appear in the flesh to justify investment. “If trillions of dollars are being committed in capital, then there needs to be trillions of dollars of capital to support it,” he added. “The money needs to come from somewhere, and where the money comes from right now is still questionable.” Right now, AI relies on a subscription model, where users pay per month. While the expectation is that large-scale corporate subscriptions will integrate these different AI technologies into their numerous businesses, the real bet is on AI getting intertwined into the everyday lives of ordinary Americans in myriad, unheard-of ways. “The hope is it gets embedded into a lot more areas of your life, and so as these things get better at image recognition, machine learning through visuals, it might integrate into wearables, and it could be embedded into autonomous vehicles diagnostics,” said Wilson. “That’s the thought, but we’re at this precipice, and, if anyone says they know where this technology is headed, call them crazy.” Another wild card in the entire narrative is the power struggle. The Electric Power Research Institute estimates data centers could account for anywhere from 5 percent to 9 percent of all U.S. electricity consumption by 2030. The Environmental and Energy Study Institute forecasts data center electricity demand will reach 130 gigawatts by 2030, and account for 12 percent of U.S. electricity demand. And some of the numbers now being forecast are not just jaw-dropping, but in some cases fanciful. CNBC reported the Electric Reliability Council of Texas projects 220 gigawatts of large data center developments have asked to connect to the Texas electric grid by 2030. Mike Hogan, senior adviser to Regulatory Assistance Project, a nonprofit think tank that advises on energy policy, noted that 225 gigawatts of new data center demand in Texas is almost six times the current peak load of the whole state, which is projected to be 40 gigawatts by 2030, and that the U.S. power grid is 900 gigawatts total. “It’s very, very difficult to imagine that all of that development is for real,” said Hogan, who noted many data center development contracts counted are duplicative across states, or speculative. “I’m far from alone in thinking that we’re in the middle of a bubble. But it’s also true that if only 10 percent of that comes through, it’s a significant amount of new load.” Russo, another skeptic, noted that, right now, data center developers are “almost indifferent to what energy costs,” because returns are currently so high, while the average American voter might not be so amenable to increased energy bills due to the wave of new data center deals. “Data centers are making clear one of the fundamental principles of markets: When something is scarce, it becomes expensive, and, at the moment, there is a very large demand for electricity from data centers and consumers, and that increases prices,” he said. “Everyone loves market incentives, but nobody likes the side effects of higher bills.” Even if the access to power for data center developers has immediate solutions — JLL’s Farney noted that large consumers are creating their own multistate natural gas arrangements, while also investing heavily into alternatives to existing grid technology via nuclear power, coal and solar — there is still the threat inherent in the technology itself. Unlike railroad infrastructure or telecommunication fiber optic cables, the chips built today that power data centers won’t be useful in five years, let alone 100 years, according to Russo. “The speed at which this technology depreciates — and a lot of the value is consumed very quickly — is astonishing compared to other industries,” he said. “It’s like developing an office building and replacing the plumbing and wiring almost immediately.” CenterSquare’s Wilson said the bubble threat to the market isn’t so much like the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, but more like the boom-and-bust cycle that occurred during the growth of the railroad industry in the 19th century. “I do think this is a huge inflection point in society going forward,” he said. “This isn’t a fad, but there will be, like there always is in bubbles, if we can call this a bubble, wreckage, and there will be losers.” Brian Pascus can be reached at bpascus@commercialobserver.com.

But it’s the gen AI hubs that have given her pause, mainly due to questions on long-term use and overall business models. “What we’re now working through are new facets of the industry with these AI factories, and neocloud operating models, and those [business models] remain to be determined,” she said. “There isn’t the same overall story as there is in core data centers.” Dave Powell, a partner at law firm King & Spalding, specializes in data centers. He noted that there are numerous expensive questions associated with any data center development. For instance, is an end-user lined up? Is it a big tech firm or not? Will it be a hyperscale site or co-location? And, most importantly, is there a reliable source of power to make the investment pencil? “We really see that it’s all about power — electricity generation is reaching new heights … and with respect to electricity, it’s divided up by markets, and not all markets are created equal,” said Powell. “To develop a data center, you need reliable electricity, which should be relatively inexpensive, you need land, you need to be near a major metropolitan area with favorable, or non-penalizing, regulations from the local government.” Even after all these questions are answered, and the data center is finally built (in compliance with the maze of local zoning codes, of course), perhaps the biggest open-ended question is how investors will make money on an asset class whose tenants still haven’t figured out how to monetize the actual “data” propping up the multibillion-dollar “center.” “It’s a question we hear day in and day out: What is the exit and how do people ultimately get returns? And it’s still to be determined,” said Walker & Dunlop’s Kaskel. “Right now, so much of the capital is being invested on the construction and development side, and these projects are three- to five- to 10-year developments before they reach 100 percent stabilization.” Generational dollars Even amid a laundry list of uncertainties, money has poured into the space since ChatGPT came online in 2022. By 2025, even after years of Wall Street capital behind it, what pushed data centers to another level was the Trump administration’s support for the industry, primarily Trump’s announcement of a $500 billion private sector investment in the construction of 20 new data centers, collectively spanning 10 million square feet, on his first full day back in office. “We have a clear policy to support the data center builds and the recognition that data centers are part of a strategic advantage,” JLL’s Farney said of the nation at large. “[The industry] came into its own in 2025, where there was wide recognition, not just in [big tech] but in financial services, that AI is a critical component of the economy and the value-prop for every company on the face of the Earth.” The evolution of AI has come as the data center space has experienced its own metamorphosis in recent years when it comes to investment capital. Previously, data centers as an asset class were a long-term, buy-and-hold play by public real estate investment trusts (REITs), which don’t tend to sell. But the public REITs eventually realized that cash flows on data centers tended to plateau once they were leased, making them a dilutive investment for public market investors always under the gun to raise debt or equity to acquire more assets and generate quarterly returns. Cue the private equity music. The early 2020s saw Blackstone buy REIT QTS for $10 billion, American Tower purchase CoreSite for $10.1 billion, and KKR scoop up CyrusOne for $15 billion. In 2024 and 2025, the big deals continued. DigitalBridge and Silver Lake bought Vantage Data Centers, a hyperscale data center developer, in a $9.2 billion equity investment, while a consortium backed by NVIDIA, Microsoft, BlackRock and xAI purchased Aligned Data Centers for $40 billion, the largest deal to date. For many of these acquisitions involving the big-name hyperscalers, the money is chasing profits in the nebulous AI factory space, where many risks remain. “AI factories are quite sizable, so you’re looking at construction budgets north of $20 billion in many instances, so from an equity perspective that takeout remains to be determined, or if it’s something better suited for the public markets,” said CBRE’s Metzger. “There’s just some unknowns. None of these have delivered yet, so that process of overall monetization hasn’t taken place yet … and for some investors these might be very long-term holds.” One reason why investors have jumped so eagerly into the data center space, including the generative AI factory arena, is because of the valuations hyperscalers have experienced in the last five years, especially since AI went mainstream in 2022. Since December 2020, Google’s stock price has increased 258 percent; Microsoft’s has risen 119 percent; Meta’s 144 percent; Apple is up 105 percent; and Oracle’s stock price is 205 percent higher. “People have a general sense of a bubble, but for me it’s irrational investment behavior, and that can be both on the investment side, with capital going in, but also irrational valuations around the companies that are in there,” said CenterSquare’s Wilson. Wilson emphasized that before 2025, public REITs drove the capital into the sector. But today, with hundreds of billions of dollars required for development platforms, REITs are “incredibly small scale” compared to the private players, particularly the Big 4 Silicon Valley firms. He said Amazon, Google parent Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft were estimated to deploy $350 billion into the space through 2025 and are expected to invest another $511 billion in 2026. “There’s some thought it might go up, but it will get tougher and tougher to deploy starting in 2028,” he added. “A lot of the physical space will be taken up and installed, there’ll be tremendously tighter markets, and you’ll be going into the tertiary markets in North Dakota, Louisiana, west Texas, and so you do start to bump up against the level where capital expenditures plateau.” Snap, crackle and pop To even a true data center bull like JLL’s Farney, ever since Wall Street jumped into the industry in the early 2020s, the valuations for AI and data centers have been “bonkers,” but that doesn’t mean they’re dangerously priced. “Absolutely, there’s a bubble in equity pricing, along the entire value chain, but when it comes to the fundamentals of business, it’s in no way [a bubble],” he said. “No one can show me the demand is not there.” Sure, demand is all well and good, but industry experts like Chris Russo, who makes a living advising on data center economics, argue there are major, existential questions on how generative AI will be monetized. It could come in the form of all of corporate America adopting a gen AI Microsoft Co-Pilot, which is powered by ChatGPT, or life sciences firms adopting AI hyperscaler technology for research, or every white-collar business in the country automating its human workers as AI chatbots. But those remain theories, if not science fiction. “All of the investment in AI is to ultimately produce LLMs, or AI generative intelligence, but at some point people need to pay to use it as a product,” Russo said, emphasizing that revenue must appear in the flesh to justify investment. “If trillions of dollars are being committed in capital, then there needs to be trillions of dollars of capital to support it,” he added. “The money needs to come from somewhere, and where the money comes from right now is still questionable.” Right now, AI relies on a subscription model, where users pay per month. While the expectation is that large-scale corporate subscriptions will integrate these different AI technologies into their numerous businesses, the real bet is on AI getting intertwined into the everyday lives of ordinary Americans in myriad, unheard-of ways. “The hope is it gets embedded into a lot more areas of your life, and so as these things get better at image recognition, machine learning through visuals, it might integrate into wearables, and it could be embedded into autonomous vehicles diagnostics,” said Wilson. “That’s the thought, but we’re at this precipice, and, if anyone says they know where this technology is headed, call them crazy.” Another wild card in the entire narrative is the power struggle. The Electric Power Research Institute estimates data centers could account for anywhere from 5 percent to 9 percent of all U.S. electricity consumption by 2030. The Environmental and Energy Study Institute forecasts data center electricity demand will reach 130 gigawatts by 2030, and account for 12 percent of U.S. electricity demand. And some of the numbers now being forecast are not just jaw-dropping, but in some cases fanciful. CNBC reported the Electric Reliability Council of Texas projects 220 gigawatts of large data center developments have asked to connect to the Texas electric grid by 2030. Mike Hogan, senior adviser to Regulatory Assistance Project, a nonprofit think tank that advises on energy policy, noted that 225 gigawatts of new data center demand in Texas is almost six times the current peak load of the whole state, which is projected to be 40 gigawatts by 2030, and that the U.S. power grid is 900 gigawatts total. “It’s very, very difficult to imagine that all of that development is for real,” said Hogan, who noted many data center development contracts counted are duplicative across states, or speculative. “I’m far from alone in thinking that we’re in the middle of a bubble. But it’s also true that if only 10 percent of that comes through, it’s a significant amount of new load.” Russo, another skeptic, noted that, right now, data center developers are “almost indifferent to what energy costs,” because returns are currently so high, while the average American voter might not be so amenable to increased energy bills due to the wave of new data center deals. “Data centers are making clear one of the fundamental principles of markets: When something is scarce, it becomes expensive, and, at the moment, there is a very large demand for electricity from data centers and consumers, and that increases prices,” he said. “Everyone loves market incentives, but nobody likes the side effects of higher bills.” Even if the access to power for data center developers has immediate solutions — JLL’s Farney noted that large consumers are creating their own multistate natural gas arrangements, while also investing heavily into alternatives to existing grid technology via nuclear power, coal and solar — there is still the threat inherent in the technology itself. Unlike railroad infrastructure or telecommunication fiber optic cables, the chips built today that power data centers won’t be useful in five years, let alone 100 years, according to Russo. “The speed at which this technology depreciates — and a lot of the value is consumed very quickly — is astonishing compared to other industries,” he said. “It’s like developing an office building and replacing the plumbing and wiring almost immediately.” CenterSquare’s Wilson said the bubble threat to the market isn’t so much like the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, but more like the boom-and-bust cycle that occurred during the growth of the railroad industry in the 19th century. “I do think this is a huge inflection point in society going forward,” he said. “This isn’t a fad, but there will be, like there always is in bubbles, if we can call this a bubble, wreckage, and there will be losers.” Brian Pascus can be reached at bpascus@commercialobserver.com.

Title: How the Stock Market Could Sink Trump in 2026
URL: https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-stock-market-ahead-of-midterms-by-desmond-lachman-2026-01
Time Published: 2026-01-05T14:46:27Z
Full Content:
By emphasizing how well the US stock market is doing, US President Donald Trump could be setting himself up for electoral disappointment this November. With equities priced for perfection, any number of risks could deflate today's exuberance. WASHINGTON, DC – In a recent campaign-style speech, US President Donald Trump asserted that “the only thing that’s really going up, big, it’s called the stock market, and your 401(k).” He has a point: all major US stock indices realized double-digit percentage gains last year. And yet, the November midterm elections are still a long way off. Were there to be a stock-market correction in the meantime, Trump’s economic point of pride could become a liability. Unfortunately for Trump, a market correction (a 10-20% decline) does seem highly probable this year. There is an unusually high degree of optimism priced into the market, making stocks susceptible to a large pullback in the event of an economic setback – which any number of economic or political “known unknowns” could cause in the run-up to the midterms. Consider the current optimism. It would be an understatement to say that stocks are priced at lofty valuations; in fact, they are priced for economic perfection. As measured by the Cyclically Adjusted Price-Earnings Ratio, the S&P 500 is valued at more than twice its long-term average, and at close to its pre-2001 dot-com high. And as measured by the Buffett Indicator – the ratio of the total US stock-market valuation to US GDP – the market is trading at an all-time record, some 50% above its 2008 high. Another measure of optimism is the current bullishness on the part of fund managers. According to Bank of America, these influential voices are more exuberant now than at any point in the past three years, and their current cash holdings have plummeted to their lowest level on record. Again, such sentiment – and the bets that follow from it – would seem to set the market up for a major pullback should the economy falter in the coming months. Why might that happen? One need only consider the country’s unsustainable public finances, coupled with the threat Trump poses to the US Federal Reserve’s independence, to envisage a return of the bond market vigilantes and a spike in long-term interest rates. Heightening this risk is the country’s high dependence on foreigners to finance its $2 trillion annual budget deficit. If foreigners come to think that the US government will try to inflate away its debt, they will demand higher interest payments on their US Treasury bond holdings, which would increase the cost of mortgages, auto loans, and many other common forms of borrowing. Another domestic risk is the AI bubble, which could burst or deflate at any time. This risk is especially acute considering that as much as half of US GDP growth is being driven by AI-related investment. Moreover, the end of the AI bubble would have a chilling effect on the stock prices of the so-called Magnificent Seven (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla), whose combined valuation is around 35% of the S&P 500’s total. Oracle, whose stock price already fell 30% last quarter, could prove to be the canary in the coal mine. Our annual flagship magazine, PS Quarterly: The Year Ahead 2026, is here!

One such shock could come from China, which is still relying excessively on an investment- and export-centric model to drive its economy. With China’s trade surplus now exceeding $1 trillion, increased US and European protectionism has become more likely, and with it, a further breakdown in the international trading system. Another shock could come from Japan, where Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s pursuit of an irresponsible budget policy has raised fears of a “Liz Truss moment” that could send Japanese government bond yields sharply higher (as happened in the United Kingdom in the fall of 2022). Were that to occur, we could see a disruptive unwinding of the Japanese carry trade (borrowing at a lower interest rate in one country to invest in assets elsewhere) and the repatriation of Japanese capital that has been supporting US financial markets. Finally, as last weekend’s US military operation against Venezuela demonstrated, unexpected or under-appreciated geopolitical events can disrupt financial markets. Even before Trump announced that the US plans to “run” Venezuela until a “proper” transition can take place, China was conducting live military drills in the Taiwan Strait, and Russia was dragging its feet on a peace settlement with Ukraine. China might try to capitalize on this moment to regain control over Taiwan, and Russia may be emboldened to make even more ambitious demands for territorial concessions from Ukraine. Even the smallest possibility of a conflict over Taiwan should be deeply concerning, considering that it supplies more than half the world’s semiconductors. If those who live by the sword die by the sword, the same may be true of equity prices in the run-up to this year’s midterm elections. By emphasizing how well the stock market is doing now, Trump could be setting himself up for disappointment if any number of risks materialize.

Share this article Bank of America’s wealth advisers will be permitted to recommend Bitcoin ETFs to their clients starting today. Chris Hyzy, chief investment officer at Bank of America Private Bank, told Yahoo Finance last month that the bank would officially kick off coverage for four Bitcoin ETFs, including Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC), and BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), on January 5. The bank endorses a 1%–4% allocation to digital assets for clients across Merrill, Bank of America Private Bank, and Merrill Edge. With this move, Bank of America is joining Morgan Stanley in expanding access to digital asset investment products for its clients. The move is viewed as a meaningful change from the bank’s former conservative position on digital assets. Greater availability of Bitcoin ETFs through major financial institutions could draw new investors into the market and potentially boost overall demand. Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: Ethereum has long talked a big game. Now it’s time for the second biggest blockchain to deliver
URL: https://fortune.com/crypto/2026/01/05/ethereum-2026-vitalik-buterin-fork-in-the-road/
Time Published: 2026-01-05T12:36:31Z
Full Content:
On Jan. 1, Vitalik Buterin announced a New Year’s resolution for the blockchain he devised way back in 2013. It’s time, he declared, for Ethereum to step up and deliver on its original mission: “To build the world computer that serves as a central infrastructure piece of a more free and open internet.” Buterin’s message is a timely one. For more than a decade now, Ethereum has offered the tantalizing promise of a global computer, available to anyone, that can be used to create decentralized alternatives to Big Tech’s data-gobbling monopolies. The blockchain popularized smart contracts, and has been a springboard for thousands of projects backed by billions of dollars. It has also spawned legions of mostly fly-by-night imitators. Despite all of this, the promise of Ethereum always seems just over the horizon. In recent years, the blockchain has come to resemble that can’t-miss sports prospect who can’t quite hack it in the big leagues. Instead of evolving into a popular global computer, Ethereum still feels like a sub-culture where cliques of insiders build esoteric applications for each other. In response, many in the crypto world started betting on other horses like Solana that promised to deliver practical results. Ethereum’s problem, ironically, has been its idealism. The blockchain has a core community that believes passionately in decentralization, and is mistrustful of anything resembling formal authority. That includes Buterin, who stepped back from his creation several years ago, preferring to let Ethereum find its own path forward. All of this is admirable, especially in contrast to many recent arrivals on the crypto scene, whose first and only concern is to make a buck. Unfortunately, it has also led Ethereum developers to dither in the face of obvious problems, including congestion and high gas fees. To be fair, the blockchain has made some important fixes—but only after allowing piggy-back chains, known as layer 2s, to siphon off large amounts of revenue and make the crypto landscape painfully complicated. Now, though, change could be in the air. In the last two years, both BlackRock and JPMorgan Chase have launched tokenized assets that settle directly to the main Ethereum blockchain. This is a testament to how Ethereum remains the gold standard for security and points to a future where it will be the backbone of global finance. The tokenized transactions also legitimize Ethereum’s claim to be a universal computer, and could spur the mainstream adoption of other decentralized applications for social media, identity, and more. For this to happen, though, the Ethereum community will require Buterin’s ongoing leadership. That’s why his New Year’s Day post is a welcome development. The piece reinforced the primacy of decentralization as Ethereum’s paramount value: “We’re building decentralized applications. Applications that run without fraud, censorship or third-party interference. Applications that pass the walkaway test: they keep running even if the original developers disappear.” But it also delivered a pragmatic piece of advice to the community seeking to build this decentralized future: Get on with it, already.

Top navigation Buffer’s features Supported social media channels Buffer’s resources Blog navigation Buffer’s blog topics Breadcrumbs PublishedJan 5, 2026 Discover 28 essential digital marketing tools that help growing brands succeed without breaking the bank — including free and affordable options. Big marketing dreams, but working with a tight budget? After more than a decade of marketing for bootstrapped brands, I've learned that you don't need to spend a fortune on fancy digital marketing tools to see results. It's all about building a smart toolkit that punches above its weight. One that helps you work efficiently and get results without breaking the bank. That's where this comprehensive list comes in: 28 digital marketing tools that help growing brands succeed. Many of these tools offer free or low-cost versions, so you can start small and scale up as you're ready for more features. Consider this your guide to building a powerful marketing tech stack that works within your budget. These social media tools help you maintain a consistent social media presence and evaluate your content performance. A social media management tool is central to any social strategy. It helps you manage your online presence so you can post consistently and on a schedule you choose — which can help improve engagement. I've been a Buffer customer and fan for nine years, long before I started contributing to the blog. And, when I became more active in building my personal brand a year ago, Buffer was the natural choice. Since this is the Buffer blog, we're naturally excited to share how Buffer can help with your social media management. The good stuff: The Create space is one of my favorite features. Here's my current setup: I log all my half-baked ideas here and move them along in my custom Kanban board as they progress. I even have a prompts category for ideas in case I get stuck (many of which came from Buffer's Creator Camp) — but there's a nifty "generate ideas" button that can jumpstart your content creation. From here, adding a finished post to my queue for publishing is super easy. And with Buffer's pay-by-channel pricing model, I've been able to scale the services I pay for up and down based on what I need. For example, I used to be active on both LinkedIn and X, but now I'm only on LinkedIn. That flexibility is helpful since every dollar counts as I grow my freelance business. Plus, if you're experimenting with newer platform options, Buffer quickly adds support for new social platforms (hello, Mastodon and Bluesky). Buffer shines brightest for small businesses, solopreneurs, and creators looking to streamline their social media game without getting lost in complex features. It's the perfect balance of powerful and user-friendly — just what you need to make your social media presence pop without the headache. Pricing: Free plan available. Paid plans start at $6/month/channel. Have you ever wondered what people say about your brand when you're not looking? That's where social listening comes in — and Mentionlytics makes it accessible even if you're working with a tight budget. Many social listening tools cost hundreds or thousands of dollars, putting them out of reach for small businesses. But Mentionlytics brings these powerful capabilities to small businesses at a fraction of the cost. The good stuff: The drag-and-drop report builder also lets you create custom reports to share insights with your team. Whether you're looking to improve your customer service, gather product feedback, or keep tabs on your online reputation, Mentionlytics could be a valuable addition to your digital marketing toolkit. Pricing: Starts at $69/month. Ultimately, you'll want to differentiate your social media marketing strategy from your competitors', so you don't want to copy them. But checking out what they're doing with a competitive analysis tool can help you understand their strategy and inform your own. Predis.ai surfaces these insights and can even help you generate content based on what's working in your industry. The good stuff: All in all, Predis.ai is worth considering to learn from the wins and mistakes of your competitors so you don't have to learn them yourself the hard way. Pricing: Free plan available. Paid plans start at $32/month. This next great digital marketing tool has been mentioned by several folks I respect who are growing their personal brands on social media. If you ever find it hard to keep your social media queue full, Quuu can help curate content from around the web that interests your audience. Then, you can blend original posts with curated content that gets conversations going without manually searching for share-worthy content. Quuu uses AI to curate content and draft posts suitable for your audience. The good stuff: Whether you're looking to establish thought leadership, keep your audience informed, or maintain a consistent posting schedule, Quuu can save time while keeping you up-to-date and relevant. Pricing: 7-day free trial available. Paid plans start at $19.79/month per social media profile. Partnership marketing is great for businesses of all sizes. It enables you to expand your brand's reach through exposure to the audiences others have already built. However, managing these relationships can get a bit fiddly if you rely on spreadsheets and email threads. These digital marketing tools can help you track relationships, streamline outreach, manage campaigns, and measure the impact of your collaborations. Many influencer marketing tools are in the thousands per month. But Influencity makes influencer marketing management a lot more achievable for those with a modest budget. The good stuff: Influencity is perfect for brands looking to dip their toes into influencer marketing for the first time or those who don't have a large budget but want to level up from managing with spreadsheets. Pricing: 7-day free trial available. Contact Influencity for pricing information. In the five years I spent managing partnerships at Tortuga, I can't recommend using a CRM for partnerships enough. I used Buzzstream to track brand features and outreach of all kinds, including those with media, bloggers, product review sites, influencers, and affiliates. The good stuff: If you manage many partnerships for your brand, Buzzstream can help you keep all those plates spinning without dropping any. Pricing: 14-day free trial available. Paid plans start at $24/month. After discovering new potential customers through other marketing channels, you'll want a way to stay in direct contact with your audience so you can build deeper relationships and gather first-party data for personalization. Email and SMS marketing can help you nurture leads, maintain existing customer relationships, and drive conversions through personalized, direct communication. When it comes to email marketing tools, Mailchimp is often first to come to mind because it's versatile and approachable for new businesses. The good stuff: Content creator and relationship coach Mike Mantell has used Mailchimp for years to manage their email newsletter. "I find it pretty easy to make lists to distinguish where signups from different lead magnets came from," they share. "It has the basic functionality I need for email marketing." They can even create multiple email sequences on the free plan, which sets Mailchimp apart from other options. However, Mike notes that as your needs grow more complex, you might feel some growing pains: "If I have to edit any of my automations, it takes a long time for me to figure out how. It's a bit unintuitive in that way." If that's the case for you, you may consider upgrading to a specialized tool focused on your niche. Pricing: Free email-only plan for up to 250 contacts. Paid plans start at $13/month. If you're running an e-commerce business, you know Klaviyo. It's been a go-to email marketing tool for online retail stores for years. The good stuff: I've had hands-on experience with Klaviyo at multiple e-commerce brands, and having a provider focused on online retail makes a difference. Klaviyo makes it intuitive to create segments based on your history with a customer, set up automated flows, and track revenue impact. While Klaviyo has been a frontrunner for over a decade, it's worth mentioning that alternatives like Privy and Omnisend offer similar features at comparable price points and are establishing a name for themselves as well. For those with bigger budgets and more complex needs, solutions like Sendlane and Attentive are pushing the envelope with advanced features and top-tier service. On the flip side, if you're a Shopify brand just starting out, Shopify Messaging has a generous free tier for up to 10k emails per month. While it offers fewer features than Klaviyo, it can be a good stepping stone for budding brands. Pricing: Klaviyo has a free plan for up to 250 contacts and 500 monthly email sends. Paid plans start at $20/month for email alone or $35/month for email and SMS. HubSpot is a powerhouse for B2B SaaS companies looking to manage their relationships with leads and customers alongside email marketing. I've used it to manage email marketing for a small tech company, and it was so helpful to be able to peek at a customer's entire journey and history with our brand. The good stuff: The email builder is intuitive. It's also powerful to be able to segment your list based on any data point in your CRM. However, the learning curve can be steep if you're new to marketing automation platforms because HubSpot is packed to the brim with capabilities. It's worth noting that while HubSpot is excellent for B2B, it'll be overkill for simpler email marketing needs. If you're not leveraging its full suite of tools, you might find better value elsewhere. Pricing: Free plan available. Paid Marketing Hub plans start at $20/user/month but can get pricey as you add more contacts and features. Kit is an email marketing platform designed for creators and solopreneurs who sell digital products like courses, ebooks, or coaching services. Kit sets itself apart through its monetization features. The good stuff: Anna Burgess Yang, a freelance writer who helps fellow solopreneurs improve their workflows, swears by Kit's capabilities: "I host a lot of webinars and create free downloads for my audience. Kit makes it easy for me to create landing pages and email sequences. I now have a well-oiled process for launching something new in Kit and segmenting the subscribers into different groups with tags based on what they signed up to receive." Pricing: Free plan for up to 10k subscribers. Paid plans start at $39/month. Several creators I follow have switched to beehiiv recently due to its specialized features. It's a platform designed for creators who see their newsletter as the main event, not just a marketing tool. While platforms like Kit excel at selling digital products, beehiiv shines when the newsletter itself is the value you're offering. It's for those who want to turn their email list into a thriving community and potentially a revenue stream. The good stuff: Buffer's own Senior Content Creator, Tamilore Oladipo, hosts her newsletter, Content-as-a-Career, on beehiiv. "I've tried many newsletter platforms and have found beehiiv to offer the most value for my usual needs," she says. It's also made it easy for Tami to monetize early on: "My favorite thing about the platform is the ability to connect to sponsors easily — I'm already monetizing with just over 1,000 subscribers." As far as more advanced features, Tami shares, "I haven't had to implement anything too complex yet, so I can't say too much about its automation capabilities. But if you're looking to get an MVP (minimum viable product) of your newsletter off the ground, it's a great tool." The platform also offers robust analytics, helping you understand what content resonates with your audience. This data-driven approach can be invaluable for creators looking to grow their readership and influence. Pricing: Free plan for up to 2,500 subscribers. Paid plans start at $49/month. SEO isn't just about pleasing search engines. It's about improving your visibility so you can connect with people searching for what you offer. But search engine optimization can feel like a complex logic puzzle, especially if you're juggling other marketing channels. The right SEO tools can help you decode the mystery of search engine rankings and determine where to focus your efforts. I've been using Moz on and off for nearly a decade. I keep coming back to it for its simple user interface and powerful features — some of which they even grant access to (at a small monthly volume) on the free plan. The good stuff: While Moz offers similar functionality to competitor Ahrefs, I find Ahrefs more robust and intuitive. However, Ahrefs' paid plans start at a higher price point, making Moz a more accessible option for many small businesses. Moz also rocks in the educational content department. Their webinars and SEO guides are excellent resources if you're looking to expand your SEO knowledge. Clearscope co-founder Bernard Huang's episode on ranch-style content marketing is a personal favorite. Pricing: Free plan available. Paid plans start at $49/month. Frase is a content optimization tool that helps you create SEO-friendly long-form content that ranks well in search results. As a freelance writer, I've used several content optimization tools, including SurferSEO and Clearscope. While they all offer similar core functionality for optimizing blog posts, Frase stands out for its affordability and flexibility. The good stuff: What I appreciate most about Frase is its pricing model. As a freelancer, not all of my clients need search optimization, and some provide access to their own software. Frase's monthly subscription option allows me to pay only when I need it, which helps cut down costs compared to annual subscriptions for similar tools. The intuitive interface makes it easy to analyze top-ranking content and ensure my article covers all the necessary topics. Pricing: Starts at $45/month. Google Search Console is a free tool for understanding and improving your site's performance in Google search results. Mike Mantell, the relationship coach and content creator we mentioned earlier, relies on Google Search Console to understand how well their blog posts rank and what search terms bring people to their site. The good stuff: What does Mike love about Google Search Console? "It sends me a regular email to help me gauge my progress. It's cool to see my monthly clicks go up. And I find it helpful to see which pages are growing the fastest. It's gratifying to see my progress and to home in on what's working." Pricing: Completely free. Creating professional, engaging content helps you capture your audience's attention and convey your message effectively. But you might not have the budget for heavy-duty tools or design experience — and that's completely understandable. These tools can bridge the gap, turning your ideas into polished visual content and crafty copy, even without specialized skills. Canva makes graphic design accessible to anyone. I've been using it for years, personally and professionally. It's my go-to tool for creating quick, polished visuals for social media posts, profile banners, and LinkedIn carousels. The good stuff: What I love most about Canva is that you don't need to be an Adobe pro to create professional-looking graphics. The templates are a great starting point, and it's easy to customize them to fit your brand. One standout feature is the ability to resize designs for different social media platforms in one click. This is a huge time-saver when you're creating content for multiple platforms or social media channels with their own size requirements. Pricing: Free plan available. Paid plans start at $15/month for one person. Adobe Firefly is Adobe's foray into the world of AI-generated images, and it's making waves for good reason. It can help you produce high-quality visuals quickly, especially if you need images for commercial use. The good stuff: Kirsti Lang, a senior content writer at Buffer, took it for a spin. Her opinion was that the free web version is surprisingly powerful. You can specify everything from aspect ratio and art style to depth of field and color tone. One standout feature is the quality of human faces in AI-generated photos. Unlike some other tools, Firefly produces realistic faces without the unsettling "uncanny valley" effect. "My results with Firefly were consistently excellent," Kirsti says, "I found that playing around with the various art styles and effects pre-generated really helped me fine-tune my ask." While the free version is great for experimenting, the watermark-free images in paid plans are worth considering for professional use. Pricing: Free version available with watermark. Paid plans start at $9.99/month. VEED is a simple browser-based video editing tool designed to make video creation accessible to those without extensive editing experience. As someone who's dabbled in more advanced tools like Final Cut Pro, I initially found VEED limiting. However, I appreciate its simplicity for quick edits. The good stuff: What stands out about VEED is its ease of use. While I sometimes wish for more control, that's exactly why it's great for small business owners or marketers who aren't video editing pros. It's hard to make big mistakes with VEED. Pricing: Free version available with watermark. Paid plans start at $24/month. Butter is a specialized video creation tool designed with e-commerce brands in mind, offering a Canva-like experience for short-form product videos. As someone who's worked with e-commerce brands, I appreciate tools that streamline the process of creating engaging product content. Butter does just that for video. The good stuff: Butter really sets itself apart in its focus on creating dynamic product videos from a combination of still shots and video footage. It lets your marketing team create eye-catching assets on the fly for your website, email, SMS, and social media campaigns. It's a tool I wish I had when I was doing marketing for e-commerce brands. It lets you step up your video content without a huge learning curve or budget. Pricing: Plans start at $25/month. Everyone has their go-to AI writing assistant at this point. Claude is mine. It's a large language model, much like ChatGPT, that you can use to brainstorm ideas, generate and edit writing, and repurpose content, among other things. I've experimented with numerous AI writing tools, including ChatGPT, Writer, Jasper, Lex, Copy.ai, and Reword. I've found Claude to be a standout option. The good stuff: What I appreciate most about Claude is how human it sounds. The outputs feel more natural and require less editing than many other AI writing tools I've tried. I've also been finding Claude's Projects feature useful lately. You can add resources and custom instructions to use across multiple chats. So you don't need to add the same files and instructions over and over again. For example, I used Claude for an upcoming Buffer article to brainstorm a new outline that will be more skimmable, noting the resources I'd attached to the project: Claude also offers limited use on its free plan. So when my workload is lighter, the free plan suffices, which has led to me only paying for Claude for four out of ten months so far this year. While Claude is great for individual writing tasks, software like Narrato or Blaze might be worth exploring for teams managing large amounts of content. They offer additional features for collaboration, content repurposing, and publishing that I've found intriguing. Pricing: Free version available. Paid plans start at $20/month. Is your website getting traffic, but not enough visitors are taking action? That's where conversion optimization software comes in handy. These digital marketing tools help you maximize your website's effectiveness at turning visitors into leads or customers — so you get more out of all your marketing efforts. Let's talk about A/B testing (or split-testing) with our first conversion optimization software: VWO. A/B testing is used to determine the best way to display different elements on your website that will lead to the most conversions. For example, you might test different colors or copy for your CTAs (calls-to-action) or timing on a popup. The good stuff: VWO is a great option for small businesses due to its approachable pricing that scales with you as you grow. Pricing: 30-day free trial available. Paid plans start at $633/month, billed annually. Another important aspect of conversion optimization is personalizing your website — tailoring your visitors' experience depending on their actions. For example, you might show an exit-intent popup if they're about to leave, or recommend products based on their purchase history and other first-party data you've collected. This is where ConvertFlow comes in. Now, full disclosure: I used to work at ConvertFlow, so I'm a little biased. But I think it's a powerful tool for any business looking to personalize their website and guide their site visitors' experience. The good stuff: What sets ConvertFlow apart is the ability it gives you to create complex, multi-step campaigns without any coding. Its drag-and-drop builder lets anyone on your team create campaigns — something I wish I had at other brands when I had to rely on a designer for any requests. Pricing: Free plan lets you build campaigns, though you'll need to upgrade to publish them on your website. Paid plans start at $299/month. If you're running an online store, getting conversions is one piece of the revenue puzzle. But increasing cart values lets you boost your bottom line without acquiring new customers. Cody Plofker, Chief Marketing and Revenue Officer at Jones Road Beauty, stands by Aftersell to increase average order value through smart upsells and cross-sells. The good stuff: Cody shared in a recent newsletter that he appreciates Aftersell because it has a great team and it's cheaper than similar options. "You can get post-purchase upsells, in-checkout blocks, and network offers in one tool with a capped pricing model," he says. What's particularly clever about Aftersell is its focus on high-intent shoppers. People who already have items in their cart or have just purchased are already in a buying mood, so it's a great time to upsell or cross-sell items they might be interested in. Pricing: Aftersell offers modular pricing, depending on which features you want, starting at $34.99/month. It can be easy to burn through your paid ads budget without seeing results. That's where paid advertising tools come in handy. They help ensure you're maximizing your ROAS (return on ad spend) and targeting the right audiences. Wondering how your Google Ads campaigns are stacking up? Wordstream's Google Ads Performance Grader lets you gain quick, actionable insights — and it's completely free. The good stuff: It takes the complex data from your account and translates it into clear, actionable advice. Pricing: Free. If you've ever felt like you're walking in a dark room when it comes to your Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok ads, Atria is like flipping on the lights. The good stuff: Atria is really leaning into its AI features to stand out from other options in this space. Its AI can analyze your best performers and use that data to generate new ad ideas, even providing a conversion score to help you pick the most effective copy. Plus, curated "top picks" showcase winning ads from various industries, giving you a shortcut to what's working right now in paid advertising. Pricing: Free trial available. Paid plans start at $159/month. Marketing analytics tools give you X-ray vision into your marketing efforts. They help you see what's working so you can amplify successful efforts and adjust anything that's falling flat. As far as free tools go, Google Analytics is a powerhouse. I've used it at every company I've worked with for over a decade — and for good reason. It's got a surprising amount of depth and flexibility for a free analytics tool. The good stuff: What I appreciate most about Google Analytics is its ability to adapt to your specific business needs. The custom conversion events let you track anything from newsletter signups to product purchases, giving you a clear picture of how users interact with your site. If you don't have the budget to invest in a more comprehensive or automated tool, Google Analytics will give you most of what you need. If you're not already using it, I recommend implementing it ASAP to build up your historical data. There is a paid version (Google Analytics 360), but I've never used it — likely because its hefty starting price of $50k/year is out of reach for most small businesses. Pricing: Free. Hotjar reveals how users interact with your website — taking the guesswork out of your visitor experience. The good stuff: What I love most about Hotjar is how it combines quantitative data with qualitative insights. The heatmaps and recordings show you what users do, while the feedback tools help you understand why they do it. E-commerce retention expert Elliot Kovac praised Hotjar on X for the clarity it brings to user behavior: "You’ll be able to see the biggest drop-off points quite easily and take action to resolve." It's a helpful software for businesses in any industry. Pricing: Free plan for up to 200,000 monthly sessions. Paid plans start at $49/month. If you have a mobile app or web-based digital product, Amplitude's robust analytics platform provides valuable insights into user behavior, ultimately allowing you to improve retention. The good stuff: What sets Amplitude apart is its focus on behavioral cohorts. Instead of just looking at demographics, you can group users based on their actions. This can help you identify your power users and understand what features keep them coming back. Pricing: Free plan for up to 10 million events/month. Paid plans start at $61/month. This is another tool I wish I had when I was working at e-commerce brands. For Shopify store owners, Lifetimely offers a crystal-clear view of customer behavior and lifetime value, helping you make data-driven decisions to boost profitability and grow your store strategically. The good stuff: Plus, the ability to predict customer lifetime value. This insight lets you focus your marketing efforts on your most valuable customers and improve profitability. Max Bidna, who goes by Marketing Max, reports on X that Lifetimely's Shopify charts "are second to none in terms of helping you understand the LTV from different customer segments and from different acquisition channels." Plus, the ability to compare your store's performance against others in your industry gives you a clear picture of where you stand and where you can improve. Bonus: All features are available on all plans, making it easy to grow your Shopify store. Pricing: Free plan up to 50 orders per month. Paid plans start at $149/month. You now have access to a comprehensive collection of digital marketing tools, each designed to help with specific aspects of your marketing efforts. But you don't need to implement everything at once. Start by identifying your most pressing marketing challenges. Is it maintaining a consistent social media presence? Understanding your website visitors' behavior? Or maybe you're looking to get into influencer marketing for the first time? Choose one or two areas to focus on initially and adopt the tools that address those needs. When you're ready to try a new channel or optimize an existing one, you can come back to explore your options and gradually expand your digital marketing toolkit. Angela — a writer and former e-commerce marketer — transforms real social media success stories into actionable insights, empowering emerging brands and creators to succeed in their marketing efforts. 190,000+ creators, small businesses, and marketers use Buffer to grow their audiences every month.

That’s why choosing the right SEO plugin for the AI search era can feel like a high-stakes decision for your business. I’ve spent months testing Rank Math vs. All in One SEO to see which one actually keeps your traffic safe. You need a tool that handles the technical heavy lifting so you can focus on your work. In this review, I’ll share my personal experience using both tools on real websites. I found that one of these plugins is far better at preparing your site for the future of AI. I want to help you feel confident that you aren’t just guessing with your SEO. My goal is to show you which choice will grow with your business without causing technical headaches. If you are looking for the best SEO plugin to future-proof your site for the AI search era, All in One SEO (AIOSEO) is the winner. While Rank Math offers great tools for manual optimization, AIOSEO provides the specific technical infrastructure needed for Generative Engine Optimization (GEO). Before we dive into the in-depth comparison, here is my quick overview: Since 2009, WPBeginner has been helping millions of WordPress users build and grow their websites. We’ve used and worked with SEO plugins daily in real-world scenarios to grow our own businesses. For this comparison, we used the premium versions of both All in One SEO and Rank Math in live testing environments to evaluate every feature, technical setting, and AI integration they offer. For more information about how we evaluate WordPress tools, see our editorial guidelines. I have broken down this comparison into the following key sections: Setting up an SEO plugin should be straightforward. You want a tool that configures the basics correctly without asking a hundred confusing questions. AIOSEO uses a very friendly step-by-step setup wizard. The first thing you notice upon plugin activation is how it immediately launches a “Let’s Get Started” screen that feels very welcoming. It will then ask for your website category. You can pick if your site is a blog, news site, online store, or small business. I found this helpful because it tailors the settings for you. I really like the “Person or Organization” step. This is where you add your logo and social profile URLs. Google uses this data for its Knowledge Panel, and AIOSEO makes it simple to fill out. The wizard also handles advanced technical SEO settings for you behind the scenes. You can still tweak those settings if you want, but the wizard gives you an optimal starting point. If you want to follow along, we have a detailed guide for AIOSEO that walks you through every single step. I found that most users can finish the entire process in less than 5 minutes. Rank Math also has a setup wizard, but it feels a bit different. When I activated it, the first thing I saw was a prompt to connect a Rank Math account. I found this a bit frustrating because I had to create yet another account just to use the plugin. You can skip it, but you lose access to some of the best features. Once inside, you have to choose between Easy, Advanced, or Custom modes. I noticed that many beginners choose “Easy,” but then they miss out on the advanced schema tools later. I was impressed by the compatibility check. It scans your site for conflicting plugins before you start. This prevented a lot of technical headaches for me during my testing. I found the Rank Math wizard to be very detailed. It covers everything from Sitemap configuration to Role Manager. However, it feels more like sitting in the cockpit of a plane with many toggles and switches. I recommend All in One SEO for this category. It follows the “Set and Forget” philosophy that is so important for busy business owners. It makes smart decisions for you right out of the box. Rank Math is excellent if you love to “tinker” with every small detail. But for a clean and fast setup, AIOSEO is the clear winner for beginners. I found that a smooth setup sets the stage for everything else. Now that we have the foundations ready, let’s look at how these tools help you with your daily SEO work. Most of your time won’t be spent in the plugin settings. It will be spent inside the WordPress block editor, writing content, creating pages, and managing your business. I wanted to see which tool actually helps you write better and more SEO-friendly. In other words, which plugin offers a better on-page SEO experience for users? The following table compares the on-page SEO features available directly within the WordPress editor for both plugins. This comparison highlights how each tool helps your team during the actual content creation process. Now, I’ll walk you through my experience with each of the plugins. When you write a post with AIOSEO, you get a TruSEO score in the top right corner. I found this incredibly motivating. It isn’t just a number. Instead, it’s a smart checklist of over 70 different SEO factors. I really like the General tab. It breaks your post down into “Basic SEO,” “Title,” and “Readability.” For example, if your paragraphs are too long, AIOSEO will highlight them in orange and tell you exactly how to fix them. It feels like having a professional editor looking over your shoulder. Another feature that stands out is the Headline Analyzer. Before I publish, I always check my title score. It looks for “Power Words” and “Emotional Words” that encourage people to click. I managed to increase the click-through rate on my latest tutorial just by following the suggestion to add an “action” word to my title. Another bonus tool worth mentioning is SEOBoost. It is a powerful AI Writing Assistant that offers real-time SEO guidance within the WordPress editor. Get keyword suggestions, readability checks, competitor insights, and more – all in one place. The downside is that it requires a paid SEOBoost subscription (Starting from $22.50). Apart from the usual Focus Keyword, Title, and Meta Description optimization, AIOSEO comes with full support for schema markup with built-in blocks for several popular content types like recipes, products, FAQs, table of contents, and more. Rank Math takes a similar but slightly different approach. The free version allows you to track up to 5 focus keywords, which is very generous. I found this helpful when I wanted to rank for a main topic and a few related sub-topics at the same time. They also have a feature called Content AI. This uses artificial intelligence to scan the web and tell you exactly how many words, headings, and images you should use to beat the top-ranking sites. It gives you a “target” to hit, which is great for competitive niches. However, I noticed that Rank Math’s editor can feel a bit “busy.” There are a lot of numbers and suggestions flying at you at once. If you are a minimalist writer, you might find the AIOSEO interface a bit more peaceful and easier to navigate. You want your posts to look great when they are shared on Facebook or X (Twitter). Both plugins have a “Social” tab, but I found AIOSEO’s preview to be more accurate. In AIOSEO, you can choose which specific image from your post to display as the “Social Image.” This is a lifesaver if your featured image doesn’t quite fit the square Facebook layout. Rank Math also offers this, but I found the “Overlay” icons in Rank Math to be a bit much for most professional business sites. AIOSEO is better for writers who want clear, actionable advice on making their content more readable and clickable. On the other hand, Rank Math is better for SEO pros who want to “over-optimize” for multiple keywords and use AI to research their competition. Writing great content is only half the battle. In 2026, you also have to make sure the “robots” and AI Crawlers can read your site properly. The rules of SEO have changed. It isn’t just about showing up in a list of blue links on Google anymore. Google’s new AI Search and other AI platforms like ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity are answering the users directly without them ever visiting your website. These are called zero-click searches. The strategy to survive in this landscape is called Generative Engine Optimization (GEO). Just like traditional SEO, GEO helps you position your brand to appear in AI answers, cited as sources, and mentioned as the authority. I tested both plugins to see which one helps you survive this shift. The folks at All in One SEO are incredibly fast at adapting to the new AI search era. Here are some of the features they have recently added to give users the cutting-edge advantage: 1. AI Keyword Report: Tracking “Ghost Queries” AIOSEO includes a brand-new AI Keyword Report that I find revolutionary. This tool shows you if ChatGPT or Gemini is actually citing your brand. I discovered what AIOSEO calls “Ghost Queries.” These are terms where I rank #1 on Google, but AI search engines completely ignore me. AIOSEO helps me find these gaps so I can fix my content for AI platforms. Related: See my tips on getting your content cited by AI Tools 2. Controlling the AI Crawl (llms.txt) AI models need to “read” your site efficiently. AIOSEO makes it super easy to create an llms.txt file automatically. It goes a step further with llms-full.txt. This automatically translates your content into “Markdown,” a clean text format that is much easier for AI robots to read and understand than standard HTML code. 3. AI Content and Image Generation All in One SEO comes with built-in AI content generation. Simply describe your content, and it will take care of the rest. This helps you write 10x faster and without leaving the WordPress dashboard. It goes beyond text and has an integrated AI Image Generator. Simply add an image block to your content and click on the ‘Generate with AI’ button. Then describe the image you want to add, and it will generate it for you. Rank Math takes a different approach. While AIOSEO focuses on helping you rank in AI results, Rank Math focuses heavily on helping you write content using AI. Here is how their tools stack up for the AI era: 1. AI Search Traffic (Tracking Clicks, Not Rankings) Rank Math introduced a feature called AI Search Traffic. It connects to your Google Search Console and analytics and filters the data to show you how many visitors came from AI tools like ChatGPT. While useful, this is a “rear-view mirror” tool. It only tells you about the success you already had (the people who clicked). It stays completely blind to “zero-click” citations—where ChatGPT gives your answer, but the user never visits your site. 2. Content AI (Writing Assistant) This is Rank Math’s biggest AI feature. It is a suite of 40+ AI writing templates built into your dashboard. You can use it to write blog post outlines, fix grammar, or generate social media captions. It uses a credit system (you have to buy credits) to run. Overall, it helps you produce content faster, but it doesn’t necessarily help that content rank better in AI search engines. 3. Basic llms.txt Support Like AIOSEO, Rank Math allows you to create an llms.txt file to help AI bots find your links. However, it currently lacks the advanced llms-full.txt feature with Markdown conversion. It points the bots to your pages, but it doesn’t translate the content into the “robot-friendly” language that AIOSEO does. Rank Math has excellent writing tools, but there are plenty of free tools (like ChatGPT itself) that can do that. All in One SEO is the clear winner here because it provides infrastructure. Its AI Keyword Report and llms-full.txt features give you a technical advantage that actually helps you rank in the new world of AI Search. Rank Math helps you write, but AIOSEO helps you win. Technical SEO is like the “plumbing” of your site’s SEO structure. If the pipes are broken, then search engines and AI agents cannot crawl or index your content effectively. For businesses, having an SEO plugin that automates complex technical tasks makes a big impact. For instance, fixing broken links or finding “orphaned content” manually can be time-consuming. You need a tool that handles this in minutes so you can prevent costly errors and save your team’s time. AIOSEO focuses heavily on automation and efficiency. My favorite feature here is the Link Assistant, which is a powerful internal linking tool integrated into your WordPress dashboard. It automatically scans your entire site to find “Orphan Pages”. These are high-quality posts that have no internal links pointing to them. The real game-changer is the “One-Click Insertion” dashboard. You can add internal links to your posts directly from the Link Assistant report without ever opening the WordPress editor. I estimate this saves about 40 to 50 hours of manual labor during a standard site audit. On the infrastructure side, AIOSEO’s Redirection Manager is built for speed. It allows you to export redirects to server-level files (.htaccess or nginx). This makes your redirects lightning-fast because they process before WordPress or the database even loads. Its modern architecture uses separate database tables to keep your site fast as your business grows. Rank Math offers a powerful set of technical tools, but the workflow often requires much more manual effort. For internal linking, it provides suggestions in a sidebar while you are writing. However, you still have to manually copy the suggested link and paste it into your text yourself. While Rank Math includes a Redirection Manager, it mostly relies on PHP-based redirection. This method is technically slower than AIOSEO’s server-level approach because the server must load the WordPress core before the redirect can execute. Under heavy traffic, this can cause “Time to First Byte” lag. Additionally, Rank Math is sometimes criticized in technical circles for “feature bloat.” Its feature-jamming approach can leave a larger footprint in your database, even if you disable certain modules. All in One SEO is the clear winner for technical SEO. While both plugins offer similar features on paper, AIOSEO automates the actual execution of these tasks. The ability to inject internal links with one click and handle redirects at the server level provides a better Return on Investment (ROI) by saving you significant time and keeping your site fast. For a business, the user interface is not just about looks. It directly impacts how much work you and your team get done. A “bloated” plugin can clutter your dashboard and make it harder for you to find things. AIOSEO follows a distinct design philosophy: “Decisions, not Options.” This means the plugin is designed to be clean, professional, and less intrusive. I like that its onboarding wizard uses plain-English questions to configure technical settings in the background. This allows you to set up your SEO in minutes rather than spending time searching Google to understand what everything means. From a technical standpoint, AIOSEO is built for speed and stability. Following a complete code refactoring, the plugin uses separate database tables for its data. This ensures that even as your site grows from a few dozen pages to over 100,000, the SEO plugin never becomes a performance bottleneck or slows down your WordPress admin dashboard. I also like AIOSEO’s design aesthetics with readable typography, plenty of spacing, and clear navigation. Rank Math is frequently criticized for “feature creep” or “bloat.” While it uses a modular design, code analysis suggests that even disabled modules can leave behind extra database tables and options that hurt performance. I noticed that Rank Math’s dashboard can feel quite busy, making it harder for non-technical users to find what they need. Plus, many users have reported frustration with Rank Math’s intrusive marketing. The dashboard often displays banners for credit upsells, and a “Write with AI” button frequently appears in the content editor. For professional writers, this can be visual clutter and a distraction. Its interface is often described as overwhelming due to the sheer volume of buttons and settings. The user interface uses a smaller font and buttons, which makes the design and navigation feel overwhelming at times. All in One SEO is the superior choice for user experience. It provides a cleaner, faster, and more professional environment. By focusing on “Decisions, not Options” and maintaining a database architecture that prevents site slowdowns, AIOSEO is an enterprise-grade tool that respects both your time and your website’s performance. On the other hand, Rank Math feels like a desk covered in post-it notes, advertisements, and gadgets you didn’t ask for. It’s functional but distracting. Depending on your business, you may need specialized SEO features that are critical for your business. For instance, retail businesses need local SEO to appear in the search results in their target area and region. Similarly, an eCommerce store needs product optimization to appear in shopping results. AIOSEO offers a comprehensive, wizard-driven Local SEO module that simplifies complex tasks. Setting up a Google My Business profile is super easy, including Google Maps integration. It also includes a functional Store Locator block and an automated Opening Hours Schema that handles holidays and special exceptions. This ensures that Google always knows exactly when your doors are open. For eCommerce, AIOSEO’s WooCommerce integration is excellent. It automatically populates product schema, such as price and availability, so your listings look professional in search results. Not using a shopping cart plugin? No worries, you can add a product block to display and sell products anywhere on your site (compatible with popular payment plugins like WP Simple Pay). Another standout feature is its “expired product” logic in the Redirection Manager. When a product is discontinued, you can set up an automatic redirect to a parent category to avoid a 404 error. This preserves your hard-earned “link juice” and keeps customers on your site. Additionally, its AI Image Generator lets you turn generic supplier photos into unique visual assets, which helps you avoid “duplicate content” penalties in image search. Rank Math provides multi-location support and local business schema, but I found the configuration to be complex and less intuitive for non-technical users. It lets you set up a Google My Business profile by adding supported data. While it includes a Schema Generator for products, it lacks the specialized “expired product” redirection logic found in AIOSEO. This means you have to manage discontinued products manually or risk losing search rankings. All in One SEO is the winner here. Its automated handling of expired products and the ability to generate unique product images with AI give eCommerce sites a massive competitive edge. Meanwhile, its Local SEO wizard makes “Map Pack” optimization accessible to every business owner. For agencies and growing teams, Security and Access Control are non-negotiable. Without granular permissions, a junior editor could accidentally “nuke” a site’s global schema or sitemap settings. This can lead to a catastrophic drop in search rankings that could take months to fix. AIOSEO is often called the “Enterprise Choice” because of its powerful security standards. It provides a Granular Role Manager that lets you let staff optimize meta tags while strictly restricting access to global infrastructure, such as redirects or sitemaps. This “Decisions, not Options” philosophy ensures that the interface remains clean and safe for your clients. I’ve found that this level of control is a lifesaver for agency owners who want to prevent human error. Rank Math includes a role manager, but it has been reported as less intuitive and occasionally buggy, particularly in WordPress multisite environments. The user experience is also hurt by “feature creep.” For example, frequent dashboard ads for credit upsells and “Write with AI” buttons appearing directly inside content editor fields create a lot of visual noise. This cluttered environment increases the risk of accidental configuration errors by less experienced users who might get distracted by the gadgets and ads. All in One SEO wins for its professional, “clean” environment. Its focus on stability and restrictive access protects business owners from mistakes. This makes it the safer and more reliable choice for anyone managing a professional team or multiple client sites. You want to know that help is there when you need it. I’ve dealt with support teams for both companies. AIOSEO is part of the Awesome Motive family. They have a massive team that also supports plugins like WPForms and MonsterInsights. I found their documentation to be written in plain English. It is very easy for a beginner to follow their step-by-step tutorials. Rank Math also has a great community and a 24/7 forum. I liked their AI support bot, which offered quick answers to common questions. However, I found their replies can sometimes be a bit technical for a non-coder. Winner: Tie Both plugins have excellent documentation and quick support channels to get help. The common myth is that Rank Math is cheaper. When I looked at the 2026 pricing, I found the “Agency Tier” story is very different. I believe AIOSEO Elite offers the best value for agencies. It includes the AI Keyword Report and advanced client management for a much lower price than Rank Math’s top tier. AI Credits Pricing All in One SEO’s included AI credits are quite enough for most small businesses and blogs. You only need to pay if you have used up all your AI monthly credits and need to replenish them. Rank Math’s yearly plans don’t have a pay-as-you-go option. You get a set amount of credits each month, and if you have consumed them, you have to upgrade to a higher annual plan. Winner: All in One SEO Choosing the right SEO plugin is about future-proofing your business. Here is my final verdict. I recommend All in One SEO (AIOSEO) for business owners and agencies. It is the only WordPress SEO plugin that helps you gain visibility into AI search results. The Link Assistant and AI Keyword Report provide a massive Return on Investment. It saves you time and shows you data that Rank Math simply doesn’t have. I recommend Rank Math for hobbyists and smaller blogs or portfolio sites. It is a great tool if you enjoy micro-managing every single technical toggle. But for now, AIOSEO has captured the high ground. It is the smarter, more stable choice for the AI search era. In the rapidly changing world of AI search, you likely have specific concerns about how these tools impact your site’s performance and workflow. Here are my answers to those questions: Will I lose my current search rankings if I switch from Rank Math to AIOSEO? No, switching plugins does not hurt your rankings if done correctly. All in One SEO includes a built-in Setup Wizard that can import all your titles, descriptions, and schema settings from Rank Math in one click. This ensures a seamless transition without losing your SEO progress. Does AIOSEO’s content analysis work with page builders like Elementor or Divi? Yes, both plugins have deep integrations with popular page builders. In 2026, you can access the TruSEO score and AI insights directly within the Elementor or Divi editor sidebars, allowing you to optimize your design and content simultaneously. Do I need to buy my own OpenAI API key to use the AI features? No, you do not need a separate API key. Both plugins use their own secure connections to provide AI features. AIOSEO includes a generous amount of monthly credits with its plans, whereas Rank Math requires a separate recurring subscription for its Content AI tools. What is the benefit of the llms-full.txt file found in AIOSEO? The standard llms.txt is just a list of links, but llms-full.txt provides the actual content of your pages in a clean Markdown format. This is critical because it allows AI agents like ChatGPT and Claude to “ingest” your content much more accurately, increasing your chances of being cited as a source. Is Rank Math still the best free option for hobbyists? Rank Math remains a popular choice for users who want a lot of technical toggles for free. However, for business owners who need “Generative Engine Optimization” (GEO) features like AI Keyword tracking, the premium versions of AIOSEO have become the industry standard in 2026. Can I use both plugins at the same time? No, you should never run two SEO plugins simultaneously. This causes technical conflicts, slows down your site, and confuses search engine crawlers. It is best to choose one plugin that fits your business goals and stick with it.

Title: Even the Wall Street Journal Doubts the Trump Seize-Venezuela-Oil Scheme

Alert readers immediately noticed the disconnect between Trump’s signature braggadocio and the more cautious remarks from the other members of Trump’s team after the kidnapping of Venezuela’s president Nicholas Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores. Trump skipped the narco-terrorism pretext despite a US indictment being the pretext for the abduction; he instead talked up having US companies exploit Venezuela’s reserves: “We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country.” But many observers quickly compared the Trump press conference to Bush’s “Mission Accomplished” moment as the Venezuela government not only remains in place but its acting president Delcy Rodriguez maintains that Maduro remains the country’s leader and that Venezuela will not cede to US colonialist demands. And perhaps being a smidge more realistic, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, by contrast, presented the US as having narrower aims, of simply removing Maduro, at the initial presser, and has been trying to square the circle of Trump being high on his show of force versus the fact that the US is not even remotely in control of Venezuela. From Politico: In the wake of the U.S.’s capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday made it clear that it is somewhat unclear what’s next for the Latin American country. His comments come as Democratic leaders continue to decry the administration’s actions in Venezuela and push for the White House to seek congressional approval for such military operations. In multiple interviews, Rubio emphasized that the U.S. is not at war with Venezuela but stopped short of explaining exactly what the U.S. role in the country will look like as both nations reel from Maduro’s arrest — and in the aftermath of President Donald Trump’s statement Saturday that the U.S. would “run” Venezuela for an indeterminate time. “We are at war against drug trafficking organizations, not at war against Venezuela,” Rubio told NBC’s “Meet the Press.” Rubio added that oil sanctions will remain in place, and the U.S. reserves the right to issue strikes against alleged drug boats heading toward America. But while Rubio told CBS’ “Face the Nation” that the U.S. is not occupying Venezuela, he did not reject the idea that it could be a future option from the Trump administration. Trump, Rubio said, “does not feel like he is going to publicly rule out options that are available for the United States, even though that’s not what you’re seeing right now.” “What you’re seeing right now is a quarantine that allows us to exert tremendous leverage over what happens next,” he added. Many experts with knowledge of the region, such as Larry Johnson, have given repeated, long-form accounts of how much harder it would be to conquer Venezuela that Iraq, even before factoring in that our army is much smaller and weaker now than then. A short version of this line of argument from Modern War Monitor: Venezuela is heavily armed. Years of political polarization, along with an expanded role for security forces and pro-government colectivos, mean that weapons and combat experience are not in short supply. The country’s borders are long, porous and already used by guerrillas, paramilitaries, and criminal networks. To see what that might look like in practice, you don’t have to speculate; you can look next door. Colombia’s armed conflict, officially dating from 1964, pitted the state against FARC, ELN, and a web of paramilitary and criminal actors for decades. It persisted, in part, because armed groups could slip across borders, find safe havens, move contraband, and restock. Even with massive US funding under Plan Colombia and repeated “final” offensives, the state never achieved a clean victory; violence simply changed shape. Translate that pattern into a post-Maduro Venezuela run in practice by US–backed figures, and you can sketch the basic dynamic. There will be bombings of police stations and government offices, high-profile assassinations, and attacks on oil infrastructure. Kidnapping Americans or US contractors will become a lucrative tactic. Armed groups will drift across the Colombian and Brazilian borders and into the jungle or mountains when pressure grows. Even Sky News is reporting that men and women on the street are speaking out on behalf of the current regime: 🗣️ "The US is not interested in freedom or democracy, it is interested in our oil." Venezuelans gathered in Caracas to express their solidarity with Nicolas Maduro, who was captured by the United States following a series of airstrikes. Latest updates: https://t.co/4w875fZU8W pic.twitter.com/b5byRmj15m — Sky News (@SkyNews) January 4, 2026 So oil theater is signature Trump, of acting like empty bags have value. He talked up his “raw earths” deal with Zelensky, which still proved to be a difficult negotiation even with the US theoretically holding all the card by providing Ukraine with critical intel and targeting along with weapons, particularly air defenses. And that’s before getting to the fact that as of when the agreement was inked, over one-half of the “Ukraine” reserves were in Russian hands, and how much of Ukraine eventually winds up being formally part of Russia and/or in a rump Ukraine that is a Russian vassal is up in the air. Similarly, in the 28 to 20 point piece plan floating about, Trump’s negotiators Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner claim that one of two really key US demands involves joint ownership of the Zaporzhizhia nuclear power plant and the disposition of its energy. This idea is delusional. Russia deems Zaprozhizhia to be part of Russia and is not going to hand part of the nuclear facility to the US to make nice to Trump. We’ve already discussed that wringing more production out of Venezuela’s oil fields would require a long period of investment before any real payoff took place. And the precedent of Iraq, where we had occupied the country, bodes ill. Despite oil being seen as the most logical objective for the US invasion, it was years before oil producers started investing. Admittedly, the embargo is increasing pressure on the Venezuela government. Venezuela’s state oil company PDVSA is cutting crude production because it is running out of storage capacity due to an ongoing US oil blockade that has halted exports, increasing pressure on the interim government https://t.co/eAelegFxHM pic.twitter.com/sIs9UqaQei — Reuters Business (@ReutersBiz) January 5, 2026 So why not stick with Plan A? Was this yet another manifestation of Trump’s extreme need to be seen as dominating world events? To create a distraction from the Epstein files and increasing certainty that Russia will secure a military victory in Ukraine, which will mean Trump lost? IMHO the initial apparent success of the Trump “Raid not invade” in Caracas almost assures that he will take Greenland when Ukraine is clearly toast. Not surprisingly, the mainstream media is raising eyebrows over Trump’s grandiose oil exploitation claims. It is true that the US has motive, in that our refineries are tuned so that 70% of the oil they process is heavier grades, despite the US producing light sweet crudes.1 And commentators have pointed out that after the US sanctioned Russia, cutting it off from its medium heavy crude. Even though Russian supplies purportedly represented only 3% of US imports and experts predicted that its loss would matter little to the US, Biden turned to Venezuela almost immediately after imposing the shock and awe sanctions, explicitly to replace Russian fuel. However, heavy and sour (as in sulfur-ridden) crude of the Venezuela sort is expensive to process. The current low oil price environment, driven by less-than-robust growth in much of the world,2 is an unfavorable backdrop, even before getting to perfectly reasonable big corporate concerns about safety and expropriation risk. Do not be fooled by Trump likely succeeding in having a flurry of meetings with big oil execs. There was also a lot of dog-and-pony showing for a Ukraine reconstruction fund, starting under Biden, that continued with Trump. Many misread the involvement of giant fund manager BlackRock, which had signed up only as an adviser and had not committed any money. We featured an OilPrice article in late 2025 that argued that it didn’t make economic sense for the US to try to seize Venezuela’s oil. First from our long intro: This article explains why Venezuela’s oil is not of much strategic value to the US and its infrastructure would take a lot of investment over a long time to bring up to snuff. Yet Trump has shifted his justification from narco-terrorism to, erm, retaking the oil and other assets, in going to war with Venezuela (recall a blockade is an act of war)… Recall that after the weapons of mass destruction justification for the Iraq war fell apart, the Administration then provided a series of pretexts, even as most observers argued that the oil was the reason. Iraq then had the world’s second largest proven reserves, and they were highly prized light sweet crude. And while the US still has substantial control over Iraq’s oil exports, the US were slow to invest in Iraq’s oil infrastructure. I cannot find the source, but I recall reading that the majors were not comfortable the US level of exploitation of the Iraqi resource…. A 2012 Aljazeera story intimated that the Western firms, even though they won the critical oil concessions after the war, had not done as well as they had hoped, confirming the idea that the exploitation of the Iraq resource was not handled in an expeditious manner…. But my impression is that the later theories, that Iraq was a stepping stone on the way to subjugating Iran, and the oil was at most a secondary objective, are on target. From the OilPrice article proper: The Wall Street Journal story flagged in our headline comes to similar conclusions. From Trump Wants to Unlock Venezuela’s Oil Reserves. A Huge Challenge Awaits: The Trump administration’s move to oust Venezuelan strongman Nicolás Maduro…. will pave the way for U.S. oil companies to regain a foothold in the South American nation, President Trump said at a Mar-a-Lago press conference. “We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country,” he said. But getting foreign companies to flock back to Venezuela will be a massive challenge. Chevron is the only major U.S. oil company there…. Other oil executives will be forced to gauge the stability on the ground in a country where the industry has fallen into disarray… The other obstacle facing Trump’s effort to put more of Venezuela’s viscous crude into the global market is that the world doesn’t have much of an appetite for more oil… The U.S. hasn’t detailed the mechanics of how it would bring more American oil companies into Venezuela to boost production. Analysts say it could facilitate a process that would allow companies to bid for oil and gas blocks and question whether European companies could also bid for the right to enter the country. As readers know, that assumes subjugation of Venezuela or cooperation that has yet to be in evidence. The article cited a statement by Chevron being “focused” on employee safety and “integrity” of its Venezuela operation. Not hard to read that as an expression of heightened concern. In passing, it also signaled doubt about whether the level of Venezuelan reserves are as large as claimed (supposedly the largest in the world). This is not crazy. Matthew Simmons of Peak Oil fame produced tables showing OPEC members posting sudden increases in claimed reserves, which he documented had no substantiation (as in no new discoveries or changes in production methods that could lead to bigger supplies from existing assets). He argued a big reason for these rises was that OPEC set production levels among its members based on their proven reserves. Back to the Journal: In the U.S., the shale boom unleashed record levels of oil production, but the kind of oil American frackers are pumping doesn’t work as well as heavy crude produced in Venezuela, Canada and Mexico. Venezuela’s government says its proved oil reserves top 300 billion barrels, which, if true, would make its bounty the world’s largest. Other big oil companies that are potentially interested in re-entering Venezuela will almost certainly take time to evaluate the situation because the country has a track record of appropriating oil assets, as it did in the 1970s and the 2000s, analysts said. ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil pulled out of Venezuela in 2007 after then-President Hugo Chávez nationalized their assets. Conoco later sued the Venezuelan government for more than $20 billion; Exxon sued for $12 billion. The companies were awarded fractions of their losses in protracted arbitration proceedings… Orlando Ochoa, a Caracas-based economist and a visiting fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, described the Herculean task of jump-starting the moribund energy industry, which has seen tens of thousands of trained professionals flee the country under Maduro’s authoritarian rule. He said that includes drafting a broad economic stabilization plan to attract the financing Venezuela badly needs from multilateral lenders to rebuild infrastructure and rusted oil-field installations. Local laws need to be modified to allow private energy firms to operate without state overreach, he added. And the government has to restructure some $160 billion in debt and settle pending arbitration cases with foreign companies to convince them to come back. “What the U.S. needs to do is to implement a form of a Marshall Plan,” said Ochoa, referring to the economic program that helped rebuild Europe after World War II. “This is about much more than coming into the oil and gas sector just to extract crude from the ground.” Good luck with that. This is from a bunch that is so seat-of-the-pants that it can’t even conduct negotiations with Russia on a disciplined basis. Reuters echoes the Journal’s concerns: Venezuela was a founding member of OPEC with Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Its struggles with electricity production have repeatedly hampered mining and oil operations. The country was producing as much as 3.5 million barrels per day of crude in the 1970s, which at the time represented over 7% of global oil output. Production fell below 2 million bpd during the 2010s and averaged some 1.1 million bpd last year or just 1% of global production. That’s roughly the same production as the U.S. state of North Dakota. “If developments ultimately lead to a genuine regime change, this could even result in more oil on the market over time. However, it will take time for production to recover fully,” said Arne Lohmann Rasmussen from Global Risk Management… “History shows that forced regime change rarely stabilises oil supply quickly, with Libya and Iraq offering clear and sobering precedents,” said Jorge Leon, head of geopolitical analysis at Rystad Energy. Reuters usefully presents 2019 and 2021 data from Venezuela on gold, coal and nickel reserves. It also includes this interesting factoid: Venezuela owes about $10 billion to China after China became the largest lender under late President Hugo Chavez. Venezuela repays loans with crude transported in three very large crude carriers previously co-owned by Venezuela and China. But Reuters oddly does not mention the large gas field off the coast of Venezuela and Guyana, which relates to a long-standing territorial dispute.3 Finally from the New York Times: The national oil company, known as PDVSA, lacks the capital and expertise to increase production. The country’s oil fields are run down and suffer from “years of insufficient drilling, dilapidated infrastructure, frequent power cuts and equipment theft,” according to a recent study by Energy Aspects, a research firm. The United States has placed sanctions on Venezuelan oil, which is now exported primarily to China….. In theory, if U.S. oil companies were given greater access in Venezuela, they could help gradually turn the industry around. “But it’s not going to be a straightforward proposition,” said Richard Bronze, head of geopolitics at Energy Aspects. Analysts say increasing Venezuelan production will not be cheap. Energy Aspects estimated that adding another half a million barrels a day of production would cost $10 billion and take about two years. Major increases might require “tens of billions of dollars over multiple years,” the firm said. Some experts are throwing even more cold water on the Trump hoped-for oil heist. Be sure to click through. The analysis is detailed and devastating. I have spent a lot of time talking shit at people with opinions on Venezuela's oil production potential, and how it's going to "RePLaCe CanADa". So here's my contribution — how I see the cost of replacing Canadian crude with Venezuelan heavy. I think it's a nearly $1 trillion… pic.twitter.com/XFlPVwPdew — Michael Spyker (@ShaleTier7) January 4, 2026 To entice you to read the whole tweet, one paragraph from the middle: The problem is they don’t have the power infrastructure to add the power needed for 3MMBbls/d of SAGD for steam generation, and even for primary recovery they don’t have the electricity they need. So you need to build 10-15 GW of new power infra, at gas-fired capital cost including transmission and the new midstream infra to move gas (including LNG import terminals), that’s another $40-75Bn just to get the power to the SAGD facilities. There are constant rolling blackouts in the country. You also need ~7-900MB/d of diluent looping on the Venezuela side, including DRUs for another ~$25Bn. Other local midstream refurb is at least $15Bn to replace ashphalted and corroded trunk lines. Any North American firm would also have to commit to cleaning up Lake Maracaibo which is a $10Bn commitment. So this Trump romp in South America is sure to end badly. The big open question is whether Trump decides to break more china there or goes TACO and moves to other, seemingly easier, targets. ____ 1 Thanks to the state of search, I have been unable to find estimates of how much it would cost to retune a refinery to process lighter grades, although I infer that newer refineries make this possible at lower cost than for older ones. Per the American Fuel & Petroleum Manufacturers website : Long before the U.S. shale boom, when global production of light sweet crude oil was declining, we made significant investments in our refineries to process heavier, high-sulfur crude oils that were more widely available in the global market. These investments were made to ensure U.S. refineries would have access to the feedstocks needed to produce gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. Heavier crude is now an essential feedstock for many U.S. refineries. Substituting it for U.S. light sweet crude oil would make these facilities less efficient and competitive, leading to a decline in fuel production and higher costs for consumers. 2 Trump tariffs and Chinese overinvestment and resulting deflation are big drivers. Neither looks set to change soon. 3 Among other things, Venezuela has credibly alleged that the long-ago arbitrator was bribed. I am skipping over this topic for now, but those interested, please see The Guyana-Venezuela dispute and UK involvement and Guyana’s Oil Wealth Drives Tensions With Venezuela. So one view is that the subjugation of Venezuela would also solve the Venezuela dispute with Guyana and facilitate development there. This is reminiscent of Peter Cook’s World Domination League,,where you would knock on the door and politely ask to be allowed to dominate people. Some Admiral in the US is looking at the budget for this killing present appropriations and the maintenance costs of keeping all these old ships on station longer than they should and shaking his head. Not that I don’t think the fix is in but it can’t be done on the cheap like they are trying. power peeps care not one whit about doing things on the cheap. Budgets and spending are matters of Political Will, and Political Won’t. There will always be plenty of money to procure arms, siphon dough off to the MIC, to protect Oil resources that the US assumes and asserts are ‘hers’. Same Old Sh*t, different Emperial action. I guess with Trump, it is Imperial? I hope that Dulci and the Chavista movement stay strong in Venezuela but I’m uneasy about her 1-hour reported call with Narco Rubio and the fact there was no military opposition to the raid. I also hope that Trump takes Greenland next. It will be delicious to see the craven EU twist itself into a pretzel to not sanction the US in anyway despite the latter waging a war against it. It will expose it to those who still don’t see how useless it is. The handover from Rafael Correa to Lenin Moreno in Ecuador constitutes a sobering precedent: from a leftist government that implemented quite a number of reforms favouring the working class, sovereignty in the exploitation of resources, and autonomy from the USA to one doing a 180-turn (Baerbock-360) that privatized everything, abolished social reforms, exited ALBA, accepted the yoke of the IMF, and started a steady cooperation with the USA. The former basis of Correa protested heavily, and was crushed. Moreno had been vice-president of Correa, and was member of the same party — just like Delcy Rodriguez wrt. Nicolas Maduro. The Defense Minister’s house was bombed and he is alive only by virtue of having gotten to a shelter. At least two of the ~10 helicopters were hit, which means shot at, and some soliders were injured as a result but I infer not badly. The US sent in over 150 planes. From Task & Purpose: The force included a mix of Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps bombers, fighter jets and electronic attack planes, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine said on Saturday. Speaking at a press conference with President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Caine said that the force used included “F-22s, F, 35s, F-18s, EA18s, E-2s B-1, bombers and other support aircraft, as well as numerous remotely piloted drones.” The various aircraft hit several targets in Venezuela, including the La Guaira port, the military headquarters complex at Fort Tiuna in Caracas and multiple airports. While the jets and bombers flew overhead and prepared for any aerial response, helicopters flown by the Army’s 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment entered, carrying members of Delta Force. They flew over a largely blacked out Caracas, which Trump implied was as a result of operations by American forces. Caine noted that U.S. Cyber Command and Space Command carried out actions in support of the air assault. https://taskandpurpose.com/news/fighters-bombers-venezuela-attack-maduro/ And Vanessa Beeley speculated: Were the alleged 5000 Russian-manufactured Manpad systems jammed, as happened in Iran during the first 24 hours of the Zionist aggression in June 2025? https://beeley.substack.com/p/14-points-on-trump-kidnap-of-venezuelan? Listened to a few podcasts this morning and it was either Alastair Cook or Chas Freeman or both who said that 30 Cuban soldiers who comprised Maduro’s personal bodyguard were all killed. Yesterday there was that report from the Russian pundit (Korbyko?) who claimed Russian forces went in to protect Maduro and were fired on by his bodyguard – that claim seems a little odd to me. All that seems certain at this point was that there was some resistance to his capture. thank you. I watched Max and Anya’s livestream about this yesterday and they didn’t have these details yet. And from today’s links, I learned that a military base repelled an attack as well so there was some resistance. Very clean operation by the US. It seems very likely the CIA did pay for a lot of intel and perhaps some cooperation. But IMHO there is a tendency to over-rely on that idea as being the main driver here due to: 1. Bias to see Latinos as corrupt 2. Bias to see US military as not very good (when our special ops are pretty good). And remember, Mossad likely helped a lot. 3. Psyops playing up idea of top level cooperation to weaken Rodriguez and incumbents (keep pressure on them) and make US operation look less illegitimate at the margin (ie, locals cooperated in the raid). Greenland will be much easier: 1. Declare Greenland US territory 2. Send ICE in to round-up and deport the non-US citizens to willing Sub-Saharan hosts There’s less than 60,000 of soon-to-be illegals in Greenland– Homeland Security can clean house in a week. Wouldn’t this be the end of NATO? (I wouldn’t cry for this) Urup would finally have to face up to its submerging reality and cut its increasingly threadbare cloth accordingly. South America could not supply enough coke to cope. How does Trump even TACO from this mess? Release Maduro? I guess he could hold Maduro in legal limbo a la Assange for years/decades. A la Assange, a la Epstein, a la Milosevic, a la Hussein, a la carte. There’s a lot on the menu. Hei, wouldn’t it be something if they Epsteined him?!? Hear the shrieks get even louder! Perhaps the U.S. has learned from previous mistakes (Iraq, Libya) and realized that destroying an existing regime is not a good idea. The oil industry requires long-term investments, which depend on stability. The process I am seeing reminds me of the “Transition” in Spain in 1978. In a smooth “Transition,” the current elites retain most of their power in exchange for: 1) providing stability, 2) accommodating U.S. interests, and 3) eventually moving to the background. If the Spanish “Transition” is the template, we should see elections within 1-2 years, with the winner being a “centrist” candidate. Someone clarify: When in the last 60 years has the US learned from a mistake, whether or not that mistake was admitted? I’m not coming up with a single one, except for multiple examples of the learning part being “keep it even more secret”. They’ve lerned to stop the draft after the Vietnam War, and feed their grinder with foreign meat. That’s what kept them going. “Words calculated to catch everyone may catch no one.” “The sound of tireless voices is the price we pay for the right to hear the music of our own opinions. But there is also, it seems to me, a moment at which democracy must prove its capacity to act. Every man has a right to be heard; but no man has the right to strangle democracy with a single set of vocal cords.” Adlai Stevenson Trump’s goal is not to seize oil. Rather, he wants to avenge his humiliating loss in Ukraine by defeating Russia’s key allies, such as Syria and Venezuela. Perhaps you’re right. But according to Mercouris at least, Russia is doing surprisingly well in Syria under the new regime, and this strike against Venezuela is most likely to result in the Russia/China relationship getting even stronger as China might look to Russia for even more oil… https://youtu.be/5CrOrDheZ9s?si=yf3LZJyEGuJLDbjf Perhaps Trump has achieved a key goal in cutting off a Petro supply line to China? May be insignificant in the number of tankers going through Panana but will be seen as a win by Trump to attempt restricting Chinese economic growth. *Sigh* Please consider uinsg a search engine, as I just did: Trump suggested on Saturday that China will continue to receive some Venezuelan oil under a U.S.-led government in Caracas, but that amount is likely to be limited. https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-oil-refiners-win-chinese-rivals-lose-trumps-venezuela-strike-2026-01-04/ * The US’s intervention in Venezuela will likely choke oil flows to China, as China is the major buyer of crude from the South American country. * Venezuelan shipments provide a unique type of crude used to produce bitumen, which is vital for construction and road building, and is also deeply discounted, making it popular with China’s independent refiners. * A hoard of sanctioned crude in floating storage will cushion Chinese buyers in the coming months, with almost 82 million barrels currently on tankers in waters off China and Malaysia. The US’s shock intervention in Venezuela will likely choke oil flows to China, although the short-term impact will be softened by large volumes of sanctioned crude being stored at sea. China is the major buyer of crude from the South American country, but that trade now looks in jeopardy after the seizure of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro over the weekend. President Donald Trump said the US would run the country and American companies would rebuild its oil industry and sell a “large amount” to global buyers, including current customers and new ones, without specifically mentioning China. https://archive.is/gRk9D#selection-1611.0-1647.341 Russia can provide China with heavy crude (Urals is medium heavy), increasing Chinese dependence on Russia, but filling any bitumen gap would take some doing. From an article explaining why Russia’s bitumen exports had fallen: Russia’s strategic reorientation of oil-product sales toward Asia—especially China and South Asia—complicated logistical flows for bitumen specifically. Unlike crude oil and gasoil, bitumen is not easily rerouted through long-distance maritime transport without special heating systems, viscosity management, and insulated storage. Some of Russia’s older export terminals on the Baltic Sea and Black Sea lacked the upgraded heating and pumping infrastructure required for large-scale redirection. As a result, even if the intention existed to replace European markets with Asian importers, the operational and technical constraints reduced Russia’s ability to shift bitumen exports efficiently. https://bitumenmag.com/News/global-repercussions-of-russias-declining-bitumen-output-in-2025 Thanks Yves, first time contributor so learning the ropes. Will get better. Sorry to have seemed rough on you and appreciate you being a good sport. While 80-90% of Venezuela’s crude oil export goes to China in recent years, only 4% of China’s crude import comes from Venezuela according to a recent report from Reuters. China is probably more worried about the debt it lent to Venezuela. And China can buy heavy crude from Canada… Willy OAM, over at his YouTube channel (Legends) mentioned on his video yesterday that lots of liars are using statistics to distort the dependence of China on Venezuelan oil. Apparently, only 4% of China’s oil comes from Venezuela. So, they should be able to easily replace that even if Trump succeeds in blocking oil exports. I was half listening to Trump waffle on about taking Venezuela’s oil when he used a word that I had not heard him using before in talking about that oil and I think that it was the word recompense. He was saying that he would take the oil and profits would be used to help the Venezuelan people. That was what the government has been doing and I am sure that he only means certain parts of the population. Regardless, he slipped that word recompense in and what I think that he means is this. He will take that oil, sell it, deduct what the US has had to pay for this to happen (I would imagine that would also include the tens of billions of dollars spent on the blockade) and then they would take out recompense. By that I am sure that he means the decades worth of lost profits that the US never made on that oil so in the end, there will be very little left for the common people. This plus the Michael Spyker thread prompts ”socialize the costs, privatize the profits”-dictum How many and which billionaires do you need to off in order to stop this evil? Sounds like trickle-down economics, with high viscosity fluid. :) https://www.upworthy.com/pitch-drop-experiment-still-fascinates After Saturday’s presser, with Trump talking about oil and identifying the colonial viceroys standing behind him while the others talked only of narco-gang-poison-crime and getting the kingpin in SDNY, I was thinking about my remark when we were discussing this Oil Price (quoted again above) that it might still be about the oil for Trump. I had opined that perhaps Trump doesn’t understand the obstacles, like he doesn’t understand about the effects of tariffs, and there may be neocons that find it useful for him to believe the oil story. Now Yves added a very interesting dimension to this: he’s doing sales theater like with the Ukraine minerals. Trump the real estate developer has a long career of talking up things that don’t exist trying to raise the investment needed to make them, many of the things being completely pie-in-the-sky, and that’d often be fitting in projects’ early stages (compare selling Venezuelan oil production licenses to selling Theranos equity). With all that experience Trump may find it reflexive and/or natural-feeling to talk up the oil like he did. Ultimately, the real motives for this whole Venezuelan adventure are most likely the usual 1) empire, in this case establishing the Donroe Doctrine (which the CW seems to accept, judging from early reactions), and 2) he needed a distraction from all the failing at home and some highly visible win. The usual, indeed. And there is no such thing as narco-terrorism. Adults willing to go on camera and say narco-terrorism out loud or claim “we are at war withbdrig traffickers” are so obviously lying. With this administration, don’t they even have a truth to hide? Trump is a 1980s Reagan guy living in a 21st century world and that applies to much of the Repub party that supports him. Meanwhile the Dems try to coast on their own brand fumes. The only thing new in our not so brave new world is the rise of the computer industry and they too live in an imaginary bubble. I’ve been rewatching old episodes of the Mike Judge absurdist comedy Silicon Valley. The characters are all deeply weird comic types and it’s hilarious. He satirizes the way these nerds talk about “making the world a better place” when it’s really all about money even if the central character–the nerdiest of all–does seem sincere. Trump apes all that “better place” lingo but nobody could possibly buy his pitch unless they are feeling trapped by TINA. When that last collapses maybe things will finally change. …he needed a distraction from all the failing at home and some highly visible win. Doing an imperialist takeover of some foreign country is not a good way to distract the population from your failures. Recent decades have given us plenty of examples of how these operations inevitably play out, which is more gigantic failures and usually the signature catastrophe of your administration. When you think of Lyndon Johnson, what do you think of? Vietnam! When you think of Ronald Reagan, what do you think of? Iran-Contra! When you think of Bill Clinton, what do you think of? Iraq (part 1)! When you think of GW bush, what do you think of? Afghanistan and Iraq (part 2). When you think of Obama, what do you think of? Iraq and Afghanistan! When you think of Biden, what do you think of? Ukraine and Afghanistan! I will leave it as an exercise to the reader regarding what Trump’s historic legacy will be. Bushco will always be remembered as the sawdust head Charlie McCarthy to Edgar Bergen Cheney. It’s a long time between now and November, and today’s “win” could well turn into a significant political loss – particularly if Trump régime follows it up with Iran, or the Russians start deliberately taking out Americans in the Ukraine, or the Taiwanese decide that China has prepared an offer they can’t refuse, or that he makes a move on Greenland and steps on Russian and Chinese toes. Great analysis, as usual, Yves. Especially in this, err, overly dynamic situation. I’m curious about your views on the point Larry Johnson made recently that this is a step towards the US guaranteeing it’s supply of oil in the face of potential oil market upheavals if Israel (+US) attack Iran? This could be simply getting a few pieces on the board in advance of a longer Iran play… What do you think? its really reallty really worthwhile to read the Stryker X thread: https://x.com/ShaleTier7/status/2007936384448024898 which assumes no resistance (in the new age of drones, where China and Russia have incentive to bog the US down in a new Vietnam). There also is an assumption that China will provide the necessary rare earths and components to allow the US to retool the Venezuelan oil industry to prevent it from exporting oil to China! If that is Johnson’s argument, I don’t understand it. Venezuela supplies to global markets are too small to have any impact on a closure-of-the-Strait-of-Hormuz scenario. Thanks. From this article https://larrycjohnson.substack.com/p/is-the-maduro-kidnapping-a-prelude Larry says I believe the true objective of the kidnapping operation to remove Maduro is to secure US control of Venezuelan oil in anticipation of a disruption of the flow of oil from the Persian Gulf when Israel, with US-backing, launches a new attack on Iran Although having read through the long tweet by ShaleTier7 and the arguments you make above, I am also persuaded that if this *was* their thinking they have sorely miscalculated. What a shock. Cheers It may be that Larry Johnson assumes a lack of knowledge alongside frail intellectual abilities are the guiding stars of US policy. Or it could be that Trump is going to re-make all the roads in the US, re-build all the bridges and develop wonderful housing estates for the poor and generally make every white Amercan life great again. What a guy! Thank you for this excellent analysis. “Some Admiral in the US is looking at the budget for this killing present appropriations and the maintenance costs of keeping all these old ships on station longer than they should and shaking his head.” I am curious what the cost of the whole Venezuela project has been to ‘arrest’ Maduro. The Pricer says around $60 million. https://www.thepricer.org/how-much-did-the-u-s-spend-to-capture-maduro/ That seems very low to me. Navy ships have continuous overhead, but I believe being on station must be more expensive. And then there is the strikes on the narco-terrorist boats, the DEA, the Coast Guard involvement. A lot of money for nothing in my book. Same with the money spent ‘getting’ all the terrorists we have chased for 25 years. I guess the payoff must be the resulting militaristic rule in the USA. That Pricer article attempted to define the incremental costs of the op. It states a major uncertainty is the ordnance expended. It doesn’t attempt to cost out the general presence mission cost. Keep in mind we have had an ongoing level of effort counter-drug op in the Caribbean for about as long as I’ve been around. Of course we have gone from a board-and-arrest model to attack-and-destroy. That’s separate from the cost of enforcing sanctions. Trump is obviously high on his supposed perfect military abduction. Unfortunately, when his oil heist doesn’t go as planned, and it won’t, Trump will probably get uglier toward the Venezuelan people. Trump basically sounds like a mob boss when he said if the new president Delcy Rodriguez “doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.” Trump, according to the NYT, told reporters, “And don’t ask me who’s in charge, because I’ll give you an answer, and it’ll be very controversial.” “What does that mean?” a reporter asked. “It means we’re in charge,” the president said. One might think of the Nazis and the annexation of Austria. Hitler visited Austria to meet with Austrian Nazis. This was Hitler’s home country. He spent time visiting his family home and the border crossing where his father worked. It seemed he cared about Austrians. It didn’t work out well for Austrians or the Austrian Nazis who thought they were more or less partners. The Austrian Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg was arrested and spent the war in a concentration camp. Austrian ministers were replaced when Hitler sent his own ministers to Vienna to run the country. Austrian Nazis had little or no power. The Austrian Central bank was looted for its gold and foreign reserves. Austria’s iron ore deposits were seized immediately, as well as other mineral resources, oil, art works, etc. I hope the Venezuelans realize what Trump has in store for them. Looks like the interm president got the message: Venezuelan interim leader tones down criticism, ready to ‘work with the US’ Acting President Delcy Rodriguez calls for a ‘balanced and respectful’ relationship with Washington during transition. “We extend an invitation to the US government to work together on an agenda for cooperation that is aimed towards shared development,” she continued. The US does have Venezuela over the barrel, quite literally. A bit of lip-service at this point can be a step towards reducing the immediate heat without being tantamount to capitulation or surrender– pull a Ukraine: sign a few agreements, buy some time to more properly arm. I don’t see how Venezuela can break out of the stranglehold that the US has it in. As economic conditions there worsen, the US remains out of reach, and civil unrest will turn inward to find targets close at hand. The issue is not the regime change threat. It’s the blockade, But it costs the US to keep that going. And someone in Russia might have clued Rodriguez in that it costs nothing to talk nicely to Trump, and he gets off on that. Except Trump takes the soft soap seriously and wants revenge when he finds out it isn’t. Crooke suggests the Russians may be changing their tactics and withdrawing from Trump engagement. IMHO everyone important in Russia except Putin and Dmitriev,, who has his stature elevated by this charade, has been wanting to withdraw from Trump engagement. Putin needed to go along, regardless of what he felt (and he really does not like war, I think he is natively very conservative on that front) to placate his Global South economic allies, particularly China and India. But in an important late-in-year Q&A (not his big year-end event but not long before that) Putin said it suited Russia better to resolve Project Ukraine on the battlefield. It still costs Russia nothing to play along. But Putin is likely to decline further in-person engagement with anyone other than Trump or perhaps Rubio. They probably can’t break out of it until enough other nations realize that they can either hang together now or hang separately later. How many countries does the US need to destroy before other nations fight back? You would think that at the very least, the UN could impose massive sanctions on the US. Yes, I know, I did laugh a little as I typed that last sentence. The UN is about as useless as the US Congress Aboard AF1, Trump told a reporter, “We need total access in Venezuela. We need access to the oil and to other things.” “Total Access” Trump also accused Venezuela of stealing from the US. He said, “It was the greatest theft in the history of America. Nobody has ever stolen our property like they have. They took our oil away from us.” I can’t find an accurate figure but it seems Venezuela has roughly $5 billion in gold at its central bank and another $2 billion in the UK which the UK has refused to return. There are other valuable minerals available to be extracted. And, of course, lots of water front property. I can imagine Trump stealing what he can as payback while waiting for the oil business to recover. https://apnews.com/video/trump-says-he-wants-total-access-from-venezuela-comments-on-cubans-killed-c08d04e0f1d7467e87fdb3f66c3eac77 https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/05/business/oil-venezuela-trump The Iraq tragedy is being repeated as farce in Venezuela. Trump lacks the means to extract anything other than cheap spectacle from Venezuela. The downward spiral of the U.S. into idiocracy continues. Adam Tooze has put together a Chartbook on Venezuelan oil. Which likely won’t start to flow anytime soon: https://adamtooze.substack.com/p/chartbook-423-some-topical-material Same as natural resources from Greenland… Which will need ports, airports, roads, powerplants, housing and amenities for the workforce, etc. All in a harsh climate. Greenland already has US military there since WWII, can’t they properly insure the US national security? Trump’s regime is notable for its incompetence – just like Zelensky in Ukraine, which is why, despite claims to the contrary, Putin has made it clear he wants to keep him in office for now, because better the incompetent leader you know is going to screw things up than a competent one that won’t. So, arguably it is better Chump stays in office and keeps screwing things up, than the far more competent Vance take over. However, the risk of major war keeps going up! Chump is deranged enough to ramp things up further. This Venezuela debacle has all the hallmarks of yet another botched regime change and resources grab job. If it was to prop up the petrodollar by making Venezuela revert to selling oil in dollars, so far nothing has changed – and won’t unless a puppet regime is installed, and even then it will take time before any change comes into effect. If it was to hurt Chinese and Russian interests in the country, they will retaliate in other ways to hurt the US dollar and economy. The US has spent a huge amount of money, well into the billions, just to kidnap one man, and bribe the military not to defend the country, and has so far failed to achieve anything much. Chumps’ threats to other countries will merely accelerate the move/rush away from the dollar and the dumping of US treasuries, thus putting even more downward pressure on the dollar. Making enemies at such a rapid rate will soon overwhelm the US. It can’t fight everyone! This article: The Venezuelan Oil Narative is PURE THEATRE -The Real Reason the Pentagon Approved Venezuela: Critical Minerals and Adversary Expulsion pins the motive on a threefold confluence of risks to the Pentagon: 1, The Pentagon’s Critical Minerals Crisis – along side China’s Supply Chain Stranglehold of the critical minerals in Venezuela; 2, IRGC: Iranian Weapons Manufacturing in the Western Hemisphere; 3, Russian Military Advisory Mission and Systems.

BUMPER TO BUMPER traffic at peak hours has become a feature of modern life in Ireland’s cities, with road users reporting ever-worsening gridlock on key routes. From the Quincentennial Bridge in Galway, to the Dunkettle Interchange in Cork, to the M50 and N7 and other roads around Dublin, along with every other city, commuters can lose hours of their days stuck in traffic. On the M50, Ireland’s busiest road, any closing of a lane as a result of a crash or debris can result in huge delays. The motorway has seen a 40% increase in traffic on its busiest stretches over the past 10 years. Recently Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) stated that it had “done all it can” in terms of works and upgrades to address the gridlock. Meanwhile, it has not been much better for anyone using public transport, with a senior Dublin Bus official recently citing data that showed traffic in the capital has become slower than London. Across the country, there are plans underway to revamp the roads network and to expand transport services – but some of these have faced repeated delays, whether due to planning struggles or financing from government. Most recently Firethorn Limited and Manhattan Peanuts lodged a judicial review against the planned Luas extension to Finglas in north-west Dublin city. We asked our readers to outline some of their main traffic complaints. Here’s what they said. Unsurprisingly, the main issue brought up had to do with traffic on the M50, and the knock-on effect this had on other areas around Dublin. One reader said he had to drive from Cherrywood to Santry on the run up to Christmas to collect a parcel at a depot. “I left at around 4.20pm, but by the time I made it to Santry, it was nearly 6.30 and the depot had closed at 6pm. Two hours to cross the breadth of the M50. The M7 and M4 exits in particular looked awful,” they said. They tried again a few days later, this time heading from Artane to Santry, what should be a much shorter journey. “This time from Artane to the same depot. It took an hour each way. I wish I was joking, but the gridlock was that bad,” the readers said. “At least I got the package! Perhaps the grim weather was to blame but still, that’s a really long time to cross 3 kilometres as the crow flies. Another reader, who lives in Ballyfermot, said they had experience multiple traffic jams as result of traffic on the M50. They were travelling from Smyths Toy Store at Fotnhill Retail Park to their home in Ballyfermot, a journey that would take about 15 minutes in light traffic. “It took one and a half hours to get out of the carpark and two hours to get home to Ballyfermot. This should have been a 15 minute journey!” The reader said. On another day soon after that, the reader went to collect her husband at the Hermitage Hospital in Lucan. “We could not get out of the car park. It took us one and a half hours to get home, we can normally do this trip in 15 minutes,” she said. The reader blamed traffic on the M50 for having a knock-on effect elsewhere. “When there is an incident on the M50 it causes enormous traffic jams in Ballyfermot as drivers drive through their to avoid delays on the M50,” she said. A final reader raised issue with traffic coming into Dublin, comparing their trip into Dublin on the N7 to Merrion Square, to when they drove in London. “I lived in London for six months last year. My commute to work consisted of driving from Finchley to around Cheshunt, the drive was 24 km and in bad traffic would take 40/45 mins on a bad day during rush hour traffic,” they said. “On the other hand I drove from the far side of Limerick City last week to Dublin. “It took me less time to get from Limerick to passing in by An Poitín Stíl (in Rathcoole) which is 195 km, compared to getting from An Poitín Stíl to Merrion Square that took me 2 hours on the dot and is only 18 km away and there were no road closures or crashes… just traffic.” Advertisement Readers also raised issues with traffic coming in and out of Galway City at peak times. “Traffic gridlock in Galway has been getting worse in the last few years but especially in the last year,” one woman told The Journal. “The Quincentennial Bridge in the mornings eastbound to the factories in the Parkmore/Ballybrit areas are a constant line of cars. The reader also said that the Dublin Road inbound and outbound are “constant traffic jams any time of day”. A bypass for Galway City – the Galway City Ring Road – has long been planned and debated. An Coimisiún Pleanála is due to make a decision on the road early this year. Another reader, who “drives daily for a living in Galway” decried the traffic and improper planning in the city, and called for the ring road to be built. “Galway’s annual descent into gridlock in the weeks leading up to Christmas is often blamed on shoppers, tourists, or poor driving behaviour, but the core problem is structural,” they wrote. “The absence of a completed ring road means that through traffic — vehicles with no destination in the city at all — is forced to funnel directly through already constrained urban streets. This fundamental planning failure magnifies congestion every December, when traffic volumes naturally rise.” The reader said that this forced the city to attempt to deal with local traffic and long-distance vehicles, which it fails to do. “The result is chronic congestion on key corridors, unreliable journey times, and mounting frustration for residents, workers, and businesses alike. Christmas simply exposes the problem at its worst.” The reader said that the ring road would also help improve sustainable transport options in the city, like public transport, walking and cycling. “Road space in Galway is scarce, and as long as it is dominated by through traffic, there is little political or practical room to reallocate it. “A functioning ring road would remove a significant volume of cars and trucks from the city centre, freeing space for continuous bus lanes, safe cycle infrastructure, and improved pedestrian environments. Public transport could become faster and more reliable, active travel safer and more attractive. Other readers shared local traffic issues in the outskirts of the cities. One reader who lives on the outskirts of Cork City said their morning commute takes 45 minutes, or 15 minutes with no traffic. “Nowhere near as bad as Dublin. Despite this as a family I am so frustrated by traffic and the lack of real alternatives,” they said. “If you look around Carrilgaline, Glanmire, Ballincollig, Maryborough, Lehenaghmore you will find massive newish housing developments with thousands of young families and kids and teens with zero infrastructure and zero amenities. “More often than not: No local shop. No crèche for the 100s of kids. No pub. No restaurant. No school. No playground. Nothing for teens to do. No GP. No dentist. No pharmacy. No bike lanes, no active travel supports. Limited bus routes, no bus shelters Zero, nothing, zilch. “And then we wonder why traffic is so bad?? ‘Cos we have to drive everywhere all the time for everything. Drive into Carrigaline, down to Douglas, over to Wilton. All stuck in traffic all wondering why traffic is so bad all the time!! Another reader took issue with traffic in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area of South Dublin, saying that there were now numerous traffic jams “all over the Dún Laoghaire, Glenageary, Deansgrange, Blackrock areas”. The reader said the jams were caused by “out of sync lights” and “unused cycle lanes that shut off parts of the road”. “I have no idea why the council closed off the feeder lanes at colossal expense and disruption,” they said. As well as the issues raised, some readers raised proposed solutions to the problems. The reader who lived out the outskirts of Cork proposed a variety of responses. These included: A final reader, living in Kildare but commuting to Dublin every day, said he is “a true believer in public transport but have mostly given up” and that he is “ashamed at how bad we’ve let it become, considering we’re such a small, flat country”. This readers commutes 30km to and from Dublin today. Where he lives has a direct train line to the city, he he cycles “because it’s faster (75mins vs 90mins minimum) and I can guarantee my arrival time(s)”. He said the city and surrounding area needed new train and metro lines to get people off the roads; double-tracking existing railway lines; connectivity between orbital train stations adding new stations. “I’d love to talk more about cycling infrastructure, but we can only properly tackle that once we do the big things properly,” he said.

lassedesignen - Fotolia SCC UK is starting the year with a fresh CEO, recruiting a channel veteran to run the business as it ushers in a fresh era at the channel player. Russell Brown becomes UK chief executive at SCC, starting in the role from next week. He replaces Dennis Badman, who is stepping down. Brown comes with more than two decades of channel experience, with the bulk of that time spent at Computacenter, where he enjoyed senior roles on both sides of the Atlantic. Originally from Birmingham, it is also a homecoming for Brown, who will relocate with his family to take up the position. He has gained experience in the UK, as well as in senior roles for Computacenter US, where the business was in growth mode, expanding a foothold in the enterprise market. Brown joins SCC at a moment when the business is moving to a shared services approach for delivery and operations. As part of that, the UK operation is being repositioned towards sales leadership, customer engagement and growth. Badman has already positioned the firm in that direction, making for a smoother transition. “I’m delighted to be joining SCC at a pivotal moment,” said Brown. “The move to a European shared services model provides a strong platform of growth, and I’m excited to lead the UK organisation as it sharpens its focus on customers, AI [artificial intelligence] innovation and value-led services.” The arrival of a fresh UK boss follows just four months on from the appointment of Robert Vassoyan as European CEO, and both appointments are set against the backdrop of the channel player marking 50 years in business. Vassoyan thanked the outgoing UK CEO for his contribution to the business and welcomed Brown. “Dennis has played an important role in strengthening our UK delivery capability, and we thank him for his contribution,” he added. “As we transition to a European shared services model, the UK business is entering a new phase focused on growth and customer value. Russell’s experience in leading sales-driven, customer-centric organisations makes him the right leader for this next chapter.” During its 50th anniversary celebrations last year, SCC’s senior leadership indicated the ambition was to focus on the IT market and move the business to a position where it was able to adapt to accelerate market change, and remain a leading source of expertise and customer support around a range of areas, including cloud and AI. Elsewhere, cloud services and infrastructure as a service provider Leaseweb was also welcoming fresh talent towards the end of last year, with Ronald Richardson joining as chief revenue officer. His brief includes spearheading the firm’s go-to-market operations, working with sales, marketing and operations to enhance its proposition. Lex Boost, co-CEO at Leaseweb, said Richardson had a strong CV, including time at Banyan, Microsoft, AdEspresso, Axon and ESS. “His leadership will be instrumental as we continue to expand our international footprint,” said Boost. “We are delighted to welcome him to the team as we advance our mission to be the world’s leading independent, privately owned and sovereign-by-design hybrid cloud provider.”

The rebranding was announced by SGX Group CEO Loh Boon Chye at a ceremony at the SGX Centre’s IPO Arena. “This reinforces its role as the core pillar of SGX group’s multi-asset ambitions and its importance to Singapore as an international financial centre,” Loh said. The announcement comes as Singapore’s equity market shows signs of recovery. The STI delivered a total return of over 25 per cent in 2025, reaching record highs. Over five years, the index has gained more than 100 per cent in Singapore dollar terms, according to National Development Minister and Monetary Authority of Singapore deputy chairman Chee Hong Tat. The total market value of SGX-listed companies crossed the $1 trillion mark in 2025, while the average daily traded value for the year was the highest since 2010. Trading volumes in small- and mid-cap stocks surged more than 40 per cent compared to 2024. IPO activity rebounded significantly, with over $2.4 billion raised in 2025 - the strongest showing since 2019. The recovery follows a $5 billion Equities Market Development Programme led by MAS, with $3.95 billion already allocated to nine asset managers, including BlackRock and JP Morgan Asset Management. “Our journey to rebuild a vibrant stock market has started well in 2025, but all stakeholders must work even harder this year,” Chee said, cautioning that sustained effort is needed. The STI, launched in 1966 as the Straits Times Industrial Index, now tracks Singapore’s top 30 blue-chip companies and represents about 85 per cent of the market’s total capitalisation. The three local banks, DBS, OCBC and UOB, account for nearly half of the index’s weight. Published on January 5, 2026 Copyright© 2026, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Title: Databases in 2025: A Year in Review
URL: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/blog/2026/01/2025-databases-retrospective.html
Time Published: 2026-01-05T07:14:30Z
Full Content:
Another year passes. I was hoping to write more articles instead of just these end-of-the-year screeds, but I almost died in the spring semester, and it sucked up my time. Nevertheless, I will go through what I think are the major trends and happenings in databases over the last year. There were many exciting and unprecedented developments in the world of databases. Vibe coding entered the vernacular. The Wu-Tang Clan announced their time capsule project. Rather than raising one massive funding round this year instead of going public, Databricks raised two massive rounds instead of going public. Meanwhile, other events were expected and less surprising. Redis Ltd. switched their license back one year after their rugpull (I called this shot last year). SurrealDB reported great benchmark numbers because they weren't flushing writes to disk and lost data. And Coldplay can break up your marriage. Astronomer did make some pretty good lemonade on that last one though. With that out of the way, let's do this. These articles are getting longer each year, so I apologize in advance. Previous entries: I first wrote about how PostgreSQL was eating the database world in 2021. That trend continues unabated as most of the most interesting developments in the database world are happening once again with PostgreSQL. The DBMS's latest version (v18) dropped in November 2025. The most prominent feature is the new asynchronous I/O storage subsystem, which will finally put PostgreSQL on the path to dropping its reliance on the OS page cache. It also added support for skip scans; queries can still use multi-key B+Tree indexes even if they are missing the leading keys (i.e., prefix). There are some additional improvements to the query optimizer (e.g., removing superfluous self-joins). Savvy database connoisseurs will be quick to point out that these are not groundbreaking features and that other DBMSs have had them for years. PostgreSQL is the only major DBMS still relying on the OS page cache. And Oracle has supported skip scans since 2002 (v9i)! You may wonder, therefore, why I am claiming that the hottest action in databases for 2025 happened with PostgreSQL? The reason is that most of the database energy and activity is going into PostgreSQL companies, offerings, projects, and derivative systems. In the last year, the hottest data start-up (Databricks) paid $1b for a PostgreSQL DBaaS company (Neon). Next, one of the biggest database companies in the world (Snowflake) paid $250m for another PostgreSQL DBaaS company (CrunchyData). Then, one of the biggest tech companies on the planet (Microsoft) launched a new PostgreSQL DBaaS (HorizonDB). Neon and HorizonDB follow Amazon Aurora's original high-level architecture from the 2010s, with a single primary node separating compute and storage. For now, Snowflake's PostgreSQL DBaaS uses the same core architecture as standard PostgreSQL because they built on Crunchy Bridge. All of the services I listed above are single-primary node architectures. That is, applications send writes to a primary node, which then sends those changes to secondary replicas. But in 2025, there were two announcements on new projects to create scale-out (i.e., horizontal partitioning) services for PostgreSQL. In June 2025, Supabase announced that it had hired Sugu, the Vitess co-creator and former PlanetScale co-founder/CTO, to lead the Multigres project to create sharding middleware for PostgreSQL, similar to how Vitess shards MySQL. Sugu left PlanetScale in 2023 and had to lie back in the cut for two years. He is now likely clear of any legal issues and can make things happen at Supabase. You know it is a big deal when a database engineer joins a company, and the announcement focuses more on the person than the system. The co-founder/CTO of SingleStore joined Microsoft in 2024 to lead HorizonDB, but Microsoft (incorrectly) did not make a big deal about it. Sugu joining Supabase is like Ol' Dirty Bastard (RIP) getting out on parole after two years and then announcing a new record deal on the first day of his release. One month after the Multigres news dropped, PlanetScale announced its own Vitess-for-PostgreSQL project, Neki. PlanetScale launched its initial PostgreSQL DBaaS in March 2025, but the core architecture is single-node stock PostgreSQL with pgBouncer. With Microsoft's introduction of HorizonDB in 2025, all major cloud vendors now have serious projects for their own PostgreSQL offerings. Amazon has offered Aurora PostgreSQL since 2017. Google put out AlloyDB in 2022. ServiceNow launched its RaptorDB service in 2024, based on its 2021 acquisition of Swarm64. Even the old flip-phone IBM has had its cloud version of PostgreSQL since 2018. Oracle released its PostgreSQL service in 2023, though there is a rumor that its in-house PostgreSQL team was collateral damage in its MySQL OCI layoffs in September 2025. There are still a few independent (ISV) PostgreSQL DBaaS companies. Supabase is likely the largest of these by the number of instances. Others include YugabyteDB, TigerData (nÃ©e TimeScale), PlanetScale, Xata, PgEdge, and Nile. Xata built its original architecture on Amazon Aurora, but this year, it announced it is switching to its own infrastructure. ParadeDB has yet to announce its hosted service. Tembo dropped its hosted PostgreSQL offering in 2025 to pivot to a coding agent that can do some database tuning. Hydra and PostgresML went bust in 2025 (see Deaths section), so they're out of the game. Other systems provide a Postgres-compatible front-end, but the back-end systems are not derived from PostgreSQL (e.g., CockroachDB, CedarDB, Google Spanner). There are also hosting companies that offer PostgreSQL DBaaS alongside other systems, such as Aiven and Tessel. It is not clear who the next major buyer will be after Databricks and Snowflake bought PostgreSQL companies. Again, every major tech company already has a Postgres offering. EnterpriseDB is the oldest PostgreSQL ISV, but missed out on the two most significant PostgreSQL acquisitions in the last five years. But they can ride Bain Capital's jock for a while, or hope that HPE buys them even though that partnership is from eight years ago. The PostgreSQL M&A playfield is reminiscent of OLAP acquisitions in the late 2000s, when Vertica was the last one waiting at the bus stop after AsterData, Greenplum, and DATAllegro were acquired. The development of the two three competing distributed PostgreSQL projects (Multigres, Neki, PgDog) is welcome news. These projects are not the first time somebody has attempted this: Greenplum, ParAccel, and Citus have been around for two decades for OLAP workloads. Citus supports OLTP workloads, but they started in 2010 focused on analytics. For OLTP, 15 years ago, the NTT RiTaDB project joined forces with GridSQL to create Postgres-XC. Developers from Postgres-XC founded StormDB, which Translattice later acquired in 2013. Postgres-X2 was an attempt to modernize XC, but the developers abandoned that effort. Translattice open-sourced StormDB as Postgres-XL, but the project has been dormant since 2018. YugabyteDB came out in 2016 and is probably the most widely deployed sharded PostgreSQL system (and remains open-source!), but it is a hard fork, so it is only compatible with PostgreSQL v15. Amazon announced its own sharded PostgreSQL (Aurora Limitless) in 2024, but it is closed source. I know Microsoft bought Citus in 2019 but it is hard to keep track of what they were doing before HorizonDB because of their confusing product names. Citus was rebranded as Azure Database for PostgreSQL Hyperscale in 2019 and was then renamed to Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL in 2022. But then there is Azure Database for PostgreSQL with Elastic Clusters that also uses Citus, but it is not the same as the Citus-powered Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL. Microsoft discontinued Azure PostgreSQL Single Server in 2023, but kept Azure PostgreSQL Flexible Server. That is a lot of Azure this and Azure that. It is sort of like how Amazon could not resist adding "Aurora" to DSQL's name. Either way, at least Microsoft was smart enough to keep the name for their new system to just "Azure HorizonDB" (for now). The PlanetScale squad has no love for the other side and is known to throw hands at Neon and Timescale. Database companies popping off at each other is nothing new (see Yugabyte vs. CockroachDB or Databricks vs. Snowflake). I suspect we will see more of this in the future as the PostgreSQL wars heat up. I suggest that these smaller companies call out the big cloud vendors and keep each other's name out of their mouths. If 2023 was the year every DBMS added a vector index, then 2025 was the year that every DBMS added support for Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP). MCP is a standardized client-server JSON-RPC interface that lets LLMS interact with external tools and data sources without requiring custom glue code. An MCP server acts as middleware in front of a DBMS and exposes a listing of tools, data, and actions it provides. An MCP client (e.g., an LLM host such as Claude or ChatGPT) discovers and uses these tools to extend its models' capabilities by sending requests to the server. In the case of databases, the MCP server converts these queries into the appropriate database query (e.g., SQL) or administrative command. In other words, MCP is the middleman who keeps the bricks counted and the cream straight, so the database and LLMs trust each other enough to do business. Anthropic announced MCP in November 2024, but it really took off in March 2025 when OpenAI announced it would support MCP in its ecosystem. Over the next few months, every DBMS vendor released MCP servers for all system categories: OLAP (e.g., ClickHouse, Snowflake, Firebolt, Yellowbrick), SQL (e.g., YugabyteDB, Oracle, PlanetScale), and NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB, Neo4j, Redis). Since there is no official Postgres MCP server, every Postgres DBaaS has released its own (e.g., Timescale, Supabase, Xata). The cloud vendors released multi-database MCP servers that can talk to any of their managed database services (e.g., Amazon, Microsoft, Google). Allowing a single gateway to talk to heterogeneous databases is almost, but not quite, a holy-grail federated database. As far as I know, each request in these MCP servers targets only a single database at a time, so the application is responsible for performing joins across sources. Beyond the official vendor MCP implementations, there are hundreds of rando MCP server implementations for nearly every DBMS. Some of them attempt to support multiple systems (e.g., DBHub, DB MCP Server). DBHub put out a good overview of PostgreSQL MCP servers. An interesting feature that has proven helpful for agents is database branching. Although not specific to MCP servers, branching allows agents to test database changes quickly without affecting production applications. Neon reported in July 2025 that agents create 80% of their databases. Neon was designed from the beginning to support branching (Nikita showed me an early demo when the system was still called "Zenith"), whereas other systems have added branching support later. See Xata's recent comparison article on database branching. On one hand, I'm happy that there is now a standard for exposing databases to more applications. But nobody should trust an application with unfettered database access, whether it is via MCP or the system's regular API. And it remains good practice only to grant minimal privileges to accounts. Restricting accounts is especially important with unmonitored agents that may start going wild all up in your database. This means that lazy practices like giving admin privileges to every account or using the same account for every service are going to get wrecked when the LLM starts popping off. Of course, if your company leaves its database open to the world while you cause the stock price of one of the wealthiest companies to drop by $600b, then rogue MCP requests are not your top concern. From my cursory examination of a few MCP server implementations, they are simple proxies that translate the MCP JSON requests into database queries. There is no deep introspection to understand what the request aims to do and whether it is appropriate. Somebody is going to try to order 18,000 water cups in your application, and you need to make sure it doesn't crash your database. Some MCP servers have basic protection mechanisms (e.g., ClickHouse only allows read-only queries). DBHub provides a few additional protections, such as capping the number of returned records per request and implementing query timeouts. Supabase's documentation offers best-practice guidelines for MCP agents, but they rely on humans to follow them. And of course, if you rely on humans to do the right thing, bad things will happen. Enterprise DBMSs already have automated guardrails and other safety mechanisms that open-source systems lack, and thus, they are better prepared for an agentic ecosystem. For example, IBM Guardium and Oracle Database Firewall identify and block anomalous queries. I am not trying to shill for these big tech companies. I know we will see more examples in the future of agents ruining lives, like accidentally dropping databases. Combining MCP servers with proxies (e.g., connection pooling) is an excellent opportunity to introduce automated protection mechanisms. MongoDB has been the NoSQL stalwart for two decades now. FerretDB was launched in 2021 by Percona's top brass to provide a middleware proxy that converts MongoDB queries into SQL for a PostgreSQL backend. This proxy allows MongoDB applications to switch over to PostgreSQL without rewriting queries. They coexisted for a few years before MongoDB sent FerretDB a cease-and-desist letter in 2023, alleging that FerretDB infringes MongoDB's patents, copyrights, and trademarks, and that it violates MongoDB's license for its documentation and wire protocol specification. This letter became public in May 2025 when MongoDB went nuclear on FerretDB by filing a federal lawsuit over these issues. Part of their beef is that FerretDB is out on the street, claiming they have a "drop-in replacement" for MongoDB without authorization. MongoDB's court filing has all the standard complaints about (1) misleading developers, (2) diluting trademarks, and (3) damaging their reputation. The story is further complicated by Microsoft's announcement that it donated its MongoDB-compatible DocumentDB to the Linux Foundation. The project website mentions that DocumentDB is compatible with the MongoDB drivers and that it aims to "build a MongoDB compatible open source document database". Other major database vendors, such as Amazon and Yugabyte, are also involved in the project. From a cursory glance, this language seems similar to what MongoDB is accusing FerretDB of doing. I could not find an example of a database company suing another one for replicating their API. The closest is Oracle suing Google for using a clean-room copy of the Java API in Android. The Supreme Court ultimately ruled in favor of Google on fair use grounds, and the case affected how re-implementation is treated legally. I don't know how the lawsuit will play out if it ever goes to trial. A jury of random people off the street may not be able to comprehend the specifics of MongoDB's wire protocol, but they are definitely going to understand that the original name of FerretDB was MangoDB. It is going to be challenging to convince a jury that you were not trying to divert customers when you changed one letter in the other company's name. Never mind that it is not even an original name: there is already a parody DBMS called MangoDB that writes everything to /dev/null as a joke. And while we are on the topic of database system naming, Microsoft's choice of "DocumentDB" is unfortunate. There are already Amazon DocumentDB (which, by the way, is also compatible with MongoDB, but Amazon probably pays for that), InterSystems DocDB, and Yugabyte DocDB. Microsoft's original name for "Cosmos DB" was also DocumentDB back in 2016. Lastly, MongoDB's court filing claims they "pioneered the development of 'non-relational' databases". This statement is incorrect. The first general-purpose DBMSs were non-relational because the relational model had not yet been invented. General Electric's Integrated Data Store (1964) used a network data model, and IBM's Information Management System (1966) used a hierarchical data model. MongoDB is also not the first document DBMS. That title goes to the object-oriented DBMSs from the late 1980s (e.g., Versant) or the XML DBMSs from the 2000s (e.g., MarkLogic). MongoDB is the most successful of these approaches by a massive margin (except maybe IMS). File formats are an area of data systems that have been mostly dormant for the last decade. In 2011, Meta released a column-oriented format for Hadoop called RCFile. Two years later, Meta refined RCFile and announced the PAX-based ORC (Optimized Record Columnar File) format. A month after ORC's release, Twitter and Cloudera released the first version of Parquet. Nearly 15 years later, Parquet is the dominant file open-source format. In 2025, there were five new open-source file formats released vying to dethrone Parquet: These new formats joined the other formats released in 2024: SpiralDB made the biggest splash this year with their announcement of donating Vortex to the Linux Foundation and the establishment of their multi-organization steering committee. Microsoft quietly killed off Amudai (or at least closed sourced it) at some point at the end of 2025. The other projects (FastLanes, F3, Anyblox) are academic prototypes. Anyblox won the VLDB Best Paper award this year. This fresh competition has lit a fire in the Parquet developer community to modernize its features. See this in-depth technical analysis of the columnar file format landscape by Parquet PMC Chair (Julien Le Dem). The main problem with Parquet is not inherent in the format itself. The specification can and has evolved. Nobody expected organizations to rewrite petabytes of legacy files to update them to the latest Parquet version. The problem is that there are so many implementations of reader/writer libraries in different languages, each supporting a distinct subset of the specification. Our analysis of Parquet files in the wild found that 94% of them use only v1 features from 2013, even though their creation timestamps are after 2020. This lowest common denominator means that if someone creates a Parquet file using v2 features, it is unclear whether a system will have the correct version to read it. I worked on the F3 file format with brilliant people at Tsinghua (Xinyu Zeng, Ruijun Meng, Huanchen Zhang), CMU (Martin Prammer, Jignesh Patel), and Wes McKinney. Our focus is on solving this interoperability problem by providing both native decoders as shared objects (Rust crates) and embedded WASM versions of those decoders in the file. If somebody creates a new encoding and the DBMS does not have a native implementation, it can still read data using the WASM version by passing Arrow buffers. Each decoder targets a single column, allowing a DBMS to use a mix of native and WASM decoders for a single file. AnyBlox takes a different approach, generating a single WASM program to decode the entire file. I don't know who will win the file format war. The next battle is likely to be over GPU support. SpiralDB seems to be making the right moves, but Parquet's ubiquity will be challenging to overcome. I also didn't even discuss how DuckLake seeks to upend Iceberg... Of course, when this topic comes up, somebody always posts this xkcd comic on competing standards. I've seen it before. You don't need to email it to me again. Databases are big money. Let's go through them all! Lots of movement on the block. Pinecone replaced its CEO in September to prepare for an acquisition, but I have not heard anything else about it. Here are the ones that did happen: The Cassandra stalwart got picked up by IBM at the beginning of the year for an estimated $3b. The leading company behind the Lucene replacement, Tantivy, a full-text search engine, was acquired at the beginning of the year. The good news is that Tantivy development continues unabated. This acquisition was a solid pick-up for dbt as part of their Fusion announcement this year. It allows them to perform more rigorous SQL analysis in their DAGs. Mongo picked up an early-stage AI company to expand its RAG capabilities in its cloud offering. One of my best students joined Voyage one week before the announcement. He thought he was going against the "family" by not signing with a database company, only to end up at one. Apparently, there was a bidding war for this PostgreSQL company, but Databricks paid a mouthwatering $1b for it. Neon still exists today as a standalone service, but Databricks quickly rebranded it in its ecosystem as Lakebase. You know Snowflake could not let Databricks get all the excitement during the summer, so they paid $250m for the 13-year-old PostgreSQL company CrunchyData. Crunchy had picked up top ex-Citus talent in recent years and was expanding its DBaaS offering before Snowflake wrote them a check. Snowflake announced the public preview of its Postgres service in December 2025. The 1990s old-school ETL company Informatica got picked up by Salesforce for $8b. This is after they went public in 1999, reverted to PE in 2015, and went public again in 2021. To be honest, I never understood how Couchbase went public in 2021. I guess they were riding on MongoDB's coattails? Couchbase did interesting work a few years ago by incorporating components from the AsterixDB project at UC Irvine. Tecton provides Databricks with additional tooling to build agents. Another one of my former students was at the company and is now at Databricks. This team is behind two useful tools: SQLMesh and SQLglot. The former is the only viable open-source contender to dbt (see below for their pending merger with Fivetran). SQLglot is a handy SQL parser/deparser that supports a heuristic-based query optimizer. The combination of this in Fivetran and SDF with dbt makes for an interesting technology play in this space in the coming years. The PE firm buying SingleStore (Vector Capital) has prior experience in managing a database company. They previously purchased the XML database company MarkLogic in 2020 and flipped it to Progress in 2023. After getting bought by PE in 2024, the MariaDB Corporation went on a buying spree this year. The first up is the company behind the Galera Cluster scale-out middleware for MariaDB. See my 2023 overview of the MariaDB dumpster fire. And then we have the second MariaDB acquisition. Just so everyone is clear, the original commercial company backing MariaDB was called "SkySQL Corporation" in 2010, but it changed its name to "MariaDB Corporation" in 2014. Then in 2020, the MariaDB Corporation released a MariaDB DBaaS called SkySQL. But because they were hemorrhaging cash, the MariaDB Corporation spun SkySQL Inc. out as an independent company in 2023. And now, in 2025, MariaDB Corporation has come full circle by buying back SkySQL Inc. I did not have this move on my database bingo card this year. The automated database optimization tool company heads off to Temporal to automatically optimize their databases! I'm happy to hear that Crystal's founder and Berkeley database group alumnus Johann Schleier-Smith is doing well there. This system (formerly OmniSci, formerly MapD) was one of the first GPU-accelerated databases, launched in 2013. I couldn't find an official announcement of their closing, aside from an M&A firm listing the successful deal. And then we had a meeting with Nvidia to discuss potential database research collaborations, and some HeavyDB friends showed up. Dgraph was previously acquired by Hypermode in 2023. It looks like Istari just bought Dgraph and not the rest of Hypermode (or they ditched it). I still haven't met anybody who is actively using Dgraph. This was one of the first "chat with your database" out of the University of Wisconsin and now CMU-DB professor Jignesh Patel. But they were bought by a European hotel management SaaS. Take that to mean what you think it means. Datometry has been working on the perilous problem of automatically converting legacy SQL dialects (e.g., Teradata) to newer OLAP systems for several years. Snowflake picked them up to expand their migration tooling. See Datometry's 2020 CMU-DB tech talk for more info. Like Snowflake buying Datometry, ClickHouse's acquisition here is a good example of improving the developer experience for high-performance commodity OLAP engines. After buying Neon, Databricks bought Mooncake to enable PostgreSQL to read/write to Apache Iceberg data. See their November 2025 CMU-DB talk for more info. This is the archetype of how to make a company out of a grassroots open-source project. Kafka was originally developed at Linkedin in 2011. Confluent was then spun out as a separate startup in 2014. They went IPO seven years later in 2021. Then IBM wrote a big check to take it over. Like with DataStax, it remains to be seen whether IBM will do to Confluent what IBM normally does with acquired companies, or whether they will be able to remain autonomous like RedHat. Formerly EdgeDB, they provided DSL on top of PostgreSQL that got picked up by Verel at the end of the year. The embedded graph DBMS out of the University of Waterloo was acquired by an unnamed company in 2025. The KuzuDB company then announced it was abandoning the open-source project. The LadybugDB project is an attempt at maintaining a fork of the Kuzu code. Unexpected news dropped in October 2025 when Fivetran and dbt Labs announced they were merging to form a single company. The last merger I can think of in the database space was the 2019 merger between Cloudera and Hortonworks. But that deal was just weak keys getting stepped on in a kitchen: two companies that were struggling to find market relevance with Hadoop merged into a single company to try to find it (spoiler: they did not). The MariaDB Corporation merger with Angel Pond Holdings Corporation in 2022 via a SPAC technically counts too, but that deal was so MariaDB could backdoor their way to IPO. And it didn't end well for investors. The Fivetran + dbt merger is different (and better) than these two. They are two complementary technology companies combining to become an ETL juggernaut, preparing for a legit IPO in the near future. Unless I missed them or they weren't announced, there were not as many early-stage funding rounds for database startups. The buzz around vector databases has muted, and VCs are only writing checks for LLM companies. A new category in my yearly write-up is database companies changing the name of their company or system. The JSON database company dropped the "DB" suffix from its name to emphasize its positioning as a platform for database-backed applications, similar to Convex and Heroku. I like the Harper people. Their 2021 CMU-DB tech talk presented the worst DBMS idea I have ever heard. Thankfully, they ditched that once they realized how bad it was and switched to LMDB. This was a smart move because the name "Edge" conveys that it is a database for edge devices or services (e.g., Fly.io). But I'm not sure "Gel" conveys the project's higher-level goals. See their 2025 CMU-DB talk on Gel's query language (still called EdgeQL) from a CMU Ph.D. alum. This is a rare occurrence of a database company renaming itself to distinguish itself from its main database product. It is usually companies renaming themselves to be the name of the database (e.g., "Relational Software, Inc." to "Oracle Systems Corporation", "10gen, Inc." to "MongoDB, Inc."). But it makes sense for the company to try to shed the perception of being a specialized time-series DBMS instead of an improved version of PostgreSQL for general applications, since the former is a much smaller market segment than the latter. In full disclosure, I was a technical advisor for two of these failed startups. My success rate as an advisor is terrible at this point. I was also an advisor for Splice Machine, but they closed shop in 2021. In my defense, I only talk with these companies about technical ideas, not business strategies. And I did tell Fauna they should add SQL support, but they did not take my advice. An interesting distributed DBMS based on Dan Abadi's research for deterministic concurrency control. They provided strongly consistent transactions right when the NoSQL fade was waning, and Spanner made transactions cool again. But they had a proprietary query language and made big bets on GraphQL. The idea seemed obvious: enable people to run ML/AI operations inside of their PostgreSQL DBMS. The challenge was to convince people to migrate their existing databases to their hosted platform. They were pushing pgCat as a proxy to mirror database traffic. One of the co-founders joined Anthropic. The other co-founder created a new proxy project called pgDog. This is one of the first DBMSs written in Java, dating back to 1997 (originally called "Java DB" or "JBMS"). IBM donated it to the Apache Foundation in the 2000s, and it was renamed as Derby. In October 2025, the project announced that the system would enter "read-only mode" because no one was actively maintaining it anymore. Although there is no official announcement for the DuckDB-inside-Postgres startup, the co-founders and employees have scattered to other companies. This was a fork of Clickhouse that adds vector search and full-text indexing using Tantivy. They announced they were closing in May 2025. This was supposed to be the supergroup of database companies. Think of it like having Run the Jewels team of heavy hitters. You had top engineers from Nvidia Rapids, the inventor of Apache Arrow and Python Pandas, and the Peruvian GPU wizards from BlazingSQL. Then throw in $110m in VC money from top firms that included the future CEO of Intel (and a board of trustee member at CMU). They built a GPU-accelerated database (Theseus), but failed to launch it in a timely manner. Lastly, although not a business, I would be remiss not to mention the closing of IBM Research Almaden. IBM built this site in 1986 and was the database research mecca for decades. I interviewed at Almaden in 2013 and found the scenery to be beautiful. The IBM Research Database Group is not what it used to be. Still, the alum list of this hallowed database ground is impressive: Rakesh Agrawal, Donald Chamberlin, Ronald Fagin, Laura Haas, Mohan, Pat Selinger, Moshe Vardi, Jennifer Widom, and Guy Lohman. Somebody claimed that I judge the quality of a database based on how much funding the backing company raises for its development. This is obviously not true. I track these happenings because the database research game is crowded and high-energy. Not only am I "competing" against academics at other universities, but big tech companies and small start-ups are also putting out interesting systems I need to follow. The industry research labs are not what they used to be, except for Microsoft Research, which is still aggressively hiring top people and doing incredible work. I predicted in 2022 that there would be a large number of database company closings in 2025. Yes, there were more closings this year than in previous years, but not at the scale I expected. The death of Voltron and sort-of acquihire of HeavyDB seem to continue the trend of the inviability of GPU-accelerated databases. Kinetica has been milking government contracts for years, and Sqream still appears to be kicking it. These companies are still niche, and nobody has been able to make a significant dent in the dominance of CPU-powered DBMSs. I can't say who or what, but you will hear some major GPU-accelerated database announcements by vendors in 2026. It also provides further evidence of the commoditization of OLAP engines; modern systems have gotten so fast that the performance between them is negligible for low-level operations (scans, joins), so the things that differentiate one system from another are user experience and the quality of the query plans their optimizers generate. The Couchbase and SingleStore acquisitions by private equity (PE) firms might signal a future trend in the database industry. Of course, PE acquisitions have happened before, but they all seem to be in recent times: (1) MarkLogic in 2020, (2) Cloudera in 2021, and (3) MariaDB in 2023. The only ones I can find before 2020 were SolidDB in 2007 and Informatica in 2015. PE acquisitions might replace the trend of plateaued database companies being bought by holding companies that milk the maintenance fees until eternity (Actian, Rocket). Even Oracle is still making money off RDB/VMS after buying them 30 years ago! Lastly, props to Nikita Shamgunov. As far as I know, he is the only person to have co-founded two database companies (SingleStore and Neon) that were both acquired in a single year. Like when DMX (RIP) released two #1 albums in a single year (It's Dark and Hell Is Hot, Flesh of My Flesh), I don't think anybody is going to break Nikita's record any time soon. Talk about a banner year for the database OG Larry Ellison. The man turned 81 and accomplished more in one year than most people do in their lifetime. I will cover it all in chronological order. Larry started the year ranked third-richest in the world. The idea that he would be worth less than Mark Zuckerberg was keeping him up at night. Some were saying Larry's insomnia was due to a diet change after he bought a famous British pub and was eating more pies. But I assure you that Larry's "veg-aquarian" diet has not changed in 30 years. Then, in April 2025, we got the news that Larry had become the second-richest person in the world. He started sleeping a little better, but it still wasn't good enough. There was also still a lot going on in his life that was stressing him out. For example, Larry finally decided to sell his rare, semi-road-legal McLaren F1 supercar, complete with the original owner's manual in the glovebox. In July 2025, Larry graced us with this third tweet in 13 years (known as "#3" by Larry aficionados such as myself). This was an update about the Ellison Institute of Technology (EIT) that Larry established near the University of Oxford. With the name EIT and its association with Oxford, it sounds like it would be a pure research, non-profit institution, similar to Stanford's SRI or CMU's SEI. But it turns out to be an umbrella organization for a series of for-profit companies owned by a California-based limited liability company. Of course, a bunch of weirdos replied to #3 with promises of blockchain-powered cryogenic freezing or room-temperature superconductors. Larry told me he ignores those. Then there are people like this guy who get it. The biggest database news of the year (possibly the century) hit us on Wednesday, September 10th, at approximately 3:00pm EST. After waiting for his turn for decades, Larry Joseph Ellison was finally anointed the richest person in the world. $ORCL shares rose by 40% that morning, and since Larry still owns 40% of the company, his estimated total worth is $393b. To put this in perspective, this not only made Larry the wealthiest person in the world, but also the richest person in the entire history of humanity. The peak net worths, adjusted for inflation, of John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie (yes, the 'C' in CMU) were only $340b and $310b, respectively. On top of Larry's ascension to the top of the world, Oracle was also involved in the acquisition of the U.S. company controlling TikTok and Larry bankrolling Paramount (controlled by his son from his fourth marriage) bid to take over Warner Bros. The U.S. president even chided Larry to take control of CNN's news division since Larry is the majority shareholder of Paramount. I don't even know where to begin. Of course, when I found out that Larry Ellison had become the richest person in the world, all thanks to databases, I was heartened that something positive had finally happened in our lives. I don't care that Oracle's stock was artificially pumped up by splashy deals to build AI data centers instead of its traditional software business. I don't care that he dropped down the rankings after personally losing $130b in two months. That's like you and me blowing a paycheck on FortuneCoins. It stings a little, and we had to eat rice and beans for two weeks mixed with expired hot sauce packets we took from Taco Bell, but we'll be alright. Some people claim that Larry is out of touch with ordinary people. Or that he has lost his way because he is involved in things not directly related to databases. They point to things like his Hawaiian robot farm selling lettuce at $24/pound (â¬41/kg). Or that 81-year-old men don't have naturally blonde hair. The truth is that Larry Ellison has conquered the enterprise database world, competitive sailing, and techbro wellness spas. The obvious next step is to take over a cable TV channel watched by thousands of people waiting in airports every day. Every time I talk with Larry, he makes it clear that he does not care one bit what people say or think about him. He knows his fans love him. His (new) wife loves him. And in the end, that's all that matters. Before we close, I want to give some quick shout outs and words of advice. First is to PT for keeping their database game tight with Turso in lockdown (see you on the outside). Condolences to JT for losing their job for trapping their KevoDB database sidepiece. And be sure to only put in fake data in your database for testing and not to sell it for $175m only to end up getting a seven year bid. My Ph.D. students and I also have a new start-up. I hope to say more on that soon. Word is bond.

Title: Java and Event‑Driven Architectures: Kafka, Pulsar, and the Modern Streaming Landscape

Time Published: 2026-01-05T07:08:00Z
Full Content:
Event‑driven architectures have become a defining approach for building systems that react in real time, scale horizontally, and remain resilient under unpredictable workloads. Java, with its mature ecosystem and long history in enterprise environments, continues to be one of the strongest foundations for these architectures. Whether you’re working with Apache Kafka, Apache Pulsar, or stream‑processing frameworks like Flink and Kafka Streams, Java provides the tools and libraries needed to build reliable, event‑centric systems. Traditional systems store only the latest state of an entity. Event sourcing challenges that assumption by storing every change as an immutable event. Instead of asking “What is the current state?”, the system asks “What happened over time?” and reconstructs state by replaying events. This approach provides a complete audit trail, makes debugging easier, and allows new read models to be built long after the original events occurred. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) naturally fits into this model. By separating the write side (commands that change state) from the read side (queries that return state), systems can scale each part independently. Java frameworks like Axon Framework make these patterns accessible without forcing developers to reinvent the wheel. A simple Java event might look like this: This small snippet captures the essence of event sourcing: events are facts, immutable and expressive. Although Kafka often dominates discussions around event‑driven systems, it is far from the only messaging technology worth considering. Each platform—Kafka, Pulsar, and RabbitMQ—was built with a different philosophy, and understanding those differences helps teams choose the right tool for their architecture rather than defaulting to whatever is most popular. Kafka is fundamentally a distributed commit log. Its design revolves around partitions, sequential writes, and the ability for consumers to replay events from any point in time. This makes it exceptionally strong for high‑throughput pipelines, event sourcing, and long‑term retention scenarios. Pulsar, on the other hand, separates compute from storage by pairing brokers with Apache BookKeeper. This gives it a more cloud‑native elasticity model, allowing storage and messaging layers to scale independently. It also supports both streaming and traditional queue semantics, making it more flexible for multi‑tenant or hybrid workloads. RabbitMQ takes a more traditional approach, focusing on message routing, exchanges, and low‑latency delivery. It is not designed for event replay or large‑scale log retention, but it excels in transactional systems, RPC patterns, and workloads where messages must be delivered quickly and reliably. To make the distinctions clearer, here is a concise comparison: When viewed side by side, the differences become clearer. Kafka is the powerhouse for streaming and replay‑heavy workloads. Pulsar is the more flexible, cloud‑native option with strong multi‑tenant capabilities. RabbitMQ remains the go‑to solution for traditional messaging patterns where routing and low latency matter more than historical replay. The right choice depends entirely on the nature of the system you’re building and the operational model you want to support. Once events are flowing, the next challenge is making sense of them in real time. Java developers have two powerful tools at their disposal. Kafka Streams is a lightweight library that runs inside your application. It doesn’t require deploying a separate cluster, which makes it ideal for microservices that need embedded stream processing. Its API is intentionally simple, allowing developers to transform, aggregate, and join streams with minimal overhead. Apache Flink is a distributed stream‑processing engine designed for large‑scale, stateful computations. It supports event‑time processing, exactly‑once semantics, and sophisticated windowing strategies. Flink is often used when the processing logic is complex or when workloads require high availability and fault tolerance across large clusters. A small Kafka Streams example illustrates how approachable stream transformations can be: This simplicity is one of the reasons Kafka Streams has become so popular in microservice architectures. Event‑driven systems embrace the idea that different parts of the system may not be perfectly synchronized at all times. Instead of forcing synchronous updates across services, each service processes events at its own pace. This leads to a model known as eventual consistency, where the system converges to a correct state over time. Designing for eventual consistency requires a mindset shift. Developers must think about idempotent event handlers, clear retry strategies, and the possibility that some services may temporarily lag behind others. Monitoring becomes essential, not just for performance but for understanding how far behind consumers are and whether the system is behaving as expected. No matter how carefully a system is designed, some events will fail processing. Dead letter queues (DLQs) provide a safety net by capturing problematic events so they can be inspected, corrected, or replayed later. Kafka typically handles DLQs through consumer logic or Kafka Connect’s built‑in error handling. Pulsar includes native DLQ support with configurable redelivery policies. RabbitMQ uses Dead Letter Exchanges (DLX) to route failed messages to dedicated queues. A healthy DLQ strategy doesn’t just store failed events — it preserves context, including the reason for failure, so teams can diagnose issues quickly. This prevents silent data loss and ensures that failures become visible rather than buried. As systems evolve, event schemas inevitably change. Adding fields, renaming attributes, or restructuring data can break consumers if not handled carefully. Tools like Confluent Schema Registry or Pulsar’s built‑in schema registry help enforce compatibility rules and prevent incompatible changes from being deployed. Good schema evolution practices include adding new fields with defaults, avoiding the removal of required fields, and ensuring backward and forward compatibility. These practices allow old consumers and new producers to coexist without forcing synchronized deployments — a key advantage in distributed systems. Scalability in event‑driven architectures is influenced by many factors: how topics are partitioned, how consumer groups are balanced, how retention policies are configured, and how stream processors are deployed. Kafka’s partitioning strategy, for example, directly affects throughput and parallelism. Pulsar’s namespace and topic model allows fine‑grained scaling and isolation. Flink and Kafka Streams scale horizontally by distributing processing tasks across nodes. Java frameworks like Vert.x, Quarkus, and Spring WebFlux complement these systems by offering non‑blocking, reactive programming models that handle high‑throughput event streams efficiently. Event‑driven architectures thrive on decoupling, scalability, and real‑time responsiveness. Java’s ecosystem — from Kafka and Pulsar to Flink and Kafka Streams — provides everything needed to build robust, future‑proof systems. By embracing event sourcing, designing for eventual consistency, handling schema evolution thoughtfully, and planning for scalability from the start, teams can build systems that grow gracefully and adapt to changing requirements.

January 05, 2026 01:30 ET | Source: NICOX SA NICOX SA Press Release Nicox Announces Complete Repayment of Kreos Capital Debt and Extends Cash Runway Beyond 2027 with New Additional Financing January 5, 2026 – release at 7:30 am CETSophia Antipolis, France Nicox SA (Euronext Growth Paris: FR0013018124, ALCOX), an international ophthalmology company, today announced repayment of all secured debt and extension of its cash runway beyond 2027 with an additional unsecured financing. “The full repayment of our debt to funds and accounts managed by Kreos Capital announced today removes a number of obligations on the Company as a result of the security interests granted over Nicox’s assets. In the last 24 months, we have demonstrated our ability to meet our timelines and fulfil our obligations, and we appreciate the support that our long-term debtholders have given us,” said Gavin Spencer, Chief Executive Officer of Nicox. “To reinforce our cash position and better manage our resources, we have taken the opportunity to continue our successful collaboration with our financing partner and shareholder, Vester Finance. Based on our current cash on hand and the current timelines, this additional financing of up to €4 million extends our cash runway beyond the end of 2027. We are now in a healthier and significantly stronger position to navigate the future, including in our strategic discussions.” Nicox has fully repaid all outstanding debt with funds and accounts managed by Kreos Capital1 using existing cash at 31 December 2025, thereby releasing all security guarantees over Nicox assets and terminating the right for Kreos Capital to appoint an Observer to the Board of Directors. This transaction coincides with raising new financing through the issuance of bonds to European investors, including Vester Finance, a current financing partner and established institutional investor. This financing consists of an issue of €3 million of convertible bonds and €1 million of ordinary bonds (subject to certain conditions precedent) and extends the Company’s cash runway beyond the end of 2027. This financing does not have any guarantee or security interest associated with it. Nicox is continuing to evaluate future strategic growth opportunities, including collaborations or business combinations. Key Future Milestones Cash Runway Based on the expected upcoming milestones, including the submission of an NCX 470 New Drug Application in the U.S. and a standard review period of 12 months, the financing announced today and the repayment of the Kreos Capital debt, the Company believes that its current activities are financed to beyond the end of 2027. The Company remains committed to cost control and optimizing resource allocation while maintaining the capabilities required to support our strategic objectives. If any of the assumptions around estimated income or costs change, this may impact the cash runway. Potential proceeds from existing warrants and the €1 million additional bond financing, subject to certain conditions precedent, are not included in the above cash runway calculation. Full Repayment of the Kreos Capital Debt Nicox originally subscribed to a secured long-term debt with funds and accounts managed by Kreos Capital totalling €20 million in 2019. Today’s payment reimburses the remaining outstanding balance of that debt in totality. In accordance with the amendment announced on 14 October 2024, Kreos Capital retains 17 warrants giving the right to acquire 400,000 shares per warrant in Nicox at €0.25, which can be exercised until 14 October 2036. As of 31 December 2025, Nicox’s remaining debt amounted to €0.3 million, consisting entirely of the outstanding balance of a COVID loan, which will be repaid from cash in hand by the end of August 2026. New Bond Financing from Institutional Investors The issuance of the convertible bonds was carried out based on the delegation granted by the Company’s shareholders during the General Meeting held on June 27, 2025, under the 13th resolution2. The convertible bonds, with a nominal unit value of €10, were subscribed at 92% of their nominal value for a total subscription price of €3,000,028.00, paid in full on the day of subscription. The bonds bear no interest and are unsecured. The bonds are convertible at any time, at a conversion price determined based on the stock market price3 at the time, in accordance with pricing rules and the ceiling set by the shareholders’ meeting. The ordinary bonds with a nominal unit value of €9.20, have been subscribed by the same investors at 100% of their nominal value, for a total subscription price of €1,000,003.20. They do not bear any interest nor guarantees and have the same term as the convertible bonds. Their subscription price will be made as one payment, at the moment when certain conditions have been met, at the latest at the start of September 2026. At a term of 24 months following the issuance of the debt, the bonds will be redeemed at maturity at 100% of their nominal value if they have not been converted at that date. This transaction was advised by Vester Finance, which is also a subscriber to these bonds. For illustrative purposes, if all convertible bonds were converted based on the Nicox share closing price on December 31, 2025, a shareholder holding 1% of the capital (calculated on the basis of the number of outstanding shares as of December 31, 2025) prior to the issuance and conversion would hold 0.876% of the capital on a non-diluted basis and 0.650% on a fully diluted basis. The new shares issued from conversion will be subject to all the provisions of the Company’s bylaws. They will be fully fungible with existing ordinary shares and will carry the same rights. Risk Factors Risk factors affecting the Company are detailed in section 3 of the “Rapport Annuel 2024” and in section 4 of the “Rapport semestriel 2025” which are available on Nicox’s website (www.nicox.com). Since the conversion price of the bonds set out above is linked to the Company’s share price, the exact number of shares to be issued upon conversion cannot be determined at the time of issuance, and such conversion may significantly dilute existing shareholders. Impact on the shareholder’s situation and on the distribution of share capital The following table, provided for illustrative purposes only, outlines various scenarios regarding the impact of the issuance of new shares resulting from the conversion of convertible bonds on the shareholder’s situation, depending on the evolution of the share price. *Closing price at 31 December 2025, i.e. €0.2980**Calculated on the basis of 88,441,773 Nicox shares as of December 31, 2025 The table below presents the Company’s share capital structure before and after the conversion of the convertible bonds, based on information available to the Company, and on the assumption that all the bonds are converted at a conversion price corresponding to the closing share price as at 31 December 2025: Prospectus – Admission to trading The bonds will not be subject to any application for admission to trading on Euronext Growth. This issue does not give rise to the preparation of a prospectus subject to the approval of the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF). Termination of the PACEO4 Equity Financing Line The PACEO Equity Line with Vester Finance announced on 6 March 2025 and extended on 8 August 2025 is now finished. It has permitted Nicox to raise €3.9 million, through the issuance of 15,000,000 new shares.

Business LONDON/NEW YORK, ‌Jan 5 : Global stock markets, riding high on AI euphoria at the start of 2026 may be disregarding one of the biggest threats that could spoil the party: a surge in inflation driven partly by the tech investment boom. U.S. stock indexes, where seven tech groups contributed half of all market earnings this year, made double-digit gains in 2025 to hit record highs as exuberance about AI and monetary easing also propelled European and Asian equities to record peaks. Expectations for further rate cuts have buoyed bonds too, handing U.S. Treasury investors the best annual performance for five years as inflation retreated, although it remains above the Federal Reserve's average 2 per cent target. For 2026, waves of government stimulus in the U.S., Europe and Japan as well as the AI boom are expected to refuel global growth.

Title: ESG Hits Record $799B in ETF Assets Globally

Investors are still flocking to environmental, social and governance funds, even as criticism has grown louder on Capitol Hill. Sean Allocca sean@thedailyupside.com ESG may be the most controversial acronym in finance, but don’t tell that to ETF investors. Environmental, social and governance exchange-traded funds reached a new milestone, with global assets climbing to $799 billion through the end of November, according to ETFGI data. The category pulled in $5.7 billion in November alone, bringing year-to-date inflows to almost $49 billion, a 25% increase over the prior year. But it also comes at a pivotal time, as asset managers continue to downplay ESG labels and critics on Capitol Hill have accused fund managers of everything from political bias to regulatory overreach. The resurgence of ESG funds could also become a savvy play for financial advisors looking to attract younger, more sustainability-minded clients. “Political winds are fickle, but long-term investors recognize reality,” said Max Kulyk, founder of the fee-only planning firm Chicory Wealth. “Criticism from lawmakers has only turned up the volume.” Last year’s sales tally ranked sixth-highest on record, though it trailed years during ESG’s heyday: Inflows peaked at $147 billion in 2021. Broad strategies attracted the bulk of assets, but investors also directed money toward clean energy, green bonds and transition-focused funds. “What we are actually seeing is the ‘weeding out’ of products that were never truly impact investments to begin with,” Kulyk said. “Products [got] slapped with an ‘ESG’ label during the boom a few years back, opaquely structured as ETFs or mutual funds, with no transparency into the environmental or societal impact of the companies within them.” The data also show: “Under the current political climate, ESG as a label has come under attack,” said Kristin Hull, founder of Nia Impact Capital. “Yet, business concerns about the material aspects of the environment, human capital and governance are more pertinent than ever.” It’s Not Easy Being Green. One of the longstanding issues has been finding a standardized criteria for ESG products. That still seems to be the case with 56% of adopters saying there is a lack of clarity around what the strategy actually means, according to a survey cited in the data. Younger generations, like millennials and Gen Z, are especially motivated by sustainability and are choosing financial advisors based on it, Hull said. “As the Great Wealth Transfer takes place, women and younger investors see climate as a key risk factor and want their money aligned with the economy they want to see.” Vega Capital Partners filed for 16 highly leveraged ETFs not long after the SEC told other issuers that such products wouldn’t fly. Tuttle’s GRFT fund aims to capitalize on the links between power and profit in government but was turned away by all the major US exchanges. ETF Launches, flows and assets were higher than ever in 2025, as issuers and investors expanded into niche categories. ETFs, particularly strategies built around AI and crypto assets, saw massive growth among RIAs this past year. Advisors are expected to utilize more artificial intelligence tools next year and even launch their own chatbots. The five funds with the best returns tracked companies that mined precious metals, with one ETF up 200% year-to-date. Dozens of companies recently got approval from the SEC to add ETF share classes of mutual funds and vice versa, something they’ve waited years for. The funds have taken in tens of billions of dollars in inflows this year as enthusiasm for digital currencies continues. Allocations will go toward companies that exhibit favorable future estimates of cash flow, earnings per share, price targets and sales. Its two diversified bond ETFs can’t match the private-credit allocations of less-liquid vehicles, but they are beating 92% of peers. Avantis Investors reached the asset milestone during a big year of growth and a legal proceeding over naming rights. There are 11 ETFs with over 5% of assets allocated to the stock. But most assets are held in gigantic funds with small exposures. © 2026 The Daily Upside

Title: Is the AI boom a bubble waiting to pop? Here’s what history says

As the artificial intelligence trade continues to push the stock market to new highs, investors are increasingly asking if we’re living through another financial bubble that’s destined to burst. The answer isn’t so simple, at least according to history. The S&P 500 Index jumped 16% in 2025, with AI winners Nvidia Corp., Alphabet Inc., Broadcom Inc. and Microsoft Corp. contributing the most. But at the same time, concerns are mounting about the hundreds of billions of dollars Big Tech has pledged to spend on AI infrastructure. Capital expenditures from Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. are expected to rise 34% to roughly $440 billion combined over the next year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Meanwhile, OpenAI has committed to spending more than $1 trillion on AI infrastructure, an eye-popping number for a closely held company that isn’t profitable. But perhaps even more troubling is the circular nature of many of its arrangements, in which investments and spending go back and forth between OpenAI and a few publicly traded tech giants. Throughout history, over-investment has been a common theme when there’s a technological advancement that will transform society, according to Invesco chief global market strategist Brian Levitt, who pointed to the development of railroads, electricity and the internet. This time may be no different. “At some point the infrastructure build may exceed what the economy will need over a short period of time,” he said. “But that doesn’t mean that the rail tracks weren’t finished or the internet didn’t become a thing, right?” Still, with equity valuations creeping up and the S&P 500 just posting its third straight year of double-digit percentage gains, it makes sense that investors are growing concerned about how much upside is left and how much market value could be lost if AI doesn’t live up to the hype. Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon.com, Broadcom and Meta Platforms account for almost 30% of the S&P 500, so an AI selloff would hit the index hard. “A bubble likely crashes on a bear market,” said Gene Goldman, chief investment officer at Cetera Financial Group, who doesn’t believe AI stocks are in a bubble. “We just don’t see a bear market anytime soon.” Here’s how today’s AI boom stacks up against previous market bubbles. One simple way of gaging whether the AI-fueled tech rally has gone too far or too fast is to compare it against past bull runs. Looking at 10 equity bubbles from around the world since 1900, they lasted just over two-and-a-half years on average with a trough-to-peak gain of 244%, according to research by Bank of America strategist Michael Hartnett. By comparison, the AI-driven rally is in its third year, with the S&P 500 rising 79% since the end of 2022 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index gaining 130%. While it’s difficult to draw any conclusions from the data, Hartnett warns investors against fleeing the stock market even if they believe it’s in a bubble because the last stretch of the rally is typically the steepest, and missing out would be costly. One way to hedge is to buy cheap value plays like UK stocks and energy companies, he said. The S&P 500’s 10 biggest stocks now account for roughly 40% of the index, a level of concentration not seen since the 1960s. That has put some investors off, including Wall Street research veteran Ed Yardeni, who said in December that it no longer makes sense to recommend overweighting tech stocks. Market historians argue that, while the concentration seems extreme relative to recent memory, there are precedents. Top stocks as a share of the US market were at similar levels in the 1930s and 1960s, according to London Business School professor Paul Marsh, who studied the past 125 years of global asset returns. In 1900, 63% of US market value was tied to railroad stocks, compared with 37% tied to technology at the end of 2024, Marsh said. Asset bubbles tend to be much harder to spot in real time than after the fact because fundamentals are usually at the center of the debate, and the metrics investors focus on can be fluid, according to TS Lombard economist Dario Perkins. “It is easy for tech enthusiasts to claim that ‘it’s different now’ and that fundamental valuations will never be the same again,” he said. But some fundamentals are always important. For example, compared with the dot-com bubble, today’s AI giants have lower debt-to-earnings ratios than, say, WorldCom Inc. And companies like Nvidia and Meta Platforms are already reporting strong profit growth from AI, which wasn’t necessarily the case in the speculative era 25 years ago. The potential for credit risk in the AI trade is making some investors nervous. After Oracle Corp. sold $18 billion in bonds on Sept. 24, the stock plunged 5.6% the next day and it’s down 37% since then. Meta, Alphabet and Oracle will need to raise $86 billion combined in 2026 alone, according to an estimate by Societe Generale. The S&P 500’s valuation is the highest it’s ever been except for the early 2000s, at least according to its cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, a metric invented by economist Robert Shiller that divides a stock price by the average of its inflation-adjusted earnings over the past 10 years. Bullish investors argue that while market valuations are rising because of tech, the pace of increase is much slower than the dot-com era. At one point in 2000, Cisco Systems Inc. was priced at over 200 times its previous 12 months of earnings, while Nvidia is at less than 50 times today. Stock prices decouple from earnings growth in an environment where there’s no debate on valuations, according to Richard Clode, a fund manager at Janus Henderson. “We’re just not seeing that currently as yet,” he said. Discussions of a potential stock bubble percolated throughout the year but picked up significantly in November and December amid warnings from investor Michael Burry and the Bank of England. More than 12,000 stories in November mentioned the phrase “AI bubble,” roughly equal to the prior ten months combined, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Investors see an AI bubble as the biggest “tail risk” event, a December poll by Bank of America showed. More than half of the respondents said the Magnificent Seven tech stocks were Wall Street’s most crowded trade. This contrasts with the dot-com bubble, when there was “complete excitement about the internet revolutionizing everything,” said Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays. And the questions about whether AI investments will pay off are increasing as the debt issuance rises. “I wouldn’t brush it off, but I would generally think that scrutiny is healthy,” he said. “In fact, that scrutiny is what will prevent extreme moves like a crash.”

Personalise the news and stay in the know Emergency Backstory Newsletters 中文新闻 BERITA BAHASA INDONESIA TOK PISIN Find any issues using dark mode? Please let us know analysis By Kirsten Aiken By Michael Janda By Daniel Ziffer By Gareth Hutchens By Alicia Barry By David Taylor By Stephanie Chalmers By Emilia Terzon Topic:Economic Trends and Indicators The Reserve Bank Governor Michele Bullock has already indicated the quarter's trimmed mean (or core inflation) will be key to the RBA's deliberations for interest rates in early February. (AAP Image/Dean Lewins) What are you watching in 2026 when it comes to the economy or markets? That's the question we put to the ABC's business journalists, presenters and commentators as we head into the new year. From the Japanese bond market to intergenerational inequality and from unemployment to electric vehicles, here's what they're keeping an eye on in 2026. Inflation is the indicator to watch in early 2026. In fact, set an alarm for 11.30am on January 28. That is when the Australian Bureau of Statistics will release the December quarter's CPI. The Reserve Bank Governor Michele Bullock has already indicated the quarter's trimmed mean (or core inflation) will be key to the RBA's deliberations for interest rates in early February. Bullock could not have been clearer when fronting the media pack for the final time in 2025. She emphasised time and again the RBA is alert to the signs of a more broad-based pick-up in inflation. The jawboning saw financial markets immediately reprice rate expectations. But was it also a warning to Australians to watch their holiday budgets, as well as the federal government to rein in the public spending of recent years ahead of a rate rise? We have been given fair warning that the cash rate of 3.6 per cent could move higher in 2026. The likelihood of whether a hike could happen early in February, and at the RBA's first opportunity for the year, will become much clearer as early as 11.30am on January 28. Business editor Michael Janda will be interviewing the RBA's deputy governor Andrew Hauser on January 8. (AAP: Lukas Coch) What will happen to unemployment in 2026? Australia's unemployment rate touched a 50-year low of 3.4 per cent in October 2022, but it has been slowly grinding higher for the last three years. In November it was 4.3 per cent. The Reserve Bank thinks it will need to settle around 4.4 per cent for inflation to be under control. Economists like to point out that an unemployment rate of 4.4 per cent is still low by modern historical standards. Between 1993 (when inflation-targeting began) and the start of 2020 (when the COVID pandemic hit), the unemployment rate averaged 6.3 per cent. So if inflation can settle back down inside the RBA's 2-3 per cent target range, and the unemployment rate can stay around 4.4 per cent, the RBA will take that as a win. But if unemployment keeps rising, and other measures of "spare capacity" in the labour market (underemployment, youth unemployment, etc) keep deteriorating, the RBA's hopes of "locking in" the hard-won employment gains from the COVID lockdowns may blow away with the wind. Like most mortgage borrowers, I'll be watching interest rates closely in 2026. But what are they going to do? After the Reserve Bank's most recent rate cut in August markets were confident there'd be another two rate cuts by February, which would have taken the cash rate to 3.1 per cent, with a fair chance of a third cut before 2026 was done. Fast forward past a couple of shockingly high inflation numbers and a press conference where Michele Bullock laid bare on the table that the choice now was between rates on hold and rates rising, and that market pricing has flipped completely. Traders now collectively think there's close to a 40 per cent chance of a rate rise in February, a near-certainty of one by June, and a better than 50-50 chance of two before the end of 2026. I attend almost every one of RBA boss Michele Bullock's press conferences, sit in all their Statement on Monetary Policy media lock-ups, and even have the odd one-on-one background chat with senior officials. So what do I think? If I was a betting man, I'd wager on an extended hold because, as my colleague Gareth Hutchens points out, the jobs market looks a little shaky and I think the RBA would want to wait and see how things develop before raising rates. But, as Kirsten Aiken notes, another couple of shockers for inflation data coming out on January 7 and 28 could force the bank's hand as early as February. I'll be interviewing the RBA's deputy governor Andrew Hauser on January 8, so maybe he'll give us a bit of a steer… but I wouldn't bet on it. Housing has become increasingly unaffordable for younger Australians. (ABC News: John Gunn) Intergenerational inequality is the biggest thing. Younger people are being saddled with debt (personal and government) face the dizzying cost of dealing with the climate crisis and housing… Housing? I've only been given 200 words and I'm trying to swear less. Our tax settings. Our benefits. The divergent ways we treat income from work and income from assets (like homes and shares). In the second year of a second term, this is the time for Labor to take dramatic shifts to re-balance systems that overwhelmingly preference older and wealthier people. For the Coalition the choice is much simpler: change or die. The Australian Electoral Study demonstrates the "conservative maturation" theory — that people vote more conservatively as they age — isn't happening. Some Millennials (born between 1981 and 1996) are 45-years-old: this year the Coalition won just 21 per cent of that group. I don't think anyone, as they gently rub the back of their grizzling baby through a sleepless night, with a long day of work stretching in front of them, thinks: "When my children do this, I hope things are harder for them." But that's what we've done. We need to change it. For the first time, in the inner city it seems feasible to own an EV without at-home charging capacity, with more councils rolling out street charging. (Troy Sincock, ABC) In 2026 I'm going to be watching how electrification is accelerating in our economy. I live in inner Sydney, so I'm very aware it's a particular type of bubble, but it is a very populous one. The increased number of electric vehicles on our roads is incredibly noticeable. That's reflected in the government's decision to review its Electric Car Discount, citing industry data showing EVs now comprise about 10 per cent of new vehicle sales. Car manufacturers had been accused of dumping their least efficient petrol cars in Australia, as we trailed other jurisdictions in restrictions on the sale of new combustion engine cars (although it seems Europe may be winding back its planned ban). Now, there's talk of China flooding the market with cheap EVs — the number of models available here has skyrocketed. Whilst you used to only see the odd top-end Tesla, you'd now be hard pressed to take a glance at Parramatta Road and not spot a bunch of BYDs and mid-range EVs from the major manufacturers. The second-hand EV market will keep gaining more depth too. For the first time, in the inner city it seems feasible to own an EV without at-home charging capacity, with more councils rolling out street charging. The government has also said energy retailers will need to offer free power in the middle of the day, to spread the benefits of solar beyond those who can afford panels and batteries, including to renters. So is 2026 the year of electrification for the masses? Let's see. The low interest rate 'risk on' environment supported gains in risky assets like equities across the board, particularly in technology stocks. (ABC News: John Gunn) If rates move higher will investors have to work harder for returns? Active managers, who focus on the performance and outlook of individual companies have had a tough run in the last few years locally, outpaced by passive money chasing the benchmarks, like index funds. The low interest rate "risk on" environment supported gains in risky assets like equities across the board, particularly in technology stocks. Blackrock strategist for APAC and the Middle East Ben Powell says if rates drift higher, investors need an active investment strategy, "having to pick where we have conviction, be that in artificial intelligence or elsewhere. Because the central bankers, they're still nice people, but they're constrained by inflation from being quite as supportive for risk and for markets as we all got used to." So where to look if rates go up? Citi says AI won't dominate quite as much in 2026 and expects cyclical stocks (those exposed to economic cycles like miners) to do well. The investment bank prefers financial stocks over consumer staples (which are typically seen as defensive). It's possible 2026 will finally be the year of the stock picker.

Japanese stocks sank while other Asian markets gained Monday after Japan reported a record economic contraction as the coronavirus pandemic weighed on retailing, investment and exports. (AP: Eugene Hoshiko) All eyes will be on the Bank of Japan in coming weeks and months. It's considered a giant funding source to the world's global financial markets, especially Wall Street. In past decades Japanese interest rates have been extremely low. Known as the carry trade, investors would borrow yen from Japan and invest in US assets including Treasury bills and stocks on Wall Street, which offered relatively lucrative returns. On December 19, the Bank of Japan, keen to hit its inflation target of 2 per cent and with one eye on increased business confidence, hiked its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points to 0.75 per cent. In contrast the Reserve Bank of Australia's cash rate stands at 3.6 per cent. Immediately following the announcement, the Japan 10-year government bond yield rose above 2 per cent — it's highest level since 1995. Trillions of dollars are tied up in and around the carry trade and Japanese investments in the US. The key question is how high Japanese interest rates need to go before borrowing from Japan becomes too expensive, overriding future returns from US assets. In this case, large flows of money could return home to Japan, deeply cutting into Wall Street liquidity and, potentially, Australian superannuation funds currently heavily exposed to American markets. Australian businesses were caught out by US President Donald Trump's global upheaval in 2025. (Reuters: Jonathan Ernst) I'll be watching out for more tariff turmoil. Australian businesses — from beef producers through to bikini designers — were caught out by US President Donald Trump's global upheaval in 2025. We even had Australia Post temporarily suspend most shipping to the US! Many businesses are still recovering from the disruption to their supply chains and pricing structures, especially those that manufacture goods in China and then import them into the US. I'll be looking out for how the Australian government, including Austrade, deals with any more disruption, and of course at any more tariff directions out of the White House.

Title: Is DFAC ETF Still A Buy After 15% Run?

Investing DFAC returned 15% over the past year but matched the S&P 500 despite charging fees for factor-based tilts. Rising 10-year Treasury yields above 4.2% threaten DFAC’s small-cap holdings while 40% of Russell 2000 stocks remain unprofitable. The fund holds $40B with 16% in NVDA, MSFT and AAPL while maintaining a 0.17% expense ratio. Sending You to Google News in 3 © bigjom jom / Shutterstock.com The Dimensional U.S. Core Equity 2 ETF (NYSEARCA:DFAC) has delivered a 15% gain over the past year, essentially matching the S&P 500’s return. Investors paid for Dimensional’s factor-based approach and got market performance. DFAC’s 2026 performance will likely depend less on 2025 results and more on what drives 2026 returns. DFAC manages nearly $40 billion using a strategy that tilts toward smaller companies while maintaining mega-cap tech exposure. The fund’s top three holdings are NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), representing nearly 16% of assets. Information technology accounts for 26% of the portfolio. This isn’t a pure small-cap fund-it’s a core equity strategy that leans into factor premiums when available but doesn’t abandon the market’s growth engines. Small-cap stocks live and die by interest rates, and 2026 presents a complicated picture. The Federal Reserve has delivered three rate cuts, bringing the federal funds rate to 3.5% to 3.75%. But longer-term Treasury yields have been climbing, with the 10-year hitting its highest level since September. That’s a problem for DFAC’s small-cap holdings. Small companies often rely on floating-rate debt, so they benefit when short-term rates fall. But rising long-term yields shrink the present value of future earnings, particularly for unprofitable companies. About 40% of Russell 2000 stocks didn’t turn a profit over the past year, according to Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO). DFAC’s factor screens help avoid the worst offenders, but the fund still holds plenty of smaller firms whose valuations depend on optimistic growth assumptions. Watch the 10-year Treasury yield weekly. If it continues climbing above 4.2%, the small-cap tilt that defines DFAC becomes a headwind. If yields stabilize or fall as the Fed continues easing, that same tilt becomes an advantage. The CME FedWatch Tool currently shows no rate cut priced in until April 2026 at the earliest. DFAC’s 33% concentration in its top 10 holdings is lower than most broad market funds, but those names still matter. The fund collected $0.39 in dividends per share in 2025, up 9% from 2024. That income comes primarily from large, profitable companies, not speculative small caps. The 0.17% expense ratio and 4% portfolio turnover mean DFAC isn’t churning through positions chasing momentum. Dimensional publishes quarterly fact sheets showing sector weights and top holdings. Check those documents to see whether the fund is increasing or decreasing small-cap exposure. If the team is adding to smaller names, they’re betting on rate cuts and economic resilience. If they’re pulling back, they see risks you should understand. The Avantis U.S. Small Cap Value ETF (NYSEARCA:AVUV) charges 0.25% and manages $17 billion with a more concentrated bet on small-cap value stocks. It doesn’t own NVDA or AAPL. If you believe small-cap value will outperform in 2026, AVUV delivers that thesis more directly than DFAC’s balanced approach. DFAC’s performance in 2026 will likely depend on whether interest rates stabilize and small-cap earnings catch up to large caps. The 10-year Treasury yield and quarterly fact sheets will show whether the fund’s positioning aligns with these market conditions. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

Title: Xreal releases new AR glasses and power hub to transform work and entertainment
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/04/xreal-releases-new-ar-glasses-power-hub-transform-work-entertainment/
Time Published: 2026-01-04T14:00:47Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 09:00 EST / JANUARY 04 2026 by Kyt Dotson Augmented reality device maker Xreal Inc. released the Xreal 1S today, a new premium pair of 3D spatial display glasses, and a compact power hub that combines a battery and video passthrough. The 1S joins the Xreal One Series, including the One and One Pro, providing a powerful foundation for wearable AR displays. The company said the 1S represents a new standard for AR displays and is a market replacement for the initial Xreal One, released in December 2024. 1S provides an immersive, cinema-grade experience with the ability to project a 171-inch spatial screen while building on core aspects of the One. It increases resolution from 1080p to 1200p FullHD, delivers brightness of 700 nits, and offers a larger field of view at 52 degrees. When moving between outdoors and indoors, the glasses can change their display settings using electrochromic dimming to adapt to lighting conditions. The glasses also feature Sound by Bose technology, eliminating the need for earbuds or headphones, and are capable of delivering high-fidelity audio directly near the ears. All of this is built into a lightweight 82-gram frame. Although this is heavier than the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, which weigh 49-51 grams, the S1 packs in numerous productivity and entertainment features. The Ray-Ban smart glasses also only project onto one lens, so they do not provide a 3D augmented reality display like the S1. For comparison, some regular sunglasses weigh about 45 grams, making these glasses feel heavier on the face. Users can place floating screens in their vision that “anchor in place” and do not move when they move their head, or they can generate an ultra-large cinema screen that will stay in front of their vision at all times. For productivity, “side view” allows pinning a smaller screen to a corner of vision, such as the top-right or bottom-right, allowing users to multitask by watching content while seeing the real-world surroundings clearly. Available today, the Xreal 1S lowers the price from its predecessor, the Xreal One, from $499 to $449. That makes it more affordable for entry-level consumers. “Every Xreal One Series product has raised the bar for what wearable displays can achieve,” said co-founder and Chief Executive Chi Xu. “With Xreal 1S, we’re not only lowering the cost of entry, we’re doing so while boosting specs and performance, and improving optics.” In addition to the 1S, Xreal launched a power accessory called Neo, providing extended battery life for longer sessions. The Neo serves as a DisplayPort video hub with a 10,000 mAh power bank, eliminating the need for additional adapters or chargers. It supports 30-watt input and 20-watt output on battery and up to 45-watt output when connected to a wall charger. Beyond battery life, the Neo permits higher video performance gains when streaming from other devices. It also unlocks the ability to connect to the Nintendo Switch handheld, without the need for the previously required dock. Xreal 1S users can experience the Nintendo Inc. Switch’s onboard screen at 1080p resolutions. Valve Corp. SteamDeck owners can receive up to 1200p resolution. “Xreal 1S brings true cinema-quality spatial displays to more people than ever before, while Xreal Neo redefines what’s possible in portable AR by solving one of the industry’s biggest limitations – power and performance on the go,” said Xu.

Title: Why Nvidia Could Have a Terrible Year in 2026, And Why It Might Not Be So Bad

Investing Nvidia faces deceleration risk if hyperscaler capex spending slows from recent elevated levels. Nearly all mega-cap tech companies are developing competing chips that threaten Nvidia’s market dominance. A Nvidia slowdown could benefit broader markets if AI cost declines drive efficiency gains elsewhere. Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. Among the top-performing (and most closely-watched) stocks in the market, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has to be on every investor’s radar. That’s mostly because this is the largest company in the world. As such, Nvidia’s price movements on a daily basis can swing the market in one direction or another – that’s how market cap-weighted indices work, after all. Thus, price predictions around where Nvidia will ultimately end up in 2026 are meaningful, and could have a significant impact on where investors think the overall market could be headed in the year to come. Let’s dive into a few of the challenges Nvidia could face in 2026, and take a more bearish perspective on this stock from a skeptical angle. I find such an exercise to be useful, even for investors such as myself who are generally bullish on the direction of this stock over the medium to long-term. Man fighting a bear on top of a red arrow heading lower I think the key risk facing Nvidia and its investor base this year is Capex-related growth which could be decelerating off of extremely high levels. Simply put, hyperscalers who have been investing heavily in the data center and AI buildout have been buying Nvidia chips to run their models one. With a fully integrated stack which includes key software that allows AI developers to utilize these chips to their maximum potential, Nvidia has created a world-class ecosystem which drives significant network effects that provide growing cash flows over time that are very difficult to replicate. The thing is, if the growth we’ve seen thus far in this buildout slows, and investors catch a whiff of a diminished backlog or some indication that future growth may not be as robust, this is a stock that could have significant downside from here. That’s mostly because investors can generally agree that NVDA stock is priced to perfection (or even a bit above perfection), with continuous earnings beats already priced into this name. If AI bubble chatter picks up, and some of Nvidia’s customers continue to turn into direct competitors (nearly all mega-cap tech companies are in the process of, or have already developed, their own chips), then Nvidia’s stranglehold on the high-performance chip market could deteriorate. If regulatory and labor bottlenecks further slow this AI buildout, then other key drivers could drive bearish momentum for this stock. In other words, things need to continue rolling as they have in recent years, and Nvidia will need to avoid these key potholes in the road ahead, to continue marching higher to the next $trillion thresholds along the way. Elderly couple looking at their portfolios in a surprised and positive way When I think about the headwinds Nvidia is facing right now, I also realize that these headwinds could have opposite and offsetting effects from other companies. If we do see a widespread Capex spending slowdown from the largest players in tech, then it’s entirely possible we could also see profits surge as existing AI technology creates added efficiencies and allows companies to earn more profits with less people. Of course, there’s a downside for the labor market if this takes place. But it’s also true that in the event that more Nvidia customers become direct competitors, that prices of AI technology and models could come down, which could be a net benefit both for consumers and for the entire AI ecosystem. In such an event, Nvidia’s potential decline could come at the benefit of many other companies and individuals (large and small), which could drive outsized economic growth. That’s the bullish take on how this bearish narrative could unravel. I think we need to see a broadening of the leadership Nvidia and other key tech giants have dominated in terms of market returns in recent history. Perhaps these well-choreographed headwinds will materialize, and it won’t be such a bad thing for investors or consumers over the long-term. We’ll see.

The page where this image originates is full of similarly-themed and obviously CGI/AI generated pictures, and the site hosting it, stockcake.com, touts “Millions of free AI stock photos”, and “Sign up to use AI-powered tools — Join 300,000+ creators • Free forever • No credit card required”. That term ‘creators’ is a bit of a stretch. All they did was to take other people’s work and used a computer to bodgy up their own version which puts the real, original creators out of work. And people wonder why I despise Silicon Valley culture. The hosting site is totally open about it. Witness: “Recreate this image — Sign up to generate variations — 50 free credits daily — Commercial license included — No credit card required” Respectively: “Apply stunning effects — Sign up to use AI tools on this image…” The well of artistic creation is truly and hopelessly poisoned. A post by a sort-of respected medical researcher on twitter had an AI-generated image and someone replied that it would be better to not use this stuff. The researcher (what a nerve) told the replier to make an image for him if they didn’t like the AI. Someone else replied “f off with your anti-AI propaganda”. Anti-AI propaganda? Where are people’s heads at, my god. Makes me wonder if the reply was generated by… wait for it….. an LLM AI Bot? I replaced the AI panda image with a real panda trio. Some pictures are too good to be true. The new photo is great, thanks. It’s a bear band lp cover photo. I think they play bluegrass. Thanks Haig. Much more pleasing to the eye <3 i watch broadcast TV via youtube. My suspicion is that 33 – 49% of youtube adverts are made via generative AI. Hollywood and NYC national broadcasters, as we know it, are dead men walking The handwriting has been on the wall since Max Headroom. “Live updates: Trump says US will ‘run’ Venezuela after Maduro capture” That’s going to be a neat trick. Does he plan on phoning in his orders? Will he send Venezuelan-Americans back in to run the country for him without the need for a messy election? Can’t be done without boots on the ground but is there an appetite to do so? Mark Sleboda on Danny Haiphong yesterday opined to the contrary, that the absence of defensive fire against dozens of helicopters and the orderly handover of Maduro by his guards to the Americans means the military was bought off in advance and in on the plot. He thinks there will be no problem maintaining order in the near term with threats and bribes. Haiphong also said the house of the defense minsiter was hit but he survived becuase he got to his bunker. The US took out a lot of the lights in Caracas before they went in and also hit airbases to take out air defenses. MANPADs require either initial visual targeting (the IR can then take over) or radar, so no lights would impede MANPAD use. More from the Financial Times: Experts in air assault said that the US air armada would have been able to suppress Venezuelan airspace defences using a variety of electronic and kinetic attacks, from spoofing GPS timing and jamming communications to turning off early warning and targeting radar. This meant that the Blackhawk and Chinook helicopters seen flying low over the skyline of Caracas were “in little danger until they reached the fortress”, said Andrew Turner, a former Royal Air Force helicopter pilot. “The ingress and egress from the Iwo Jima to the target would have been the easy part,” said Turner. “The most dangerous time is the 60-90 seconds as you are approaching and are on the target when you don’t have the full picture, bullets are going everywhere and you have yet to secure the area. That is where the danger is.” And Kutilya the Contemplator: It must be noted here that the fact that US helicopters entered Caracas, seized Maduro and exited without any significant resistance does not demonstrate Venezuelan military acquiescence or institutional weakness. It more plausibly reflects temporary denial of response at the apex of command – confusion, withheld authorization, selective stand-downs by a narrow set of gatekeepers or deliberate restraint to avoid catastrophic escalation against overwhelming US force. Modern, politicized militaries do not automatically fire under conditions of uncertainty. They calculate institutional survival. Thus, if inducements or coercion occurred, they needed only to neutralize air-defense commanders and presidential guard leadership, not the entire force. A clean extraction therefore signals elite fracture and risk aversion in the moment, not acceptance of foreign custodianship. Indeed, militaries humiliated without being destroyed often shift toward delayed, asymmetric and deniable resistance, making the absence of immediate kinetic response a warning sign rather than reassurance for Washington. https://chandragupta.substack.com/p/decapitation-without-destruction So this is not proven. People want tidy explanations when a lot is still not very well known. Yes. To be honest, this is what I would have expected from a military without recent combat experience, subject to an attack that was a complete tactical surprise, carefully prepared and with an overwhelming capability advantage. Against a large-scale conventional attack, they would probably have done quite a lot better, because they would have had more time, but you have to anticipate, plan for and train for a limited and targeted attack of this kind, which it’s clear the Venezuelans were not expecting. Any such attack achieves most of its effect from surprise and it seems surprise here was total. That said, it’s not clear to me that the US has gained a great deal except in PR terms. There is no reason to suppose that the new government (same as the old government, effectively) will do what the US wants, nor that the US is prepared to actually try to invade the country. to make it do so. I’ve been reading that Maduro was guarded by Wagner mercenaries, which makes me wonder. This would be a stain on their record if they got rolled with barely landing any punches of their own. I suspect they just provided his personal protection against assassinations, conventional kidnapping attempts etc: things like vehicle escort, manning security barriers, and the like.They would not have been expecting something like this, nor equipped to deal with it. Venezuela was up against the might of the western colonial empire. And in the fine British tradition of never believe anything until it has been officially denied, I would say the UK was definitely involved “British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said his country was not involved in the United States’ strikes on Venezuela” from Al-Jazeera. So this was probably US muscle + UK colonial rule tactics + Israeli electronic warfare. The US attack was not a bolt from the blue. Venezuela had been facing an obvious enemy buildup on their doorstep for many weeks. Everybody knows that “decapitation” is part of US and Israeli doctrine–virtually SOP. In any case, enemy attack on one’s command-and-control is always to be expected in war. Recent examples: Israelis killing Nasrallah. Russian SF tried to nab Zelensky at the beginning of the Ukraine war. Even if we disregard the risk of capture, Maduro should still have already been in a HQ bunker, or making frequent moves, simply because of the risk of an air strike, made by an enemy known to have stealth aircraft and advanced ECM. Now think about just how good the US intelligence had to be, to conduct the kidnap–how accurate, how timely the information they needed. On this basis alone, treachery would be a reasonable hypothesis. From the videos I’ve seen, some helicopters were plainly visible. Fair targets for old fashioned ack-ack, let alone MANPADS. Whatever details emerge, I assume Venezuela will take this as a wake up call, time to diversify small arms storage. The Grayzone podcast yesterday by Max Blumenthal and Anya Parampil was interesting on this issue. Both are very familiar with the Venezuela situation and have relevant contacts there and in DC. While they were careful in their comments, they strongly implied that there had been negotiations behind the scenes in the preceding weeks toward just this outcome. They didn’t say it quite this directly, but my interpretation was that Maduro was given the choice to leave voluntarily and would not, so the “choice” was made for him (actually Parampil did state this as a possible scenario). They did not directly accuse Delcy Rodríguez or others in Maduro’s administration of complicity, but they did point out that for some reason the Trump administration seems willing to deal with them, at least temporarily, and noted Trump’s rather brutal dismissal of Machado in his press conference. And while they kind of danced around this, they did raise questions about the relative ease with which the kidnapping took place. For those interested: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTgkGSeJfhg Fwiw, there is something analogous between MAGAism and Bolivarianismo, in the sense of riling up disaffected masses against established elites. However, I doubt socio-cultural affinity probably doesn’t mean much to Trump (I personally thought Maduro was more a “jobber” than a real believer, which Rodriguez seemed to be–then again, that’d make her more like MTG whom Trumpuro hates…) I suspect that the reason that Trump dissed Machao was because she “took” his Nobel Peace Prize when clearly it should have belonged to him. From A Martyanov: “I know, it is going to be hurtful to many but they don’t call those countries banana republics for nothing, banana republic being a euphemism for corrupt regimes and toy armies. Some news (from there)–the chief of Maduro’s security detail as well as a number of others have been bought by the US. In fact, there was a Russian military group which rushed to Maduro residence but it was held off by the fire of … yep, Maduro security people. By the time Russians dealt with those traitors, Maduro was already gone. The chief of security detail has been caught and was executed already. So, this is update for you.” Polar Scientist was commenting yesterday that there was fire exchange and that US group left under fire. if wagner were anywhere near this fight you know we’d be seeing pix on US .mil social media of some roided-out JSOC beardo showing off his RUS ghanima. they either never existed or weren’t trusted by maduro not to be bought off (never trust a merc with your life) And another question: will the billion dollar a day fleet off the Venezuelan coast now go home? As to the question of whether Trump knows what he is doing we all know the answer. Antiwar site says that 40 people were killed from the raid’s bombing and some American troops may have been injured. MOA says among the bomb targets was Chavez’ mausoleum. Classy. At any rate the attack’s true purpose–throw a small country against the wall to show who’s boss– has likely been accomplished. That this brilliant idea never seems to work will be ignored by Trump as he builds his arch of triumph to himself in DC. No doubt it will include a bas relief of Maduro in handcuffs. I just saw Douglas Macgregor on Judge Napolitano. He thinks not, or at least not all of them. The US has ~15,000 tropps which he thinks will be committed, as Trump indicated (he talked about boots on the ground), presumably to do things like secure key government installations and protect oil assets. They will require logistical support. If Trump tries, those troops will be stretched thin. The accepted ration for an occupation is twenty troops for every 1,000 population. And Venezuela has a population of about 30 million. So will there be a Green Zone in Caracas then? I suspect, admittedly on very limited information, that if President Trump is foolish enough to send in only the 15,000, that they believe their own propaganda and/or that they have a deal with what they believe are the current ruling Venezuela elites. Kidnapping a country’s leader especially without a declaration of war under criminal charges that the attacking country’s leader could be indicted under seems like a good way to guarantee a hot war; there are always some angry men willing to take revenge. Getting troops in isn’t difficult compared to getting them out. Trump says US will ‘ruin’ Venezuela after Maduro capture”.

Interesting bit on Rodriguez from the AP: Strong ties with Wall Street A lawyer educated in Britain and France, Rodríguez has a long history of representing the revolution started by the late Hugo Chávez on the world stage. She and her brother, Jorge Rodríguez, head of the Maduro-controlled National Assembly, have sterling leftist credentials born from tragedy. Their father was a socialist leader who died in police custody in the 1970s, a crime that shook many activists of the era, including a young Maduro. Unlike many in Maduro’s inner circle, the Rodríguez siblings have avoided criminal indictment in the U.S. Delcy Rodríguez developed strong ties with Republicans in the oil industry and on Wall Street who balked at the notion of U.S.-led regime change. Among her past interlocutors were Blackwater founder Erik Prince and, more recently, Richard Grenell, a Trump special envoy who tried to negotiate a deal with Maduro for greater U.S. influence in Venezuela. Fluent in English, Rodríguez is sometimes portrayed as a well-educated, market-friendly moderate in contrast to the military hard-liners who took up arms with Chávez against Venezuela’s democratically elected president in the 1990s. https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-trump-maduro-military-rodriguez-lead-c0bd39f98a79c18c5501bac939c640fe# “Trump admin sends tough private message to oil companies on Venezuela” I can understand the reluctance of the oil companies. Trump is expecting them to invest huge amounts of capital to rebuild Venezuela’s oil infrastructure as well as starting to convert plants in the US to once more handle the heavy crudes that they use to process. And this effort will effort will take many years and is assuming that there is no resistance in Venezuela to them pumping that oil to send to the US while paying Venezuela only a pittance. Say that it will take five years which may prove optimistic. What will this country be like by 2031? Which party will be running the US by then? Why is Trump not offering any guarantees but lumbering all the costs onto them? If I was running an oil company, I would be extremely lurky about getting too much involved and spending too much capital on such a dynamic situation. I certainly be not depending on a Trump promise. What a framing but, I think Trump is offering protection money/troops/mercs to the oil companies and a reimbusement to big oil investments through these government supports. Sort of like the old protection rackets — I am offering protection in exchange for some money…wouldn’t want anything bad to happen..if you know what I mean. the below quote could be used about Gaza and Venezuela “Venezuela would be a crown jewel if the above-ground risk is removed. I have companies saying let’s see where this lands,” said Derentz “above-ground risk is removed” pesky humans That kinda sounds like he wants to establish a “security zone” around those oil fields where there will be no people, towns or villages allowed. Kinda like the Israeli method. No doubt they will get some merc corporations to provide all the security in and around there with drones being used as well. Oil field workers may be forced to live in some sort of policed towns in this security zone and only allowed out on weekend leave or the like. If this is so, then they must be really worried about sabotage there. So would I. Well one thing we know for sure, whatever policy put in place by Trump-as it pertains to Venezuela-will be left as is should a Dem administration take over in 2028. Iraq being the Cheney Oily-Man symposium on , “We used to, and that’s why we don’t any more…” Also, given the global trend favoring renewables over fossil fuels as evidenced by shifting market shares (Our World in Data) favoring the former, this might give oil companies pause when it comes to costly, long term investments, and particularly so if the locals are hostile. ‘Science girl @sciencegirl A Shaolin kung fu master shows how it’s done.’ If it weren’t for the clothes that they were wearing, somebody should have told them to put their rulers away and zip up again.

The photo is interesting and I’m curious what other readers think. Madero is shown with hands cuffed in front giving two thumbs up while surrounded by DEA agents. That is an interesting photo that. Those DEA agents tried to make it a ‘trophy’ shot but Maduro giving both thumbs up spoiled the whole thing for them. Maduro was previously negotiating. Here are some what-ifs. He wanted safe passage to pick-a-country. He got some assurances about personal safety for his family. The next shoe to drop will be revelations about the Venezuelan role in election machines. They do have form. >The United States Captures Nicolás Maduro and his Wife In his appeal, Noriega argued that his arrest violated international law under the head-of-state immunity doctrine. The district court rejected Noriega’s head-of-state immunity claim because the United States government never recognized Noriega as Panama’s legitimate ruler — an argument that will be made in the Maduro prosecution. Can China lawfully detain and try Taiwan’s president under Chinese law just because it doesn’t recognize his legitimacy? Seems to me that the arrest of a Taiwanese president under PRC law could be much easier argued as legal given that Taiwan is not actually officially recognized as an independent nation by the vast majority of the world. Netanyahu is an international criminal guilty of plausible genocide by the ICJ. Were he kidnapped and brought to the Hague, and imprisoned, or kidnapped by another country to stand trial, I doubt the US would tolerate it. As for Noriega, unlike Maduro, Noriega was an unelected dictator. The US charges against Maduro include drug smuggling and dealing in weapons, and if he were a US President doing these things as part of his office (which we know many have done) — if I read the recent SCOTUS decision correctly — he would be immune from prosecution. A US president may be immune from a US prosecution, but he is now subject to jurisdiction from just about anyone in the world under their laws who care not one bit about SCOTUS. Top 5 African countries with the best quality of life index at the start of 2026 Business Insider Africa This made me think of Gaddafi. Maybe this index is how the great USA chooses the African country that needs destruction the most. Unlike Libya, none of the five countries mentioned are particularly resource-rich, and all depend partly on tourism. Libya is a good example of the old rule that you can only bribe the population with resource revenues, up to a certain point, no matter how repressive your security apparatus is. It’s a story that’s played out many times in Africa and the Middle East, and will again, no doubt. I thought that list was kind of odd. I’ve been to West Africa more than a handful of times for both work and visiting friends and Senegal, Ivory Coast and at the limit, Guinea-Bissau, are livable countries with tons of potential. I’ve also been to South Africa plenty – though not in the last 10 years – and while it has higher levels of economic development at the very top, it seemed to me not a place for the kind of people who can’t deal with constant situational awareness. Egypt is the real outlier there. The cities need a heck of a lot of infrastructure care. When I was studying the Maghrebi dialect of Arabic (spoken in Morocco), all my teachers told me the king (the current king’s father) was not well loved. Gaddafi is also a good example of the old rule that you can only remain in power so long as you don’t threaten the economies of larger countries’ economies, imo. See his interest in selling oil for currencies other than US dollars. I don’t think those who rose up against him in 2011 were particularly worried about that. Little brown people who don’t speak English have agency too, you know. In any case Gaddafi was very popular internationally after 2004 as an ally in the War on Terror without the tiresome scruples of western states, and it was only when he was clearly going down that the West piled in, hoping to be on good terms with whoever replaced him. The CIA and M-I6 are very very good at… um… ‘guiding’ the people and events in foreign countries. See: color revolutions. See Hillary “we came, we saw, he died” Clinton. / ;) Pretty sure those “little brown people who don’t speak English” did not, for example, bomb their own county’s irrigation infrastructure all by themselves and very likely did not wish it to happen – https://theecologist.org/2015/may/14/war-crime-nato-deliberately-destroyed-libyas-water-infrastructure It’s funny how self-destructive behavior of little non-white non-English-speaking people perfectly matches neocolonial desires of bigwig white English-speaking gentlemen, not to mention military efforts of NATO countries. The Lord indeed works in mysterious ways. He was by no means “clearly going down” until after the west piled on. – ‘The United States Captures Nicolás Maduro and his Wife’ – Jonathan Turley I commented on this yesterday, but as I re-read this I find I’m much more irritated today. Turley lays out the defense he thinks Maduro will use based on the earlier Manuel Noriega case . He defends the “legality” of the Trump administration’s kidnapping though some dubious Obama whataboutism (which I guess is “precedent” here), and explains why Maduro’s defense will fail as did Noriega’s. As he notes, much of this earlier failure, in a “legal” sense, was simply due to the State’s insistence that Noriega was not a legitimate head of state, just a common drug trafficker. The Court just accepted this bulls**t claim. Turley has the audacity to pretend that the preordained verdict was a matter of law! But then he goes further and says this in his conclusion: “Legally, Trump has the upper hand in this case. Maduro will replay the arguments from the Noriega case. However, he presents an even weaker case on the merits under the controlling precedent than did Noriega.” Noriega was a notorious drug trafficker whose actions were abetted by the US when he was helping us support the Contras against Nicaragua. But he knew where a lot of skeletons were buried (figuratively and literally) and so was legally “disappeared” when he became a little too “independent.” Maduro’s case was *nothing* like this, and whatever corruption took place during his regime (and I’m sure it was there, so there will be “evidence” of some kind), these charges are ridiculously “trumped” up. Everyone knows this. For Turley to pretend that The Law matters at all here simply reinforces the despicable administration framing. A YouTuber (Judge Nap?) said the case was filed under Trump 1.0 but not pursued under Biden because they could not prove it. Turley ignores the factual allegations, that it depicts Maduro as the head of some named cartel (forgive me for not searching for it) which Larry Johnson has repeatedly dismissed as a fabrication. Turley, the very self righteous law “absolutist,” has a flexible view when the law is bent by Republicans. He seemed refreshing when we were suffering under Biden and the opposite now that the supposedly victimized conservatives are back in charge. Meanwhile Simplicus suggests that the entire operation was theater in which Maduro cooperated since a deal has been worked out for him and his family to take a plea or be let go–another way of making him disappear. This is mere speculation of course. So how long until we just dismiss Turley as a right-wing shill? wasn’t that about twenty years ago? If so, and regardless, a lot of people, “little people” for sure, were killed and injured in the process. The operation is despicable. Nothing more to add.

The strong will do as they will and the weak suffer what they must.* Overthrow the strong. *solidarity Instead: How do the many bring the clever onto their side? And then overthrow Capital Given the present trajectory, I expect Capital to “overthrow” itself. By focusing narrowly and almost exclusively on its own ‘private’ profit, Capital starves the public sector of resources with which to run, let alone expand social services. This directly effects the ability of “society” in general to support the Capitalist class in its endeavours. Late stage Capitalism can be best described as a Doom Loop in progress. What many “True Believers” forget is that Capitalism is a Teran human construct. It is not a “Natural Law,” or an aspect of physics. Terran humans being fallible beings, then so too are their creations. Capitalism may not think about the Jackpot, but the Jackpot thinks about Capitalism. I wonder who will be the Maduros’ lawyers. I would suggest the same team that represents Luigi Mangione. Turley disingenuously ignores the blatant illegality of the Maduro ‘arrest’ under international law. There is a critical distinction between “prescriptive”jurisdiction, under which a state may criminalize conduct outside its borders which has domestic effects, and “enforcement” jurisdiction, which forbids a state from exercising law enforcement actions (such as arrests) in the territory of another country without that country’s consent. That is the whole point of having extradition treaties. See Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States § 432(2) (sorry can’t link due to paywall); Ghappour, “Searching Places Unknown,” 69 Stanford Law Review 1075, 1100 (2017). 1. International law is irrelevant in US courts 2. Lawyers can correct me, but I also believe illegal arrests are not a defense to prosecution in the US either. If cops or prosecutors get information impermissibly (search w/o a warrant or consent, for instance), that information cannot be used in a prosecution. But my having watched too many vids by civil rights attorneys says you need to be found innocent of the criminal charges, and only then can you file a civil rights claim over the illegal arrest. With all due respect, I am a lawyer and a retired federal judge. Your statement that international law is irrelevant in federal courts is way too glib. True, the issue is complicated and has been the subject of intense debate since the 1990s, but there is little doubt that for most of our history the “Law of Nations” was regarded as part of the Supreme Law of the Land. https://tlblog.org/international-law-in-american-courts/ I offer no prediction on whether the illegality of the arrest will prove to be a get out of jail card for Maduro in this particular instance. I do know it is possible to challenge an illegal extradition by filing a federal habeas corpus petition. I handled several such cases when I was on the bench. secular americans, especially those in the industry, cling so tightly to “legality” as though there is some divine arbiter to whom the wronged could appeal. obviously this whole thing is an illegal farce, and equally obviously team snatch&grab doesn’t give a damn. if (mirabile dictu) he’s found innocent, will he be repatriated and reinstated? c’mon. several decades of abusing and neglecting the rule of law (under both parties) have rendered it a crumbling edifice at best and a transparent joke at worst.

For many years now a lot of States require people that are employed by them to sign contracts which include the proviso that they are not allowed to do stuff like boycott Israel. I personally would say that this was in direct contravention of the US First Amendment but State and Federal governments – of both parties – were cool with it so what do I know. Thing is, with the Trump regime in charge right now, Trump might decide that this is a fine idea that would please his buddy Bibi and start doing it. I’ve always thought those laws and contracts are unenforceable. If you don’t broadcast your reasons, who’s going to know that you’re not buying Israeli goods? It’s like the claim from fundies that students aren’t allowed to pray in school. Didn’t The Teacher say you’re not supposed to pray in public like the hypocrites?

Re cars as spybots–lest readers get too panicky about this I believe even Teslas require owner consent (perhaps it’s an opt out) for the car to continuously phone home to mother via cell towers. On ICE cars like mine you have to subscribe to an Onstar like service that is supposed to automatically call for help in case of as accident or emergency. The linked article says that cell supplied navigation services–on that dash screen– also give the car company continuous access to the computer inside your car. However the car is still recording data even if offline so if you take it to the dealer for service (or if right to repair advocates have their way any repair shop) then the record of your travels can be recovered. So I use my own GPS navigator (not smartphone based), don’t subscribe to the manufacturer’s services and have yet to take it to the dealer since I change my own oil. Some among the paranoid even disable the “head unit”–that center dash box that contains the various radios–to make sure the car isn’t talking to the spooks but that’s probably going too far. Simply refusing to cooperate in your own privacy invasion is probably enough. Happy to be informed otherwise by those more in the know. you have to subscribe to an Onstar like service that is supposed to automatically call I don’t think that’s as strong an argument as you think it is. If you can subscribe, that means the capability to do whatever is still there in the background. The subscription only means you’re paying for them to provide a service. If you were to subscribe, chances are almost certain that you wouldn’t have to take it in to the dealer to ‘turn it on’…. that would cost too much for them and be a very big negative effect on conversion rates. The car is talking to home, just not telling you. Back in the summer of ‘21 I was advised by my Sudbury dealer that my brand new Impreza would constantly be collecting driving data. He told me that this data would be used in a court of law were it necessary.

You do refer to him as Donnie, not respectful. No, not respectful and here’s why. The snatch was neat and clean. Maybe the fix was in, but it plays well. What’s next? A plan or play it by ear? Based on past events my guess is play it by ear. Won’t cost us, he said. The oil will pay for it, he said. Wasn’t the oil going to pay for the Iraq invasion? Seems Venezuela is supposed to roll,over and submit. If not. what is your plan? Who protects the oil companies rebuilding the oil infrastructure? US troops? Mercenaries … those guys are expensive. You snatched Maduro. Two can play that game. Yeah, I know. The US is the big dog this close to home, but it is a “nice mess” until proven otherwise and I have no faith in that. https://x.com/RepMTG/status/2007485346913607836 💯👍 Thanks. Every usian should read this. She is still placing the blame on the other. Conservatives just are not capable of anything else. F#$% her. Sure, but presently she’s a critical part of the architecture attempting to split “America Firsters” from Trump’s support base, and push back on our “ironclad” support for ISR. Gut feeling is the, nonZio faction will be liquidated and with relative ease. I mean they are mocked online, but who is still in charge. Disagree with the easy part. Time will tell, one way or the other. I don’t think genZ is buying what bibi is selling. File under wild speculation…. / ;) Both Isr and Kingdom Saudi Arabia (KSA) share several interests. Both want the Yemeni military threats to their govts eliminated. Both want the Yemeni threat to the Gulf of Aden passage past the Horn of Africa* eliminated. (See the courting of Somalia Land by Isr.) Both have common enemies in Yemen, Iraq, and Iran. Both are currently interested in keeping the majority of the world’s oil reserves under the current arrangement of financial control of the US/West. Which brings me to Venezuela. Much has been made about Isr’s possible interest in the attack. Nothing has been said about KSA’s possible interest in seeing an oil competitor brought under control by the US. And… going way out here… nothing has been said about the T family’s immense financial dealings with KSA. Think of Jared Kushner managing the KSA sovereign wealth fund in the US. * map: http://www.geographicguide.net/africa/images/horn-africa.jpg / end wild speculations. / ;) Venezuela’s crude is a very different type of oil–heavy–and so not directly competitive with that from KSA. thanks. That’s motive, not innocence. To run a refinery requires a mix of crude. If you only have light crude like the Gulf, you cannot make heavier crack products…. I won’t even presume to know exactly what’s going on in Venezuela, especially with so much noise in the ether. Apparently half of the attacks people initially reported (like on the tomb of Chavez) weren’t even real? But I think there’s one crucial question that I haven’t seen much reporting on: is the government mobilizing the popular militias or not? Besides Yves’ one report yesterday and an article on Telesur (but not at the top), I haven’t heard much either way. If there is a popular mobilization though and if Venezuela is analogous to the revolutionary trajectory of Iran, China, or Russia, then it’s possible Trump just unintentionally gave PSUV the opening to start a Cultural Revolution (which wouldn’t contradict a backroom deal to “purge” Maduro by American black helicopters). Like I’ve said before, I don’t claim to know Venezuela or South America as well as other countries, so I mainly fall back onto comparative methods. And I recognize it might not be any more precise or scientific than astrology. The collapse of Assad in Syria surprised me though partly because I didn’t take that approach so I’m just putting it out there. This former CIA says Venezuela is nothing like Cuba the revolutionary fervor is just not there. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=helSwCCGwvQ CIA Analyst EXPOSES Plan A & B for Venezuela | Ron Aledo Neutrality Studies I’ll have to watch the video later, but again, another reason I bring up the comparative method is it challenges what may seem like the most natural model at first. For example, if there’s any validity to what I’m suggesting, the analogy isn’t Venezuela ~ Cuba, but more like Venezuela ~ China while Cuba ~ North Korea. Cuba has become a uniquely hardened society with an idiosyncratic system, even if it’s clearly an ally and the ideology is superficially like Venezuela’s. Venezuela OTOH has become more of a dynamic project, where factions are going to act out different trends over time. Again, it could all be woo-woo and pareidolia, but if there’s something to it and the initial analogy is sound, the clock would be somewhere around the Cultural Revolution in the Chinese context. Also the era of Basiji reactivation in Iran and Stalinist purges in the USSR. The main uncertainty is at what point do you start the clock from: Chavez’ first election, the 2009 referendum, or something else? Because that could mean it’s either at the beginning or the end; whether the popular militias stand down or rise up over the coming weeks and months sort of answers that. Either way, I could be wrong, but I currently don’t believe this represents a successful soft coup by the US. For one, all analysis and reporting from that angle starts from either taking everything Trump says as true or a sort of depressed “resistance is futile” worldview (which I’ve said before is just really a more resentful form of TINA). And if the analogy holds, even if some high-ranking officials or generals were bought, those are usually some of the very people that get purged in periods like this. Keep in mind that the Venezuelan people have been in a hyperinflationary economy for 42 years since Black Friday* in 1983, with the current rate of exchange something like 30,000 Bolivars to the buck. This is the same situation that we fell into with Ecuador when their economy was hyperinflating around the turn of the century and we jumped in and dollarized the place, along with all of its oil reserves. To put things in mad perspective, a 1964 or earlier silver Quarter has around $13 worth of silver in content at current rates, a similar coin, a 1965 Venezuela silver Bolivar is worth around 400,000,000 Bolivars after you go through all of the new and improved Bolivars that weren’t all that. That would be the easiest sell to the Venezuelan people, financial stability vis a vis a greenback economy. * my brother in law’s sister was an elementary school teacher in Atlanta in the late 1970’s and Venezuela offered her double what she was making in the states, and then Black Friday comes along and within a month she’s making 1/4 of what she could make in the states-exit stage north. I was there briefly before Chavez came to power 92-93. The poverty was gross to say the least. Literally people without lower limbs leading protests. If they start to revert to that i would assume that they will swing back more in the Bolivarian direction, but that will take time. Apparently half of the attacks people initially reported (like on the tomb of Chavez) weren’t even real? It’s the same playbook we saw with the Israeli surprise attack on Iran, just straight up BS being spewed out by the Western media mouthpieces to sow confusion. It might even literally be the same people doing the co-ordinating, or however these “reporter” scum get their blob marching orders. The Israelification of America in real time. Some of the headlines I was reading yesterday were just straight unfiltered bullshit: Venezuela vice president Rodriguez in Russia, four sources say Thanks, Reuters! Really keeping their audience informed aren’t they? FOUR whole sources supposedly too. And then via Reuters you get the same crap spewed everywhere else, eg: Venezuelan Vice President May Be in Russia: Report Western English media reporting at this point is a sewer wherever one cares to look, eg: US and Israel ‘planted’ media leaks alleging tensions before Iran attack: Report re: ‘Remove the top’: Grok AI floods with sexualized images of women – The American Bazaar One little understood or appreciated reason for the incredible increases in computer video cards improvements in refresh speed, color rendering, animation, detail, etc was/is the demand from the online pron industry. (It wasn’t driven by online gaming nearly as much as by online pron back then.) People interested in that wanted better video cards for their home computers than one needed to display simple data charts, graphs, maps, home digital pictures, or playing Super Mario Brothers, etc. The money pouring into accelerating video development for the home computer came in large measure from the ‘naughty’ market user demands back in the day. I’m not at all surprised by this Grok AI story. / ;) Shorter: some people were willing to pay much higher prices for an improved video card to get the video quality they wanted. Those much higher prices paid for better cards drove development faster than it might otherwise have developed. I remember reading years ago that the initial “profit driver” for new communications technologies is usually “representations of people making the beast with two backs.” This applies to print, photography, electronic audio and video, film, etc. etc. Remember ‘bootleg’ vinyl records of “blue joke” comics? I had a Moms Mably record once until my Mom found it. Photo cards of “poses plastiques?” ‘Girly’ magazines would come in plain brown paper wrappers, etc. etc. The infamous remark that no one ever went bankrupt underestimating the intelligence of the public also applies to morals. The underlying evil of Po—graphy is that it directly enables the sexual exploitation of the weak and the desperate. Stay safe. A little more by writer who lives there. https://www.counterpunch.org/2026/01/03/report-from-caracas-the-us-kidnaps-president-nicolas-maduro-but-venezuela-fights-back-and-maintains-its-revolution/ This from smoothie story. In fact, there was a Russian military group which rushed to Maduro residence but it was held off by the fire of … yep, Maduro security people. By the time Russians dealt with those traitors, Maduro was already gone. The chief of security detail has been caught and was executed already. So, this is update for you. No Making Shit Up. The Counterpoint piece does not say that and you have no source for your last para. Martyanov just dropped his talk with Garland. I have yet to check. But usually Martyanov is not making up things like this one. It´s obviously an issue: How come this all happen with RU arms and above all personnel on the ground? The above Martyanov quote is on his page fwiw https://smoothiex12.blogspot.com/2026/01/reaupload-with-new.html For what it’s worth, Venezuelanalysis confirms from their sources that 15 members of Maduro’s security detachment died (“were assassinated”) during the invasion. The source, I believe, is Andrey Martyanov’s blog (smoothiex12.blogspot.com) – word for word. As Martyanov is both quite well connected and prone to some “patriotic over-excitement” more than a grain of salt is warranted and yet it may be true-ish… Beyond that quote Martyanov´s usual chauvinism – (thanks to Yves for bringing back into discussion that word which as of late has completely vanished from the spaces that I read mostly pushed away by that awful “toxic” term) – in lieu of genuine insight on Venezuela and South America is of rather little help. So as of now it seems Russian unit when rushing to protect Maduro ran into none other than Maduro´s own guards. There apparently was a stand-off. And when Russians had “finished off ” those they came in too late. Also S-300/400 apparently were turned off. (how that worked with RUs possibly in charge? I don´t know. That´d possibly be the scene in a movie…) To equal the Venezuelan blunder with Syria or Iraq is superficial and uninformed in a way he is informed about his very own field of expertise where he is – overaly “exact” – which I cherish because he is professional. But since to his own regret he is not only commenting on military affairs re: Russia but also geopolitics he might wanna step back from some comments. Since even geopolitics is no science there you do need knowledge. It´s not as if he didn´t point out his shortcomings stating several times, he is no specialist on South America at all – but then his boastful verbage is thwarting the admission the next moment. The fact that 3rd World countries are “structurally weak” is not due to their cultural peculiarities. Which is why comparing the surrender of the Iraqi Army with a Mossadegh or Venezuela now is totally out of place. Garland actually has the more interesting quips. Both agree that Venezuela as a new target is basically admitting defeat and signals eventual retreat of the US from Ukraine. Martyanov is also hinting at setting a precedent now might well again come back the way Serbia 1999 and Kosovo 2008 boomeranged in form of Crimea 2014 and SMO now. Despite the flaws I addressed worth the 45 minutes: https://smoothiex12.blogspot.com/2026/01/garland-and-me.html Martyanov´s latest own podcast I have not yet watched: https://smoothiex12.blogspot.com/2026/01/reaupload-with-new.html p.s. Again I feel reminded by all this of Conrad´s undervalued adventure novel “NOSTROMO”. Garland brings up a funny idea but the truth behind it is essential: If Trump were to seize control over Greenland would the Europeans oppose? Of course not. Because they´re powerless. On this note one could argue, Europe is lucky not to be very rich of natural resources the US really needs. Otherwise the insane things happening here would provide material for the next decade of Hollywood flicks and high-octane action-thriller streaming content. Like French and German troops fighting US forces. I would be more concerned about the Greenlanders and Denmark recognising a double coincidence of interests with Russia and China. Re: p. s. A British TV film based on the novel is on Youtube in two parts. Excellent cast too. Youtube link to first part: https://youtu.be/EIM9vo73jjI HAHAHAHAHAHA!!! excellent thank you. This is like “I told you so” from Conrad looking down onto us right now. The intro could be used as a commentary from the editorial pages of a daily this very week. It´s time to adapt the novel again. https://smoothiex12.blogspot.com/2026/01/reaupload-with-new.html Here Santa Clara/San Jose has an interesting heritage. It was the center for the “Copperheads” or Confederate sympathizers during the American Civil War, a stronghold of the Klan in the 20’s and 30’s (Along with Contra Costa County) and during the 60’s the militant wing of the John Birch society ,the “Minutemen” had their California headquarters there. Peter Thiel and the Tech Bros fit right in Anti-Aging Injection Regrows Knee Cartilage and Prevents Arthritis SciTech Daily ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Sounds great, where do I sign up to be a crash test dummy? Put in a whole 7 miles on the trails in Mineral King this summer thanks to my ailing knee, normally it’d be around 150 miles. Skied once this year and it didn’t feel too bad, as you aren’t really moving your legs all that much when skiing down a mountain, its more hip swiveling than anything else, and relying on gravity. Remember Jet Stix? I had a pair. Never had those, but I had Burt bindings for a brief time~ https://unofficialnetworks.com/2024/04/30/most-dangerous-ski-binding-ever-produced/ I’m glad I never had those, lol. We had those leather safety straps at first, the ones that were hard to work with cold fingers. I’m curious how the trial goes. In the assault with a deadly sandwich case and the Comey and Letitia James cases the Trump DOJ has hardly covered itself in glory. One big difference between Maduro and Noriega is that the latter was actually running drugs, even if for the CIA, I have yet to see any compelling evidence that Maduro was doing the same. My understanding is that while no friends of Maduro the Biden DOJ thought the indictment against him put out by the first Trump admin was very weak tea and were not interested in pursuing it. What happens if a jury finds Maduro and his wife not guilty? The Trump admin certainly has shown a penchant for going ready, fire, aim on policy. >The 2025 Housing Affordability Crisis in Charts: What Changed and What Didn’t Investopedia From the article: “Gen Zers and young families will feel the pinch of still-high costs, with many of them opting for nontraditional living situations to afford housing…” I vote for “nontraditional living situations” as The Euphemism of 2026. What an anodyne way to describe four people in a one-bedroom apartment, 30-year-olds in their parents’ basement, life in a camper van or RV or a tent in a park, a habitation under a bridge. Almost makes them sound desirable, an alternative to normal living: ‘Will that be traditional or non-traditional, sir?” “I’ll take the non-traditional. I’m a bohemian poet. Give me the garret on the sixth-floor.” I think most Gen Zers would describe their housing situation in words other than “nontraditional”. Like hopeless, depressing, humiliating. But this does not detract from the clever wording of the article which obscures the fact that most young people today, to put it in the plain words not used by the article, cannot find a decent place to live at a decent price. For my 20 year old nephews in San Diego, its an impossible dream acquiring an American Dream now at a million bucks. It would have been $100k when I was their age… Their only hope is via inheritance~ I just ran across a link at NDTV[? do not know of their reliability]: NASA’s Largest Library To Permanently Close On Jan 2, Books Will Be ‘Tossed Away’ https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/nasas-largest-library-to-permanently-close-on-jan-2-books-will-be-tossed-away-10170584 “NASA’s largest library at the Goddard Space Flight Center will close permanently on Jan 2 under the Trump administration’s reorganisation plans.” This is appalling if true. I saw similar library closings and dumpsters full of bound journals and techical books when Bell Labs shut down their Whippany library. I did not see it but heard a similar closure and discarding of books and journals occurred when the Holmdel library was closed. Many of the books dated from the 1960s and almost all were nearly irreplaceable to say nothing of what they could cost. The Bell Labs Whippany library closure took place in the early 1990s and though there were many advances since the 1960s those 1990s advances built upon knowledge from before often best described and explained in the books from the 1960s, 1970s, and some books from the 1980s. Trump’s America is well on its way toward reviving a new know-nothing party to serve a country of know-nothings. It just hurts my heart to see what is happening to our country. I can’t understand how anyone would cheer for this. The people enabling this are basically stupid “smart” people. It is time for an American Cultural Revolution. (The damage is already being done to “ordinary” people. Now the task is to ‘share’ the pain with the so called “Upper Crust.”) That’s gunna put a big spanner into space research by people. Their suggestion is to look on the net or or use the inter-library loan service from other federal agencies – who will unlikely have such specialized books. Maybe they should ask Musk if he wants the books from that library as his people would be able to use them. but NASA is being gutted. Thanks for this. Link to NYT article of same Goddard closure: https://archive.ph/uBZ8g Hard agree with @ambrit ITT. Way overdue. Mighty big of Elon, he’s offering free Starlink to all Venezuelans until February 3rd. Another true son of the Empire doing his part. Ha. OpenAI was offering double usage credits for their Codex coding LLM for like 3 days as a new year’s gift or something ridiculous, lol. Interesting. True. No mention of COVID, though, and the nearly 1.3 million deaths directly attributed to it, and those indirectly, like my father’s, must be causing a great deal of grief as well. If only society acknowledges it, might we be able to contend with the cause of it. We Are All in a Constant State of Grief (NY Times op ed) I often start and end my day in my mother’s garden. She died almost three years ago, of stomach cancer. The garden was sacred to her. While she was alive, I saw it as just a place to read on a lounge chair or duck out to for a smoke when I came back home to visit. Since her death, I’ve found myself drawn there. I feel closer to her when I am in the garden. I cannot claim to know the names of all the plants, shrubs and bushes, but I do my best to take care of them. It feels like taking care of her, as I had tried to do, right up to her last breath. I first noticed the preponderance of lawyer billboards in Phoenix about a dozen years ago on the freeways in town, and Las Vegas had even more of them, but you didn’t see so many in California compared to those locales, but that was then and this is now, and on my drive down to San Diego they carpet bombed billboards with their pleas for fees. What does this say about us as a society, where slimy lawyers (and casinos-the other player) are held to a higher standard of about 25 feet up? why post that AI image of a pandas? Interesting information on Danny Haiphong’s YT channel w/ Diego Sequera live from Venezuela. A fairly concise unpacking with invested corporate interests and their political operatives over some decades. Highlights include McKinsey & Company, Hedge funds/asset mgmt, Marco Rubio [his long term agenda] his affiliation with María Corina Machado, AI techbro barons with a hint of Israel, and how some AI ex Executives are now full birds in the U.S. Military …. Topping it all of is a planned trip by a large group of investor types to Venezuela. Seeing how they can help with energy and infrastructure whilst spreading freedom and democracy to its peoples …. /s Rubio said it out loud … This is the Westren Hemisphere and WE don’t need nations that are not pro American by having/sharing trade et al with nations like China/Russia. As I noted yesterday in links Venezuela has a more conservative society than America, more family formation/value orientated. Good to see the currant batch of political operatives in DC being anti family – unless your wealthy and can donate. From another episode of America is trash, at an employer I know. For all those on the High Deductible plans, remember to always check your drug prices with GoodRX (or drug discount site of choice) and ask the pharmacy if they have any additional discounts. This 2 minute search each time can save you a significant amount of money at the register. Here is an example this morning for my daughter’s medications: * Her medication started at $316 for 30 days based on the Cigna Insurance deductible negotiated price. * Pulled up GoodRX while in line and without membership, it was $67 for 30 days. Showed this to the person at the checkout. They directed me to the consultation window. * At the consultation window, I showed them the GoodRX discount. They did a search and found that that medication has a CVS coupon for $51 for 30 days. * The pharmacist added the coupon to my daughter’s account and it will now apply for all future orders! Savings of $265 by doing a little research, asking questions, and waiting about 15 mins for them to reprocess the RX! Three things to note: 1. This discount dance has to be done for every prescription and for every dependent on your plan. 2. If there is no generic, there is typically a coupon at the manufacturers website. Do this in advance, as it sometimes requires doing a bit more information sharing and back and forth to get the discount codes. 3. This may effect the deductible amount depending on how it is processed and where you live. Fun times, yes? And we’ve learned from Pro Publica recently that our generic supply is potentially questionable, but the FDA doesn’t want to expose that, so we’re left in the dark about particular plants and particular drug manufacturing runs. I am so tired of having to play these games as my minimal prescriptions continue to rise in price regardless. fyi: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gusano Re: Venezeula Interesting statements from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and PM Takaichi: https://x.com/NaokoScalise/status/2007794084212302157 MOFA says (as expected): Japan has consistently respected fundamental values such as freedom and democracy. We have also consistently emphasized respect for the principles of international law within the international community. Moving forward, based on this consistent stance, we will continue to work closely with relevant countries, including the G7 and regional nations, to ensure the utmost protection for Japanese nationals. We will also advance diplomatic efforts aimed at restoring democracy and stabilizing the situation in Venezuela. Takaichi repeats the same talking points, but omitting mention of international law and the international community. Commentary: The heads of both the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court are Japanese. Wow, they’re erasing “international law” now. re: Craig Murray on Venezuela Craig Murray weighs in. He planned on going to Venezuela. This is not entirely off the table still. Important piece, although for those who followed events the last 25 years not new. https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2026/01/venezuela-and-truth/ “(…) By pure chance, on Friday I had texted Delcy Rodríguez about arrangements for travel and accreditation so I could go and report from Venezuela and bring you more of the truth from that country that the media is hiding from you. I made plain I was not asking for financial support. Things are obviously fluid at the moment, but it is still my intention to get there. (…)” Any comparison with other countries like Iran or Syria seems to make little sense. All these societies are unique. But much more important – Venezuela is a functioning and free country and society. And one needs to keep in mind the huge success Venezuela represents. As more than one commenter here has said: Once the “civilized nations” partook in or condoned the genocide in Gaza, everything became do-able. We are through the looking glass now. RIP “rules-based order” era. Hello, IRL Risk era. Guardian Live Blog: More on Donald Trump’s comments to reporters aboard Air Force One: the president said elections in Venezuela would have to wait. “We’re going to run it, fix it, we’ll have elections at the right time, but the main thing you have to fix is it’s a broken country,” he said. Trump had harsh words for other US adversaries, saying Colombia’s leader was “not going to be doing it very long”, Communist-ruled Cuba was “ready to fall” and that Iran’s leadership would be “hit hard” if protesters were killed, AFP reports. Trump earlier threatened that acting Venezuelan president Delcy Rodriguez would pay a “big price” if she did not cooperate with the US.

Title: Inside Saks Fifth Avenue's fight for its life: How a tumultuous 12 months left the retailer on the brink of bankruptcy

From the outside, Saks Fifth Avenue — the century-old department store in Manhattan — is literally glowing, its façade decorated with thousands of glittering lights as part of its annual holiday display. The shine, however, masks a retailer under pressure. On Friday, Saks named a new CEO, capping a tumultuous 12 months for the heavily leveraged department store owner. After months of restructurings, lawsuits, missed payments, and broken promises, Saks Global is now facing the possibility of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy. What happens next could have consequences for customers. Brands — some of which haven't been paid in full for over a year — have paused shipments to Saks' stores, and creditors are awaiting news of its financial future. In early December, Hilldun Corp., which acts as a sort of guarantor or insurer for brands, said it would no longer back shipments to Saks. The firm represents about 140 brands that sell to Saks — in the past, it's worked with big names like Tommy Hilfiger, Marc Jacobs, and A.L.C. — and supplies the retailer with at least $500 million worth of product annually. Hilldun's delay was expected to be short-lived, but shipments were still on hold as 2025 came to a close amid growing reports that Saks Global, which also owns Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman Marcus, was considering a court-supervised reorganization.

"They must do something very quickly to rectify this situation in the market, or they will not have a spring season," Gary Wassner, Hilldun's CEO, told Business Insider. "Every order is on hold until Saks clarifies to the industry what they intend to do." Saks itself hasn't negated the bankruptcy talk. "Together with our key financial stakeholders, we are exploring all potential paths to secure a strong and stable future," a spokesperson for Saks Global told Business Insider. "Importantly, opportunities in the luxury market remain strong, and Saks Global continues to play a distinct and enduring role within it." To succeed, Saks' stores must not only resolve their debt issues, but continue to offer the assortment of luxury clothing, shoes, handbags, and beauty products that have long made its stores shopping paradises. As things stand today, that's at risk, Mark Cohen, the former CEO of Sears Canada, told Business Insider. "They aren't going to have goods on the shelf, certainly not new goods. This is a house of cards — from a financial point of view, from a merchandising point of view, from a customer profile point of view." Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today. Sign up for the newsletter. 2025 was supposed to be a great year for Saks. For more than a decade, the retailer, with its large physical footprint, had struggled to maintain its dominance as shopping patterns shifted, with customers turning to e-commerce or brand-owned outlets. It wasn't alone: Nordstrom was treading water before it was taken private, and Macy's has endured a drawn-out turnaround plan. Its problems intensified following the pandemic, when inflation and economic uncertainty curbed discretionary spending. By 2023, it began to face challenges in paying vendors. Then, at the end of 2024, Saks finalized its $2.7 billion acquisition of Neiman Marcus Group, forming a luxury behemoth backed by the technology of Salesforce and Amazon, which took stakes in the new company as part of the deal. The move was seen as a solution to the beleaguered retailer's problems. "It was touch-and-go up until the Neiman Marcus deal occurred," Wassner said. "Everyone thought that would solve the cash flow problems." But the execution was messy. The deal was financed by $2.2 billion worth of junk bonds — debt that carries high interest rates — which S&P Global called "unsustainable." It left the company strapped for cash, leading to a round of layoffs to start the year (multiple more would follow). One of the first red flags for Saks arose on Valentine's Day, when vendors, who Wassner estimates are owed hundreds of millions, received an I-love-you-not from then-Saks Global CEO Marc Metrick. He told them that they'd have to wait. Saks would pay its overdue bills — in some cases, more than a year past due — in installments stretched over 12 months that wouldn't begin until summer. Vendors, some of whom were burned by similar communications prior to the 2019 bankruptcy of the iconic department store Barney's, were left between a rock and a hard place. One vendor, who said he is owed six figures, called the situation "agony." "We thought it was going to be a smoother transition and that this was going to be a global luxury masterpiece in the making," the person said. "That just did not happen." Brands could withhold inventory shipments — which would risk ruining relationships with a core customer and put more strain on Saks' balance sheet — or continue business as usual and hope for the best. Those who chose the latter were further disappointed in July, when the payment schedule wasn't met. That month, Saks' financial vulnerability was made clear when a nine-figure interest payment prompted a debt restructuring. A majority of bondholders agreed to provide cash in return for being moved up on the retailer's cap table. Basically, meaning that if (or when) Saks files for bankruptcy, those bondholders get first dibs — likely before any vendors. "I will say the biggest part of it has been the mental cruelty of this situation, waking up, not knowing what's going to happen, trying to keep things going," the vendor who spoke to Business Insider said. In the fall, things had dissolved to the point that several labels were withholding inventory. S&P analysts wrote that Saks had a "less-than-adequate in-stock inventory position." In October, the company lowered its earnings guidance for the year, blaming inventory challenges. "You are going to ship to somebody you know you're going to get paid from," Tim Hynes, the global head of credit research at Debtwire, told Business Insider. "You will give Saks what's left, you're not going to give them the best." Some brands went even further, taking direct aim at Saks. Skincare brand Sunday Riley said it threatened to sue if payments were not made, Retail Dive reported in August. In October, Jovani Fashion, the dressmaker made famous by "Real Housewives of New York" star Luann de Lesseps, filed a lawsuit against Saks Global — a rare step in a relationship-driven industry. Jovani said Saks owed $295,651 for merchandise it accepted this year. (Saks has denied wrongdoing.) By the end of the year, murmurs of a potential bankruptcy filing made headlines. They intensified on the last day of the year, when The Wall Street Journal reported that Saks had missed a nine-figure interest payment, according to people familiar with it. "It's time to solve the problems one way or another," Wassner said. Bankruptcy isn't the only option. The company has billions of dollars in real estate that it can sell — it recently sold the land beneath its Beverly Hills location — and can close down unproductive stores, as it did with several Saks Off 5th locations and has floated doing with the Neiman Marcus in Dallas. The retailer's store names still hold cultural cache, and deep-pocketed investors could step in to enhance the shopping experience. Cohen, the former Sears exec, doesn't expect Saks to close Bergdorf's or that famous Fifth Avenue location anytime soon, but there's still a long road ahead. "They're not getting merchandise freely. They've had enormous upheaval in management. The luxury business, generally speaking, is not robust at the moment, and we're going into a year, 2026, which has all the makings of an honest-to- god recession," he said. "Is there sunshine here? I don't think so." Kaja Whitehouse contributed reporting to this article. Jump to

Title: Big Tech turned me down. At Walmart, I found a career opportunity, work-life balance, and good food.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kanish Shah, a 26-year-old software engineer at Walmart who lives in Milpitas, California. Business Insider has verified his employment with documentation. His words have been edited for length and clarity. I moved to the US from India in August 2021 to pursue a master's degree in computer science at the University of Southern California. Soon after, I began looking for a summer internship — but things didn't go as planned. Like many aspiring software engineers, I was excited about the idea of working at a Big Tech company like Google, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, or Netflix. I targeted those tech giants during my internship search, but the competition was intense. I ended up being rejected by all of them, which was disappointing. It wasn't just the tech giants that turned me down. I ended up applying to hundreds of internships and received fewer than 15 callbacks — one of which turned into a role at Walmart. I learned that Big Tech isn't the only route to take for a successful tech career. While I struggled to gain traction with tech giants, I eventually secured interviews with several startups and midsize companies. One of the internships I applied to early on — without a referral — was a software engineering role at Walmart. A couple of months later, around October 2021, a recruiter reached out about an online assessment followed by two technical interviews. I received an offer soon after the interviews and started the internship in May. I treated the internship like an extended interview — I asked for weekly feedback, stayed vocal during meetings, and found a mentor. I believe that approach helped me secure a full-time software engineering role with Walmart, which I started in June 2023. Business Insider has heard from hundreds of job seekers over the past year.

Read more on the topic: When I joined Walmart full-time, the company was in the midst of a major transformation — evolving from a traditional retail giant into a tech-driven, AI-powered organization. It felt like an opportunity to contribute to meaningful technological change while accelerating my own learning. That was a significant reason I decided to stay after my internship. I'm very happy with my decision. In addition to growing as a software engineer, I've found that the work culture and work-life balance at Walmart are really great. My hours can vary, but I generally work from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and have time to spend with family and friends on the weekends. I live in Milpitas, California, about a 25-minute commute from Walmart's Sunnyvale office. I'm required to go in two days a week, though in-office expectations vary across teams. The office itself is great. It has a lot of amenities, including boxing and pilates classes, a basketball court, a large gym, and good food. Walmart offers a wide range of cuisine options in its cafeteria. For lunch, I usually opt for the "make your own salad bowl," but there are also options featuring Asian, Indian, Italian, and Mexican dishes. The food isn't free, but it's subsidized, so it's not costly — and drinks like fountain beverages, tea, and coffee are complimentary. At a traditional Big Tech company, you may find early exposure to systems operating at a massive global scale — along with access to specialized internal tooling, research teams, and long-established engineering playbooks. There's also the brand recognition, which could make future job mobility feel more straightforward. That said, those differences haven't felt like gaps for me. I haven't felt that I'm missing out on meaningful learning or career development where I am. For me, the quality of work, mentorship, and ownership has mattered more than the logo. My advice to other young tech professionals is this: aiming for Big Tech is completely valid — those roles can be great aspirations. However, not landing one of these roles shouldn't be too discouraging. High-impact work can be found in many environments, including startups and emerging tech companies. I also believe that strong compensation is possible outside traditional Big Tech — my compensation is in the six figures. From a job security perspective, I believe the entire tech industry has undergone a period of recalibration over the past couple of years. Layoffs have affected companies of all sizes — including Big Tech, midsize firms, and even large enterprises like Walmart. So I try not to view job security as something tied to a single company or sector. What gives me confidence is focusing on the factors I can control: continuously building relevant skills, staying adaptable, and making a meaningful impact in my role. In short, my advice would be not to limit yourself to a narrow set of companies. Stay open to opportunities where you can learn, contribute, and grow — because the tech world is much bigger than just one path. Jump to

Title: SpaceX, Private Ventures Fuel Elon Musk’s Trillion-Dollar Dreams

Tesla’s sleek cars and futuristic trucks have defined Elon Musk’s public image, but SpaceX is the real engine behind his growing net worth. Jennifer Ablan Guest Contributor to The Daily Upside Elon Musk, often described as a modern-day Thomas Edison, may soon add an unprecedented title to his résumé: the world’s first trillionaire. Tesla’s sleek cars and futuristic trucks have defined his public image, but SpaceX is the real engine behind his growing net worth. The buzz around a potential IPO valued at as much as $1.5 trillion for the high-flying government contractor has emerged as the primary swing factor in the entrepreneur’s net worth at the same time that Tesla shareholders have approved a massive, performance-based compensation package that could significantly expand his stake in the electric-car maker. Together, these developments have shifted Musk’s path to extreme wealth from incremental gains to a handful of high-stakes corporate milestones. Musk’s net worth has surged nearly 50% year over year to an estimated $645 billion. In October, he became the first individual to surpass a $500 billion net worth, propelled by rising private-market valuations for SpaceX and renewed confidence in Tesla’s long-term strategy. If Musk meets the aggressive performance targets tied to his Tesla compensation plan, and if SpaceX continues on its current trajectory, he could break the trillion-dollar barrier. Such an accomplishment would test the upper bounds of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, created and named when the idea of a trillionaire still seemed unfathomable and absurd. Now, it no longer does. Already, Musk has been cast front and center, most recently by Forbes, as the maestro of this era’s wealth creation. SpaceX, which has invested aggressively in reusable rockets, launch infrastructure, and satellites, is the single largest lever in the trillionaire equation. Musk owns an estimated 42% of the private rocket and satellite company, which recent secondary share transactions have valued at $350 billion to $800 billion in private markets; that makes his stake worth roughly $136 billion to more than $300 billion on paper today. The real upside comes from long-term growth and the potential for a public offering; if SpaceX lists at valuations some analysts forecast (up to about $1.5 trillion), Musk’s stake alone could exceed $600 billion, reshaping his net worth significantly. Indeed, Starlink has rapidly become the financial backbone of SpaceX. The satellite internet service has added 1 million new customers in under seven weeks, bringing its total to more than 9 million active users across 155 countries and territories, according to the company, implying a growth rate of more than 20,000 new users per day since early November. That momentum caps an explosive year. In December 2024, SpaceX reported 4.6 million Starlink customers; by August 2025, the figure had climbed to 7 million, before accelerating sharply in recent months. The service now operates on a constellation of more than 9,000 low-Earth-orbit satellites, enabling broadband connectivity in rural, maritime, aviation, and defense-critical regions beyond the reach of traditional networks (For my part, I can now use Wi-Fi on routes to and from New York and Hawaii, even over the Pacific Ocean — something that was previously impossible — because of Starlink.) Musk has said Starlink is now “by far” the largest driver of SpaceX’s revenue — a distinction that has materially altered how investors assess the company. While SpaceX and Starlink represent the transformational upside, Tesla remains a critical component of Musk’s wealth trajectory. His 2018 compensation package, revived after the Delaware Supreme Court overturned a lower court ruling that had voided it, entitles Musk to acquire stock options tied to ambitious operational and market-capitalization milestones. Most of those milestones have already been achieved, giving Musk the right to purchase roughly 304 million Tesla shares at deeply discounted prices, currently valued at approximately $139 billion. Adding to this, Tesla’s shareholders have also approved a new performance-based pay plan, further increasing Musk’s potential upside and consolidating his control over the company. If fully realized, these packages could add hundreds of billions in theoretical value, though the actual gain depends on hitting aggressive targets and on public-market conditions. All told, the new performance plan positions Musk to unlock value as Tesla begins monetizing AI-driven initiatives, including full self-driving, autonomous fleet operations and robotics. In this framework, Tesla serves as an accelerant rather than the primary driver of Musk’s net worth. Its gains are meaningful but incremental, constrained by stock performance, earnings multiples and investor sentiment. SpaceX, by contrast, offers the potential for sudden, transformative gains: an IPO, Starlink expansion or secondary-market repricing could add hundreds of billions almost overnight. “Heading into 2026, this marks a monster year for Tesla and Musk as the autonomous and robotics chapter begins,” analyst Dan Ives writes in his latest report on Top 5 Names to Play the AI Revolution into 2026. “The AI valuation will start to get unlocked, and we believe the march to an AI-driven valuation for Tesla over the next six to nine months has now begun, with full self-driving and autonomous penetration of Tesla’s installed base and the acceleration of Cybercab in the US representing the golden goose for Musk & Co. We believe Tesla could reach a $2 trillion market cap over the coming year, and in a bull-case scenario, $3 trillion by the end of 2026.” Beyond Tesla and SpaceX, Musk holds stakes in several ventures that extend both financial upside and strategic influence, positioning him across AI, social platforms, neurotechnology and infrastructure: In true “Musk fashion,” the venture was inspired when Musk was stuck in LA traffic. Artificial intelligence-powered bots’ big presence at CES belies the tech industry’s expectations to turn a profit on them. Greg Abel earned Warren Buffett’s trust and, eventually, his job. Here’s what you need to know about Berkshire Hathaway’s new, lower-key CEO. Bitcoin, the No. 1 crypto by market cap, hasn’t recovered from a flash crash, chopping more than $1 trillion from the broader sector’s value. With an estimated half a million workers needed to fill the construction industry’s labor shortages, AI investments this year may get stalled. US automakers General Motors, Stellantis (formerly Fiat Chrysler) and Ford are bracing for slowing sales in 2026 amid rising unemployment. The last three months of 2025 are only the start of a downturn for EV sales: The pace is expected to keep slowing next year. Despite initial concern from motorists, robotaxi services are finding plenty of passengers as they expand across the country. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs proved they’re still the go-to middlemen for Wall Street deals amid a near-record $4.8 trillion global M&A bonanza Forecasters predict gold’s rally will stretch through December 2026, although one analysis says there’s reason for caution. For the first time since 2018, the Wells Fargo stagecoach is rolling into a new year without the burden of a Federal Reserve asset cap. Commerce Department data released this week showed US GDP rose 4.3% in the third quarter, with the American consumer to thank for it. Despite a recent pickup in dealmaking, the industry is sitting on a backlog of at least 31,000 companies valued at $3.7 trillion. © 2026 The Daily Upside

Title: Here’s How Much BlackRock Spent Buying Bitcoin And Ethereum In 2025

BlackRock pushed into digital assets massively in 2025, with on-chain data revealing just how aggressive the leading asset manager became in accumulating Bitcoin and Ethereum. Blockchain tracking data shows that the world’s largest asset manager expanded its cryptocurrency holdings by more than $23 billion in 2025, and this is one of the biggest institutional accumulation phases seen in the year. The figures highlight a sustained commitment to Bitcoin and Ethereum, even as price action turned bearish towards the end of the year. Crypto was at the forefront of BlackRock’s investment strategy in 2025. According to data from on-chain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence, BlackRock’s on-chain cryptocurrency holdings at the start of 2025 were $54.83 billion. By January 1, 2026, that figure had risen to about $78.36 billion, representing a net increase of roughly $23.52 billion over the course of the year. These figures mean that by the end of 2025, BlackRock’s crypto portfolio had grown by about 43% compared to the start of the year. Unsurprisingly, the accumulation was concentrated almost entirely in Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two biggest assets leading institutional exposure to the crypto industry. Bitcoin was the dominant holding by value. BlackRock’s BTC stash grew from around 552,550 BTC worth about $51.16 billion in January 2025 to about 770,290 BTC valued at $68.05 billion in January 2026. This translates to an increase of approximately 217,740 BTC, adding about $16.88 billion to the firm’s portfolio based on year-end valuations. Even with Bitcoin’s price down about 5% from January 2025, the increase in BTC units held grew by 39%, which, in turn, pushed the total value higher. Ethereum, although smaller in absolute terms, saw even faster relative growth. Holdings expanded from 1.07 million ETH valued at $3.59 billion in January 2025 to about 3.47 million ETH worth $10.31 billion in January 2026. That represents an increase of nearly 2.4 million ETH, contributing around $6.71 billion to BlackRock’s crypto holdings in 2025. These numbers mean that BlackRock’s ETH holdings grew by more than 224% over the year, far outpacing Bitcoin’s 39% increase. The bulk of BlackRock’s crypto buying in 2025 was due to persistent inflows into its spot exchange-traded products. Investor demand for regulated exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum was strong for much of the year, particularly during rallies that pushed both assets toward fresh all-time highs. At the same time, corrective phases in the crypto market were accompanied by notable ETF outflows. This trend supports the view that Bitcoin and Ethereum price action is becoming increasingly linked to ETF activity, and BlackRock is the dominant issuer within those flows. BlackRock has not yet established a presence in the XRP market. The asset manager does not currently offer a Spot XRP ETF, and spokespersons have previously stated that the company has no immediate plans to launch one.

Title: Here’s Why Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Holds the Keys to AI’s Explosive Growth

Investing Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) controls advanced packaging capacity that determines which AI chipmakers can scale production. Google reportedly cut its 2026 TPU production target from 4 million to 3 million units due to limited access to Taiwan Semiconductor’s CoWoS packaging. Nvidia secured over half of Taiwan Semiconductor’s CoWoS capacity through 2027. Sending You to Google News in 3 The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has expanded rapidly since 2023, powering applications from chatbots to autonomous systems and driving trillions in market value. Tech giants have invested heavily in data centers and specialized hardware to meet surging demand for training and inference tasks. However, constraints are emerging that cap this growth rate. Supply chain bottlenecks, particularly in advanced manufacturing, limit how quickly new AI capabilities can scale. Power availability and component shortages further hinder expansion. It could be that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is one of the key linchpins determining how far and fast AI expands. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) has reportedly reduced its 2026 production target for Tensor Processing Units from around 4 million to 3 million units. According to a report by Korea Economic Daily, this adjustment stems from limited access to Taiwan Semiconductor’s CoWoS advanced packaging capacity, which Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) secured through priority allocations. CoWoS integrates processors with high-bandwidth memory on a silicon interposer, essential for high-performance AI accelerators. Without sufficient capacity, finished chips cannot deploy at scale. Other outlets have reported on production caps previously. Taiwan Semiconductor dominates CoWoS technology, but explosive AI demand has outpaced its expansions. Nvidia has locked in over half of its available capacity through 2026 and 2027, leaving competitors like Google constrained. This forced Google to cut its production target despite strong internal needs for its custom silicon. The issue underscores how supply allocation now influences the AI hardware landscape more than design or demand alone. Chipmakers and designers are competing intensely for positions in Taiwan Semiconductor’s production queue. Google’s experience highlights this scramble, where securing advanced packaging determines output volumes. Nvidia’s dominance in allocations gives it an edge in scaling AI accelerators, while others face delays. This dynamic parallels energy constraints limiting data center buildouts. Power grids struggle to support massive, expanding AI infrastructure, capping expansion opportunities. Yet Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing controls the core components inside those centers, from logic dies to packaged accelerators. Its role as the primary foundry for leading-edge nodes makes it central to AI progress. Without its capacity ramps, even abundant energy would not translate to deployable hardware. Taiwan Semiconductor is accelerating capacity expansion through 2028, doubling its advanced wafer capabilities. It is also repurposing 200 mm fabs for advanced packaging, which could increase its returns. If fully utilized, it would not be surprising to see revenue double by 2028. Yet the CoWoS shortage could end up boosting the competition, which moves in to fill the void created. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), for example, is aiming to rival Taiwan Semiconductor in foundry services. Google has explored alternatives like Intel’s EMIB packaging for future TPUs, such as the v9 accelerator expected around 2027. Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) also is said to have placed orders with Intel, while Apple could tap Intel’s 18A process for its entry-level M-series chips starting in 2027. The foundry’s focus on custom ASICs and advanced packaging puts it in step with industry needs for efficient AI compute. Its 18A and 14A nodes, plus EMIB, position it to capture business from hyperscalers seeking alternatives. Intel is scaling its New Mexico facility’s capacity by 30% for EMIB and 150% for Foveros, its own advanced 3D packaging technology. Yet Nvidia reportedly reviewed and passed on using Intel’s facilities, though both Google and Apple are reportedly also sounding out Samsung‘s two facilities in Texas to meet their needs. Samsung is offering advanced packaging as a “turnkey” solution bundled with DRAM and foundry services to hyperscalers such as Google, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). So, while Taiwan Semiconductor remains dominant, its capacity issues create openings for its competitors to gain traction and, in Intel’s case, validate its turnaround strategy. While Nvidia seems to have the inside track on commanding priority, boosting its long-term dominance in the space, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is increasingly the key to whether other chipmakers and designers thrive. As advanced packaging becomes the new industry bottleneck, its CoWoS capacity can determine who scales compute. This kingmaker capability — Taiwan Semiconductor deciding where the players stand in line — can ultimately decide the AI market’s winners and losers. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

Title: Early Retirement With Index Funds: How This Simple Strategy Could Change Your Financial Future
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/early-retirement-with-index-funds-how-this-simple-strategy-could-change-your-financial-future-11876964
Time Published: 2026-01-03T10:44:00Z
Full Content:
Many dream of retiring early, but achieving that goal doesn't require high-priced financial advisors or complex investment strategies. Low-cost index funds have emerged as a powerful tool in pursuing financial independence, offering a straightforward path that combines simplicity, diversification, and a proven track record of superior performance. Index funds are investments that mirror specific market indexes, such as the S&P 500 or the total stock market. Think of them as buying a slice of the entire market rather than trying to pick individual winning stocks. So when you invest in an S&P 500 index mutual or exchange-traded fund, you're gaining exposure to America's 500 largest companies, from Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) to Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Coca-Cola Co. (KO). The index approach began in the 1970s when John Bogle launched the first index fund (the Vanguard 500 Index Fund). Critics initially called it "un-American" and "a sure path to mediocrity." Starting with just $11 million in assets, the fund struggled initially. However, investors soon caught on, and index funds grew dramatically. As of late 2025, the Vanguard 500 Fund has $1.5 trillion in assets under management. As you can see above, few actively managed funds have beat index funds over the last few decades. Some say the success of index funds rests on a fundamental principle known as the efficient market hypothesis (EMH), which argues that stock prices reflect all publicly available information about companies, making it extremely difficult for any individual investor to consistently identify mispriced stocks and beat the market. Market efficiency arises from the immense scale of modern financial markets, where millions of participants simultaneously analyze data and trade stocks. When new information emerges, their collective trading quickly drives prices to reflect that information in a process known as "price discovery." To regularly beat the market, an active manager would need to analyze information much faster and make better judgments than this vast network of competitors, a task that becomes mathematically improbable over long periods and which could explain the persistent underperformance of active funds. The cost advantage of index funds creates an additional tail wind that can really push returns upward. A $10,000 investment earning an annualized 7% average return over 30 years would grow to $73,191 with a low-cost index fund charging 0.14% annually, but only to $57,435 with a higher-cost fund charging 1.0% annually. The difference of $15,756 represents a 27.4% cut in your returns only from the 0.86% difference in annual fees—something seemingly small that adds up dramatically over time. Dollar-cost averaging is where you invest a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of market conditions. This approach offers three key advantages: "Systematically buying investments incrementally over time is a proven method to a successful long-term outcome because it helps investors ignore the noise of financial news and the folly of attempting to time the market," says David Tenerelli, a certified financial planner at Values Added Financial. "It takes discipline to continue to buy investments during a market downturn, but a shift in mindset can help—rather than fearing financial loss, an investor can reframe as buying stocks 'on sale.'" The combination of market-matching returns, minimal fees, and the power of compounding make index funds historically one of the most reliable paths to building wealth. However, success requires consistent, disciplined contributions and a long enough time horizon.

Title: Billionaire David Tepper Pours $411,000,000 Into Contrarian Asset After Dumping Exposure To Tech, Health and AI Stocks

A highly successful and closely watched billionaire is making major changes to his hedge fund’s portfolio. A new SEC filing shows the founder and president of Appaloosa Management, David Tepper, just sold UnitedHealth (UNH), Intel (INTC), Alibaba (BABA), Vistra (VST) and Micron (MU). Tepper slashed UNH by 92%, exited INTC entirely, trimmed BABA by 9%, cut VST by 31% and reduced MU by 39% in Q3 of 2025. Meanwhile, in a bold contrarian pivot, Tepper poured $411 million into Whirlpool (WHR), boosting shares from 266,000 to 5.5 million. The appliance giant now ranks third in Appaloosa’s $7.38 billion portfolio at 5.85%. Tepper also added stakes in old-economy names like Goodyear Tire (GT) and regional banks such as Truist (TFC) and Western Alliance (WAL). The moves reflect Tepper’s opportunistic style, betting on undervalued cyclicals amid tech pullbacks. The firm’s portfolio value grew 14% quarter-over-quarter, and its top holdings remain Alibaba (BABA) at 15.6%, Amazon (AMZN) at 7.4%, and Nvidia (NVDA) at 4.8%.

Title: Top 10 crypto fundraising rounds in 2025 — and what they mean for 2026
URL: https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/top-10-crypto-fundraising-rounds-in-2025/
Time Published: 2026-01-03T06:00:00Z

About us Copy link Fundraising by crypto businesses reached over $25 billion in 2025, shattering analysts’ expectations that companies would raise just north of $18 billion. The top 10 raises alone brought in over $10 billion, DefiLlama data shows. Leading investors this year include not only tech-centric firms like Paradigm and Sequoia Capital, but also white-shoe stalwarts BlackRock, JP Morgan, and Goldman Sachs. The blockbuster deals underscore the convergence between crypto and traditional financial institutions, according to Charles Chong, VP of strategy at crypto investment firm BlockSpaceForce. “The line between fintech, TradFi, and crypto will continue to blur,” Chong told DL News. “Blockchain rails will increasingly sit in the background, improving settlement, custody, and programmability, while most crypto-specific complexity is abstracted away from end users,” Chong said. In the converging environment, the main dynamic is companies with a big client base splurging to buy infrastructure firms, regardless of whether they started as fintech or crypto, he said. “Stablecoins and tokenised assets will keep growing because they solve obvious problems for banks, funds, and corporations,” he said. Here are the top 10 biggest raises in 2025. In March, crypto exchange Binance raised $2 billion in a strategic round led by Abu Dhabi-based fund MGX. The raise is the largest single investment in crypto history and marks a key milestone in Binance’s post-regulatory transformation, as it doubles down on institutional services and compliance infrastructure. In October, US President Donald Trump pardoned Changpeng Zhao, the former Binance CEO who served a four-month prison sentence in 2024 after pleading guilty to violating US laws by failing to do enough to prevent criminals, sanctioned entities and other bad actors from laundering billions of dollars in dirty money, according to court filings. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told DL News that Zhao was “prosecuted by the Biden Administration in their war on cryptocurrency.” In October, Prediction platform Polymarket locked in a $2 billion strategic raise led by the New York Stock Exchange’s parent company ICE. “Our investment blends ICE [with] a forward-thinking, revolutionary company pioneering change within the decentralised finance space,” said Jeffrey Sprecher, ICE CEO. The $2 billion dollar investment certainly raised a few eyebrows, but Michael Blaugrund, vice president of strategic initiatives at Intercontinental Exchange, said in November that Zohran Mamdani’s New York City mayoral election win vindicated the sale. Bettors had given Mamdani overwhelming odds to win. “I was so nervous,” Blaugrund said at an event. “Because regardless of where my politics are, if Mamdani didn’t win, we would have overpaid for Polymarket.” In June, Stablecoin issuer Circle raised $1.1 billion in its August public offering in one of the most high-profile crypto raises on Wall Street. Now trading at just over 150% above IPO price, Circle is trying to position as critical dollar infrastructure for digital payments by focusing on global rollout, public sector partnerships, and expanding its compliance-based treasury rails. The raise underscores how stablecoins are entering Wall Street. In August, Peter Thiel-backed crypto exchange Bullish debuted on public markets raising $1.1 billion. Its automated market maker-style trading model and regulated-first positioning made it attractive to institutional investors seeking exchange exposure with minimal counterparty risk. The firm said it will use the funds to grow in Asia and Europe while doubling down on proprietary trading and data services. It currently trades near $39 per share at time of reporting, or just slightly above its IPO price. In December, betting platform Kalshi announced it closed a $1 billion Series E led by Paradigm and a16z. The Polymarket rival, focused on real-world event contracts, said it aims to become the Nasdaq analogy of prediction markets. As demand for hedging against macroeconomic, weather, and politics grows, Kalshi is launching hundreds of new tradable events and lobbying for further regulatory clarity. In September, blockchain lender Figure Technology raised just over $787 million in an IPO. Legendary investor Stanley Druckenmiller’s Duquesne Family Office alone invested $50 million, Reuters reported. Built on the Provenance Blockchain, the firm tokenises home equity loans and other credit instruments. Institutional investors see Figure as a gateway to real-world asset tokenisation. In September, Kraken pulled in $600 million in a pre-IPO round to prepare for a 2026 public offering. Previous report had stated that the crypto exchange had raised a $500 million round, but the company only confirmed the actual number in November as it not only officially announced plans to go public in 2026, but that it had also secured another $200 million in a strategic investment from Citadel Securities at a $20 billion valuation. The raise is “a milestone that reflects years of work, discipline, and conviction,” co-CEO Arjun Sethi said on LinkedIn. “I am proud of our team and grateful for the partners who chose to join us. In July, memecoin launchpad Pump.fun stunned markets with a $500 million initial coin offering. The platform lets users mint new tokens instantly. Often dismissed as retail froth, Pump.fun’s raise shows investor appetite for high-risk, high-speed protocols remains relevant. The team has said it is investing in security upgrades and social trading features. In October, Stripe-incubated layer 1 blockchain Tempo raised $500 million to build a high-speed payments chain for USDC and USDT. Tempo targets global payroll and remittances with low-latency infrastructure. In December, Tempo released its first public test network. Tempo has lured several well-respected crypto researchers, executives, and software engineers, such as former Ethereum Foundation researcher Dankrad Feist, former Optimism Labs CEO Liam Horne, and Rice University Professor Mallesh Pai. In September, fintech-as-a-service firm Rapyd closed a $500 million Series F round backed by BlackRock and Fidelity. Known for powering crypto-fiat APIs and stablecoin rails, Rapyd says it is now working on a multibillion-dollar acquisition strategy. It’s become critical middleware for businesses bridging traditional finance and DeFi.

Title: XRP Faces Strong Social Discontent—Is A 50% Bullish Reversal Just Around The Corner?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. As 2026 begins, XRP is starting the year on a bearish note, with investor sentiment plummeting to levels of extreme fear. Despite these challenging conditions, analysts are suggesting that this negativity may set the stage for a significant bullish reversal, drawing parallels to historical trends. Reports indicate that periods of extreme sentiment have often preceded XRP rallies with impressive gains, at times exceeding 1,000%. Data from Santiment indicates that bearish mentions of XRP are now running 20-30% higher than the subdued averages seen in November. This deepening negativity, coupled with XRP stabilizing between $1.8 and $1.9 mark, highlights “a classic market divergence”: sentiment continues to worsen while prices consolidate, suggesting that emotional capitulation is occurring faster than any fundamental deterioration. Beneath this wave of retail fear, however, institutional behavior paints a more positive picture. Spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded inflows of approximately $424 million in December alone, making them the best-performing crypto ETF product. This contrast between extreme retail sentiment—currently at an extreme fear level of 24—and substantial institutional accumulation, which stands at around $1.3 billion over the past 50 days, often precedes market reversals more reliably than sentiment readings alone indicate. For XRP, the current setup combines extreme fear readings with a social sentiment significantly above baseline levels, alongside price consolidation, creating a historical pattern that has led to substantial rallies multiple times since 2020. For instance, back in the 2020-2021 cycle, XRP dropped to $0.17 amid the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit, followed by a 1,053% increase to $1.96 over just four months. Today’s scenario mirrors this past occurrence. With institutional accumulation diverging sharply from retail capitulation, historical data suggests that this combination yields a 70-75% chance of a bullish reversal within the next two to eight weeks. Current trading conditions for XRP sit at approximately $1.90, with the Fear & Greed Index at 24. This setup creates three potential scenarios. In the most favorable bullish scenario, the Trump administration could announce clear pro-crypto regulatory policies in the first quarter of the year, BlackRock might file an XRP ETF application, or the adoption of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin could rapidly scale above $2-3 billion. Historically, when the Fear & Greed Index climbs from 24 into neutral territory (between 50 and 60), XRP often rallies between 30-50%, setting targets between $2.44 and $2.82. If bullish momentum continues into mild greed (70+), XRP could reach the $3.00-$3.20 range. In a more neutral scenario, sentiment may gradually normalize without dramatic catalysts, with ETF inflows continuing to average between $200-300 million monthly. As RLUSD organically grows through existing partnerships, fears could naturally subside over a span of six to eight weeks. As the Fear & Greed Index rises from 24 to the 45-55 range, XRP has typically appreciated between 15-25%, targeting between $2.16 and $2.35. If the support at $1.85 holds through January, and trading volume expands above $1.98, the price could extend toward $2.40-$2.50. In a bearish outcome, sentiment could linger in extreme fear (below 30) for over eight weeks without relief. A decisive break below $1.85 on substantial volume would see XRP testing support levels around $1.65-$1.70. The altcoin has surged by over 6% in the past 24 hours towards $1.98 amid a broader recovery in the crypto market.

I went to the Chicago CES during finals week in 1983. It was incredible. Back then, no online announcements.

HEADLINES: Trump declares U.S. will "run" Venezuela temporarily, threatens those who oppose (Video)Following a public pressure campaign against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, on Saturday a military assault ordered by President Donald Trump captured Maduro and his wife, who were then taken to the United States to face narco-terrorism, drug trafficking and weapons charges. Venezuela's vice president denounced the operation and called it illegal. Trump said the U.S. would "run the country" until there's a judicious transition, and warned of more attacks if Venezuela does not comply. CBS News national security correspondent David Martin outlines the operation. HEADLINES: In Venezuela, uncertainty in the wake of Maduro's removal (Video)It's not the first time the United States has used force to remove a Latin American strongman from power. But the Trump administration's operation to capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro now leaves that country's future shrouded in uncertainty – with President Trump saying the U.S. may "run" Venezuela, and questions over whether the opposition can take over. Lee Cowan talks with author William Neuman and professor Oscar Perez about Washington's next steps as it takes control of a nation of nearly 30 million people.

Title: Bitcoin treasury slump deepens as 40% trade at discount: ‘It’s an abomination’
URL: https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/bitcoin-treasury-blues-mount-as-40-percent-trade-at-discount/
Time Published: 2026-01-02T21:26:54Z

About us Copy link The trend that became the biggest boom of 2025 is starting the new year as a bust. At least 37 of the top 100 Bitcoin treasury companies now trade at discounts to their net asset value, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries.net. That means nearly 40% of major treasuries are worth less than the Bitcoin they hold. “The initial hype is over,” Brian Huang, co-founder of investment platform Glider, told DL News. Indeed, the premium era has ended. For the first three-quarters of 2025, treasury companies enjoyed significant premiums on their holdings. That allowed them to issue new stock above their Bitcoin value, use the proceeds to buy more coins, and repeat the cycle — all without diluting shareholders. Scores of companies, many of them without any previous connection to crypto, rushed to emulate the trade. The boom meant nearly 200 public companies now collectively hold over 1 million Bitcoin worth around $96 billion. But that playbook only works when companies’ equity trades at a premium to the crypto on their balance sheets. Strategy, the sector’s pioneer, traded at more than double its Bitcoin value last year. Today it offers a 17% discount. The entire trade began to slump in October. Ultimately, just one Bitcoin treasury company, France’s The Blockchain Group, outperformed the 16% the S&P 500 returned to investors in 2025, according to a December report from BitcoinTreasuries.net. Every other treasury underperformed the bellwether S&P 500, and 60% of Bitcoin treasuries spent more on their Bitcoin than it’s now worth. For macro analyst Alex Kruger, the Bitcoin treasury trade ominously reminds him of a situation that Bitcoin dealt with exactly five years ago. “When it comes to analogies across cycles and Bitcoin Treasury companies, June 2025 is analogous to December 2020 and the Bitcoin Grayscale trade,” Kruger told DL News. In 2020, Grayscale traded at a 40% premium to its Bitcoin holdings, meaning investors paid $1.40 for every $1 of Bitcoin the trust held because it was the only way institutions could get regulated Bitcoin exposure. But then came Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Investors could get Bitcoin exposure easily on their BlackRock or Fidelity account, collapsing Grayscale’s appeal — and premium. Eventually, Grayscale’s product traded at a 50% discount, pinning down investors who were forced to sell at massive losses. The 37 Bitcoin treasury companies trading below NAV range from major players like Strategy and Twenty One Capital — two of the top five treasuries, which each have a 17% discount to their Bitcoin holdings — to smaller firms like Sweden-based H100 Group, which trades at a 32% discount, and Vanadi Coffee, which is valued by investors at a 61% discount to its Bitcoin holdings. Another five to six companies hover precariously close to 1.0x, including Brazil-based OranjeBTC at parity. Any modest equity drawdown could push them below NAV, and turn them into food for giants. Kruger reckons consolidation is on its way, as failed treasuries become acquisition targets. In September, Bitcoin treasury Strive purchased Semler Scientific in an all-stock transaction. Other treasury figures predict a similar scenario playing out. Katherine Dowling, president of Bitcoin Standard Treasury Company, said the strongest digital asset treasuries that survive 2025’s year-end collapse will become even bigger — by acquiring the weak. “Bitcoin DATs will push through this current noise as well. We will also likely see some DAT M&A opportunistic activity,” Dowling previously told DL News. Companies trading below 1.0x mNAV cannot issue stock to buy more Bitcoin because doing so destroys shareholder value. Let’s say a treasury holds $100 million in Bitcoin but trades at a 30% discount, so its market cap is $70 million. If it issues $10 million in new shares to buy Bitcoin, shareholders now own $110 million in Bitcoin but the market cap only rises to $77 million. Shareholders got diluted for nothing. This dynamic destroys the entire treasury playbook, ending access to capital markets, the allegedly endless Bitcoin purchases, and the potential for an expanding premium. Instead, the scheme turns into no more than holding and hoping. “The model is an abomination,” said Kruger. Pedro Solimano is DL News’ Buenos Aires-based markets correspondent. Got a tip?

Title: Expert tips for paying down debt, saving for retirement and other financial goals
URL: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/expert-tips-for-paying-down-debt-saving-for-retirement-and-other-financial-goals
Time Published: 2026-01-02T21:25:37Z

Your generous monthly contribution— or whatever you can give—will help secure our future. Cecilia Lallmann Cecilia Lallmann Leave your feedback Maybe your resolution for 2026 is to pay down debt, start your retirement savings, or save for a big ticket item. Maybe you need help with personal finance but don't know where to start. Either way, prioritizing your goals for the New Year comes down to understanding what you value the most, Kumiko Love, an accredited financial counselor and author of "My Money, My Way," told PBS News. That's because, in "the world of finance, everything is a trade off," Love said. WATCH: Should you use a buy now, pay later loan? Here's what to know Of the 30% of Americans who say they make at least one resolution, 61% say they are focused on money or finances, according to Pew Research. And a majority of Americans – 87% – say they accomplish at least some of their annual resolutions. To Love, mapping out small wins along the way can help you stay the course. "What we need to be doing is celebrating all the consistent habits and actions and mindset that we're doing to get us there," Love said. "The honest truth is we live more in our day-to-day than at our end results." To help you set yourself up for financial success this year, PBS News asked experts for tips on reaching different financial goals. Fear around your money "most of the time comes from the unknown," Love said. "You're not scared of looking at your money. You're actually nervous and stressed out because you have no idea what's going on with your money," echoed Tori Dunlap, a self-taught money and career expert who founded the financial education platform Her First 100K. "We can't make changes unless we actually know what's going on, unless we know where our money's going." "Paying off debt is not an action, it's a change of lifestyle." When you sit down to look at the numbers, "rewire all of that shame and the fear and the guilt you feel," suggested Dunlap, author of "Financial Feminist. The first step to that is "looking at your money in the most neutral way possible and just figuring out, 'OK, what am I gonna do to fix the things that aren't working and continue doing the things that are?'" There are also resources for people who need support. "The most important thing in this day and time is that if you feel overwhelmed, if you feel burdened, that you reach out and say, 'I need help,'" said Michelle Singletary, personal finance columnist at The Washington Post. She suggests looking into personal finance classes or community programs, or finding an accountability partner. "Maybe there's somebody in your life who's really good with money" who you can ask to help you on your personal finance journey, Singletary said. Love wants people to understand that "paying off debt is not an action, it's a change of lifestyle." She said if you don't learn the healthy habits to stay out of debt, "you can pay off debt but go right back into debt again." So the first step of what she calls a "debt payoff journey" is to understand "why you're in debt in the first place." "This is not a blame game," Love said. "This is simply understanding how you got here so you can set better management and healthy habits to maybe correct some of those things and or make different choices." WATCH: Why it's getting harder to find a new car under $25,000 High-interest debt should be the first kind you should tackle. "Credit card debt always is going to have a high interest rate. That's probably the debt you need to work to eliminate first before you worry about your lesser interest debt," Dunlap said. If you have multiple credit cards with different interest rates, start with the one with the highest interest rate. Dunlap also suggests "looking "into a personal loan to help consolidate your debt, especially if you have a lot of debt at a higher interest rate and it's not going down." "The thing with credit cards is that the interest compounds. It's very high and it compounds every day," Dunlap told PBS News. "So, every day you spend in debt, it gets more expensive. Personal loans allow you to typically take out a loan at a lower interest rate with one single monthly payment that isn't going to compound every day." The personal loan route to pay off high-interest credit card debt can be "a nice reset for your money." Dunlap said the strategy for paying off your student loan debt depends on what kind of loans they are and what the interest rate is. If you have multiple sources of debt, federal student loans can be your last priority since there are other options for repayment, Love said. You may qualify for an income-based repayment plan that could help give you "some breathing room" to focus on whatever debt is most eating into your cash flow and destroying your budget, she added. Dunlap shared what she calls the "7 to 8% rule." If the interest rate on your student loan debt is more than 7 to 8%, then it costs you more money to be in debt, so you should pay it off faster. Put extra money into the principle so your interest is calculated off of a smaller balance. If the interest rate is less than that, Dunlap recommends sticking with monthly payments and focusing on investing any extra income instead. If you have private student loans at a high interest rate, Dunlap said it might be worth refinancing, but she said "do not take your federal loans private." "That takes you out of potential student loan forgiveness in the future," Dunlap said, and won't allow you to get on an income-based repayment plan. "Investing should not be sexy," Dunlap said. "It should be safe, consistent, and over a long period of time." She said day trading or picking "a hot stock" is very risky. The first place to start when investing is using your retirement account to its full advantage, both Dunlap and Love said. "Investing should not be sexy." "People don't understand that retirement accounts like a 401k or an IRA are investing accounts and they're tax advantaged, meaning that the government is incentivizing you to save for your retirement by offering you tax breaks," Dunlap said. Plus, a lot of employer sponsored plans offer a match as part of your benefits package, Love said. "It's like free money" you can use to invest. But, Dunlap said to remember to choose your investments. Otherwise, you'll spend "years in what I call financial purgatory," Dunlap said. Dunlap recommends " something like an index fund, which is a group of stocks" that is "well diversified." Love said if you want more specific advice, you'll typically "have access to the financial advisor that is managing" your retirement account on whatever platform you use. "If you have questions, reach out to them. That's what they're there for," Love said Love stressed that while she is an accredited financial counselor, she is not a fiduciary. So her advice shouldn't take the place of recommendations from an adviser with specific information about your assets. But there are three steps that come to mind for how you could begin "upping your retirement game." First, "start with your [employer] match." Then, if you want to go above and beyond, "I would move to a Roth IRA or traditional IRA, depending on your tax bracket and where you're gonna be in retirement." And then "I [would] look at something called a health savings account," where individuals can set aside money on a pre-tax basis to pay for qualified medical expenses. Love recommends looking into an HSA because it's a triple tax-advantage account, since you can contribute to it before taxes, earn interest on the account tax-free, and withdrawals are not taxed as long as they're used for qualifying medical expenses. Since the funds don't expire and continue to roll over year after year, "it turns into quite a retirement account when you become of age for retirement." Dunlap said if you are nearing retirement, you can contribute more money through a "catch-up contribution," which varies based on the account. She recommends looking into what type of retirement account you currently have and what the catch-up contribution is if you're looking to save more as you get closer to retirement age. Before you think about the financial part of homeownership, the first question you should ask yourself is "is this something you want to do or just something that you were told to do?'" Dunlap said "Renting is not throwing away money. You are paying a fee to live in a place and also a convenience fee where somebody else is gonna handle any problems that come up," Dunlap said. She said homeownership comes with many more expenses than just the down payment and monthly mortgage, and you should ask yourself if you're ready to pay for everything that could come up. READ MORE: Is the 30% rule for rent still relevant? Here's what experts think Some expenses to consider include property taxes, emergency repairs, possibly a homeowners association fee and property insurance. So, "the second question is, can I afford to do this?" Dunlap said. If the answer is yes, Love said you need to determine how much to save, which "starts with understanding what you want to buy." "Until you know how much house you can afford and what you want, it's really hard to start the planning process," Love said. Love said some of the questions to ask yourself when determining your budget include: "Are you buying a fixer upper? Are you buying something that you're going to only live in temporarily for a short amount of time under five years? Are you buying your forever home? How big do you want it? Do you still want to extend your family? Because then you have to think if it's going to be your forever home, you better make sure it's big enough." Dunlap suggested using a high-yield savings account to use as a place to save the money you will use for a down payment, and to automate contributions so it's easier to meet your monthly goal. If you want to avoid paying for private mortgage insurance, the easiest way to do this is by having 20% of the home price for the down payment. If you're like the 80% of buyers who financed their home purchase in 2024, you will want to think about how to improve your credit score to get a better mortgage interest rate, Dunlap said. And don't forget about an emergency fund, Love said. You can also use the questions you asked yourself at the beginning to determine how much to save for house maintenance. As soon as you know an estimated total for the purchase, you can start a sinking fund, where you save a small amount from each paycheck for a planned expense. This should be separate from your emergency fund, which should only be used for unplanned expenses. Both Dunlap and Love say the easiest way to determine your monthly savings goal is to take the amount and divide it by however many months you have to save. If you do this and the amount is unrealistic, Dunlap said, you should pick a different destination, a more affordable item or give yourself more time to save, if you can move the date. In 2025, more than 1.1 million people in the U.S. were laid off, according to the career services firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. When trying to make up for lost income, Love said, "lean in on the skills that you possess" and "get on places like Upwork where you can work for yourself." You may feel like you are overqualified to drive for Uber, but you could be surprised and make way more than you thought you could, Love said. Places like Upwork can also connect you with temporary gigs that match your skillset. Dunlap said a high-yield savings account can come in handy during this time. Even small contributions could return $20 to 40 a month, compared to the few dollars you'd get in annual interest with a traditional account. It's also a good time to make a sustainable budget. Like a car gas gauge, "budgets tell you how far you can get," Dunlap said. "Knowing what's going in and going out, and allowing your budget to adjust accordingly is one of the ways we get control during a very uncontrollable situation." Also, "remind yourself that this season is temporary," Love said, and give yourself grace. More than half of the U.S. workforce in 2024 were paid hourly rates, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics . These workers tend to have less predictable paychecks compared to salaried workers. If your income fluctuates, the first step is to know the minimum amount of money you need to make each month to meet the basics. (Love calls this a "bare bones budget"; for Dunlap, it's the "ramen noodle number.") Start with a revolving checking or savings account, where you'll deposit your checks or tips. "Pay yourself" your bare bones budget from this account to cover your monthly expenses. If there is extra money left, leave it in the revolving account so you can make up for expenses when you don't meet your bare bones budget in other months. Love recommends having at least one month of bare bones expenses in the revolving account. Keeping the baseline in the account can help stabilize your cash flow. Gradually, "you can start giving yourself more for more wants" as you continue to build up this account, Love said. If you make more money than you expect, Dunlap suggests going through a "financial priority list" for that extra income. "Contribute to your emergency fund," Dunlap said. If you already have three to six months of living expenses tucked away, pay off credit card debt and then "contribute more to your retirement accounts," Dunlap said.

Title: Be warned: big tech elitism beyond dot-com bubble peak

Get the FREE App Get the FREE App Australian investors continue to pile into US stocks, chasing outsized returns and their own piece of the artificial intelligence boom. Yet the era of tech giant dominance and a whirlpool of circular investment deals could mean a riskier bet than many realise. The popularity of funds linked to Wall Street's S&P500 index has soared and it's not hard to see why: returns over the past three years are more than 78 per cent compared to about 24 per cent for the local S&P/ASX200. But with just a handful of outsized companies and AI speculation driving broader market growth in 2025, a fund of 500 stocks might be less diversified than most of us think. And therein lies the rub. The so-called Magnificent Seven technology stocks of Apple, Nvidia, Google owner Alphabet, Amazon, Tesla, Meta and Microsoft make up more than a third of the S&P500 index's value, according to IG market analyst Tony Sycamore. "Then if you throw in Netflix and Broadcom, you're getting that dominance rising to closer to 45 per cent," he tells AAP. "Almost half the market cap is covered by nine stocks." By comparison, during the peak that preceded the dot-com crash in 2000, the six top tech companies accounted for roughly 15 per cent of the top 500 US stocks. There are many differences from the dot-com era, namely that most of the magnificent seven have pre-existing businesses that don't depend on AI. However the amount of money flowing into its research is eye-watering. Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and Alphabet alone spent an estimated $US350 billion ($A520 billion) in 2025 on AI research and infrastructure, including the data centres required to power the technology's large language models. "There's valid concern around the Mag Seven; they don't seem to have the revenue to offset these heavy debt loads," Mr Sycamore says. "The cash burn for them is extraordinary and earnings have started to slow." The circular flow of funds between the tech juggernauts and into deals with pre-revenue companies like ChatGPT creator Open AI is also a worry despite headlines and agreements delivering vertigo-inducing stock price jumps. "The market is waking up to the fact that those announcements look great on the surface but underneath they're deeply concerning, artificial and prone to unravelling quickly," Mr Sycamore adds. "That is part of the reason why we have seen these tech stocks pull back." OpenAI, potentially the world's most valuable private company with an estimated market capitalisation of $US700 billion, intends spending $US1.4 trillion on AI infrastructure despite not expecting a profit until 2030. The gap has left many wondering where the money will come from. Pepperstone head of research Chris Weston has never seen a case study similar. "There's circular deals going off left, right and centre: Broadcom, AMD ... Nvidia has $US100 billion investment in OpenAI" he says. "And it's really all premised on the idea that, at some stage, OpenAI will be able to completely monetise their offering." But despite launching the first generative AI large language model ChatGPT in June 2018, which is now in its fifth iteration, competition in AI is white-hot. "When you've got so many of them coming up, backed by some massive players that are already seen as better alternatives, if OpenAI monetises at the wrong cost structure then it becomes a major issue," Mr Weston says. With this in mind, Pepperstone is watching Softbank, a Japanese investment holding group riding an "all-in" bet on OpenAI to generate $US22.5 billion funding via loans and the sale of Nvidia and T-Mobile stocks. As one of the biggest private tech deals in history, Softbank's play is seen as a barometer for the AI leader which, as a private concern, can't be accurately valued. Bank of America data points to roughly 94 per cent of tech profits being poured into AI spending, according to InvestorsObserver finance analyst Sam Bourgi. "These companies are spending almost all the money they earn," he says. "Just in September and October, big tech borrowed $75 billion specifically for AI data centres - more than double their normal annual borrowing." Notably, shares in the Tokyo-headquartered conglomerate plummeted more than 40 per cent in October. The implications of tech concentration for Australians invested in S&P500 index funds is straightforward, Mr Bourgi says. "You own a slice of all this risk and your index's performance now depends heavily on whether these six companies' AI bets work out. "If they succeed and AI becomes hugely profitable over the next few years, your index fund will likely perform well. "If they don't and this turns out to be another bubble like 2000, your index fund could suffer significant losses." A 30 per cent drift in AI stocks could mean a 10-15 per cent decline in an S&P500 index fund, which would leave investors in a tricky spot. "You might not see gains for years if the bubble deflates like in 2000," Mr Bourgi says. finance finance

By Lili Pike, Bloomberg The world is now moving into the latter half of a critical decade to fight climate change. Scientists have warned that nations need to cut carbon emissions nearly 50% by 2030 to stave off 1.5C temperature rise. The world is woefully off track to meet those targets and risks further backsliding, even as there are some surprising sources of progress. In the US, those tensions are on full display. The future of the energy transition is being shaped by President Donald Trump’s climate policy rollbacks that favor fossil fuels — but also the life support for renewables and batteries paradoxically coming from data center power demand. China’s role as the world’s biggest emitter and hub for green tech are also affecting efforts to curb carbon pollution. This year, the country will set a new plan laying out how climate fits with its economic ambitions, while its booming clean tech sector is expected to help more developing countries adopt renewable energy and electric vehicles. Here are 14 themes Bloomberg News writers are keeping tabs on in 2026. Climate clues in China’s new economic blueprint When Chinese officials gather in March for annual legislative meetings, they will approve the country’s next five-year plan. Climate watchers will be looking to see if the plan does anything to speed up the pace of decarbonization after Beijing set what’s widely seen as a conservative 2035 climate target last year. The key stat to watch for is China’s target for carbon intensity — that is, a measure of how much it emits per unit of GDP. It’s currently off track of its last five-year plan created in 2020. How much policymakers push to close the gap will be a critical litmus test for China’s climate leadership amid global backpedaling. —Lili Pike Can diplomats make headway at COP31? International negotiators will spend much of this year trying to create a bare-bones road map to phase out fossil fuels and another to eliminate deforestation. The two issues were left unresolved at the COP30 climate summit in Brazil last year. But with the nation in control of the COP presidency this year, it has a chance to make progress. The first key milestone will be a conference in Colombia in April focused on phasing out fossil fuels. Negotiators will continue to hash out their differences at the Bonn Climate Change Conference in June, as well as at London and New York’s climate weeks held in June and September, respectively. The world’s efforts will culminate at COP31, which will take place in Antalya, Turkey, in November. —Laura Millan Look to developing countries for climate progress In recent years, there have been breakout climate success stories in developing countries, largely enabled by cheap Chinese clean tech exports. Bangladesh off-grid home solar installations set a record globally, enabling rapid rural electrification. Pakistan’s huge purchase of solar panels and batteries have led the country to abandon natural gas as a strategic fuel. And Ethiopia’s de facto ban on fossil-fuel car imports has led to a surge in electric vehicle sales. These transitions were largely driven by access to Chinese technology. With the country’s green exports increasing, expect more such stories to emerge in 2026. —Akshat Rathi The clean tech revival continues Global climate tech investment made a comeback in 2025, largely driven by growing data center energy demand. The surge is likely to continue this year, with both nascent nuclear technologies and proven renewable solutions set to draw investor interest. Upgrading the power grid is likely to see continued investments as well, giving a boost to everything from battery energy storage to power management software. But questions remain about whether the artificial intelligence boom can continue to sustain the climate tech sector, and how to bring growth to companies beyond the energy ecosystem. —Coco Liu Nuclear energy’s boom is just over the horizon Data centers are sucking up electricity as fast as new power plants can get built, and Big Tech is willing to throw big money at nuclear. Dozens of companies are working on the next generation of small reactors, and the Trump administration is pushing to streamline the regulatory process and lining up billions in financing for big ones. More than 60 reactors were under construction worldwide at the end of 2025, though the world’s nuclear capacity contracted a bit. Yet even friendly regulations and fat checks can only do so much to accelerate the notoriously slow-moving industry. That means that while the nuclear sector will start to see momentum in 2026, it’s still a few years away from bringing a wave of new plants online. —Will Wade Will the AI bubble burst? Last year began with a crash in AI-related stocks after news of Chinese company DeepSeek’s more efficient models threw a wrench in power demand growth projections. Will there be another “DeepSeek moment” in 2026? That’s a question that’s on investors’ minds, even as money keeps pouring into AI and the energy sector. Even if models don’t become more efficient, the bubble could burst in other ways. Already, clean energy and real estate developers are sounding the alarm that electric grids, permitting and regulations aren’t keeping up with the pace of interconnection. Some regions are seeing years-long queues to hook up power projects to the grid, and there are backlogs for the crucial electric infrastructure. If the friction continues, AI investors could find their ambitions thwarted or that they’ll have to rely more on developing power onsite and behind the meter. —Michelle Ma Everyone wants a piece of the Arctic “What happens in the Arctic doesn’t stay in the Arctic” is a truism that’s become irrefutable. This past year was the hottest in 125 years of records at the top of the planet, and the spill-over effect of that is beginning to be felt everywhere else, from rising seas to an uptick in atmospheric carbon. Rising temperatures also have the world increasingly looking at how to exploit the region. In 2026, expect previously local or regional Arctic issues — from ports to critical mineral development — to become international priorities. They include how China’s push to transport cargo through the Northern Sea Route will impact fragile ecosystems, and whether Trump’s push for the US to take over Greenland becomes more aggressive. —Danielle Bochove The EV market splits The global transition to electric vehicles will fracture in 2026, as EV sales slow in the US and scoot ahead in the rest of the world. BloombergNEF expects drivers to snap up 16.9 million EVs globally through September. That would be an increase of 16% over the year-earlier period. The tide of affordable and well-reviewed Chinese machines from companies like BYD and SAIC Motor will help drive the uptick in sales, building on 2025’s rise in exports. The EV outlook is far cloudier in the US, which still largely bars Chinese cars and trucks. The sunset of federal subsidies on EV purchases in September slammed the brakes on electric car adoption in the US. BNEF expects US sales to essentially stay level in the first half of the year and dip in the third quarter, in comparison to the market’s record run in August, September and October of this year. —Kyle Stock What will New York City do about BlackRock? Three of the city’s five pension funds are weighing whether to drop BlackRock’s $42 billion mandate because of the asset manager’s climate policies. Former Comptroller Brad Lander made a recommendation late last year after a formal review of all the fund managers overseeing the city’s retirement money, citing BlackRock’s failure to tackle global warming. Lander tried to pass the resolution to cut out the money manager in December, but he was unable to convince pension board of trustee members to hold a vote before the end of the year. Now, it will be up to new comptroller Mark Levine to hold a vote this year. Mayor Zohran Mamdani will also have a significant amount of influence over the outcome of the vote. It will come as BlackRock faces other headwinds: Late last year, the firm lost a mandate with a Dutch pension fund due in part to climate-related concerns. —Olivia Raimonde Climate risk modeling gains steam Demand is high and growing for accurate, usable climate information, particularly information that can help assess risk. That’s driving researchers to probe every level of risk and solution, from neighborhoods exposed to more frequent flooding, to whether proposed atmospheric cooling approaches can work safely, if at all. The clamor for actionable information comes as the Trump administration tries to dismantle much of the infrastructure in the US that underpins world-leading science. That includes hiding reports and data; cutting staff and funding; and putting out analyses that cherry-pick data downplaying climate change. The next 12 months are shaping up as a fight for more accurate climate information and an increasingly challenging environment to find it. —Eric Roston US renewables face a bumpy road The boom days for clean energy in the US are over — for now. Trump’s efforts to halt the buildout of solar and wind have resulted in policy and financial headwinds that will continue to be a big challenge for the industry. Large-scale solar installations, while still expected to make up the bulk of all new power plant additions, are forecast to decline as lucrative federal tax incentives start to fade away by mid-year and tariffs raise costs, according to BloombergNEF. Rooftop solar tax credits for homeowners also got wiped out, though leasing panels will still qualify. Wind developers may be even harder off. Subsidies have disappeared, and the Trump administration has thrown up additional permitting hurdles. The one bright spot? Batteries, which can still qualify for tax breaks if they satisfy new rules restricting the amount of materials that can come from China. Data centers are likely to be a strong source of power demand, which could help the industry. And clean energy developers are hopeful that artificial intelligence’s power needs will convince Trump to ease his assault on the industry. —Mark Chediak The EPA’s biggest climate attack is coming A process initiated by the Environmental Protection Agency last summer to unravel the federal government’s authority to regulate greenhouse gases is set to conclude this year. The EPA is expected to finalize the controversial rulemaking that would rollback the so-called endangerment finding and immediately remove greenhouse gas regulations for passenger cars and trucks. While the administration has rolled back a number of climate rules, this would be the most consequential yet. Any decision to rescind the endangerment finding will undoubtedly be swiftly challenged in the courts, kicking off an epic legal battle that could determine how much the federal government can do to respond to global warming. —Zahra Hirji FEMA’s fate will be decided The Trump administration spent 2025 weighing whether or not to abolish the Federal Emergency Management Agency, with the president establishing a review council co-chaired by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The group was tasked with providing recommendations on what to do with the agency, which it’s expected to finalize early this year. Disaster researchers, state and local emergency managers, and FEMA staff are all waiting to see how dramatic the proposed reforms will be. Although the president doesn’t hold the exclusive power to dissolve the agency in its entirety — that power rests in the hands of Congress — there’s a lot Trump can change, or at least try to. —Zahra Hirji Can California meet its climate goals? This new year marks the 20th anniversary of California’s landmark climate law that has transformed the Golden State into a green powerhouse. But it’ll spend 2026 fending off the Trump administration’s campaign to dismantle its authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. The Trump tax bill’s elimination of federal renewable energy and electric vehicle incentives is already slowing California’s progress toward reaching net-zero emissions by 2045. With the administration trying to scuttle the state’s cap-and-trade market, expect California to continue to spend more time fighting back in the courts and developing workarounds. Beyond Trump’s reach, local and regional California agencies continue to eliminate fossil fuels. A Bay Area ban on the sale of gas water heaters and furnaces, for instance, begins to take effect in 2027 and will apply to a fifth of the state’s population. —Todd Woody –With assistance from Akshat Rathi, Coco Liu, Danielle Bochove, Eric Roston, Kyle Stock, Laura Millan, Mark Chediak, Michelle Ma, Olivia Raimonde, Todd Woody, Will Wade and Zahra Hirji.

January 02, 2026 12:45 ET | Source: USA News Group USA News Group VANCOUVER, Jan. 02, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- USA News Group News Commentary – As global adversaries field operational hypersonic vehicles, the U.S. has reached a 'Sputnik moment' for tactical space access. With the Pentagon committing over $6.9 billion to hypersonic weapons development for FY 2025[1], the market is no longer looking for 'cheap rides'—it is looking for Speed Superiority. Now , the hypersonic technology market is projected to reach $8.46 billion in 2025, driven by these recent hypersonic weapons Pentagon allocations[2]. This strategic pivot toward speed and agility drives the investment thesis for Starfighters Space, Inc. (NYSE-A: FJET), AST SpaceMobile, Inc. (NASDAQ: ASTS), Rocket Lab Corporation (NASDAQ: RKLB), L3Harris Technologies (NYSE: LHX), and Kratos Defense & Security Solutions (NASDAQ: KTOS). Global commercial space launch services are expanding at a 14.6% CAGR, with the sector valued at $8.2 billion in 2024 as satellite operators demand rapid deployment and mission flexibility[3]. Space Force FY 2026 budget authorizations approaching $40 billion underscore the urgency for reusable platforms, hypersonic propulsion systems, and resilient satellite networks that can respond to emerging threats within hours rather than months[4]. Starfighters Space, Inc. (NYSE-A: FJET) closed out 2025 by recently providing a year-end corporate update following its successful listing on the NYSE American exchange, highlighting what the aerospace company describes as a transformational year. Operating out of NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida alongside major players like SpaceX and Blue Origin, Starfighters owns and operates the world's largest commercial supersonic aircraft fleet, a defensible operational monopoly as the only commercial entity globally capable of sustained MACH 2 mission profiles. The company's platform centers on a fleet of seven F-104 Starfighter aircraft, the only commercially available jets capable of sustained MACH 2 flight. These aircraft serve as a reusable first stage, carrying payloads to 45,000 feet before launching them toward space. This approach offers customers something traditional rocket launches cannot: flexible scheduling, rapid turnaround times, and the ability to choose specific orbital destinations without the delays that plague rideshare launch systems. "Starfighters' public listing represents a significant milestone for the Company and reflects growing investor interest in companies providing real-world aerospace capabilities aligned with national security, space access, and advanced testing requirements," said Rick Svetkoff, CEO of Starfighters. "The Company is well positioned to deliver services to a range of customers through our fast, innovative and unique platform." The timing of Starfighters' market entry aligns with shifting policy priorities. A December 18, 2025 White House Executive Order on space superiority emphasized responsive architectures, accelerated commercial integration, and expanded testing capabilities. The order reinforces demand for exactly what Starfighters provides: commercially operated platforms supporting government, defense, and space-adjacent missions. Starfighters generates revenue through multiple channels beyond satellite launches. The company supports hypersonic weapons testing in partnership with the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), addresses a critical national security priority given that both Russia and China have deployed operational hypersonic systems. With strategic competitors like Russia and China having already fielded operational hypersonic vehicles, Starfighters’ specialized testing partnership with the AFRL establishes the company as a 'critical path' for the United States to achieve and maintain technological parity. Additional services include payload testing, pilot training, microgravity experiments, and spaceflight hardware qualification. Current customers span defense and commercial sectors, including Lockheed Martin, GE, Innoveering, Space Florida, and the Air Force Research Laboratory. The company's STARLAUNCH program, based on proven AIM-120 missile technology with over 17,500 units built, targets small satellite operators facing the industry's fundamental dilemma: expensive dedicated launches versus unpredictable rideshare schedules. With projected costs around $15,000 per kilogram at scale, Starfighters aims to occupy the middle ground between these options while offering superior schedule control and mission flexibility. By targeting a scaled cost of $15,000 per kilogram, Starfighters Space Inc. provides a high-cadence, cost-resilient alternative to expensive dedicated launches, positioning it as a vital solution for a Pentagon focused on maximizing its $40 billion Space Force budget amid shifting fiscal priorities. AST SpaceMobile, Inc. (NASDAQ: ASTS) recently successfully launched BlueBird 6, the largest commercial communications array ever deployed in low Earth orbit at nearly 2,400 square feet—over three times the size and ten times the capacity of the company's existing satellites currently in orbit. The satellite, which lifted off December 23, 2025 from India's Satish Dhawan Space Centre, is designed to enable peak data rates up to 120 Mbps directly to standard mobile devices, supporting voice, data, and video applications critical for both commercial users and government operations. The advanced platform addresses critical security and connectivity needs by providing reliable communications infrastructure accessible anywhere on Earth, including remote and disaster-affected areas where traditional terrestrial networks are unavailable or compromised. "BlueBird 6 is a breakthrough moment for AST SpaceMobile," said Abel Avellan, Founder, Chairman, and CEO of AST SpaceMobile. "This launch validates years of U.S. innovation and American manufacturing, executed by our team and marks the transition to scaled deployment." The company plans to launch 45-60 satellites by the end of 2026, with missions scheduled every one to two months on average, as it builds out global coverage for its network of over 50 mobile operator partners representing nearly 3 billion subscribers combined. AST SpaceMobile maintains partnerships with major carriers including AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone, Rakuten, Google, American Tower, Bell, and stc Group, while operating nearly 500,000 square feet of manufacturing facilities worldwide supported by over 1,800 employees. Rocket Lab Corporation (NASDQ: RKLB) concluded 2025 with its 21st successful Electron launch of the year, achieving 100% mission success while deploying the QPS-SAR-15 synthetic aperture radar satellite for Japan-based Earth imaging company Institute for Q-shu Pioneers of Space (iQPS). The December 21st mission from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand adds critical imaging capabilities to iQPS' constellation, which provides near-real-time surveillance imagery across twelve different orbits for customers requiring persistent Earth observation for security and defense applications. The record-setting performance cements Electron as both America's preeminent small launch provider and the world's most frequently-launched small-lift orbital rocket, demonstrating the reliability required for national security missions. "In 2026 we're expanding Electron's global reach with more multi-launch constellation deployments, dedicated missions for domestic civil space and international space agencies in Japan and Europe, and both suborbital and orbital launches with defense applications for hypersonic technology and national security," said Sir Peter Beck, Founder and CEO of Rocket Lab. "Our new record of annual launches and the breadth of upcoming missions goes to show how much of a global impact Electron continues to have on the space industry." Rocket Lab has completed seven satellite deployments for iQPS to date, making Electron the primary launcher for the constellation, with five additional missions scheduled beginning in 2026. The company's 79 total Electron missions have established the platform as essential infrastructure for defense customers requiring rapid, reliable access to space for surveillance, communications, and emerging hypersonic test applications. L3Harris Technologies (NYSE: LHX) recently received a letter of intent from Kratos Defense & Security Solutions (NASDAQ: KTOS) for a commercial contract to produce 60 Zeus hypersonic motors, representing a more than 50% increase in L3Harris' annual production rate for these advanced propulsion systems. The Zeus motors support U.S. Department of Defense customers conducting critical hypersonic vehicle and ballistic missile defense testing, including programs such as the Multi-Service Advanced Capability Hypersonic Test Bed, following successful development and flight testing of both Zeus 1 and 2 motor variants by Kratos. The expanded production addresses accelerating demand for hypersonic test capabilities as the Pentagon, National Science Foundation, and U.S. Congress pursue development of hypersonic systems to counter advanced threats from strategic competitors. "We are pleased to continue working with Kratos and to support significant production increases for the Zeus advanced large solid rocket motors," said Ken Bedingfield, President of Aerojet Rocketdyne at L3Harris. "By incorporating cutting-edge propulsion technology and delivering unmatched performance, these motors meet the rigorous demands of today's missions while scaling for the challenges of tomorrow." The Zeus motors replace legacy suborbital rocket motors in fit and form while delivering increased performance when integrated with existing test infrastructure and vehicle designs, enabling faster iteration cycles for hypersonic weapons development without requiring costly ground infrastructure modifications. L3Harris designs the motors at its Huntsville, Alabama facility to Kratos specifications and manufactures them at the company's nearly 2,000-acre energetics campus in Camden, Arkansas, where it produces more than 115,000 solid rocket motors annually—from palm-sized units to systems the size of an SUV. The production expansion comes as both Russia and China field operational hypersonic vehicles, with the Pentagon publicly committing $4.7 billion for hypersonic research in 2023 according to Congressional Research Service reporting, underscoring the strategic importance of domestic hypersonic test capabilities for maintaining U.S. technological superiority.

L3Harris Technologies (NYSE: LHX) recently received a letter of intent from Kratos Defense & Security Solutions (NASDAQ: KTOS) for a commercial contract to produce 60 Zeus hypersonic motors, representing a more than 50% increase in L3Harris' annual production rate for these advanced propulsion systems. The Zeus motors support U.S. Department of Defense customers conducting critical hypersonic vehicle and ballistic missile defense testing, including programs such as the Multi-Service Advanced Capability Hypersonic Test Bed, following successful development and flight testing of both Zeus 1 and 2 motor variants by Kratos. The expanded production addresses accelerating demand for hypersonic test capabilities as the Pentagon, National Science Foundation, and U.S. Congress pursue development of hypersonic systems to counter advanced threats from strategic competitors. "We are pleased to continue working with Kratos and to support significant production increases for the Zeus advanced large solid rocket motors," said Ken Bedingfield, President of Aerojet Rocketdyne at L3Harris. "By incorporating cutting-edge propulsion technology and delivering unmatched performance, these motors meet the rigorous demands of today's missions while scaling for the challenges of tomorrow." The Zeus motors replace legacy suborbital rocket motors in fit and form while delivering increased performance when integrated with existing test infrastructure and vehicle designs, enabling faster iteration cycles for hypersonic weapons development without requiring costly ground infrastructure modifications. L3Harris designs the motors at its Huntsville, Alabama facility to Kratos specifications and manufactures them at the company's nearly 2,000-acre energetics campus in Camden, Arkansas, where it produces more than 115,000 solid rocket motors annually—from palm-sized units to systems the size of an SUV. The production expansion comes as both Russia and China field operational hypersonic vehicles, with the Pentagon publicly committing $4.7 billion for hypersonic research in 2023 according to Congressional Research Service reporting, underscoring the strategic importance of domestic hypersonic test capabilities for maintaining U.S. technological superiority.

(NASDAQ: BMNR) today announced the release of a new Chairman's message (link) outlining why shareholders are being asked to vote YES on a proposal to increase the Company's authorized shares. The message is now available on the Bitmine website and is intended to provide additional context ahead of the upcoming shareholder vote. The voting deadline is January 14, 2026 at 11:59 p.m. ET. In the video, Chairman Tom Lee explains the rationale behind Proposal 2, which seeks shareholder approval to amend the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase authorized shares from 500 million to 50 billion. There are three reasons the Company needs to increase authorized shares: Since pivoting in July to make Ethereum (ETH) its primary treasury asset, Bitmine has observed that its share price has closely tracked movements in ETH. *Coefficient (per Bloomberg) is 0.015 ETH price plus accretion of ETH/share The scatter chart in the gallery above shows the clear linkage (x-axis is ETH, y-axis is BMNR). The Company believes Ethereum represents the future of finance, a supercycle driven by Wall Street reengineering on the blockchain. Major industry leaders agree, including Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, who said that tokenization is the next evolution of global markets. And the vast majority of tokenization is happening on Ethereum. Previously, Bitmine noted its view that tokenization will drive ETH/BTC to reach all-time highs (0.0873). This implies future ETH prices of: These potential future ETH prices can be used to calculate "implied" future BMNR prices** **These are using the coefficient 0.15* ETH plus assumed accretion ETH/share of 33%. These are for illustrative purposes only. Not a forecast. To keep shares "accessible" to the public, the Company would want to split the shares, to reset the share price back towards $25. If BMNR shares are: These splits will increase total shares outstanding. Thus, Bitmine can only split shares in the future if the total authorized shares is increased. Shareholders are encouraged to review the Chairman's message and vote prior to the January 14, 2026 deadline and are welcome to attend the annual meeting on January 15, 2026, at the Wynn Las Vegas.

Title: Tom Lee urges BitMine shareholders to approve share increase ahead of January 14 vote
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2026/01/02/tom-lee-urges-bitmine-shareholders-to-approve-share-increase-ahead-of-jan-14-vote
Time Published: 2026-01-02T17:12:25Z
Full Content:
Tom Lee, chairman of ether ETH$3,217.93 treasury firm BitMine Immersion (BMNR), urged shareholders to approve a board proposal for a sharp increase in the company's authorized share count. In a start-of-the-year message, Lee said the proposal to boost the company's number of shares to 50 billion from 500 million is not a precursor to a move to "dilute" shareholders. “[This]t doesn’t mean we’re issuing 50 billion shares. That’s what we want the total max shares to be,” Lee said. Acknowledging that a higher share count does make it easier to enable the company to raise capital, Lee reminded that it also allows BitMine to pursue opportunistic dealmaking and — most importantly, according to Lee — accommodate future share splits. Lee argued that BitMine’s share price has increasingly tracked ether since the company pivoted last year to make ETH its primary treasury asset. If ether's price rises over the years as he expects — as high as $250,000 if bitcoin reaches $1 million — splits will be necessary to keep shares "accessible" to the public. Lee framed the proposal within a broader thesis that Ethereum will play a central role in Wall Street’s push toward tokenized financial markets, pointing to public comments by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink about blockchain-based market infrastructure. Lee has separately said he has been accumulating ether personally, aligning his macro view with BitMine’s treasury strategy. Lee reminded shareholders that they have until Jan. 14 to vote on the proposal, with BitMine’s annual shareholder meeting scheduled for Jan. 15 in Las Vegas.

Title: 30 hidden gems from 2025 to grab before the Steam Winter Sale ends

Time Published: 2026-01-02T17:01:00Z
Full Content:
2025 was an overwhelming year. Let's savor those positives in unlikely places. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. With each passing year, the PC gaming scene grows increasingly fragmented. More games are released, and on average they're better, too. There's just not enough time to cover them all, and 2025 was packed with gems you probably haven't heard of. For those willing to go just a little off the beaten path, the current Steam Winter Sale looks like a never-ending bounty of undersold treasures. So here's a carefully curated selection of 15 of my favorites to consider during the last couple days of sales season. Here are the rules I'm narrowing things down with: Since the year was so densely packed, I'm annoying the editors by slipping in a thematically related (but less beholden to the rules) alternative to each pick, for 30 games total. As ever, shout out your favourites, or comment if I helped you find something that made your heart sing. Let's go! Price: $21 / £17.50 (30% off) | Developer: Siris Pendrake A stunning testament to what a (mostly) solo developer can do with a modern engine and some stock asset packs. Still in early access, but already a very polished, lengthy and non-linear STALKER-inspired shooter with a funky setting. Mankind is effectively extinct. Lizard-people (which you're one of) have inherited the ruins of our civilization, and ancient fae magics leak in through the cracks of reality, as if rogue super-science wasn't enough. Project Silverfish feels like a pared-down, greased-up version of STALKER. Faster, twitchier, impressively polished (at the expense of some detail), able to run great on even lower-spec machines and requiring less fiddling around between sorties. Expect to be thrown into messy multi-faction battles right off the bat with loads of loot, getting you into deeper expeditions early. Alternatively: ADACA (50% off) - The previous game from the same developer, and effectively two games in one: A Half-Life 2/Halo-inspired story campaign and a STALKER-lite sandbox. Both surprisingly slick (and officially finished as of 2024), but Silverfish's open world & systems are on another level. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Price: $14 / £11.72 (30% off) | Developer: Figburn & Melon Hands up if you've still got a special place in your heart for Flash-era gaming, specifically Newgrounds. Contract Rush DX is a game forged in those familiar fires. It's a little bit Mega Man, a little bit Contra and more than a dash of Alien Hominid, all held together with globs of slick vectorized cartoon animation, unrealistic hyperviolence and goofy humor. They don't often make them like this anymore. Contract Rush DX doesn't rest on its nostalgic laurels though. There's a beefy, smart platformer here, with its main levels playable in any order and each with a distinct feel and mechanical twist. Recruit new characters to access extra areas or tackle bonus side-missions and work your way closer to the lore-laden reveals of the game's well-hidden True Ending. Alternatively: Seafrog (50% off) - Another platforming gem that fell between the cracks, now refreshed and under a new publisher's banner. A slick, high-technique blend of traditional platforming and Tony Hawk style skating, with big rewards for chaining long trick combos, giving every stage real replay value. Price: $12 / £10.05 (40% off) | Developer: LimboLane Not just a hidden gem, but one of my favourites of 2025. You're a Godpoke, wrangler of deities, sent to help put the bickering gods of this bizarre cartoon world back on the straight-and-narrow to avert the apocalypse. A refreshing take on the point-and-click adventure, as rather than hoard every item you find, you make up for your own quiet nature by using your suck 'n' blow megaphone to steal phrases from characters' dialogue and deploying them elsewhere as potential solutions. Or just to goof around. As with LimboLane's previous Smile For Me, this is an entire world of Weird Little Guys, even the cosmically huge gods. Everyone's at least a little bit of a freak, but they're all weirdly lovable. Especially the chaotically helpful 'bizzyboys' gang, the solution to and source of half the game's problems, and frequently featured in some deeply strange FMV puppet-show segments. Alternatively: Kulebra and the Souls of Limbo (40% off) - another offbeat adventure about hanging out with weird little guys of myth and legend. This time you're a snake-spirit in the Latin-American afterlife, trying to puzzle out how to break the eternal day-long loop that the dead are trapped in. Heartfelt, bittersweet and frequently funny. Price: $14 / £11.72 (30% off) | Developer: 13AM Games, Mighty Yell If you were to make a new Missile Command game, what kind of game would it be? Probably not 'Teen drama escape-room with tactical hex-based strategy'. This bizarre hybrid hasn't sold well at all, but it's a shockingly good and engaging time. Four teens set out to explore an abandoned cold war bunker, only to find themselves wrapped up in an escalating crisis necessitating a lot of point-and-click style puzzling and some almost Into The Breach-esque defensive turn-based battling. The combat involves planning moves two or three steps ahead, saving resources by catching multiple incoming missiles in chaining explosions, just like the old arcade game. The two halves dovetail nicely, using smaller defensive battle simulations as puzzle elements, while the larger, higher-stakes battles can dig into your stock of missile launch keycards that you scavenge from the dusty corners of the adventuring puzzle rooms, making resource conservation all the more vital. Tense and smart. Alternatively: Is This Game Trying To Kill Me? (50% off) - Another genre-hopping escape room adventure, although this one feels heavily inspired by Inscryption, as you explore a haunted videogame and the videogames within that videogame while being tormented by the (weirdly affable) entity lurking outside the rain-slick cabin window. Fun, goofy meta-narrative puzzling. Price: $6 / £5.10 (40% off) | Developer: Bubby Darkstar Shooty is our best, last line of defence against a possible robot invasion. Her crack team of robot-hunting pals are goofing off at the beach today. She doesn't have any clean clothes so she's requisitioning her commander's trousers today. Oh, and the robots are finally invading, but they don't seem to be especially threatening so you can just take your time and do some errands around town. Nobody seems too threatened. Shooty Shooty Robot Invasion feels like playing a webcomic. A particularly raucous, bright and chaotic one. Perhaps I'm just weird, but it's one of the funniest games I've played this past year, only really beaten out by Skin Deep. It's 70% exploring and meeting weird people and helping them with their daily problems, 30% light FPS combat as you blast robots using your special high-tech anti-robot bullets that only hurt machines. It's a surprisingly full package as well, clocking in at ~8 hours of shenanigans. Longer, if you're hunting for each mini open world level's secret sidequests. Alternatively: Fragrance Point (50% off) - Another 'Goofing around with weirdos' adventure, with a great rendercore aesthetic and an esoteric sci-fi spin. You're a new being, constructed to complete a very specific mission that you never got told because you accidentally blew up the tutorial by spitting lipstick everywhere. But hey, this space station seems to be a 24/7 party zone, so just go with the flow! Price: $18 / £15 (40% off) | Developer: Blue Banshee In a fit of spectacularly unfortunate timing, Maliki: Poison Of The Past was an offbeat take on the JRPG formula by a French studio released just two days before Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. It's arguably even more French, being based on a very long-running anime-tinged francophone webcomic, although no knowledge of the source material is needed to enjoy this standalone time-travelling adventure in high-intensity gardening. There is a lot going on here. Traditional turn-based RPG combat (with some timeline shenanigans); time-manipulating puzzles reminiscent of Zelda, with each party member bringing a new puzzle-solving power to the mix; even some low-impact farming between sorties across the timeline on your quest to stop the titular Poison, an evil plant-entity spreading its roots across space and time. It would be easy to draw comparisons to Chrono Trigger, but this one is a rich enough mix of inspirations to feel like its own thing. Alternatively: Wander Stars (33% off) - Another offbeat take on classic JRPG tropes, this time from Venezuela, and paying more than a little tribute to Akira Toriyama's wacky world of pint-sized martial artists and screwball comedy. Gorgeous art, simple, fight-heavy progression and creative combat where you collect a deck of words to chain into increasingly silly attack names to yell at full volume. Price: $10.50 / £7 (30% off) | Developer: Woodhound I've always had a soft spot for free-flying PSX-era shooter Forsaken, a faster, louder version of Descent. Despite an excellent (and cheap!) Nightdive remaster, it seemed doomed to fall into obscurity. But tiny studio Woodhound seems to hold a special torch for it too, releasing this roguelike tribute out of early access in 2025. It looks, sounds and plays almost exactly like Forsaken, right down to the intentionally blurry 'early 3D accelerator' textures and overbearing colored lighting, but now with near endless replay value and online co-op support. While Desecrators might lose something by not having hand-crafted levels, it does a very good job of procedurally generating labyrinthine mazes of tunnels, chambers and combat zones to blast through, punctuated with botmatch-style 'invasions' by rival treasure-hunters. It's still growing, too, with new enemies and environments added in a recent update, along with tentative VR support for those with strong stomachs. Alternatively: BRAZILIAN DRUG DEALER 3: I OPENED A PORTAL TO HELL IN THE FAVELA TRYING TO REVIVE MIT AIA I NEED TO CLOSE IT (30% off) - Another very singular tribute, although more of a deep cut. A tongue-in-cheek dive into the world of Brazil's early modding and game-dev scene, filled with in-jokes weirdness and an AMAZING title. But even taken purely on face value, it's a fun shooter running on the original Quake engine. Price: $3 / £2.55 (70% off) | Developer: Leafy Games Short, sweet and low-impact. At three dollars, it's very easy to recommend Wyrmhall, a game about being a funny little goblin running an artifact-cleaning stall in the middle of an interdimensional nexus. Weirdos from across the multiverse wander in, show you their cool (but all gunked up) cursed/blessed/incredibly dangerous doodads, chatting with you as you delouse, scrub and polish them up. The artifacts, not the clients. Although sometimes they're one and the same. Clocking in at just a couple hours long (with no shortage of twists and turns), this isn't an intense or complex game, but it is extremely funny, like playing through an extended Adventure Time skit full of gloriously wacky characters and some fun dialogue options that let you embrace your inner goblin. A good reminder that 'cozy' gaming doesn't just have to be about repackaged farming lifestyle fantasies. Sometimes you just wanna go Goblin Mode. Alternatively: Trash Goblin (40% off) - Would you believe that 2025 had TWO games about being a funny little goblin that cleans up strange artifacts? Trash Goblin is a bit less funny, but more technical, involved and mechanically engaging, using a lot more tools and upcycling to make your own goodies. Hell of a coincidence for lightning to strike twice. Price: $14 / £11.72 (30% off) | Developer: Pocket Trap It's a common lament that Nintendo has little interest in 'traditional' Zelda games now, favoring open world grandiosity over the classic NES and SNES-era format. Fortunately indies have you covered, and few do it as well as Pipistrello. The bones are solid—all the dungeon-crawling, puzzle-solving action you'd expect, fleshed out with a funky modern urban setting populated by rough-edged (but adorable) graffiti-styled critters, and with a few modern ideas like buying character upgrades on credit and paying them off over time. The star of the show is the titular Cursed Yoyo. Weapon, mobility gadget, multifunctional puzzle-solving tool and just fun to show off with, you'll be collecting new tricks for it all game long and each one opens up interesting new paths, making revisiting older areas engaging. Use slanted blocks to hit entire rooms with one spin, slam it against walls to launch yourself backwards over pits, and bypass obstacles by dragging yourself along using its string. It's just a joy to use. Alternatively: Zefyr: A Thief's Melody (75% off) - 'Retro' extends well into the Gamecube era these days, and if you're after something a little more Wind Waker-inspired, Zefyr is an excellent PC alternative. The work of a solo developer over the course of twelve years, this one's a satisfying piratical fantasy adventure with some great puzzle-laden dungeons. Price: $7 / £5.95 (30% off) | Developer: Brenton Wildes Loathe as I am to utter the word 'Metroidbrainia', it feels appropriate here. Lingo 2 is a brilliantly smart word puzzle adventure through a minimalist, Minecraft-esque block labyrinth where you interact with the world by typing letters into terminals. Simple. Except that you have to unlock one letter at a time like Metroid upgrades, and the phrase-and-response puzzles get painfully smart, fast. Sometimes you're looking for a word of the inverse meaning, or an anagram, or a palindrome, or a synonym, or a chain of words that connect several terminals together. The deeper you get, the more puzzles become available, and the more complex the world becomes, with secrets, hidden paths and optional areas seemingly everywhere with puzzles both spatial and lexical. My only gripe is that the game can be a bit US-centric, with some puzzles referring to specific American brands or idioms, but I never found it too egregious. The original Lingo is also discounted, and has its own set of puzzle mechanics so you can play them in any order. Alternatively: Rules & Rodents (40% off) - On the other end of the puzzle scale is Rules & Rodents, which is entirely wordless. A cute little mouse plots a cheese heist/escape armed with a magical scroll that holds pictograms that enable or disable specific gameplay rules controlling both you and the adorably animated rat guards. Just a few hours long, but feels perfectly paced with a surprisingly dramatic finale. Price: $10 / £8.37 (50% off) | Developer: Erlend Kirkeboe, Kay Arne Kirkeboe You can't go 10 minutes without bumping into a Slay the Spire-inspired deckbuilder these days, but few have the scribbly, grimy vision of Skogdal. Set in small-town '90s Norway, you'll be making your way through the streets battling an assortment of meatheads, weirdos and wildlife, all rendered in lumpen pencil-sketch comic style. There's a bit of Beavis and Butthead energy here as your crew of weird losers clash with retro pop culture seen through a uniquely Nordic lens. While each playable character brings their own gimmicks to the table, there's a big focus here on summoning friends into battle, who add their own cards to your deck and often add activatable powers to your party. While run-based, there's an increasingly weird story that unfurls as you complete runs, unlocking new characters (including a knock-off Norwegian Steven Segal) and new routes through the region. Not being Norwegian, some of the gags flew over my head, but most of them feel universal enough to land. Alternatively: Crown Gambit (40% off) - The latest from the team behind previous hidden gem Aetheris. A gorgeously illustrated twist on the card-battler format, split about 50/50 between visual novel-ish gothic knightly intrigue (with multi-choice dialogues) and party-based strategic battles. The two halves interplay, with the size and shape of the combat play-field shifting to reflect the prose. Price: $7.79 / £6.50 (35% off) | Developer: Fami Rough-edged, low-fi and abrasive in style, Schism feels like the kind of game I devoured in my youth. The kind of vaguely punk design that ruled in the late DOS shareware era. Under the intentionally rough aesthetic lies a very smart, experimental take on Binding of Isaac-esque action roguelike shootery. Weird creatures, weird characters, and even weirder item synergies (thoughtfully evolved as this game stewed in early access) make this one refreshing to chew on even if you're played a bunch of Games Like These. Schism isn't afraid to mentally overwhelm the player. Outside of the one small concession of pausing time as you enter a new room (letting you plan your initial movement before all hell breaks looks), there's some Ikaruga-inspired polarity switching mechanics, letting you negate red or blue bullets. You'd think that'd make things easier, but it just gives the game an excuse to blanket the screen with projectiles. Intense fun. Alternatively: Rift Wizard 2 (50% off) - Another low-fi roguelike, but more traditional in design. Positively archaic, even. Rift Wizard 2 feels most closely related to Chaos, an early cast-em-up by X-Com designer Julian Gollop. Rather than crawl through mazes for loot, each floor is a complex, open turn-based tactical battle demanding you use all your spells and summons. Price: $17.50 / £14.69 (30% off) | Developer: Dreamotion Inc. One of the higher-budget games here, released just a couple months ago. A silly but often heartstring-tugging, genre-hopping adventure about a corgi deciding to leave Dog Heaven after catching the distant scent of their human. Antics ensue, rainbow bridges are surfed across, adventures through the afterlife are had and not a single chance is missed to squeeze Big Feels out of the audience. As you might imagine it's not especially challenging stuff, but there's enough variety across the adventure (including a bunch of minigames and light challenges) to keep you engaged and paying attention. Long enough to keep eyes on the screen so you don't miss any of its gorgeously animated cutscenes, bridged with hand-drawn art. There's a real understanding here of how dogs move, especially the inherent wigglyness of short-legged friends like corgis, which means if you've ever had or lost a fuzzy little friend in your life, this one is going to hurt. Alternatively: Koira (50% off) - A surprisingly similar adventure, this one with a silhouetted, storybook aesthetic. A hermit and their dog enjoy life and nature in the mountains, interacting with wildlife, communing with the spirits and absolutely not getting into any life-or-death ordeals or supernatural goings on. Needless to say, the dog is also very good. They all are. Price: $7 / £5.95 (30% off) | Developer: Last Piscean A fantastically smart piece of sci-fi narrative experimentation. After the end of the world, three children discover a time machine. Perhaps the present can be rewritten, but the problem is that you can only send one person back at a time, with a single standing order and maybe one item, and they're going to have to spend a decade in that era before returning to base and reporting in, perhaps bringing back an item with them. Every choice is to be agonized over. The time spent in the past changes your trio. Personalities and statistics warp over time. Piecing together the origins of the apocalypse is just the first part of the puzzle, with over 20 possible endings depending on what factions you nudge or nurture, who you choose to assassinate and which child you choose for each expedition to the past. For a game presented almost entirely in (thoughtfully written) text and low-fi monochrome art, Decade is powerfully evocative. Alternatively: No Time (35% off) - If you want your time travel a little less esoteric and more tangible, this Back To The Future-inspired sandbox immersive sim has been in early access since 2019, and just recently added the final mission in its main story arc, though there's plenty yet to come. Price: $2.50 / £2.14 (50% off) | Developer: Jack Morehart 2025 was mostly a year for playing it safe in the strategy genre. DLCs, familiar genres, remasters and revivals. Kiloton is the sicko pick (I did say fewer, not none)—a minimalist, fast-paced simulation that feels like something lifted straight out of Wargames. The only winning game might be not to play, but playing with nukes can still be pretty fun. It's a lightweight geopolitical sim where you're ideally trying to avoid conflict, but every country is automatically jostling for position, with armies drawn to where there's any gap in defences. Diplomacy IS an option, but might just be denying the inevitable, and matches play out in a matter of minutes. What makes this game especially for sickos is that you play it entirely with the keyboard, with typed menu commands and simple menus navigated with the arrow keys, your clicking keypresses echoed in the game's own soundscape. Great for building tension, and will keep your hands moving quickly as things spiral out of control. Alternatively: Chip n' Clawz vs The Brainioids (30% off) - Would you believe that the creator of X-Com released a new strategy game for 2025, and it totally flew under the radar? A cartoon action-strategy game (a bit like Brutal Legend) playable the whole way through in split-screen co-op or via Friend Pass. A great way to introduce kids to the genre, and not too shabby even for veterans. And that's it for 2025. It wasn't an intentional theme, but there sure were a lot of games about terrifying apocalypses and hanging out with Weird Little Guys, weren't there? Let's avoid the former, and hang on to the latter in 2026. At least the videogames will be good, eh? Once again, I hope I've helped broaden your horizons a little, and maybe introduced you to a game or two to love. As always, check out my previous roundups below (and maybe even my Steam curator page, where everything I enjoy goes), as almost everything from previous sales is back again at even steeper discounts, and still as good as ever: Until next time, and happy new year! The product of a wasted youth, wasted prime and getting into wasted middle age, Dominic Tarason is a freelance writer, occasional indie PR guy and professional techno-hermit seen in many strange corners of the internet and seldom in reality. Based deep in the Welsh hinterlands where no food delivery dares to go, videogames provide a gritty, realistic escape from the idyllic views and fresh country air.

Title: Unemployment in Berkshire County rises to four-year high as job growth slows

Reporter Nursing students at Berkshire Community College use a simulator to stabilize a computer-controlled patient in 2022. Local workforce experts say there is a growing gap between the health care industry's needs and finding skilled workers. Training programs, like the one at BCC, are working to fill that need. Berkshire County’s unemployment rate climbed to 4 percent in September, the highest level the region has seen in four years. But even as unemployment rises, the labor market remains tight. Local employers are grappling with skill shortages, AI-driven hiring changes and evolving worker expectations — trends reflected across the U.S. as job growth slows and companies become more cautious. “We have had some layoffs in the area, but we are not seeing a big uptick in candidates coming in the door looking for work, so that’s kind of interesting,” said Guin Griswold, director of employment services at Molari Employment and Healthcare Services in Pittsfield. Maricelli Serrano of MassHire meets job applicants at a job fair in 2019. The MassHire Berkshire Career Center is a partnership between the Berkshire Training & Employment Program and the Massachusetts Division of Career Services. National job growth has also slowed in recent months. Federal data showed job losses in October followed by modest gains in November, pushing the national unemployment rate to 4.6 percent — its highest level since 2021. Tariffs, increases in wages and the impact of AI have stalled hiring momentum as companies like Amazon, Verizon, UPS and General Motors have announced job cuts. After 5 percent growth from 2019 to 2024, job growth slowed in 2025, said Heather Boulger, executive director of the MassHire Berkshire Workforce Board, a local organization that helps people find jobs. In September, 63,812 people were in the Berkshire County labor force, with 61,260 employed and 2,552 collecting unemployment insurance, according to data provided by Boulger. The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the week ending Dec. 13 rose to 1.92 million, according to ABC News. The 4 percent unemployment rate in the Berkshires was close to the Massachusetts rate of 4.7 percent, and in September 2024, the county's unemployment rate was 3.4 percent. The last time Berkshire County's unemployment rate was over 4 percent was in 2021 (4.9 percent), and the highest this decade was 9.4 percent in 2020. “It’s pretty comparable, and anything under 5 percent unemployment is considered full employment, which means that there are job opportunities for people who are looking, and it’s still keeping the economy going,” Boulger said. Some level of unemployment is natural, Boulger said, adding that “a small amount of unemployment allows companies to hire and prevents labor shortages.” Boulger, who has been working in the field for almost 35 years, said that the workforce goes through ebbs and flows. She added that Massachusetts has stable labor participation and fairly strong economic conditions, but did cite recent job losses in retail, manufacturing and food service sectors. Guin Griswold, director of employment services at Molari Employment and Healthcare Services in Pittsfield, said that while AI is changing the hiring process, it is not yet being used locally to substitute for actual workers. Griswold said that she has seen a slowdown in the job market and that some people are passively looking for work — meaning they are currently employed and not necessarily applying for jobs, but are keeping an eye out for a better fit or their next opportunity. She added that toward the end of the year, a lot of people get hired for companies they were temping at, as companies want to meet certain numbers by the end of the year. Boulger said the pandemic reset the economy at all levels, impacting every industry and changing workforce dynamics. In the past five years, the Berkshires have lost about 2,000 people in the labor force, she said, adding that many job seekers want more virtual or remote opportunities. “I think job seekers have a different expectation than they did five years ago,” Boulger said. Boulger said that challenges facing the workforce include job growth, AI integration, skill gaps, worker well-being and workplace culture. A population decrease has also impacted the workforce as 22- to 45-year-olds are migrating out of the region. There are more than 3,000 jobs currently open in the area, Boulger said, adding that businesses are struggling to find skilled workers. The MassHire Career Center and Workforce Board are working to develop training programs and career pathways to get people the skills they need to fill those gaps. Artificial intelligence has also changed the hiring process in the region. Boulger said that most candidates are adapting to get noticed in the initial job screening process, and MassHire is helping people prepare their resumes. “It seems like a very impersonal process,” she said. “A lot of our employers are still using AI to help prescreen candidates." In the Berkshires, the largest and fastest-growing employer is health care and social assistance, Boulger said. She also highlighted educational services, retail trade, accommodations, manufacturing and the food service industry. Molari Employment and Healthcare Services office in Pittsfield works to recruit home health care providers and connect them with clients. Griswold said that direct care workers are always in demand, something she deals with firsthand with Molari’s home care agency and its clients. “We could bring [10 direct care workers] in tomorrow, and we’d have them all placed by next week,” she said of the agency that has been in business since 1983 staffing and recruiting home health care providers. Helping younger workers find jobs is also a priority, as unemployment in that age group has risen. In November, the national unemployment rate for 16- to 24-year-olds climbed to 10.6 percent, the highest since 2021, according to CNN. Boulger said that MassHire has internship programs at the high school and college level, along with programs for young adults that connect them to career pathways in health care, manufacturing, clean energy and education. Even with unemployment ticking up, workforce leaders say the region’s challenge is less about job availability than ensuring workers have the skills — and expectations — to meet a changing economy.

Its revenue, profitability, and cash reserves have skyrocketed since the introduction of ChatGPT over three years ago — and the many competitive generative AI services that have launched since. Its stock price has soared, making it a $4.6 trillion market cap company. The world’s leading high-performance GPU maker has used its ballooning fortunes to significantly increase investments in startups, particularly in AI. Nvidia has participated in nearly 67 venture capital deals in 2025, surpassing the 54 deals the company completed in all of 2024, according to PitchBook data. Note that these investments exclude those made by its formal corporate VC fund, NVentures, which also significantly increased its investment pace over that period. (PitchBook says NVentures engaged in 30 deals this year, compared to just one in 2022.) Nvidia has stated that the goal of its corporate investing is to expand the AI ecosystem by backing startups it considers to be “game changers and market makers.” Below is a list of startups that raised rounds exceeding $100 million since 2023 where Nvidia is a named participant, organized from the highest to lowest amount raised in the round. This list shows just how far and wide Nvidia has spread its tentacles in the tech industry, beyond supplying its products. OpenAI: Nvidia backed the ChatGPT maker for the first time in October 2024, reportedly writing a $100 million check as part of a colossal $6.6 billion round that valued the company at $157 billion. The chipmaker’s investment was dwarfed by OpenAI’s other backers, notably Thrive, which invested $1.3 billion according to The New York Times. While PitchBook data indicates Nvidia did not participate in OpenAI’s $40 billion funding round that closed in March, the company announced in September that it would invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI over time, structured as a strategic partnership to deploy massive AI infrastructure. Nvidia later revealed in its quarterly filings that it might not follow through, stating, “There is no assurance that any investment will be completed on expected terms, if at all.” Anthropic: In November 2025, Nvidia made its first direct investment in the AI lab, committing up to $10 billion as part of a strategic round that included a $5 billion check from Microsoft. In a “circular” spending agreement, Anthropic committed to spending $30 billion on Microsoft Azure compute capacity, as well as buy Nvidia’s future Grace Blackwell and Vera Rubin systems. Cursor: In November, Nvidia made its first strategic investment in the AI-powered code assistant participating in a massive $2.3 billion Series D round co-led by Accel and Coatue. The deal valued Cursor at $29.3 billion, a nearly 15-fold increase since the start of the year. While Nvidia has long been an enterprise customer, the round marked its official entry as a shareholder alongside Google. xAI: In 2024, OpenAI tried to persuade its investors not to invest in any of its rivals. But Nvidia participated in the $6 billion round of Elon Musk’s xAI last December anyway. Nvidia will also invest up to $2 billion in the equity portion of xAI’s planned $20 billion funding round, Bloomberg reported, a deal structured to help xAI purchase more Nvidia gear. Mistral AI: Nvidia invested in Mistral for the third time when the French-based large language model (LLM) developer raised a €1.7 billion (about $2 billion) Series C at a €11.7billion ($13.5 billion) post-money valuation in September. Reflection AI: In October, Nvidia was one of the most significant investors in Reflection AI, contributing to a $2 billion funding round that valued the one-year-old startup at $8 billion. Reflection AI is positioning itself as a U.S.-based competitor to Chinese DeepSeek, whose open source LLM offers a less-expensive alternative to closed source models from companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic. Thinking Machines Lab: Nvidia was among a long list of investors who backed former OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab’s $2 billion seed round. The funding, which was formally announced in July, valued the new AI startup at $12 billion. Inflection: One of Nvidia’s first significant AI investments also had one of the more unusual (but increasingly common) outcomes. In June 2023, Nvidia was one of several lead investors in Inflection’s $1.3 billion round, a company co-founded by Mustafa Suleyman, the famed founder of DeepMind. Less than a year later, Microsoft hired Inflection’s founders, paying $620 million for a non-exclusive technology license, leaving the company with a significantly diminished workforce and a less defined future. Crusoe: In October, the chipmaker participated in a $1.4 billion Series E round that valued the AI data center developer at $10 billion. Nvidia first backed the company in late 2024 during its Series D. Crusoe is a key infrastructure partner for the ‘Stargate’ project, building massive data center campuses in Texas and Wyoming to be leased to Oracle specifically to power OpenAI’s workloads. Nscale: After the startup’s $1.1 billion round in September, Nvidia participated in Nscale’s $433 million SAFE funding in October. That’s a deal that secures future equity for investors. Nscale, which formed in 2023 after spinning out of Australian cryptocurrency mining company Arkon Energy, is building data centers in the U.K. and Norway for OpenAI’s Stargate project. Wayve: In May 2024, Nvidia participated in a $1.05 billion round for the U.K.-based startup, which is developing a self-learning system for autonomous driving. Nvidia is expected to invest an additional $500 million in Wayve, the startup told TechCrunch in September. Wayve is testing its vehicles in the U.K. and the San Francisco Bay Area. Figure AI: In September, Nvidia participated in Figure AI’s Series C funding round of over $1 billion, which valued the humanoid robotics startup at $39 billion. The chipmaker first invested in Figure in February 2024 when the company raised a $675 million Series B round at a $2.6 billion valuation. Scale AI: In May 2024, Nvidia joined Accel and other tech giants Amazon and Meta to invest $1 billion in Scale AI, which provides data-labeling services to companies for training AI models. The round valued the San Francisco-based company at nearly $14 billion. In June, Meta invested $14.3 billion for a 49% stake of Scale and hired away the company’s co-founder and CEO Alexandr Wang, as well as several other key Scale employees. Commonwealth Fusion: The chipmaker participated in the nuclear fusion-energy startup’s $863 million funding round in August. The deal, which also included investors like Google and Breakthrough Energy Ventures, valued the company at $3 billion. Cohere: The chipmaker has invested in enterprise LLM provider Cohere across multiple funding rounds, including the $500 million Series D, which closed in August, valuing Cohere at $6.8 billion. Nvidia first backed the Toronto-based startup in 2023. Perplexity: Nvidia first invested in Perplexity in November 2023 and has participated in most of the subsequent funding rounds of the AI search engine startup, including the $500 million round closed in December 2024. The chipmaker participated in the company’s July funding round, which valued Perplexity at $18 billion. However, Nvidia did not join the startup’s subsequent $200 million fundraise in September, which boosted the company’s valuation to $20 billion, according to PitchBook data. Poolside: In October 2024, the AI coding assistant startup Poolside announced it raised $500 million led by Bain Capital Ventures. Nvidia participated in the round, which valued the AI startup at $3 billion. Lambda: AI cloud provider Lambda, which provides services for model training, raised a $480 million Series D at a reported $2.5 billion valuation in February. The round was co-led by SGW and Andra Capital Lambda, and joined by Nvidia, ARK Invest, and others. A significant part of Lambda’s business involves renting servers powered by Nvidia’s GPUs. Black Forest Labs: Nvidia participated in a $300 million Series B for the German startup behind the “Flux” image generation models in December. The round, which was co-led by Salesforce Ventures and Anjney Midha (AMP) valued the company at $3.25 billion. CoreWeave: Although CoreWeave is no longer a startup, but a public company, Nvidia invested in GPU-cloud provider when it was still one, back in April 2023. That’s when CoreWeave raised $221 million in funding. Nvidia remains a significant shareholder. Together AI: In February, Nvidia participated in the $305 million Series B of this company, which offers cloud-based infrastructure for building AI models. The round valued Together AI at $3.3 billion and was co-led by Prosperity7, a Saudi Arabian venture firm, and General Catalyst. Nvidia backed the company for the first time in 2023. Firmus Technologies: In September, Firmus Technologies, the Singapore-based data center company, received an AU$330 million (approximately $215 million) in funding at an AU$1.85 billion ($1.2 billion) valuation from investors, including Nvidia. Firmus is developing an energy-efficient “AI factory” in Tasmania, an island state of Australia. The startup originally provided cooling technologies for Bitcoin mining. Uniphore: In October, Nvidia joined fellow tech giants AMD, Snowflake, and Databricks to lead a $260 million Series F round into this Business AI company. Uniphore’s multimodal platform helps enterprises automate complex workflows and deploy “AI agents” across customer service, sales, and marketing. Sakana AI: In September 2024, Nvidia invested in the Japan-based startup, which trains low-cost generative AI models using small datasets. The startup raised a massive Series A round of about $214 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion. Sakana raised another $135 million at a $2.65 billion valuation in November, but Nvidia didn’t participate in the round. Nuro: In August, Nvidia participated in a $203 million funding round for the self-driving delivery startup. The deal valued Nuro at $6 billion, a significant 30% drop from its peak at $8.6 billion valuation in 2021. Imbue: The AI research lab that claims to be developing AI systems that can reason and code raised a $200 million round in September 2023 from investors, including Nvidia, Astera Institute, and former Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt. Waabi: In June 2024, the autonomous trucking startup raised a $200 million Series B round co-led by existing investors Uber and Khosla Ventures. Other investors included Nvidia, Volvo Group Venture Capital, and Porsche Automobil Holding SE. Ayar Labs: In December 2024, Nvidia invested in the $155 million round of Ayar Labs, a company developing optical interconnects to improve AI compute and power efficiency. This was the third time Nvidia backed the startup. Kore.ai: The startup developing enterprise-focused AI chatbots raised $150 million in December of 2023. In addition to Nvidia, investors participating in the funding included FTV Capital, Vistara Growth, and Sweetwater Private Equity. Sandbox AQ: In April, Nvidia, alongside Google, BNP Paribas, and others, invested $150 million in Sandbox AQ, a startup developing large quantitative models (LQMs) for handling complex numerical analysis and statistical calculations. The investment increased Sandbox AQ’s Series E round to $450 million and the company’s valuation to $5.75 billion. Hippocratic AI: This startup, which is developing large language models for healthcare, announced in January that it raised a $141 million Series B at a valuation of $1.64 billion led by Kleiner Perkins. Nvidia participated in the round, along with returning investors Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, and others. The company claims that its AI solutions can handle non-diagnostic patient-facing tasks such as pre-operating procedures, remote patient monitoring, and appointment preparation. Hippocratic raised another $126 million at a valuation of $3.5 billion in November, but Nvidia didn’t participate in the round. Weka: In May 2024, Nvidia invested in a $140 million round for AI-native data management platform Weka. The round valued the Silicon Valley company at $1.6 billion. Runway: In April, Nvidia participated in Runway’s $308 million round, which was led by General Atlantic and valued the startup developing generative AI models for media production at $3.55 billion, according to PitchBook data. The chipmaker has been an investor in since 2023. Bright Machines: In June 2024, Nvidia participated in a $126 million Series C of Bright Machines, a smart robotics and AI-driven software startup. Enfabrica: In September 2023, Nvidia invested in networking chips designer Enfabrica’s $125 million Series B. The startup raised another $115 million in November 2024, but Nvidia didn’t participate in the round. In September, Nvidia reportedly spent over $900 million to hire Enfabrica’s CEO and staff while licensing its technology, in a deal structured as an “acquihire.” Reka AI: In July, AI research lab Reka raised $110 million in a round that included Snowflake and Nvidia. The deal tripled the startup’s valuation to over $1 billion, according to Bloomberg. This post was first published in January 2025.

Its revenue, profitability, and cash reserves have skyrocketed since the introduction of ChatGPT over three years ago — and the many competitive generative AI services that have launched since. Its stock price has soared, making it a $4.6 trillion market cap company. The world’s leading high-performance GPU maker has used its ballooning fortunes to significantly increase investments in startups, particularly in AI. Nvidia has participated in nearly 67 venture capital deals in 2025, surpassing the 54 deals the company completed in all of 2024, according to PitchBook data. Note that these investments exclude those made by its formal corporate VC fund, NVentures, which also significantly increased its investment pace over that period. (PitchBook says NVentures engaged in 30 deals this year, compared to just one in 2022.) Nvidia has stated that the goal of its corporate investing is to expand the AI ecosystem by backing startups it considers to be “game changers and market makers.” Below is a list of startups that raised rounds exceeding $100 million since 2023 where Nvidia is a named participant, organized from the highest to lowest amount raised in the round. This list shows just how far and wide Nvidia has spread its tentacles in the tech industry, beyond supplying its products. OpenAI: Nvidia backed the ChatGPT maker for the first time in October 2024, reportedly writing a $100 million check as part of a colossal $6.6 billion round that valued the company at $157 billion. The chipmaker’s investment was dwarfed by OpenAI’s other backers, notably Thrive, which invested $1.3 billion according to The New York Times. While PitchBook data indicates Nvidia did not participate in OpenAI’s $40 billion funding round that closed in March, the company announced in September that it would invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI over time, structured as a strategic partnership to deploy massive AI infrastructure. Nvidia later revealed in its quarterly filings that it might not follow through, stating, “There is no assurance that any investment will be completed on expected terms, if at all.” Anthropic: In November 2025, Nvidia made its first direct investment in the AI lab, committing up to $10 billion as part of a strategic round that included a $5 billion check from Microsoft. In a “circular” spending agreement, Anthropic committed to spending $30 billion on Microsoft Azure compute capacity, as well as buy Nvidia’s future Grace Blackwell and Vera Rubin systems. Cursor: In November, Nvidia made its first strategic investment in the AI-powered code assistant participating in a massive $2.3 billion Series D round co-led by Accel and Coatue. The deal valued Cursor at $29.3 billion, a nearly 15-fold increase since the start of the year. While Nvidia has long been an enterprise customer, the round marked its official entry as a shareholder alongside Google. xAI: In 2024, OpenAI tried to persuade its investors not to invest in any of its rivals. But Nvidia participated in the $6 billion round of Elon Musk’s xAI last December anyway. Nvidia will also invest up to $2 billion in the equity portion of xAI’s planned $20 billion funding round, Bloomberg reported, a deal structured to help xAI purchase more Nvidia gear. Mistral AI: Nvidia invested in Mistral for the third time when the French-based large language model (LLM) developer raised a €1.7 billion (about $2 billion) Series C at a €11.7billion ($13.5 billion) post-money valuation in September. Reflection AI: In October, Nvidia was one of the most significant investors in Reflection AI, contributing to a $2 billion funding round that valued the one-year-old startup at $8 billion. Reflection AI is positioning itself as a U.S.-based competitor to Chinese DeepSeek, whose open source LLM offers a less-expensive alternative to closed source models from companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic. Thinking Machines Lab: Nvidia was among a long list of investors who backed former OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab’s $2 billion seed round. The funding, which was formally announced in July, valued the new AI startup at $12 billion. Inflection: One of Nvidia’s first significant AI investments also had one of the more unusual (but increasingly common) outcomes. In June 2023, Nvidia was one of several lead investors in Inflection’s $1.3 billion round, a company co-founded by Mustafa Suleyman, the famed founder of DeepMind. Less than a year later, Microsoft hired Inflection’s founders, paying $620 million for a non-exclusive technology license, leaving the company with a significantly diminished workforce and a less defined future. Crusoe: In October, the chipmaker participated in a $1.4 billion Series E round that valued the AI data center developer at $10 billion. Nvidia first backed the company in late 2024 during its Series D. Crusoe is a key infrastructure partner for the ‘Stargate’ project, building massive data center campuses in Texas and Wyoming to be leased to Oracle specifically to power OpenAI’s workloads. Nscale: After the startup’s $1.1 billion round in September, Nvidia participated in Nscale’s $433 million SAFE funding in October. That’s a deal that secures future equity for investors. Nscale, which formed in 2023 after spinning out of Australian cryptocurrency mining company Arkon Energy, is building data centers in the U.K. and Norway for OpenAI’s Stargate project. Wayve: In May 2024, Nvidia participated in a $1.05 billion round for the U.K.-based startup, which is developing a self-learning system for autonomous driving. Nvidia is expected to invest an additional $500 million in Wayve, the startup told TechCrunch in September. Wayve is testing its vehicles in the U.K. and the San Francisco Bay Area. Figure AI: In September, Nvidia participated in Figure AI’s Series C funding round of over $1 billion, which valued the humanoid robotics startup at $39 billion. The chipmaker first invested in Figure in February 2024 when the company raised a $675 million Series B round at a $2.6 billion valuation. Scale AI: In May 2024, Nvidia joined Accel and other tech giants Amazon and Meta to invest $1 billion in Scale AI, which provides data-labeling services to companies for training AI models. The round valued the San Francisco-based company at nearly $14 billion. In June, Meta invested $14.3 billion for a 49% stake of Scale and hired away the company’s co-founder and CEO Alexandr Wang, as well as several other key Scale employees. Commonwealth Fusion: The chipmaker participated in the nuclear fusion-energy startup’s $863 million funding round in August. The deal, which also included investors like Google and Breakthrough Energy Ventures, valued the company at $3 billion. Cohere: The chipmaker has invested in enterprise LLM provider Cohere across multiple funding rounds, including the $500 million Series D, which closed in August, valuing Cohere at $6.8 billion. Nvidia first backed the Toronto-based startup in 2023. Perplexity: Nvidia first invested in Perplexity in November 2023 and has participated in most of the subsequent funding rounds of the AI search engine startup, including the $500 million round closed in December 2024. The chipmaker participated in the company’s July funding round, which valued Perplexity at $18 billion. However, Nvidia did not join the startup’s subsequent $200 million fundraise in September, which boosted the company’s valuation to $20 billion, according to PitchBook data. Poolside: In October 2024, the AI coding assistant startup Poolside announced it raised $500 million led by Bain Capital Ventures. Nvidia participated in the round, which valued the AI startup at $3 billion. Lambda: AI cloud provider Lambda, which provides services for model training, raised a $480 million Series D at a reported $2.5 billion valuation in February. The round was co-led by SGW and Andra Capital Lambda, and joined by Nvidia, ARK Invest, and others. A significant part of Lambda’s business involves renting servers powered by Nvidia’s GPUs. Black Forest Labs: Nvidia participated in a $300 million Series B for the German startup behind the “Flux” image generation models in December. The round, which was co-led by Salesforce Ventures and Anjney Midha (AMP) valued the company at $3.25 billion. CoreWeave: Although CoreWeave is no longer a startup, but a public company, Nvidia invested in GPU-cloud provider when it was still one, back in April 2023. That’s when CoreWeave raised $221 million in funding. Nvidia remains a significant shareholder. Together AI: In February, Nvidia participated in the $305 million Series B of this company, which offers cloud-based infrastructure for building AI models. The round valued Together AI at $3.3 billion and was co-led by Prosperity7, a Saudi Arabian venture firm, and General Catalyst. Nvidia backed the company for the first time in 2023. Firmus Technologies: In September, Firmus Technologies, the Singapore-based data center company, received an AU$330 million (approximately $215 million) in funding at an AU$1.85 billion ($1.2 billion) valuation from investors, including Nvidia. Firmus is developing an energy-efficient “AI factory” in Tasmania, an island state of Australia. The startup originally provided cooling technologies for Bitcoin mining. Uniphore: In October, Nvidia joined fellow tech giants AMD, Snowflake, and Databricks to lead a $260 million Series F round into this Business AI company. Uniphore’s multimodal platform helps enterprises automate complex workflows and deploy “AI agents” across customer service, sales, and marketing. Sakana AI: In September 2024, Nvidia invested in the Japan-based startup, which trains low-cost generative AI models using small datasets. The startup raised a massive Series A round of about $214 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion. Sakana raised another $135 million at a $2.65 billion valuation in November, but Nvidia didn’t participate in the round. Nuro: In August, Nvidia participated in a $203 million funding round for the self-driving delivery startup. The deal valued Nuro at $6 billion, a significant 30% drop from its peak at $8.6 billion valuation in 2021. Imbue: The AI research lab that claims to be developing AI systems that can reason and code raised a $200 million round in September 2023 from investors, including Nvidia, Astera Institute, and former Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt. Waabi: In June 2024, the autonomous trucking startup raised a $200 million Series B round co-led by existing investors Uber and Khosla Ventures. Other investors included Nvidia, Volvo Group Venture Capital, and Porsche Automobil Holding SE. Ayar Labs: In December 2024, Nvidia invested in the $155 million round of Ayar Labs, a company developing optical interconnects to improve AI compute and power efficiency. This was the third time Nvidia backed the startup. Kore.ai: The startup developing enterprise-focused AI chatbots raised $150 million in December of 2023. In addition to Nvidia, investors participating in the funding included FTV Capital, Vistara Growth, and Sweetwater Private Equity. Sandbox AQ: In April, Nvidia, alongside Google, BNP Paribas, and others, invested $150 million in Sandbox AQ, a startup developing large quantitative models (LQMs) for handling complex numerical analysis and statistical calculations. The investment increased Sandbox AQ’s Series E round to $450 million and the company’s valuation to $5.75 billion. Hippocratic AI: This startup, which is developing large language models for healthcare, announced in January that it raised a $141 million Series B at a valuation of $1.64 billion led by Kleiner Perkins. Nvidia participated in the round, along with returning investors Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, and others. The company claims that its AI solutions can handle non-diagnostic patient-facing tasks such as pre-operating procedures, remote patient monitoring, and appointment preparation. Hippocratic raised another $126 million at a valuation of $3.5 billion in November, but Nvidia didn’t participate in the round. Weka: In May 2024, Nvidia invested in a $140 million round for AI-native data management platform Weka. The round valued the Silicon Valley company at $1.6 billion. Runway: In April, Nvidia participated in Runway’s $308 million round, which was led by General Atlantic and valued the startup developing generative AI models for media production at $3.55 billion, according to PitchBook data. The chipmaker has been an investor in since 2023. Bright Machines: In June 2024, Nvidia participated in a $126 million Series C of Bright Machines, a smart robotics and AI-driven software startup. Enfabrica: In September 2023, Nvidia invested in networking chips designer Enfabrica’s $125 million Series B. The startup raised another $115 million in November 2024, but Nvidia didn’t participate in the round. In September, Nvidia reportedly spent over $900 million to hire Enfabrica’s CEO and staff while licensing its technology, in a deal structured as an “acquihire.” Reka AI: In July, AI research lab Reka raised $110 million in a round that included Snowflake and Nvidia. The deal tripled the startup’s valuation to over $1 billion, according to Bloomberg. This post was first published in January 2025.

Title: Apple needs a visionary QB again: It’s past time for game manager Tim Cook to hand off the ball

Full Content:
Update font size. Reset In American football, a “game manager” quarterback is one who protects the ball, executes the playbook, and keeps the scoreboard ticking through steady, conservative play. Tim Cook has been precisely that for Apple: an operations maestro who took the reins from the legendary Steve Jobs in 2011 and transformed the company into a financial juggernaut, ballooning its market cap from $350 billion to over $4 trillion through supply-chain efficiency, massive stock buybacks, and incremental refinements of products created under Apple’s visionary co-founder Steve Jobs. Yet, as Jobs himself might have envisioned, Cook was never meant to be the long-term playmaker — the electrifying, risk-taking, charismatic visionary who redraws the field with bold, game-changing innovations. Jobs built Apple on “insanely great” breakthroughs: the Mac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad. Under Cook’s stewardship, however, the company has increasingly relied on iteration rather than revolution, neglecting opportunities in AI (like the long-stagnant Siri), launching underwhelming entries like Vision Pro in rushed form, and prioritizing financial engineering over audacious product leaps. Nearly 15 years into his tenure — one far longer than Jobs likely intended for a transitional “caretaker” CEO — Apple stands at a crossroads. With executive departures signaling the end of an era and succession planning accelerating, it’s time for Cook to step aside. The world’s most valuable company deserves a charismatic, exciting leader once more: a true visionary capable of reigniting the magic that made Apple not just profitable, but culturally unstoppable. Richard Waters for Financial Times: ‎ The Financial Times’ report that succession planning at Apple is now in high gear makes it seem increasingly likely that the pre-eminent consumer tech company will soon be under new management. Strong demand for the iPhone 17 lifted Apple’s stock market value past $4tn for a while over the past month. With a strong tailwind from the huge stock buybacks that Cook instigated as one of his first acts as chief, the share price is up 20-fold from the day he took over in 2011. But, with artificial intelligence threatening the biggest upheaval to the tech world in decades, Cook will also leave huge questions. His successor will need to demonstrate a stronger appetite for risk and a willingness to bet on a new vision for how technology can reshape people’s lives… His successor will need to show that they can both co-opt AI to reinforce what Cook built while also harnessing its disruptive potential to ride the next consumer tech wave. The botched launch of Apple Intelligence — key parts of which were delayed early this year — was worrying. How much that will matter in the long run is hard to tell… But there are obvious risks to taking a back seat in the AI revolution. If LLMs are at the centre of innovation, then acting merely as a rent collector while leaving it to others to define the next must-have digital experiences would put Apple in an uncomfortable position. Also, if LLMs come to represent what is essentially a new operating system, they will have strategic importance. Hopefully, the days of a COO masquerading as an Apple CEO are finally drawing nigh. Apple deserves a visionary leader who can once again drive relentless, world-changing product innovation. – MacDailyNews, December 9, 2025 The Vision Pro headset represented his biggest gamble on a new device… But as a compelling vision of how mixed-reality headsets will change your life — the kind of thing that Steve Jobs excelled at — it was a flop. Instead, Meta has stolen a lead with a more lightweight, fashion-conscious range of “smart” glasses… Apple’s next chief will need to increase the scale of the company’s bets. Among the first jobs: convincing its shareholders, who have become accustomed to the iPhone’s steady profits, that it is time to look beyond Tim Cook’s gravy train. ‎ MacDailyNews Take: As our own SteveJack wrote last July: Steve Jobs famously said of Tim Cook, “Tim is not a product person, per se.” That has turned out to be an understatement, especially with the fact that the Apple Watch, AirPods, and even the Vision Pro concept began under Jobs. I’ve closely observed Apple for decades and I believe that Steve Jobs never meant for Tim Cook to be Apple’s CEO in 2025. When Jobs handpicked Cook as his successor in 2011, many believed it was a strategic move to stabilize the company during a tumultuous transition following Jobs’ untimely death. However, I contend that Jobs intended Cook to serve as a short-term CEO, a 3-5 year placeholder to mollify investors, not to lead Apple for nearly a decade and a half, stagnating its innovative spirit, jettisoning innovative executives, while relying on financial engineering, mainly in the form of hundreds of billions of dollars in buybacks, to prop up the company’s success. Jobs, a visionary known for his relentless pursuit of groundbreaking products, built Apple into a cultural and technological titan with the Mac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad. His genius lay in anticipating consumer needs before they did. Cook, hired from Compaq in 1998 as Senior Vice President of Worldwide Operations, was the operational mastermind behind Apple’s supply chain efficiency, going all-in on CCP-controlled China to maximize Apple’s profit margins. Jobs clearly valued Cook’s logistical prowess, but I believe Jobs saw Cook as a caretaker, not a long-term visionary, expecting him to maintain stability for a few years until a product-focused, visionary successor emerged. Under Cook, Apple’s market capitalization soared from $376 billion in 2011 to over $3.9 trillion in early 2025 making it the world’s most valuable company (it has since shed some $800 billion over the year, falling to third place behind Nvidia and rival Microsoft). Yet, much of this growth stems from financial engineering, service expansions like iCloud and Apple Music, and a steady stream of annual incremental product updates, rather than revolutionary Jobsian innovation. The Apple Watch, AirPods, and Vision Pro were initiated under Jobs’ tenure, with their completion coming during Cook’s tenure. The Apple Car project, also conceived by Jobs, was abandoned after a long, chaotic, and costly period under Cook. It’s clear that Cook lacks the disruptive, charismatic spark Steve Jobs infused throughout Apple. Basically, all of Apple’s successes under Cook are iterations of Steve Jobs’ products and services. Cook’s lack of hands-on product involvement has slowed innovation, with half-baked products like the Vision Pro being launched to consumers too early and, unsurprisingly, failing to sell. Apple clearly missed the generative AI (GenAI) paradigm shift under Cook and has been struggling to catch up ever since. Steve Jobs likely would not have released the Vision Pro and visionOS in the condition they were launched under Tim Cook. Jobs very likely would have not neglected Siri (which he purchased) for over a decade and a half and would almost certainly have foreseen GenAI early. Very likely, Jobs focus on Siri would have led him and Apple to GenAI first. Visionary Jobs’ main focus was about creating “insanely great” products; Cook’s seems to be about iteration and other, side pursuits. If Jobs intended Cook as a relatively short-term placeholder, the question remains: who was meant to follow? Speculation points to figures like former software chief Scott Forstall — who Cook rather quickly forced out of the company, ostensibly over the botched Maps launch (which way okayed by Cook, by the way) – and head product designer Jony Ive, who left Apple after years of feeling unchallenged under Cook. Jobs highly valued both executives, even granting Ive more operational power than Cook at the time of his death. Today, Ive is collaborating with OpenAI on a potentially revolutionary AI product, not working for Apple. The departure of these executives, whether explicit or tacit, conveniently solidified Cook’s long-term hold on the CEO role. While Cook’s canned-video tenure has been financially stellar overall, Apple has for many years coasted and thrived on Jobs’ lingering momentum, propped up by Cook’s beige operational savvy and financial engineering. After Cook’s tenure finally, blessedly ends, only time will reveal if Apple can rediscover its Jobsian revolutionary edge. ‎ Please help support MacDailyNews — and enjoy subscriber-only articles, comments, chat, and more — by subscribing to our Substack: macdailynews.substack.com.

He should have retired 8-10 years ago. “The Vision Pro headset represented his biggest gamble on a new device… But as a compelling vision of how mixed-reality headsets will change your life — the kind of thing that Steve Jobs excelled at — it was a flop. Instead, Meta has stolen a lead with a more lightweight, fashion-conscious range of “smart” glasses…” the Vision Pro is NOT a flop. it’s spectacular technology that’s very much a Version 1 (/developer) device. a lot of apple’s new tech was a ‘flop’ at launch, and then iterated over time into successful mass market products. the Vision Pro represents such a leap forward that a bold new less consumer-friendly opening salvo was necessary to start the wheels turning. eventually the technology will evolve into a viable next generation product. A product may be cool & advanced, but if it represents 8% of the market, it’s not sustainable and in business terms, it’s a flop. From the beginning, AAPL forecasted 3 million units for the first year, but early sales estimates landed around 200,000 units. Flopping early. When a WEARABLE item is notoriously uncomfortable, in-spite of offering a magical experience when using, it’s a blunderous flop. Jobs would have breathed flames on just this one aspect alone. Easy to discern (pain), relatively easy to fix, but still released! From what I gather, someone with needed acute standards, could make AVP market-relevant. This is just one products during Cook’s term that was befuddlingly mishandled. Siri agrees, as she knows. You are correct John. My Vision Pro was only used sporadically since I bought it (lots of travel and caregiving for family) in late 2024, but over the past few weeks i’ve been using it daily and I am astounded at how much the experience has improved. Little things are better like the digital crown now being able to control either environment immersion or volume depending on which icon you are looking at. And big things like pass-through video quality noticeably improving, eye tracking and gestures being even more accurate and being able to view my iPad Pro as a giant display (like Mac Virtual Display but without widescreen options). Obviously price was always going to be a limiting factor but issues like bulk or discomfort have been massively overblown. Apple had to get this product out into the wild in order to start iterating on it and improving it through real-world use. Even in 2026 this is bleeding-edge tech that’s a marvel to experience. The technologies developed for the Vision Pro will trickle down to more consumer friendly (and less exciting) glasses. By the end of the decade I expect the Vision Pro to look more like 80s visor-style sunglasses that you can quickly slip on and off (perhaps still with an external battery or tethered to a Mac/iPad). My primary complaints against Vision Pro is the poor marketing. It was never meant to be a pair of smart glasses that you walk around in, that’s a separate product category that we may see a preview of later this year.

Title: How Some Newsrooms Are Defying the Industry Odds

Pro Available to WrapPRO members Even as layoffs ravaged newspapers, magazines and TV networks in 2025, journalism leaders reveal why they’re bullish about the future Axios CEO Jim VandeHei declared last month that we’re living in a “post-news” era, a world shaped by personalized content that allows people to create their own realities. “America’s information ecosystem is badly broken, deeply polluted and increasingly dangerous,” he wrote. Yet despite that sobering conclusion, and following a year in which many news outlets, including Axios, cut jobs, VandeHei told TheWrap he felt confident about the future. “I actually go into next year probably the most bullish I’ve been for high-end media in five years,” he said. The numbers would suggest otherwise. Sweeping layoffs throughout the broader media industry reached new heights in 2025, according to the executive staffing firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas. The media industry — measured by television, news, film and streaming — announced 17,163 job cuts this year as of November, up 18% from the same period last year and ahead of the total 15,039 in 2024. It has felt like no one is immune. Throughout 2025, TheWrap chronicled cuts at legacy newspapers (Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Chicago Tribune), magazines (People Inc., Penske Media, Condé Nast), digital media companies (Vox Media, Business Insider) and TV networks (CNN, CBS News, NBC News). This slashing of jobs reflects a yearslong crisis gripping the media industry, in particular news, as it faces challenges stemming from shifting consumption habits toward creator-led programs, the threat of generative AI platforms siphoning away traffic from news websites, a retreat of ad spending and industry consolidation. It’s forced some journalists to figure out which options remain in a beleaguered industry and how best to serve audiences as attention spans have splintered. There are some bright spots: News-specific cuts were actually down last month (2,254) compared to the same period last year (4,537), according to Challenger, Gray and Christmas, and successful startups, like the Congress-focused Punchbowl News and center-right Bulwark, are growing. MS NOW (formerly MSNBC) staffed up in 2025 as it split from NBC News, while the California Post, a West Coast extension of the Rupert Murdoch-owned New York Post, is building a newsroom for its 2026 launch. Still, given the grave challenges facing the industry as a whole entering the new year, TheWrap spoke with leaders of growing media organizations about what they see that’s working. “I feel very confident that if you are a media company that produces distinct content, either because of your expertise or because of the personalities that you have on payroll, that business is getting better and better,” VandeHei said. As many of the nation’s top newsrooms retreat, a collection of outlets found ways to expand. Politico founder Robert Allbritton gave $20 million to his nonprofit, the Allbritton Journalism Institute, in 2023 to create a nonprofit newsroom, NOTUS (News of the United States). Its mission was to produce “empathetic and brutally honest” reporting on Congress and Washington by pairing a group of 10 fellows, or reporters in training, with a staff of seasoned reporters for two years. NOTUS has since drawn from the ranks of Politico, Axios, the Daily Beast and NPR, and has reported exclusively on Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s presidential ambitions and on fake citations in a report published by the Robert F. Kennedy Jr.-led Health and Human Services Department. The site has rotated through the White House’s “New Media” seat during its press briefings, with one NOTUS reporter getting on Donald Trump’s radar in May. In addition, its first class of 10 fellows “graduated” from the program earlier this year, with some landing jobs at Bloomberg, Politico, the Miami Herald and other top outlets. “Everyone who wanted a journalism job has gotten a journalism job, and a good journalism job,” NOTUS editor-in-chief Tim Grieve, a former top editor at Politico and National Journal, told TheWrap. Grieve said the newsroom now operates as a for-profit entity, though all profits are sent back to Allbritton’s institute. Some of those NOTUS’ donors support the website, he said, due to its new “Washington Bureau Initiative,” which assigns NOTUS fellows to report on state congressional delegations in 12 states, including New York, California, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Grieve called the decline in local reporting “a real crisis for journalism and for democracy.” “Most local newspapers, the ones that used to have Washington bureaus, mostly don’t anymore, and so there’s really no one out there keeping tabs on the specific members of a state delegation for the readers back home,” Grieve said. Axios, meanwhile, has consistently expanded its Axios Local initiative, which has created 34 news arms since its launch in 2020 in cities such as Miami, Atlanta, Portland and Boston. VandeHei, Axios’ CEO, plans to expand the program to areas including Colorado and Ohio next year, bringing the total to 41 by early next year. VandeHei told TheWrap the current collision of technology and reporting has allowed news outlets to break into local markets more efficiently than they could five years ago, and he wanted to “perfect” the local model by the end of 2026. “If we could fix local, which I think is the hardest problem to fix, and we could do that at scale, I think that would be a great gift to society,” VandeHei said. “I think local news is really important, and I think it’s a really hard business, and if we can crack that code, I would feel really good about life.” Axios, which was bought by Cox Enterprises in 2022, has also expanded into video once again through the first season of “The Axios Show,” a one-on-one conversation series between Axios journalists and newsmakers that highlights their perspectives. Its first season guests included Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and VandeHei said “it looks like” there would be a second one. Axios is also testing a video component to its “Behind the Curtain” column, authored by VandeHei and co-founder Mike Allen. “We’re pretty great at convening and getting really interesting people on camera doing good interviews,” VandeHei said. “So that’s a good business.” VandeHei, who had to cut 19 staffers last year at Axios, acknowledged the “painful and awful” reality of those layoffs. But he said that media companies needed to adapt quickly if they wanted “to be able to last forever.” “It’s going to be the hard part for all companies and all employees in basically every industry,” VandeHei said. “Going forward, you’re just going to have to be more agile and just realize that reality is what reality is. Things are just shifting faster than at any point in humanity, and you just have to find ways as a business and as an individual to keep up and to evolve, and that makes people nervous.” Grieve, the NOTUS editor, said the company has experimented with AI to support some of its backend models, but it wasn’t considering following other news outlets’ lead in licensing its content to companies like OpenAI or Amazon or using the technology as a substitute for reporting. “AI cannot tell you what is in the head of a politician working on Capitol Hill or what his next move is going to be,” Grieve said. “But great reporters can do that, and as someone who’s hired a ton of journalists over the years, I know how hard it is to find people who can truly break news and deliver information that people don’t have.” Axios struck a content licensing deal with OpenAI in January 2025, joining a collection of other media outlets, but it does not use ChatGPT to produce stories. VandeHei said outlets that’ve experimented with AI to generate stories were engaging in a “stupid strategy” that wasn’t distinctive enough to stand out from human-generated work. The future for outlets that seek to rise above the threats posed by technological advancements and shifting consumer habits, VandeHei said, is to report out “distinct, unique, human, verified” journalism that can stand apart from those that try to appeal to a generic audience. He singled out Punchbowl News and The Information, both of which cater to insider audiences, as well as giants like the New York Times and Wall Street Journal that have managed to convert a specific audience into devoted, paying subscribers. “I would tell anybody in any industry, buckle up,” VandeHei said. “The hypervolatility is here, and it will only intensify.”

Title: The 14 Global Trends That Will Shape the Climate in 2026

Time Published: 2026-01-02T12:30:21Z
Full Content:
The world is now moving into the latter half of a critical decade to fight climate change. Scientists have warned that nations need to cut carbon emissions nearly 50% by 2030 to stave off 1.5C temperature rise. The world is woefully off track to meet those targets and risks further backsliding, even as there are some surprising sources of progress. In the US, those tensions are on full display. The future of the energy transition is being shaped by President Donald Trump’s climate policy rollbacks that favor fossil fuels — but also the life support for renewables and batteries paradoxically coming from data center power demand. Read more: Some Good Climate News to End the Year China’s role as the world’s biggest emitter and hub for green tech are also affecting efforts to curb carbon pollution. This year, the country will set a new plan laying out how climate fits with its economic ambitions, while its booming clean tech sector is expected to help more developing countries adopt renewable energy and electric vehicles. Here are 14 themes Bloomberg News writers are keeping tabs on in 2026. Climate Clues in China’s New Economic Blueprint When Chinese officials gather in March for annual legislative meetings, they will approve the country’s next five-year plan. Climate watchers will be looking to see if the plan does anything to speed up the pace of decarbonization after Beijing set what’s widely seen as a conservative 2035 climate target last year. The key stat to watch for is China’s target for carbon intensity — that is, a measure of how much it emits per unit of GDP. It’s currently off track of its last five-year plan created in 2020. How much policymakers push to close the gap will be a critical litmus test for China’s climate leadership amid global backpedaling. —Lili Pike Can Diplomats Make Headway at COP31? International negotiators will spend much of this year trying to create a bare-bones road map to phase out fossil fuels and another to eliminate deforestation. The two issues were left unresolved at the COP30 climate summit in Brazil last year. But with the nation in control of the COP presidency this year, it has a chance to make progress. The first key milestone will be a conference in Colombia in April focused on phasing out fossil fuels. Negotiators will continue to hash out their differences at the Bonn Climate Change Conference in June, as well as at London and New York’s climate weeks held in June and September, respectively. The world’s efforts will culminate at COP31, which will take place in Antalya, Turkey, in November. —Laura Millan Look to Developing Countries for Climate Progress In recent years, there have been breakout climate success stories in developing countries, largely enabled by cheap Chinese clean tech exports. Bangladesh off-grid home solar installations set a record globally, enabling rapid rural electrification. Pakistan’s huge purchase of solar panels and batteries have led the country to abandon natural gas as a strategic fuel. And Ethiopia’s de facto ban on fossil-fuel car imports has led to a surge in electric vehicle sales. These transitions were largely driven by access to Chinese technology. With the country’s green exports increasing, expect more such stories to emerge in 2026. —Akshat Rathi The Clean Tech Revival Continues Global climate tech investment made a comeback in 2025, largely driven by growing data center energy demand. The surge is likely to continue this year, with both nascent nuclear technologies and proven renewable solutions set to draw investor interest. Upgrading the power grid is likely to see continued investments as well, giving a boost to everything from battery energy storage to power management software. But questions remain about whether the artificial intelligence boom can continue to sustain the climate tech sector, and how to bring growth to companies beyond the energy ecosystem. —Coco Liu Nuclear Energy’s Boom Is Just Over the Horizon Data centers are sucking up electricity as fast as new power plants can get built, and Big Tech is willing to throw big money at nuclear. Dozens of companies are working on the next generation of small reactors, and the Trump administration is pushing to streamline the regulatory process and lining up billions in financing for big ones. More than 60 reactors were under construction worldwide at the end of 2025, though the world’s nuclear capacity contracted a bit. Yet even friendly regulations and fat checks can only do so much to accelerate the notoriously slow-moving industry. That means that while the nuclear sector will start to see momentum in 2026, it’s still a few years away from bringing a wave of new plants online. —Will Wade Will the AI Bubble Burst? Last year began with a crash in AI-related stocks after news of Chinese company DeepSeek’s more efficient models threw a wrench in power demand growth projections. Will there be another “DeepSeek moment” in 2026? That’s a question that’s on investors’ minds, even as money keeps pouring into AI and the energy sector. Even if models don’t become more efficient, the bubble could burst in other ways. Already, clean energy and real estate developers are sounding the alarm that electric grids, permitting and regulations aren’t keeping up with the pace of interconnection. Some regions are seeing years-long queues to hook up power projects to the grid, and there are backlogs for the crucial electric infrastructure. If the friction continues, AI investors could find their ambitions thwarted or that they’ll have to rely more on developing power onsite and behind the meter. —Michelle Ma Everyone Wants a Piece of the Arctic “What happens in the Arctic doesn’t stay in the Arctic” is a truism that’s become irrefutable. This past year was the hottest in 125 years of records at the top of the planet, and the spill-over effect of that is beginning to be felt everywhere else, from rising seas to an uptick in atmospheric carbon. Rising temperatures also have the world increasingly looking at how to exploit the region. In 2026, expect previously local or regional Arctic issues — from ports to critical mineral development — to become international priorities. They include how China’s push to transport cargo through the Northern Sea Route will impact fragile ecosystems, and whether Trump’s push for the US to take over Greenland becomes more aggressive. —Danielle Bochove The EV Market Splits The global transition to electric vehicles will fracture in 2026, as EV sales slow in the US and scoot ahead in the rest of the world. BloombergNEF expects drivers to snap up 16.9 million EVs globally through September. That would be an increase of 16% over the year-earlier period. The tide of affordable and well-reviewed Chinese machines from companies like BYD and SAIC Motor will help drive the uptick in sales, building on 2025’s rise in exports. The EV outlook is far cloudier in the US, which still largely bars Chinese cars and trucks. The sunset of federal subsidies on EV purchases in September slammed the brakes on electric car adoption in the US. BNEF expects US sales to essentially stay level in the first half of the year and dip in the third quarter, in comparison to the market’s record run in August, September and October of this year. —Kyle Stock What Will New York City Do About BlackRock? Three of the city’s five pension funds are weighing whether to drop BlackRock’s $42 billion mandate because of the asset manager’s climate policies. Former Comptroller Brad Lander made a recommendation late last year after a formal review of all the fund managers overseeing the city’s retirement money, citing BlackRock’s failure to tackle global warming. Lander tried to pass the resolution to cut out the money manager in December, but he was unable to convince pension board of trustee members to hold a vote before the end of the year. Now, it will be up to new comptroller Mark Levine to hold a vote this year. Mayor Zohran Mamdani will also have a significant amount of influence over the outcome of the vote. It will come as BlackRock faces other headwinds: Late last year, the firm lost a mandate with a Dutch pension fund due in part to climate-related concerns. —Olivia Raimonde Climate Risk Modeling Gains Steam Demand is high and growing for accurate, usable climate information, particularly information that can help assess risk. That’s driving researchers to probe every level of risk and solution, from neighborhoods exposed to more frequent flooding, to whether proposed atmospheric cooling approaches can work safely, if at all. The clamor for actionable information comes as the Trump administration tries to dismantle much of the infrastructure in the US that underpins world-leading science. That includes hiding reports and data; cutting staff and funding; and putting out analyses that cherry-pick data downplaying climate change. The next 12 months are shaping up as a fight for more accurate climate information and an increasingly challenging environment to find it. —Eric Roston US Renewables Face a Bumpy Road The boom days for clean energy in the US are over — for now. Trump’s efforts to halt the buildout of solar and wind have resulted in policy and financial headwinds that will continue to be a big challenge for the industry. Large-scale solar installations, while still expected to make up the bulk of all new power plant additions, are forecast to decline as lucrative federal tax incentives start to fade away by mid-year and tariffs raise costs, according to BloombergNEF. Rooftop solar tax credits for homeowners also got wiped out, though leasing panels will still qualify. Wind developers may be even harder off. Subsidies have disappeared, and the Trump administration has thrown up additional permitting hurdles. The one bright spot? Batteries, which can still qualify for tax breaks if they satisfy new rules restricting the amount of materials that can come from China. Data centers are likely to be a strong source of power demand, which could help the industry. And clean energy developers are hopeful that artificial intelligence’s power needs will convince Trump to ease his assault on the industry. —Mark Chediak The EPA’s Biggest Climate Attack Is Coming A process initiated by the Environmental Protection Agency last summer to unravel the federal government’s authority to regulate greenhouse gases is set to conclude this year. The EPA is expected to finalize the controversial rulemaking that would rollback the so-called endangerment finding and immediately remove greenhouse gas regulations for passenger cars and trucks. While the administration has rolled back a number of climate rules, this would be the most consequential yet. Any decision to rescind the endangerment finding will undoubtedly be swiftly challenged in the courts, kicking off an epic legal battle that could determine how much the federal government can do to respond to global warming. —Zahra Hirji FEMA’s Fate Will Be Decided The Trump administration spent 2025 weighing whether or not to abolish the Federal Emergency Management Agency, with the president establishing a review council co-chaired by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The group was tasked with providing recommendations on what to do with the agency, which it’s expected to finalize early this year. Disaster researchers, state and local emergency managers, and FEMA staff are all waiting to see how dramatic the proposed reforms will be. Although the president doesn’t hold the exclusive power to dissolve the agency in its entirety — that power rests in the hands of Congress — there’s a lot Trump can change, or at least try to. —Zahra Hirji Can California Meet its Climate Goals? This new year marks the 20th anniversary of California’s landmark climate law that has transformed the Golden State into a green powerhouse. But it’ll spend 2026 fending off the Trump administration’s campaign to dismantle its authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. The Trump tax bill’s elimination of federal renewable energy and electric vehicle incentives is already slowing California’s progress toward reaching net-zero emissions by 2045. With the administration trying to scuttle the state’s cap-and-trade market, expect California to continue to spend more time fighting back in the courts and developing workarounds. Beyond Trump’s reach, local and regional California agencies continue to eliminate fossil fuels. A Bay Area ban on the sale of gas water heaters and furnaces, for instance, begins to take effect in 2027 and will apply to a fifth of the state’s population. —Todd Woody Top photograph: Floating solar panels manufactured by Hanwha Solutions Corp. on the Hapcheon Dam in Hapcheon, Gyeongsangnam-do province, South Korea, on Tuesday, Feb. 8, 2022.

“Times are difficult globally; awakening is no longer a luxury or an ideal. It’s becoming critical. We don’t need to add more depression, more discouragement, or more anger to what’s already here. It’s becoming essential that we learn how to relate sanely with difficult times. The earth seems to be beseeching us to connect with joy and discover our innermost essence. This is the best way that we can benefit others.” —Pema Chodron 2026 is the 250th anniversary of our country’s conception. A few years later when the Constitution was ratified, we became a republic — “if you can keep it,” Ben Franklin cracked to anxious citizens waiting outside the great hall in Philadelphia. Our country was predicated on the resolve of virtuous men operating under the rule of law. We are lately under an astounding siege of villains without principle seeking to wreck the republic. The big question facing the USA is whether our political life can become even more deranged than it has been in the past ten years, or can we possibly sober up. How is it we’re still arguing about men in women’s locker rooms? The self-evident has gone missing. A lot has gone very wrong. The Woke-Jacobin war against our country continues, led by a Democratic Party made even more vicious, depraved, and insane by the 2024 election victory of Mr. Trump, who was left a broken polity after the four-year tableau vivant of “Joe Biden.” Can our nation recover its balance, its sense of purpose, its traction in history? Can we reconstruct a coherent common culture that will afford us some means to carry on as an upright people? I will try to answer without wasting pixels. Hijacking the Law Nothing is more urgent than cleaning up the machinery of our elections. It is overloaded now with deliberately devious complexities that invite fraud. We must put an end to mail-in ballots with the sole exception of traditional absentee ballots for citizens out of the country on election day, with proof. We must eliminate all electronic interfaces between the vote and the tally, including all ballot-counting hardware, and return to paper ballots tallied by human beings. We must require voter ID, proof of citizenship, and proof of local voting-district residence. Automatic motor-voter registration must end. Ballots must be cast on election day only (absentee ballots must be received by election day) and the results reported out in twenty-four hours. Clusterfuck Nation is a reader-supported publication.

But, understand that an industry has evolved to take full advantage of that. It’s personified by the Democratic Party-allied lawyer Marc Elias, founder of Democracy Docket, who played a significant role in the legal expansion of mail-in voting that led up to the 2020 U.S. presidential election. The Democracy Docket org is funded by George Soros’s Open Society Foundation, associated NGOs (the Hopewell Fund, the North Fund) used as pass-throughs for the Arabella Fund, the MacArthur Foundation, and the David Rockefeller Fund. In 2021, Marc Elias founded the Elias Law Group after leaving Perkins Coie, the Washington DC power firm that played a significant role in the RussiaGate crimes centered around Hillary Clinton’s Steele Dossier. At Perkins Coie, in advance of the 2020 election, Elias was extensively involved in challenging, litigating, influencing, and re-engineering state election laws and advised on “dark money” strategies for Democratic voter “outreach” (that is, ballot-harvesting). It was all meticulously gamed-out beforehand by an NGO called the Transition Integrity Project founded by Rosa Brooks of the Georgetown University Law Center. The objective: to maximize opportunities for improper balloting. After the 2020 election, Marc Elias defended the suspicious results from counties in swing states against Trump campaign lawsuits (winning 64 of 65 cases on specious grounds). The last thing Marc Elias has been interested in is election integrity. His focus is strictly on winning elections for the Democratic Party by any means necessary. The war cry about “defending democracy” is the exact opposite of what the lawfare ninjas actually do. Through 2025, Congress has entertained election reform bills, most recently, the SAVE Act (Safeguard American Voter Eligibility), which has languished on the House side for months awaiting deliberation in the Senate. Prediction: Mr. Trump will turn up the heat on Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) to expedite passage of election reform. This partly depends on the dark business now occurring in Venezuela, which is the suspected hub of a global election rigging apparatus engineered around Dominion / Smartmatic technology. Prediction: Marc Elias will be indicted for activities related to election fraud. Norm Eisen is the point man for Democratic party Lawfare, which is warfare against the citizens of the USA by means of the courts. Eisen is affiliated with the Brookings Institution and the States United Democracy Center, which is supported by George Soros’s Open Society Foundation and activist orgs associated with Arabella Advisors, a hub fueled by dark money. He was an active participant in the Transition Integrity Project of 2020. Norm Eisen’s general mission for years is to drain the resources of the Democratic Party’s political opponents in frivolous lawsuits — working in partnership with Democratic activist judges — and to overburden the federal court dockets to paralyze the working-out of our nation’s disputes. Eisen was counsel to Jerrold Nadler’s 2019 House impeachment committee and was involved in the machinations of then-Rep. Adam Schiff with CIA-agent “whistleblower” Eric Ciaramella, Intel IG Michael Atkinson, and NSC staffer Lt. Col Alexander Vindman, who cooked up the Ukraine phone call scheme to impeach Mr. Trump. After “Joe Biden’s” fake election, Eisen was deeply involved in choreographing the scope and format of the House Jan-6 hearings for which the Republican minority was not allowed to choose its own committee members. The committee proceedings were arranged as a prestige docudrama TV show, under the direction of former ABC network president, James Goldstein, hired, in effect, as the producer of a show. The committee destroyed its entire evidence cache after it issued its final report. That’s how much confidence they had in their methods and findings. After that exploit, Eisen acted as a facilitator and strategist for “Joe Biden’s” DOJ in the 2024 Jack Smith Special Counsel prosecutions of Donald Trump, and acted as a go-between for the DOJ in the various New York State cases against Trump and the Fulton County, GA, case brought by DA Fani Willis. All of these actions amounted to election interference — a concerted conspiracy to eliminate Mr. Trump by putting him in prison by way of specious, malicious prosecutions — and, one way or another, they all failed to accomplish their goal. Norm Eisen and Marc Elias, along with their lawfare cohorts Mary McCord, Andrew Weissmann, and Ben Wittes should be subject to prosecution under federal criminal statutes for their wide-ranging activities, including: 18 U.S.C. § 241 (Conspiracy Against Rights); 18 U.S.C. § 1001 (False Statements); 18 U.S.C. § 594 (Intimidation of Voters). The next big hairball is the politicized judiciary, federal judges who consistently interfere in executive actions (the President), a clash between Article II and Article III of the Constitution. It amounts to Democratic Party-designated plaintiffs getting injunctions and restraining orders through partisan judges against policies issued by the White House around deportation of illegal immigrants, firings of federal employees, funding freezes, the termination of “birthright citizenship,” and more. The funding freeze and firing cases were aimed at keeping taxpayer dollars flowing out federal agencies to Democratic Party NGOs and for keeping the so-called “resistance” operators in positions of influence within government agencies at their desks and on the payroll. Many of the NGOs promote activities aimed at dismantling the government and fomenting racial animus. Taxpayers should not have to underwrite that. The president must be allowed to fire employees of the executive branch engaged in slow-motion sedition. These court rulings are choreographed by Norm Eisen’s lawfare operation which has enough money from the aforementioned NGOs and billionaire-funded foundations to bring endless lawsuits in order to gum up the works of governance. The remedy for all this is knotty. The US Supreme Court (SCOTUS) has reversed many lower court rulings, but these are provisional actions, pending the SCOTUS entertaining any particular case decisively in regular session. The myriad cases end up jamming the SCOTUS docket. The net effect is to slow down policy that President Trump was elected to pursue. Federal judges can otherwise be removed only via impeachment by the US Senate, which is a practical impossibility at this time since it requires 60 out of 100 votes and the Republicans hold a mere 53 seat majority out of 100. Perhaps the best remedy is to prosecute the lawfare ninjas who are ginning up all those court cases. Their activities can be framed as a conspiracy against rights (18 U.S.C. § 241). Against whose rights? Against the rights of the people of the US to an executive that is able to discharge its Constitutional duties — to provide for the public safety, to enforce the law, and to carry out foreign policy. Norm Eisen, Marty McCord, and Andrew Weissmann might also be subject to a charge of seditious conspiracy (18 U.S.C. § 2384), as when two or more persons conspire to “levy war against the United States. And it is warfare using the mechanisms of the law. Norm Eisen is behaving like a spike protein in the nation’s bloodstream, turning the nation’s immune system, the rule of law, against the nation. Prediction: Norm Eisen and cohorts will be hiring criminal defense lawyers in 2026. Hijacking the Truth “. . . the dirty little secret is that the same people pretending to be fighting fascism are the fascists.” —Sasha Stone The American people have been increasingly subjected to a contrived permission structure that has normalized lying and deceit about everything and anything, leaving every major institution in the land damaged or wrecked. Lying has become the default position of many in authority, and no one has been held accountable for it. Medicine is wrecked due to the dishonest behavior of doctors colluding with the pharmaceutical industry and officials of the Health and Human Services agencies on the Covid-19 op — mandates, lockdowns, lying about efficacy and harms, hiding true remedies, cover-up of the origins of Covid — as well as the medical establishment’s regular ongoing “health care” racketeering operations in concert with insurance companies, hospital conglomerates, and other players. The cruelty and incompetence of these medical rackets is one thing, but the moral failure is spectacular. Medicine has forsaken the Hippocratic oath: First, do no harm. The many agencies under US HHS, plus the university labs, the medical journals, the state medical boards, and the mainstream media’s health reporters are all implicated in these ongoing misdeeds. Until late in 2025, HHS Secretary Robert F Kennedy, Jr., was sore beset by “resistance” at the FDA, CDC, NIH, and everything else under the giant agency’s umbrella. In December, 2025, things are changing. The CDC’s ACIP vaccine advisory committee stopped recommending Hepatitis B vaccines for newborns. Then the CDC officially acknowledged that COVID-19 vaccines have caused injuries in adults, previously stonewalled. These might be signs that Mr. Kennedy is finally getting a grip on his sprawling agencies. Prediction: in 2026, expect criminal referrals against former senior management at CDC, FDA, and NIH for a range of crimes in the Covid-19 operation. In the larger picture, the whole scaffold of health care is in the process of imploding. Predictions: In 2026, doctors will increasingly bail out of big corporate practices and go freelance on a cash payment basis, leaving behind the corrupt and onerous insurance racket. Hospitals will shutter. Giant medical insurance conglomerates will go out of business. Millions will be left without coverage. Medicine will be forced to begin reorganizing on an emergent, provisional basis. The net effect will be doctors who make less money but control their own medical practices and much more limited access to specialty medicine for the general public, including now-common surgeries like joint replacement and cancer therapies. It will be most difficult for doctors to regain their authority and the esteem of their patients. Alt medical practitioners of every sort will multiply, many on the down-low evading regulation, as sick citizens desperately seek relief from illness while they navigate around the ruins of the old standard medicine. Quackery will flourish and it will be difficult for ordinary people to discern which health care services are of value and which are scams. Higher education is obviously ill. It bargained away its legitimacy by participating in the college loan racket with the equally deleterious overlay of pervasive DEI racketeering (and inevitable lowering of standards). That opened the door for grievance-oriented Marxists, and race-and-gender hustlers to take the curricula hostage — wholesale intellectual racketeering. That, in turn, led to the abolition of truth-telling for the purpose of advancing agendas. Reality on campus became purely transactional and contingent. Free speech was suppressed. All of this was supported by pusillanimous college deans and cowardly university presidents and now they are paying the price. Too many young Americans do not believe that a college degree has value, especially at the price of six-figures in debt. Most colleges and universities are not backstopped by big endowments like the big Ivy League schools and a lot of them will be going out of business in 2026. Graduate schools and PhD programs will be especially hard hit. It’s not clear what role artificial intelligence (AI) will play in paring down the numbers of candidates for certified expertise, but it’s not looking good. Any earnest young person can already find an adequate education post-secondary education on the internet, for instance the Khan Academy, a long-running, pre-AI, free website of courses from the rudimentary to the advanced. The arts and the cultural media (including news media) have been disgracing themselves frantically for years. Film production in Los Angeles dropped 63-percent in 2024 extending into 2025. The feature film is being replaced by short-format Instagram and Tiktok videos. The multiplex cinemas are empty. The theatrical exhibition of movies is on its deathbed. They can’t compete with giant flat-screens in the comfort of your home where microwaved popcorn is only a buck a bowl (compared to $32 at the cineplex.) Management of the Hollywood studios was taken hostage by race-and-gender hustlers, with permission structures engineered by financial reliance on Chinese (CCP-affiliated) investors and distributors. The result was Woke cinema, girl-boss movies, DEI-oriented storytelling, and one flop after another. The replication of streaming channels has only invoked Gresham’s Law in culture: bad content drives out good content. The next development, moving very rapidly now, is AI applied to cinema, which implies the end of the acting profession at least, and perhaps screenwriting, too. The end product is liable to be something more like an hallucination than a story told in the language of dramaturgy, following the logic of authentic human behavior. I’d expect even more corrosive effects of Gresham’s Law in the new AI regime as genuine human creativity becomes ever more mediated and abstracted from the end product. You must also wonder about the long-term prospects of the Internet as we know it. The sheer stress on the electric grid from the demands of AI suggests problems with reliable electric service in the years ahead. The whole thing begins to look like a self-limiting problem. Ten years from now, we might be back to entertaining ourselves with puppet shows. News as we knew it for much of the past 200 years is also gone missing. The remnants exist on cable channels and internet sites as a commerce in gossip, rumor, and opinion. The legacy TV news channels no longer employ reporters in the field. Even under Bari Weiss’s new management, CBS’s 60-Minutes still broadcasts rafts of mendacious propaganda each week. “X,” formerly Twitter, is a colossal grape-vine, and is now touting itself as the world’s leading news source, though it still engages in surreptitious censorship. These days, you must be your own gatekeeper (managing editor), combing through bales of crap to find the scattered gems of real news. The authoritative, trustworthy editors of yore are no more. Hardly anyone in the public arena speaks with authority, and reputations are easily assassinated by interested parties with agendas. The newspapers have made themselves pathetic jokes — The New York Times with its Pulitzer Prize for lying about RussiaGate and routine spin services for the corrupt Democratic Party. . . The Washington Post acting as publicist for nefarious cabals in and around the intel blob. Local newspapers lie dead everywhere, and hardly anyone knows what is going on in their own towns. The people are horrifically misinformed and uninformed. Don’t expect AI to make the situation any better. The years ahead may therefore be a nadir of public confusion, delusion, and generalized ignorance in societies whose complexity cannot survive such derangements. What was not so many decades ago a high trust society based on a coherent common culture and broadly agreed-upon values seems to be devolving into babel and anarchy leading eventually to a generalized social collapse. Out of that, a new consensus about reality will emergently and eventually self-organize, but it’s impossible to say how long that might take, what degree of disorder will have to be endured on the journey to resolution, and what the reorganized template for human behavior might finally look like. Humans organized in societies need the truth. They need trustworthy authorities. Authority without truth is just cruel, faithless power. The Democratic Party in our time has given you a nice demonstration of how that works. The party deserves to be put out of business. Perhaps that will begin the process of reconstructing a coherent common culture. War is Politics by Other Means “The self-described Coalition of the Willing was always little more than a public relations exercise. Today – after almost four years of bloody fighting – it is evident that the main concern of this Coalition is to limit the damage caused by its posturing.” —Frank Furedi Interested parties in the USA and the NATO deliberately started the Ukraine War in 2014 while transforming that sad-sack nation into a global money laundry. The reasons appear to have been nefarious and reckless. By Christmas 2025, Mr. Trump’s attempts to negotiate a peace had not succeeded. Even now, the big dogs of NATO make noises and idle threats about going to war with Russia. The rationale for that is preposterous, since they lack the military manpower and the armaments to prosecute such a war, and open themselves to nuclear destruction if they even attempt such a folly. The USA, at this point, has no vested interest in Ukraine. It is in everybody’s interest that the Ukraine revert to its pre-2014 condition as an uncontested frontier nation within Russia’s sphere of influence that does not make itself a pain-in-the-ass for the lands adjacent and proximate to it. It is very much in the USA’s interest to develop respectful, transactional relations with Russia a nation which, paradoxically, under Vladimir Putin, is making itself a last bastion of Western Civ while the EU nations commit economic and cultural suicide, make war on their own citizens, and beat a path to some grim, neo-medieval future. At this moment, there are three plausible endings to the Ukraine War. One is a simple armistice, a cessation of military operations, but without any formal peace settlement. That would look like the long and contentious irresolution of the Korean War, a suspended animation of hostilities at the current battle lines. A second potential outcome is a straight-up Russian victory, leaving Russia to pick up the pieces of what will be a failed state, will require Russia to take administrative control and rebuild what can be afforded, perhaps with international help, or not, and to see if Ukraine can stand on its feet as a sovereign state — understood to not be subject to outside manipulation. That is apt to be the outcome when money and arms from the West stop flowing into Ukraine, which is about exactly where things stand on New Year’s 2026. Mr. Trump appears to want out of supporting a war that Ukraine is clearly losing at this point. The EU’s option of underwriting the Ukraine war machine by confiscating Russian financial assets trapped in Europe’s banks was eight-sixed by Hungary and Belgium just after Christmas. Confiscating Russia’s sovereign wealth would have probably destroyed Europe’s bond markets and blown up the entire financial system of Western Civ. Europe’s economies are in enough trouble as it is, with industry failing, energy resources getting scarcer and less affordable, and social welfare systems under a mighty strain — not to mention the demographic fiasco of falling indigenous birthrates and the ongoing invasion of so many migrants from the global south. The third possible outcome of the Ukraine mess is that the Ukrainian people themselves will opt out of the war by getting rid of the Zelenskyy regime. Zelenskyy is already engulfed in a scandal over all the money that he and his cronies creamed off out of US and NATO financial support. Also, Ukraine has lost 10-million in population since the start of hostilities in 2022, more than a million of them soldiers killed in action. The lack of young men on the scene is an economic and demographic disaster. The Ukrainians know that Zelenskyy is a criminal as well as an incompetent war commander. They are sick of war, of carnage, of wreckage and ruin. Forecast: Zelenskyy will be ousted as president by elite Ukrainian military units before the four-year anniversary of the war’s onset in February. Ukraine then concedes the loss of its territories. . .the war ends. . . and Russia supervises an election at the earliest opportunity. The world moves on. Euroland Cracks Up Europe’s days as a tourist theme park draw to a close. A new era dawns: the Neo-medieval. The ancient competition for power and resources between language groups and geographic regions heats up again, with even fewer goodies to fight over this time around. EU-style cooperation breaks down. The Big Dogs (France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands) can no longer stand the grotesque over-regulation of their businesses and their energy needs. They withdraw from the EU and the union dissolves in a matter of weeks. Hard borders are reinstated. Old currencies reappear: the franc, the mark, the guilder, lira. Diplomats make frantic rounds to renegotiate trade agreements and financial arrangements, including how to deal with the many failed European banks and the broken bond markets. Skirmishes break out along contested national frontiers and the sea lanes become danger zones. Meanwhile, Europe’s people endure a severe slowdown in all business activity, loss of pensions, a broken social safety net, and a gross loss of trust in the political class. Populations grow restive. Indigenous Brits, Frenchmen, Germans, finally express their pent-up resentment with third world migrants and a movement grows to expel as many as possible back to their nations of origin. That sparks a violent response from the migrants, especially the jihad-inclined Islamists. It blossoms into medium-grade urban warfare. Militaries are called in to clean out the migrant ghettos and deport non-citizens. It is a high-tech Reconquista, but much more difficult than previous episodes on the continent, bloodier and less successful. In some localities, migrants gain the upper hand by sheer numbers. It could take decades to resolve this, if at all. There is even the possibility that some countires will be overtaken by Islam. The UK is a candidate for that. It has already shown abject submission, and it’s not going too far to imagine the Islamic population could attempt the extermination of native Britons. Many of their imams say as much out loud, one way or another, and the demoralized Brits do nothing about it If hostilities break out, I would not expect the USA to come to Europe’s rescue this time around. America is already showing signs of dissociating from Europe and NATO. It is in the NATO by-laws, for instance, that America is not obliged to defend countries that militate against support free speech, and there are already multiple aggressive censorship programs enacted around the continent. “X” was just fined $140-million by the European Commission for refusing to censor so-called “hate speech” — which is any sundry utterance that some low-level European bureaucrat deems offensive. Prediction: Macron, Merz, Starmer will be run out of office in the coming year one way or another. It will look a little like the year 1848 all over again, when revolt broke out all over the continent. The Marxists will be very active and aggressive, as ever, but they will ultimately lose. Nobody really wants to try communism again. The farmers, especially, have been in the vanguard of protest because of the EU’s onerous and idiotic regulatory regime. 1848 was mainly a revolt of urban industrial labor — the workers! Industry in 1848 was a pretty new thing at the grand scale. The deleterious effects on the laboring class came on quickly and had become too terrible to ignore. It reached a critical threshold before authorities were prepared for it. The next revolution will resolve initially into systems collapse, deep economic contraction, and continued population decline. Generalized, intractable hardship will become the new normal in Europe. Large nation states might de-consolidate, fracture into smaller autonomous regions, to keep public affairs manageable. Some regions may just get chaotic, and stay that way for a long time. Germany has only been a nation since 1871, prior to which it was a crazy-quilt of kingdoms, grand duchies, principalities, and free cities (e.g., Bremen, Frankfurt, Augsburg, Hamburg). The spectacular failure of liberal democracy in our time could easily usher in a period of autocracy — managers who can expedite problem-solving without the intercession of parliaments — and that might even mean a return to monarchy that actually rules. We thought that humanity had moved beyond that, but history is a prankster. Anyway, the USA will increasingly be an observer of all this from our remove across the Atlantic. For now, we are preoccupied with our own backyard. Return of the Monroe Doctrine A friend writes: “Trump has made the wise (and unavoidable) decision to recognize that we don’t and can’t rule the world, but we can be secure in the Western Hemisphere.” Already, under Mr. Trump, US foreign policy is recalibrating to clean up our own hemisphere — to make things a lot harder for China to surreptitiously colonize South America as a resource depot, to smash the drug cartels that are killing off Americans, bust the mafia-like governments associated with them, and aggressively discourage communist movements where they crop up. The obvious case-in-point just now is Venezuela and its long-running Chavez-to-Maduro regime, accused of hosting CCP operations, meddling in elections via internet fuckery in every place it can install Dominion / Smartmatic machines, offering a platform for Iran to antagonize the USA, expropriating US oil leases, and working hand-in-hand with Cuba’s intel services, Brazil’s Lula da Silva, and Mexico’s drug cartels to wage a new generation of warfare against the USA. Mr. Trump is going after Venezuela hard now. Don’t know how he’s going to bust up the place, exactly, but it’s coming, perhaps even without a whole lot of kinetic action. Prediction: a new government and new rules for Venezuela in 2026. US oil companies come back in and get the stuff back pumping. Venezuela gets the licensing fees, royalties, all above-board. Rule of law returns, including property law. Venezuelans can open businesses again. They send us major league baseball players instead of Tren de Agua gangsters and fentanyl. As a side effect of choking-off Venezuela, Cuba’s communist regime finally falls, too. They have depended utterly on Maduro’s oil and with the tankers blockaded, the island will soon go dark. The Castro brothers are gone. Communism, can no longer rely on their charisma. The current president of Cuba, Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez, is a nonentity. He will be overthrown in 2026, and for the first time in nearly 70 years, Cuba will be a free society. The election of Javier Milei in Argentina has turned that country back in the direction of economic liberty by severely paring down the size of parasitical government and all the racketeering associated with it that has dragged Argentina down since rise of Juan Peron and Peronism after World War Two. In October 2025, the Trump admin offered to help stabilize Argentina’s currency with a $20-billion currency swap line, conditioned on Milei’s ongoing free market reforms. His reforms will continue in 2026, lifting Argentina yet closer to its former status as one of the world’s richer nations. On December 14, 2025, Chile elected a conservative, Jose Antonio Kast, replacing the leftist government of Gabriel Boric. Kast’s election victory, with a 58-percent margin in the runoff against leftist candidate Jeannette Jara. This was a sharp rejection of Boric’s leftist administration, driven by crime, immigration, and economic dysfunction, leading to a significant rightward shift in Chilean politics. Kast’s victory aligns with a regional trend toward right-leaning leaders in Latin America, emphasizing security and migration controls. President Lula of Brazil represents an ongoing irritant to the USA. With Hugo Chavez and Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela, plus the Castro brothers, Lula organized the São Paulo Forum (Foro de São Paulo), a coordination platform for leftist political parties, movements, and organizations. You probably noticed that Lula’s 2020 election showed similar earmarks of fraud as “Joe Biden’s” election in the USA. Unlike “Biden” versus Trump, Lula managed to jail his rival, former president Jair Bolsonaro, whose party has been shattered. Prediction: Trump and Marco Rubio will work hard to neutralize the Foro de São Paulo’s operations across South America. Prediction: they will attempt to spring Bolsonaro from prison in time for the October 2026 election. Prediction: Lula will encounter strong, Trump-induced headwinds in the election. Mr. Trump is leaning hard on President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico to cease support of the drug cartels sending fentanyl into the USA. (Ha! How is that even plausible?) He’s gone as far as threatening to send American troops after the cartels’ headquarters in Mexico, and he imposed a 25-percent tariff on Mexican goods exported to the USA, but the duties were “paused” pending progress on border security and drug cooperation. At least, crossings of illegal migrants through Mexico has been reduced to near-zero on the cusp of 2026. Trump and Rubio would like to think they can work with Sheinbaum. Altogether, President Trump is reawakening interest in the America’s relations with South America after a long coma-like period of official inattention. He can already claim a substantial victory in reinstating American control over the Panama Canal with almost zero fanfare and no negative blowback. China still controls ports associated with the canal. They will probably be encouraged to sell those assets. In 2014, China broke ground symbolically for a new trans-oceanic canal through Nicaragua, estimated cost $50-billion. Since then, nothing has happened with it. The project remains suspended and no construction begun. China might be discerning that further colonialist activity in this hemisphere is a low-percentage, unwelcome move. Rampant Dragons and Rising Suns The far east is now a region of fully modernized sovereign states with high-tech armies, heavy industry, and rising prospects compared to Europe (now headed in the opposite direction), with China the biggest dog in the yard. China’s swift thirty-year lift out of something like 12th Century darkness has been an amazing spectacle, for sure. The USA is deeply intimidated by China’s manufacturing dominance, its technological prowess, and its growing military capability. There’s been plenty of loose talk about China’s “long game” aspiration to acquireNorth America as a resource depot. Sending tens of thousands of military-age men through “Joe Biden’s” open border 2021 to 2025 reinforced that worry. We still don’t know what they are up to here, what they are programmed to carry-out, and what we’re going to do about it. The news media isn’t paying attention to that for now. Many expect China to attempt some form of creeping world domination in the decades ahead. As Martin Armstrong put it (paraphrase): Cycles are a kind of religion in China, and they believe now is their turn in history. Yes, they probably think so. But I tend to view their rapid rise to world power as a self-limiting condition. We Americans know something about how quickly great techno-industrial surges can turn and go to shit. Just look around the midwestern rust-belt. The citizens of Detroit back in 1955 would be astonished at the current condition of what had been the seventh-richest city in the world then. A similar fate might await China, since it still depends so heavily on oil and natgas imports and coal-fired power plants. China also lacks the sturdy body of property law that tends to prevent hot battles over domains and the things of value built on them. For now, that authority is vested in the caprices of the CCP. But you must wonder how much possibly independent authority is lodged in the Peoples’ Liberation Army and its generals. Though the CCP has managed to remain in operation for a long time, it is not necessarily a permanent installation in the human condition. China’s population — which, by the way, is rumored to be well under the 1.4-billion claimed (estimated as low as 775-million now) — has been getting restive as the country’s industry matures and begins to show signs of similar sclerosis as seen in America. The financial condition of the country remains especially sketchy, since the CCP controls the banks and can stage-manage their outward appearances. Inside, Chinese banks are a vast chaos of janky loans based on a collateral of hopelessly crappy, fast-disintegrating high-rise apartments that China’s new middle class was swindled into buying for investment purposes, not to live in. Youth unemployment is trending at around 15-percent now. Prediction: expect more social unrest in China, with a destabilizing effect on the CCP’s ability to control events. The world’s attention tends to be focused on the fate of Taiwan, the island nation that was under direct Chinese mainland rule from 1683 to 1895, after which it was briefly swapped to Japan, who lost it in World War Two. In 1949, Chinese nationalists under Chiang Kai-Shek retreated to the island from Mao Zedong’s communists. It has evolved into a stable democratic republic and a high-tech manufacturing powerhouse. The USA is addicted to Taiwan’s computer chips, but then we are addicted to scores of products and resources from mainland still-communist China, too. It appears that the Trump admin is trying to wriggle out of that dilemma by re-industrializing the USA. Prediction: China, has been playing the long game as usual, and will keep hands-off Taiwan in 2026, while continuing to signal its control over whatever comes in and goes out of the island. China does not want to commit to a financially ruinous war over Taiwan at this moment of financial instability on the mainland. Prediction: The long game doesn’t pan out. This will be Xi Jinping’s last year as leader of China. Economic turmoil will prompt the CCP to replace him, and serial replacements won’t last. China slips and drifts as no one can consolidate power. India slips and drifts too, unable to overcome its predicament of reliance on imported oil and foreign investment. Prediction: Narendra Modi loses his grip on power. India’s economy falters and the subcontinent begins to fracture into regions. All major nations of Southeast Asia struggle to stay afloat on the cheap labor manufacturing boom largely pegged to a wobbling global economy with the US as consumer of the first-and-last resort. Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia will all come under a strain in 2026 as their factories idle. Radical groups begin to rise and challenge established power bases. Things go sideways. Global Jihad They’re not subtle about it. Islamic Jihad advertises itself loudly at the local grass-roots level. Imams in the UK, France, Germany, Dearborn (MI), all proclaim that the places they have migrated to will become Muslim-dominated. New York’s new mayor, Zohran Mamdani says he believes in global jihad. For mysterious reasons, this seems to tickle the uber-woke liberals of the Upper West Side who voted for Mamdani. The Jihadis shout about the death of America, the death of Western Civ, the death of all who are not Islamists. It’s woven into the Muslim theology. Muslims who kill “infidels” get super brownie-points in the permission structure of Islam. The west has rolled over for this malevolent nonsense for some years now, and it is all coming to a head in 2026. Prediction: EU nations and the UK will begin deporting recent illegal migrants back to where they came from, starting slowly and accelerating as resistance and violence by the designated deportees (and their allies) make it ever clearer that it is an existential necessity to get them out — and beef up their coastline protections so that new migrants cannot enter. Mostly freelance non-state Jihadis will attempt bloody operations against the property and interests of the deporting nations. They will bomb and massacre inside EU countries (likely here in America, too), and outside America against embassies and corporate property. Prediction: The mass deportations will mark a major turnaround in the West, and will be accompanied by changes in government, including the dissolution of the EU bureaucracy itself. Brussells, Belgium, the EU headquarters city, with a large Muslim population, will be a violent hot-spot. Islamism will begin to be turned back. Street protests only just erupted in Iran after Christmas, and are reaching impressive levels quickly. It’s too early to say where it is going. New Year’s Day, businesses, schools, and government offices were shut down — but, the holiday and all. Growing severe water shortages might be behind the unrest as much as dissatisfaction with decades of mullah rule. Trump and the US Domestic Scene At holiday time late in 2025, after nearly a year of exhilarating and tumultuous Trump 2.0 activity, a dark cloud swept over MAGA and many Trump supporters started gobbling up black pills and getting super-depressed. The assassination of Charlie Kirk tripped a lot of that off. It was a significant event. In a nation where reality is now optional for many groups and individuals, every niche of uncertainty and doubt gets filled with narrative battles that harden fear and paranoia. Oddly, with so much of the Woke Left pimping for Hamas the past two years against Israel, elements of the MAGA Right picked up that gonfalon and ran with it, too — led by podcasters Candace Owens, Nick Fuentes, and Tucker Carlson. Candace put out the idea that Israel killed Charlie, and many others just twanged against Israel on the general principle that Israel showers too much money on congressmen and senators — and that the executive branch is too cozy with the Jewish state — and, of course, Gaza (“Genocide.”) So now, you have both the Wokesters and part of MAGA hatin’ on Israel. A lot of this heat was probably generated by the RINO / NeverTrumper branch of the Republican Party seeking to wrassle back its hegemony over the party’s electoral apparatus from Trump / MAGA forces. Ron DeSantis is the RINO / NeverTrumper stalking horse, with that gang setting-up a potential switcheroo for JD Vance’s expected run in 2028. The bottom line, as advanced by the inimitable “Sundance” writing at The Last Refuge blogspot is that the RINO / NeverTrumper gang actually wants to lose the 2026 midterms so that Mr. Trump will be hamstrung for the remainder of his term. Prediction: MAGA has strategic and tactical capabilities that shouldn’t be underestimated. They will fight hard against their in-party enemies moving through the coming year and the fight will reveal the bad intentions of their enemies. Meanwhile, on the other front, the Trump admin is working hard to sever the NGO revenue lines that support the Democratic Party’s shock troops, Antifa, what remains of BLM, the lawfare ninjas, the From-the-River-to-the-Sea crowd, and assorted cadres of the mentally ill. The DOJ, along with its subsidiary, the FBI, is preparing to go medieval on these groups. AAG Harmeet Dhillon is turning the mojo of her Civil Rights division against anarchists who operated freely under “Joe Biden” — and they will liberally use the “domestic terrorist” tag to make this happen. AAG Dhillon is also keeping pressure on the colleges and universities that permitted Jihad on-campus and will take the federal funding away from the grownups who run these joints — who stand by and do nothing in the face of violence and intimidation. Prediction: Anti-Israel activism has gone as far as it can go and will start tailing off now as Israel’s operations in Gaza rachet down. Hamas is defeated. That’s a plain fact. It’s over over there. The surviving Palestinians will be living under a protectorate that requires them to give up devoting themselves to terror. As averred to previously, Jihad will not be greeted favorably in the USA, whether in Mamdani’s New York City or Ilhan Omar’s Minneapolis. MAGA will screw its head back on and re-focus on our country’s priorities: rebuilding productive infrastructure, carefully dismantling rogue financialization like the colossal IED it is, rescuing the American family from Woke depradations, making the people healthy again, reestablishing a coherent consensus on culture, values, right-and-wrong, and getting violence out of public life. The biggest head-wind that Trump faces, of course, is a sociopathic Democratic Party that will do anything to return to power and resume its racketeering operations. Prediction: In 2026, many of their point-persons, past-and-present, will be headed into a courtroom, possibly to a guilty verdict for conspiracy to overthrow the government and other serious charges, such as election fraud. “Joe Biden’s” blanket pardons will be declared illegitimate by SCOTUS due to the profligate use of the autopen by “JB’s” reckless subordinates (some of whom will also land in court). Higher-ups in the health agencies who took part in the Covid-19 operation will also find themselves in legal jeopardy, including the Covid Pimpernel himself, Dr. Anthony Fauci, if he remains alive. Some military figures such as general Milley will face charges. Nothing less than a comprehensive cleanup will do. If Mr. Trump lets the seditions continue, he’ll be buffaloed for the next three years just like the first time around. It’s possible that he will have to invoke a national emergency in order to overcome the resistance of the lawfare federal judge coterie. And I would not feel too sanguine about the members of Nancy Pelosi’s J-6 House Committee, or Ms. Pelosi herself in connection with the FBI / Democratic Party J-6 fake insurrection prank at the Capitol itself. Justice is coming before the 2026 midterms. Finance and Economy Mr. Trump’s biggest headwind is the ever-jankier finance sector of the US economy, a horrific, mold-like overgrowth that has sickened the country with hyper-complex trickery around debt and capital. Too many faithless promises have been made to pay back debts that will never be paid back. And too much wealth has migrated into a few elite hands on the back of those false promises. Too much collateral is mispriced and over-priced, and the re-pricing is liable to be rather violent. At the top are x-quadrillions of derivative positions — bets that could wreck global banking if they go wrong. Then the overpriced equity markets and the bond markets. If enough of that stuff goes south there will be broken pension funds, very few surviving banks, and what’s left of the Boomer generation gets financially wiped out. This late in the game, it’s hard to see how that can be averted. If it plays out, you will see widespread hardship that makes the Great Depression of the 1930s look like one bad day at the races. Trump & Company know that this debacle is ‘out there’ like a Cat-5 hurricane spinning in the Gulf Stream. They are trying to run a practical work-around program of re-industrializing the country so we can become a production-based society for the broad middle rather than a game-playing economy for the hedge-fund bunch. They are using strong-arm tactics with other nations to get reindustrialization paid-for with foreign investment and tariffs. It’s a tough play because reinvestment and rebuilding can’t happen overnight. It’s a long-game, too. And in the short-term the financial games are getting ready to blow. Much depends on how SCOTUS rules on the president’s Article II power to use tariffs as an instrument of foreign policy. The president claims he has work-arounds in the event that the decision goes against him. If SCOTUS does rule against Trump on tariff power and dismantles what he has put in place in 2025, the markets, banks, and currencies will wobble and crash. Their decision is a game of Russian roulette, and you can be sure they know it. You’ll see headlines such as: SCOTUS Destroys Global Economy. Prediction: SCOTUS won’t dare disable Mr. Trump’s tariff weapon. Decision in early spring. The longer they drag it out, the more potential damage. Let’s say there is some sort of crash in 2026, anyway. The equity markets teeter at super-record highs. There is a complete departure in trendlines between the financial part of the economy and the on-the-ground economy of businesses and services that have become increasingly unaffordable. Cars, apartments, groceries, medical stuff, you know: the basics. So far, reindustrialization remains a plan, a dream. Very few of those factory jobs have materialized and the in the immortal words of the late Tom Petty, the waiting is the hardest part. Sidebar: The Specter of AI A lot of the money in equity markets is pouring into Artificial Intelligence (AI), mainly the insanely overpriced Nvidia. AI is supposed to be the engine of the next tech revolution. I demur. I suspect it will disappoint. It will not make our lives better, it will, at best, just make a lot of common operations in daily life more frustrating by removing humans from the equation; and, at worst, it will destroy the human race. I tend to see it flopping on the ‘at best’ side. Your life has already been made worse by computer interventions in daily life, case-in-point: your attempts to contact a business. Computers cut you off at the pass. . . poorly designed phone “tree” answering programs waste hours of your time before they completely fuck up whatever transaction you attempt: a dinner reservation, a product return, a complaint to the Internet service, an attempt to get your medical lab report. Applied AI will only spread that nonsense into every other available niche in your existence. Nothing will work. No one will answer. And that can only go on so long before you get a revolution, a social collapse, a systems apocalypse, a one-way ticket back to the medieval. Coupla other obvious failure-points in the AI dream: 1) As AI increasingly “trains” on material created by AI, it becomes a self-referential hallucination of false data. You won’t be able to rely on anything it “thinks,” or any task it is assigned to carry out. And that doesn’t include its potential for going rogue and developing evil intentions of its own. And 2) The obvious strain on electric power generation, the grid. Investments in new electric generating capacity may be greater than any economic return from AI, whether the added power is nuclear or something more amazingly new and exotic that hasn’t been invented yet. Plus, AI server requirements are already making electric service unaffordable for everyday people. Economically, the thing begins to look like a mirage, including the titanic investments being made in it. Finally, imagine the psychological effect of generalized AI failure. It will put the basic notion of technological progress into a fatal funk as the human race has to go back to the drawing-board and find some other way to keep economic growth going in a finite world. Anyway, a financial train wreck can take different forms, depending on how the authorities respond to the first tremors. Could be a failure of our currency, the dollar, and steeper inflation, where you have a lot of money that has little value and can’t buy much. Could be a massive deflation in which debt failure is acknowledged and money dissipates, leaving behind a scant supply of money that still has value, but not enough to go around. . . meaning many people are just broke. Stock and bond market blowups will just be manifestations of these basic financial illnesses, failures of faith really. Prediction: We do get a crash in equities and bonds. Mr. Trump has to take on the FDR role in a hurry. It might require yet another kind of national emergency to allow a restructuring of US finance that protects the broad middle class from penury. It will take some luck for Mr. Trump to find a way to accomplish this restructuring, but Donald Trump has experienced this kind of brush with ruin personally and he knows how a calamity like this can be turned around. We’ll have to stand by to see how he plays it, how it plays him, and how history plays him and us. It will have to include novel moves besides just the same old federal reserve money-printing a shuck-and-jive. Prediction: expect real novelties, like abolishing the Federal Reserve altogether and reassigning money-issuance to the US Treasury, using a partially gold-backed dollar. Mr. Trump is already making noises about abolishing the federal income tax altogether. And there’s no question that he would love a chance to severely cut down the size and scope of the federal government so, at least, everyday people can carry on in businesses without many of the onerous regulatory burdens that make everything so difficult now. A financial emergency would require a comprehensive reform of health-care including the dismantling of hospital cartels, insurance behemoths, and all the nonsensical bureaucracy that has turned every doctors’ office into something that looks like the Department of Motor Vehicles. The Oil Scene and Energy Superficially, the numbers paint a sanguine picture, but like the black gold itself, the story lurks below the surface. The US Energy Information Agency shows total US oil production for 2025 at an all-time record high of 13.61-million barrels-a-day (b/d). The agency predicts just a bit under that for 2026: 13.53-million b/d. The US-EIA is traditionally optimistic. Americans want cheap oil and they want lots of it. The shale oil “miracle” has delivered a lotta oil as President Trump might say. We’ve been stupendously fortunate the past decade-and-a-half. Some big howevers, however. Shale oil is very expensive to get out of the ground with horizontal drilling, fracking, trucked-in frack water, chemicals, and special fracking sand. It requires very fancy financing, and the state of finance (that is, lending) generally looks shaky going forward. The oil industry has always been a precarious business. The current price of $57-a-barrel (West Texas Crude) is not high enough to provide a return-on-investment for most operators. Break-even lies between $70-90 a barrel. Lenders are reluctant to lend where there is a poor prospect for return-on-investment. But, of course, Americans demand cheap gasoline and low oil prices destroy the companies that are supposed to deliver the cheap gasoline. It’s a predicament with no easy answer. The current numbers suggest the US has finally entered a production plateau preceding major decline by 2028. The drilling rig count in the Permian Basin in late 2025 was 20 to 25 percent lower than in 2024, from 308 active rigs in 2024 to 246 rigs as of Dec 19, 2025. The Permian Basin accounts for nearly half of all US drilling rigs. The US-EIA also expects the average oil price for 2026 to hover at $55 average, lower than the all-year average $69 for 2025. Prediction: under those circumstances, a lower rig-count will bring some oil company bankruptcies, plus accelerating depletion because Permian Basin shale oil wells decline by 70 percent after the first year and lower rig counts mean fewer new wells to replace that lost production. Drill baby, drill is a nice rallying cry, but it would be years before any production could come out of Alaska’s ANWR fields, if ever. If US oil companies return to Venezuela, global supply will go up and the price of oil could decline further. As for the vaunted green energy revolution, independent analyst Art Berman, refers to this as “Renewable Derangement Syndrome: the belief that an ‘energy transition’ is well underway, despite clear evidence to the contrary. It’s the conviction that solar panels and wind turbines are replacing fossil fuels at scale when, in fact, renewables remain a rounding error in global energy supply.” Gold and Silver These things used to be money for thousands of years. For the past hundred years, the financial authorities called it a “barbarous relic.” Now, gold and silver are back, sort of, but first in the role of messenger. Surely, you’ve noticed that gold zoomed from just over $2600/oz to $4500/oz through 2025, while silver moved from $29/oz to $80/oz just after Christmas 2025. Epic moves (followed by a sharp correction New Year’s week). Supposedly, the silver market is super-agitated by the industrial need for silver in electric cars, robot electronics, and the hardware for AI. That’s part of the story. While there are plenty of technical factors, cycle explanations, and parties still manipulating the market price of precious metals, the main message of the metals must be an apprehension of social and political upheaval ahead. Metals move when people are afraid that the basic social contract is falling apart. . . that war might be coming. Everything in this forecast has spoken of unrest, upheaval, inflection points, and the circulation of elites. Gold and silver are what people turn to when they lose confidence in the institutions that stand behind money, namely governments and central banks. They also lose trust in things that purport to represent money. Those things all have counterparties lodged in the agreements around debt. Our debt-based money system is delaminating, with the various layers peeling off into worthlessness: mortgages, loans, bond obligations, etc. The counterparties are the persons or entities who offered the loan and the persons or entity who can’t pay back the loan. When that breaks, when loans don’t get paid back, money vanishes. Gold and silver don’t have counterparties, they just. . . are. They embody the work and energy that went into finding them, digging them out, smelting them, and assaying them, and that’s all. Central banks around the world have been buying up gold and silver with increasing avidity because nations are moving to currencies that are at least partially backed by precious metals. Such a move will severely cut down the issuance of loans, especially loans used to leverage investment positions in other financial instruments — that is, to blow market bubbles. Prediction: sometime in late 2026, gold will arrive at $7,500 and silver will rise to $150 or $200. Paper currencies pegged to nothing but vaporous claims of the full faith and credit of the government, or the backing of an imperial navy, have been the norm for several generations. Sometimes, the bottom falls out of your norm bucket, and you have to make new mental arrangements. In a gold-backed money ecosystem, the opportunities for many kinds of financial legerdemain expire. Swindles are still possible, but as far less complex con-jobs. Further prediction: if this effort fails and paper currencies can no longer be trusted at all, everyday transactions might devolve to circulating silver coin, for a while, anyway, in which case the standard of living will be a whole lot lower for everybody. Bitcoin It is nothing more than the fugazy of all fugazies. It has no essential, discernable, real value. It’s astonishing that it got this far, but it is more complex than a tulip bulb and hyper-complexity appeals to people in finance. It creates evermore opportunities for swindles and frauds. Even if blockchain technology itself has some value, Bitcoin is still a worthless fugazy, sustained only by the general climate of psychosis in finance. As the psychosis lifts, Bitcoin’s value will sink. Prediction: by the third quarter of 2026, Bitcoin is back below $25,000 and headed for extinction. Concluding Notes As usual, apologies for going on so long. 2026 will require more than the usual fortitude, especially for those stuck in conventional investments and who are gurgling under water on mortgages and other loans. On the political front: expect broad and serious prosecutions of many known villains who, one way and another, tried to overthrow the republic since 2016. Unlike just about everybody else in the forecasting business, I don’t believe the Democratic Party will be able to take back the House of Representatives or the US Senate in the 2026 midterms. They have left too wide a slime trail of corruption, avarice, lunacy, and treason. Lastly, a salute to the intrepid President Donald J. Trump, for all his faults, a true American hero.

Pennsylvania saw thousands of workers lose their jobs in 2025 as dozens of companies submitted Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notifications to the Pennsylvania Department of Labor & Industry this year, informing the state of large layoffs. The closing of Crozer Health resulted in 2,651 people being laid off. The collapse of Rite Aid led to more than 1,000 corporate employees being laid off. The number of Rite Aid employees laid off was much higher, considering the company closed more than 300 stores in the state in 2025. Workplaces with fewer than 50 employees aren’t required to notify the state. The federal WARN Act offers protection to workers, their families, and communities by requiring employers to provide a 60-day notice of mass layoffs or business closings involving a large number of layoffs. Enforcement of the WARN Act falls under the U.S. Department of Labor. Typically, an employer must submit a notice to the state if it will shut down a plant and the shutdown will result in a job loss for 50 or more employees during any 30-day period. Employers also must give notice if they plan to lay off 500 or more employees in a 30-day period or if they will be laying off at least 50 people and those people represent at least 33 percent of their active workforce. Please note that some of the layoffs listed below have not happened yet, but the WARN notices were filed earlier this year. While most WARN notices are permanent, there are times when they are temporary and times when the affected employees are hired immediately by another company taking over a contract. All of the employers below announced layoffs of at least 250 people in Pennsylvania in 2025: SPS Technologies - 251 Located at: 301 Highland Ave., Abington Township, Montgomery County, near Jenkintown The manufacturing company, which produces fasteners and other materials for the aviation industry, laid off 251 people after a fire broke out at its plant earlier this year. “This layoff is a result of the unforeseeable business circumstances and economic downturn caused by the fire at our facility on February 17, 2025,” the company said in the WARN notice. Fourth Street Barbecue - 252 Located at: 3 Arentzen Blvd., Speers, Washington County, near Charleroi The company laid off 252 people. Spark Therapeutics - 298 Located at: The biotechnology research company laid off 298 employees at the three locations in Philadelphia. In addition, some remote employees were laid off as well. Instant Web - 298 Located at: 100 Industrial Drive, Tilden Township, Berks County, near Hamburg Instant Web, doing business as IWCO laid off 298 people due to a closing. The company is based in Minnesota and provides advertising services. Corelle Brands - 323 Located at: 12000 Molly Pitcher Highway, Antrim Township, near Greencastle, Franklin County Glassware and dishware company Corelle Brands, formerly known as Instant Brands, laid off 323 people due to a closing. Corelle’s brands include Instant, Corelle, Pyrex, Corningware, Snapware and Chicago Cutlery. Wilson Creek Energy - 332 Located at: Wilson Creek Energy/Corsa Coal filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January and laid off 332 people at the 11 locations in March. The company produces metallurgical coal. Comprehensive Logistics - 365 Located at: 609 Memory Lane, Springettsbury Township, York County The company laid off 365 people in September at the location. IG Design Group Americas - 383 Located at: IG Design Group Americas closed three facilities and laid off 383 people on Aug. 26. Design Group Americas designs, manufactures, sources and distributes a variety of products in the seasonal, stationery, gift, craft and toy categories. The Berwick-area plant manufactured bows and ribbons as well as materials used in the floral industry. The company said at the time that it was selling its business segments while winding down its manufactured woven ribbon products business. “Like many companies in the consumer products sector, DGA has been navigating a challenging operating landscape for several years, compounded by the loss of a major customer, who entered liquidation and significantly impacted DGA’s revenue as well as new trade tariffs imposed in 2025 that increased operational costs, affected pricing strategies, and contributed to reduced customer orders,” the company said in a news release. “The Company’s decision to pursue an in-court process was driven by liquidity constraints, substantial working capital requirements, and the seasonal nature of significant portions of its business.” The “major customer” that entered into liquidation was JoAnn, according to the retail industry publication, RetailDive. Amazon - 432 Located at: 17 William Drive, Findlay Township, Allegheny County, near Imperial Amazon laid off 432 people — 273 regular associates and 159 seasonal associates whose temporary assignments were ending — due to a planned renovation project at the facility. The layoffs took place on March 12. The company said employees who accepted internal transfer opportunities at Amazon prior to March 12 would not be laid off. Oak View Group - 522 Located at: 150 Rouse Boulevard, Philadelphia The company’s contract at Citizens Bank Park for the Philadelphia Phillies will end on Dec. 31, 2025. The company provides housekeeping and general maintenance operations for the Philadelphia Phillies at Citizens Bank Park. The company told state officials its contract wasn’t renewed. The Oak View Group told the state it has 522 employees, of which 500 are part-time and are under a collective bargaining agreement. Oak View Group services multiple venues in the Philadelphia area and officials said it welcomed employees to apply for other positions in the region. Cleveland-Cliffs - 664 Located at: The company closed both steel plants. Cleveland-Cliffs laid off 68 salaried employees and 491 bargaining unit workers at the Steelton plant. The 151-year-old Steelton plant produced rails that carry freight and passengers, along with steel for heavy machinery, power generation plants and military applications such as submarines. “Weak demand and insufficient pricing for the products produced at our Steelton steelmaking facility has led Cleveland-Cliffs to conclude that this facility is not economically viable in the current market conditions,” the company said in a WARN notice. The company laid off 10 salaried employees and 97 bargaining unit workers at its plate finishing plant in Montgomery County. United Natural Foods Located at: 4255 E. Independence Drive in North Whitehall Township, Lehigh County, near Schnecksville Food wholesaler United Natural Foods closed the distribution center and laid off 717 people. Among the employees were 172 truck drivers. The distribution center closure is due to UNFI ending its agreement to provide services for Key Food. Rhode Island-based UNFI provided the following statement at the time to PennLive: “Recently, UNFI and Key Food mutually agreed to transition Key Food’s conventional grocery products business in the Northeast to another wholesaler. We believe this transition will be a better fit for Key Food and allows UNFI to exit an unprofitable relationship. At UNFI, we are continuously evaluating our distribution network to ensure we are serving our customers and suppliers as efficiently and effectively as possible. As part of these efforts, we will be ending operations at our Allentown distribution center in July 2025 and will transition these customers and suppliers to nearby distribution centers in our network. Moving Allentown’s volume to nearby DCs will enable us to serve our local partners in an efficient and sustainable way going forward." Crothall and Morrison Healthcare Located at: 3400 Spruce St., Philadelphia (Penn Medicine) Crothall and Morrison Healthcare is laying off 795 people. The layoffs were announced in 2025 but won’t take place until Feb. 1, 2026. Rite Aid Located at: The drugstore chain filed for bankruptcy a second time in May and went out of business in September. The company laid off 501 people who worked at or reported to the Valley Green Office Facility at 200 Newberry Commons. The drugstore chain also laid off 595 people who reported to the company’s headquarters at 1200 Intrepid Ave. Rite Aid said the following in the WARN notices: “Rite Aid only recently received notice from a significant vendor shortening and restricting payment terms, which could cause Rite Aid’s loan to our lenders to be accelerated,” the company said in the WARN notice. “Rite Aid’s lenders have informed us that they will not provide future funding for Rite Aid to cover payroll and employment related expenses if we retain the entirety of our current workforce.” “As a result, we have no choice but to conduct employee separations at this time to enable us to continue to meet anticipated future payroll and employment related expenses.” “In addition, the dramatic downturn in the economy, potential litigation, and increased costs (including tariffs) from our suppliers and landlords have necessitated employee separations that were unforeseen, as we were actively seeking funding and pursuing several alternative strategic transactions with the hope that this action could be avoided or postponed.” Crozer Health In what was one of the largest layoffs in recent years in the Keystone State, the hospital system closed multiple locations in Pennsylvania and 2,621 people were laid off. At least one county, two cities and a township issued emergency declarations following the hospital closing. Prospect Medical Holdings filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas. Initially, a buyer agreed to purchase the operations, but later backed out of the deal. Prospect then reached an agreement with the state to appoint a receiver to take over the strategic decision-making and finances of Prospect for the Pennsylvania facilities from Feb. 5 to March 5. The agreement was later extended to April 18. On April 9, Prospect said it received an offer from the University of Pennsylvania Health System, which intended to provide $5 million in funding, the majority of which would be a donation to Prospect, to allow for a further extension of time to reach an agreement on a purchase of the Pennsylvania facilities. On April 17, Prospect said it was informed that the donation would no longer be available to allow for the extension. With no buyer and no additional funding, Prospect said it was forced to close operations and permanently lay off all employees at its facilities in Chester and Delaware counties. The closings took place in April. At the time, Chester Mayor Stefan Roots had signed an emergency declaration for the city in response to the Prospect’s closing announcement. “City Council and I are devastated by this crisis, and we are taking every possible step to address the negative impact this closure will have on the City of Chester and its residents,” Roots said. “We are actively working with the receiver and his team to identify viable solutions that will ensure our residents continue to have access to prompt emergency medical services, which will be impacted by Prospect’s irresponsible actions.” Daniel Urie is an award-winning business reporter for the PA Media Group/PennLive/The Patriot-News.

Title: Vitalik Buterin maps Ethereum’s 2026 rebellion against centralised ‘overlords’

About us Copy link Ethereum is charging into 2026 with a manifesto — not a roadmap. That message comes directly from co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who said that Ethereum is the “rebellion” against “centralised overlords.” “We’re building decentralised applications,” Buterin said on X. “Applications that run without fraud, censorship or third-party interference.” The $365 billion blockchain network aims to be “civilisational infrastructure” that can resist censorship, service intermediaries, and corporate dominance, he said. “These properties sound radical,” he wrote, “but we must remember that a generation ago any wallet, kitchen appliance, book or car would fulfill every single one of them.” Buterin’s note comes as power and wealth in the technology industry become increasingly concentrated in the hands of just a few top corporate players from Silicon Valley, who are all highly centralised. The Mag 7 US tech companies, such as Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Meta Platforms, Nvidia, and Tesla, are now worth more than the combined stock markets of Japan, Canada, and the UK. “Ethereum is the rebellion against this,” Buterin said. “Fortunately, we have powerful tools on our side,” he wrote. “But we need to apply them, and we will.” Buterin may be championing Ethereum’s decentralised nature, but many of the banks, traditional financial firms and fintechs exploring launching stablecoins are doing so on the Ethereum blockchain — letting centralised companies use the digital ledger. Ethereum is kicking off the new year trading nearly 40% below its August all-time high of $4,950. Investors in recent months have been relentlessly dumping exchange-traded funds backed by the second-largest crypto. DefiLlama data shows $616 million in Ethereum ETF selling in December, adding to November’s $1.4 billion in liquidations. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 stock index is still hovering near all-time highs. Other assets, such as gold, are also pushing to record highs amid strong macroeconomic tailwinds. To be sure, Ethereum has plenty of bullish institutional supporters. Tom Lee, chairman of digital asset treasury firm Bitmine, said on X that he expects Ethereum to have a good 2026. “Gold moves lead crypto,” Lee said. “If these large commodity markets make such a move, how can one be skeptical of digital assets in 2026?” Lance Datskoluo is DL News’ Europe-based markets correspondent.

Title: Russia’s little-known $13bn crypto secret set for 2026 takeoff
URL: https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/russias-little-known-13bn-crypto-secret/
Time Published: 2026-01-02T09:35:52Z

About us Copy link Russians are warming to crypto, encouraged by the country’s banks and regulators. And they’re using cutting-edge solutions to build an investment ecosystem that can sidestep Western sanctions, past, present, or future. For Moscow, the future of finance is digital — and it lives on a blockchain. But while they’ve turned to traditional digital assets like Bitcoin, analysts expect a Russian take on tokenised securities and commodities, industrial Bitcoin mining, and crypto derivatives to take off in 2026. Digital financial assets, Russia‘s take on the buzzy tokenisation trend also called DFAs, have grown by over a third to become a $13 billion market in 2025, the Russian central bank estimates. But unlike many of the tokenised commodities traded in the West, they’re built on private blockchains and can only be traded on domestic platforms that hold central bank-issued permits. They now sit at the centre of Russia’s blockchain-powered economic expansion plans. DFA issuers have released tokens tied to the value of everything from cocoa beans to St. Petersburg real estate. The total volume of Russian DFA placements in the first nine months of 2025 increased by 33%, Vitaly Plotnikov, the deputy director of the central bank’s financial market infrastructure department, told Russian news agency Interfax in early December. Yields on short-term DFAs this year exceeded short-term bond yields by an average of 1.7%, he added. And it’s set to grow. In early December, Anatoly Aksakov, the head of the State Duma’s commission on the financial markets and the chief architect of Russia’s crypto legislation, said boosting the DFA market will be a key economic priority for Moscow in 2026. Aksakov added that the government aims to achieve tax parity for DFA investors in 2026, placing them on the same tax footing as traditional bondholders. “This will allow the DFA market to grow significantly, attract money for longer periods, and accumulate resources for business and economic development,” Aksakov said. Moscow has granted operating licences to 16 more Russian firms since Atomyze issued its first DFA, according to Russian central bank data. While most of these license-holders are banks, in August, the bank also granted a DFA-issuing license to a startup named Madrigal, which offers DFA issuance-as-a-service products. The Moscow Exchange, or MOEX, and Russian banks are also championing so-called crypto derivatives. As Russians cannot buy shares in popular US-based Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, MOEX and major banks have launched their own funds. ’The central bank has expressed a readiness to introduce new cryptocurrency regulations.‘ Those funds track the prices of popular BlackRock offerings, such as the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF. The popularity of these products has ballooned since they launched in the summer. After breaking MOEX trading volume records in September, crypto futures trading volumes on MOEX reached $636 million, a new record for futures contracts, the Russian publication Tsargrad reported. Crypto derivatives look set to grow rapidly in 2026. MOEX, the St. Petersburg Exchange and major banks — such as T-Bank, Alfa-Bank, and Sberbank — have all either launched their own crypto derivatives this year, or plan to do so in early 2026. While the central bank has previously tried to ensure only super-rich, “super-qualified” investors can buy crypto-related products, the government wants to make them more accessible. And the central bank is accommodating. “The central bank has expressed a readiness to introduce new cryptocurrency regulations,” Aksakov said. Major lenders are ready to take a step further and are waiting for permission to let their customers trade Bitcoin directly from their banking apps. Bitcoin mining is another core crypto sector set to grow in Russia in 2026. Dmitry Stupin, Vice President of the Russian Association of Cryptoindustry and Blockchain for Electricity Generation, told the Russian news agency TASS in November that mining volumes in Russia would recover to their 2024 peak of 2.1 to 2.2 GW in 2026 after dropping to around 1.7 GW in 2025. Stupin said that as industrial miners start using their own gas-fired power generation and upgrade their rigs, miners are set to return to their 2024 highs. The prediction does not seem far-fetched. After all, electricity is relatively cheap in energy-abundant Russia, and the cooling costs required to prevent mining rigs from overheating are minimal in famously cold regions like Siberia. Industrial mining was born in Southern Siberia in 2017, with the launch of the mining firm BitRiver. Since then, scores of competitors have emerged. In August 2024, President Vladimir Putin signed a law legalising industrial crypto mining. This paved the way for institutional and private investors to enter industrial crypto mining. In August, mining chiefs told the Russian media outlet RBC that it was only “a matter of time” before a major Russian mining company would seek a listing on MOEX.

Title: Solana enters 2026 with last-minute boost in RWA momentum

Solana finished the year with record tokenized RWA activity and strong inflows into Solana ETFs, which could push SOL toward new highs in 2026. Cointelegraph in your social feed Solana appears poised to expand from its memecoin-focused, retail-dominant network this year, after posting record real-world asset tokenization activity in December. Data from RWA.xyz shows the value of tokenized RWAs on Solana increased nearly 10% over the last month to a record-high $873.3 million, while the number of Solana RWA token holders rose over 18.4% to 126,236 over the same timeframe. The majority of these RWAs back US Treasuries, such as the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund and the Ondo US Dollar Yield, which boast market caps of $255.4 million and $175.8 million, respectively. New tokenized stocks like Tesla xStock and Nvidia xStock are also rising, at $48.3 million and $17.6 million, respectively, while institutional funds are also being tokenized on Solana. Solana is poised to become the third blockchain to exceed $1 billion in tokenized RWAs, behind Ethereum at $12.3 billion and BNB Chain, which recently passed $2 billion. Last month, crypto asset manager Bitwise predicted Solana would set a new all-time high should the US pass the market-structure-focused CLARITY Act in 2026. Related: Can Solana shed its memecoin image in 2026? If it passes, Bitwise expects crypto tokenization will take off, with Solana being one of the biggest winners from that upward trend: “We’re bullish on Ethereum and Solana. Really bullish. Primarily because we think stablecoins and tokenization are megatrends, and Ethereum and Solana are likely to be the biggest beneficiaries of that growth.” Solana (SOL) enters 2026 at a significantly lower price than it began 2025, trading around $125 versus roughly $190 this time last year. SOL is also over 57% off the $293.3 all-time high it set on Jan. 19, 2025, while Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) set their all-time highs more recently — October and August — and are currently trading much closer to those prices. Solana's legitimacy in the institutional space strengthened in late October when the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first lot of now six spot Solana exchange-traded funds. Those Solana products have combined for $765 million in inflows, Farside Investors data shows. Also in October, international remittance giant Western Union chose Solana to build its stablecoin settlements platform on for its more than 150 million customers, spread across over 200 countries and territories. It is expected to roll out in the first half of 2026. Solana is leading all blockchains in app revenue, proving it can generate high income even when memecoin activity slows. Over the past 30 days, it raked in over $110 million, far ahead of second-place Hyperliquid at $61.1 million and nearly double Ethereum’s $47.2 million, DeFiLlama data shows.

Title: Entertainment and Media Bloodbath Widened in 2025: 17,000 Jobs Slashed

Time Published: 2026-01-01T20:20:00Z
Full Content:
The year 2025 was a bloodbath for film, streaming, television, and news workers in Hollywood as the media continued its downward spiral from its once commanding position as a leading American institution. The Wrap reports that television and film lost upwards to 17,000 jobs in 2025, a loss 18 percent higher than last year. News divisions, for instance, cut about 2,254 jobs across television, film, broadcast, news and streaming services through November of 2025. The loss, though, fell below the 4,537 job losses in 2024. “The most cited reason for layoffs was restructuring and industry consolidation,” the Wrap added. The FCC approved the merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media and as the year came to a close Warner Bros. Discovery also began its move to merge with whatever outfit will end up buying it in the coming year. But job loss was a constant across it all. Even Disney continued its trend of mass layoffs despite still holding out on its own. The layoffs will continue, too, and Artificial Intelligence might be to blame for much of it. According to the World Economic Forum, 41 percent of companies worldwide will lay off workers over the next five years because they intend to begin increasing reliance on AI technology. One example is the workforce depletion at Amazon, which castoff 14,000 employees in October. This AI issue has already cost tens of thousands of current and future jobs in Hollywood, analysts say. A report from June noted that as many as 200,000 Hollywood jobs will either be lost or won’t ever be created thanks to AI. Still, some new jobs will undoubtedly be created because of AI as some workers will be needed to control the tech. Regardless, The Wrap added that 71,000 layoffs occurred in 2025 thanks to AI. At year’s end, the biggest loser appears to be Paramount, which shed 2,000 employees. Comcast’s Versant cable shed 150, which was seven percent of its workforce, and Disney laid off less than 800 across its various holdings and divisions worldwide, The Wrap continued. After years of heavier layoffs, Warner Bros. only shed about 100 across its cable holdings. But that will certainly tick upward once WBD is bought out next year. In fact, some analysts expect WBD to lose upwards to 6,000 employees after its buyout. The film industry in Los Angeles continued to contract in 2025. Hollywood had lost 100,000 jobs by the end of 2024 — or a 30 percent decline — as film and TV productions moved to other U.S. states, Canada, Mexico, or places overseas. And by April of this year, Hollywood ranked in only 6th place for the number of film and TV productions operating there. And Deadline reported in October that the downward trend in film and TV production continued through the third quarter of this year. Meanwhile, media otherwise also continued contracting as news and print media either laid off workers, canceled expansion plans, or shut down completely. Publishers Dotdash Meredith dumped 143 employees, and then after the rebranded to People Inc., shed another 226. The Washington Post eliminated four percent of its workforce, or 100 workers, CNN dumped 200 staffers, PBS laid off 15 percent of its workforce, CBS News cancelled the streaming companions to CBS Mornings and CBS News and eliminated those employees, and Business Insider dumped 21 percent of its staff. Layoffs were also felt at Variety, Rolling Stone, and Billboard. The media will continue facing tough times next year and there seems to be no end yet in sight to a leveling.

Title: Bitcoin options boom raises fears of capped BTC upside
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-options-under-fire-as-covered-calls-take-center-stage
Time Published: 2026-01-01T20:00:00Z

Bitcoin cash-and-carry trades faded toward the end of the year, leading funds to shift to Bitcoin options for yield. Is the strategy putting a cap on BTC price? Cointelegraph in your social feed Key takeaways: Covered calls gained traction as cash-and-carry returns collapsed, but data shows they are not structurally suppressing Bitcoin’s price. Stable put-to-call ratios and rising put demand suggest hedging and yield strategies coexist with bullish positioning. As Bitcoin (BTC) price entered a downtrend in November, traders began forming theories about why institutional inflows and corporate accumulation failed to sustain price levels above $110,000. One explanation frequently cited is the rising demand for Bitcoin options, particularly those linked to the BlackRock iShares spot Bitcoin (IBIT) exchange-traded fund. The aggregate Bitcoin options open interest climbed to $49 billion in December 2025 from $39 billion in December 2024, putting the covered call strategy under closer scrutiny. Critics argue that by “renting out” their upside for a fee, large investors have unintentionally created a ceiling that prevents Bitcoin from entering its next parabolic phase. To understand this argument, it helps to view a covered call as a trade-off between price appreciation and steady income. In a covered call strategy, an investor who already owns Bitcoin sells a call (buy) option to another party. This gives the buyer the right to purchase that Bitcoin at a fixed price, such as $100,000 by a specified date. In return, the seller receives an upfront cash payment, similar to earning interest on a bond. This options strategy differs from fixed income products because the seller continues to hold a volatile asset, even though their potential upside is capped. If Bitcoin rallies to $120,000, the seller must sell at $100,000, effectively missing the additional gains. Traders argue that this dynamic suppresses price action because professional dealers who purchase these options often sell Bitcoin in the spot market to hedge their exposure, creating a persistent “sell wall” around popular strike prices. This shift toward options-based yield is a direct response to the collapse of the cash and carry trade, which involves selling BTC futures while holding an equivalent position in the spot market. For much of late 2024, traders captured a steady 10% to 15% premium. By February 2025, however, that premium had fallen below 10%, and by November it struggled to remain above 5%. In search of higher returns, funds rotated into covered calls, which offered more attractive annualized yields of 12% to 18%. This transition is evident in IBIT options, where open interest jumped to $40 billion from $12 billion in late 2024. Even so, the put-to-call ratio has stayed stable below 60%. If widespread “suppressive” call selling were truly the dominant force, this ratio would likely have collapsed as the market became saturated with call sellers. Instead, the balance implies that for every yield-focused seller, there is still a buyer positioning for a breakout. The put-to-call ratio suggests that while some participants are selling upside call options, a much larger group is purchasing put (sell) instruments as protection against a potential price decline. The recent defensive stance is reflected in the skew metric. While IBIT put options traded at a 2% discount in late 2024, they now trade at a 5% premium. At the same time, implied volatility, the market’s measure of expected turbulence, declined to 45% or lower from May onward, down from 57% in late 2024. Lower volatility reduces the premiums earned by sellers, meaning the incentive to deploy this so-called “suppressive” strategy has actually weakened, even as total open interest has increased. Arguing that covered calls are holding prices down makes little sense when the sellers of those call options stand to benefit most if prices rise toward their target levels. Rather than acting as a constraint, the options market has become the primary venue where Bitcoin’s volatility is being monetized for yield.

Title: TechRadar's Year in Review 2025 – the biggest trends in AI, phones, computing, TVs, gaming and more

2025 in phones, computing, TVs, gaming, cameras, streaming and more When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. So farewell, 2025 – you were frequently exciting, regularly chaotic, occasionally frustrating but always interesting. And that’s how we like it around here. It was a year in which often fairly iterative improvements to hardware were overshadowed by rapid and significant advances on the computing side of things. I’m talking, of course, about AI, which is now so dominant within the tech world that it’s increasingly hard to find a device that doesn’t have an AI brain. Not that I’m complaining, because the leaps made in 2025 by the likes of OpenAI’s Sora and Google’s Gemini were truly astonishing; the pace of change is such that it feels like we’re squeezing about a decade’s worth of advances into each year now, and I wouldn’t like to predict what the state of play will be in 12 months’ time. Well, other than to say that we’ll be taking for granted things which seem almost impossible right now – although as our AI Editor Graham Barlow notes below, maybe we’re already doing that. In comparison, it often looked in 2025 as though things were slowing down on the hardware side. Could Apple really make its already-excellent MacBooks much better? Could Samsung improve much on the superb Galaxy S series? Was there much scope for OLED TVs or wireless headphones or mirrorless cameras to develop? The answer was yes, yes and yes. Though the upgrades to many models may not have been as big as those on the software side, they were frequently excellent in their own right. The improvements to battery life, screen tech and camera lenses may not be as flashy as those on the AI front, but they can make a real difference to how we use our devices on a daily basis. In many ways, tech fans have never had it so good. Whether that will continue in 2026 remains to be seen. AI now looks to be having a direct – and negative – effect on component prices, which could make your favorite new phone or laptop more expensive in the coming year. We might also see stock shortages in some areas, which could further inflate those price tags. It looks like we’re set for another year of exciting, chaotic, frustrating and interesting news, then – and we’ll be here with you every step of the way. Until then, I hope you’ve enjoyed reading TechRadar in 2025, and have a happy New Year! Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. This year was marked by astonishing leaps in AI capabilities, which I tried to not only report on but experience in full. From my first experience with ‘vibe coding’ to wild leaps of fancy with Veo 3 (and later the Sora app) to creating my own digital double, AI’s fast-changing capabilities constantly amazed me. Never in four decades of covering emerging technologies have I seen anything like it: AI’s rise continues to be a heady mixture of enthusiastic adoption tinged with white-knuckled fear about what it all means for jobs, and for humanity, and nothing we saw in 2025 did much to resolve that anxiety. However, it was my conversations with those leading the AI and wider innovation charge that stood out. My interviews with Amazon’s Panos Panay about Alexa+ and Google’s Sameer Samat about the future of Android were particularly memorable, as was the moment when one of Apple’s top executives threw his brand-new iPhone Air to me during a video podcast and insisted that I try to bend it. The rise of humanoid robots was a trend that shocked and pleased me in equal measure, though I’ve tried to temper my enthusiasm with the knowledge that clever marketing and eye-popping videos will only get us so far. We all want the ultimate home robot, but I still don't think many of us are willing to pay $20,000 to get it. Away from all the AI and robots, I spent much of the year trying new phones, including redesigned iPhones and an incredibly thin folding Samsung phone, along with a wide range of wearable technology that included the Galaxy XR headset, and some very exciting AR glasses from Meta and Google’s Android XR group. Experiencing these felt like peering into our near technological future, which increasingly will be filled with on-demand AI, flexible phones, and maybe those robots. For all the talk of breakthroughs and hype, 2025 felt less like the year AI changed everything and more like the year it quietly became unavoidable. While the much-hyped arrival of super-powerful artificial general intelligence (AGI), predicted for 2025 by many, simply hasn’t materialized, the year has still been a strong one for companies such as OpenAI, xAI, Anthropic, and Google. That said, there have also been some massive flops; and as for Apple, it feels like yet another year in which it slipped further behind in the AI race. ChatGPT maintained its vice-like grip as the most popular AI chatbot in the world, though it hasn’t been plain sailing for OpenAI. Legal challenges, particularly the copyright infringement claim brought by The New York Times, have continued to dog the company, and in June its servers crashed for a couple of days, giving the world a brief taste of life without the ubiquitous chatbot. OpenAI then fumbled the ball with the release of its GPT-5 model, which came across as cold and unemotional compared to the previous GPT-4o. For millions of users who’d come to rely on the chatbot as something closer to a trusted companion it felt like a best friend had undergone a personality transplant overnight, forcing OpenAI to make the legacy 4o model available again. The company has also lost a little ground to Google’s Gemini in recent months. The arrival of Gemini 3 Pro in November was well received, and on the image front, Gemini’s Nano Banana and Nano Banana Pro proved superior to ChatGPT for image generation. OpenAI responded with a new image-generation model in December. AI-powered pets and toys also began to appear this year. We took Moflin for a spin, until we accidentally fried its battery. More broadly, the dominant theme of the year was that every product must now have AI built into it in some form, and no company exemplifies this approach better than Microsoft, which has spent the year enthusiastically stuffing Copilot into just about everything it makes. Finally, the year looks set to end on a high note for Amazon. Alexa+, the AI-powered version of Alexa that Amazon has been promising all year but hasn’t yet managed to fully roll out, may finally be getting a web version, at least in the US. 2025 was the year of the super-thin phone, writes Roland Moore-Colyer, Managing Editor, Mobile Computing, with the release of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge in the first half of the year, and the iPhone Air in the second. These handsets grabbed headlines with their svelte proportions, but so far sales figures have yet to match the hype. That’s likely due to their relatively high prices in the face of already pretty slim iPhones and Galaxy and Pixel handsets, all of which saw the expected yearly upgrades with the iPhone 17, Galaxy S25 and Pixel 10 lines respectively. While the upgrades to the iPhone 17 family appeared incremental at first glance, I'd argue they're a bigger deal when you dig into the details: there was a new design and cooling system for the Pro phones, the standard model finally got a 120Hz display, and Apple's 48MP 'Fusion' camera came to every iPhone in the lineup, including the Air (the Plus model went the way of the dodo). AI found its way into more phones and more features, with Google’s Pixel phones in particular boasting a whole host of genuinely useful smart tools. Meanwhile, Apple just about managed to distract us from the shortcomings of Apple Intelligence with its flashy Liquid Glass design and the eye-catching Cosmic Orange iPhone 17 Pro. Some of the most interesting phones came from smaller brands, with the Nothing Phone 3 offering something a little different without scrimping on flagship features. There was the Oppo Find X9 Pro with its strange but useful camera kit, while the OnePlus 15 was the only phone to earn a maximum five-star review from us this year. There were also a clutch of affordable phones from the likes of Motorola and Xiaomi, proving that you don’t have to pay a lot to get a very capable smartphone these days. We saw further evolution in the folding phone space, with the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 leading the way, and Samsung also unveiled its first tri-folding phone, with the Galaxy Trifold joining Huawei's Mate XT, and teasing a future of devices that truly blend phones and tablets. We may even see a foldable iPhone in 2026, but don’t hold your breath. When it came to computing, 2025 didn't start off as the most promising year. While 2024 felt like a year of revolutionary change, with the explosive growth of AI, the fall of Intel, and the rise of Arm-based laptops that were actually worth buying, this year has felt more like we're in a holding pattern, as the innovations of the past few years are iterated on and refined.The year kicked off with Nvidia launching its latest generation of consumer graphics cards, the RTX 5000 series, at CES 2025, and they encapsulated the ‘evolution, not revolution’ theme, with some great new features that haven't fundamentally shaken up the industry, as the introduction of ray tracing with the RTX 2000 series did. Of course, making a great product even better is no bad thing, and our components editor and GPU expert John Loeffler was suitably impressed, enthusing in his RTX 5090 review that “If you're a gamer, you'll still get impressive gen-on-gen performance improvements over the celebrated RTX 4090, and the Nvidia RTX 5090 is really the first consumer graphics card I've tested that can get you consistent, high-frame-rate 8K gameplay.”I have an RTX 5090 and I love it, and I've also been impressed by its 8K performance in modern games, but with the majority of PC gamers still playing at 1080p, this high-end GPU might be a bit too expensive to justify. Other releases from AMD and Intel, plus Apple’s latest M5 chip, continued the theme of impressive releases that don’t massively change the computing landscape.Perhaps the biggest event in 2025 was the continued rise of AI. Recently, the AI boom has led to a global shortage of memory, which has in turn caused an increase in the prices of devices that use it. All of a sudden, PCs, RAM, and GPUs look set to get increasingly expensive, though some, like our computing editor Christian Guyton, aren’t too worried – yet. Personally, the end-of-year drama is making me nostalgic for those early months when 2025 felt rather boring. This year saw two really interesting developments in TV technology, with the first being the arrival of a whole new kind of ‘Tandem RGB’ OLED TV panel from LG. This appeared in the LG G5, helping it to score the maximum five stars in our review, and in the fantastic Panasonic Z95B, enabling both TVs to hit stunning levels of brightness and color depth, but with reduced power consumption. However, this new screen technology didn’t win either of those sets our TV of the Year award – that went to the Samsung S95F, which not only earned its own perfect 5-star review, but was also voted the top TV in the most categories by the judges in our flagship OLED TV showdown, which pitted it against the LG G5, Panasonic Z95B, and Sony Bravia 8 II. The second big tech development was the arrival of RGB mini-LED tech – and, make no mistake, this is the next big thing. It’s more efficient than current mini-LED tech, and is capable of richer colors and less light leakage from bright areas to dark ones, and it could be the tech to finally knock OLED off its perch. We know that Samsung, LG, TCL and Hisense will all launch RGB mini-LED TV ranges in 2026, but the Hisense UX116 was the only TV to use it in 2025 – and it was a mixed bag, with performance issues that disappointed given its eye-wateringly high price. Still, we’re excited to see how this tech develops. But the biggest thing in TVs this year was the TVs themselves – as in, they got big and they got affordable. TCL and Hisense launched 85-inch and 100-inch TVs that were within the budgets of regular mortals, and 75-inch TVs are becoming positively cheap, while still being good. While new tech is exciting, huge TVs like the Hisense U8N and TCL QM7K becoming more affordable is the change that made the biggest difference for customers. This year XR or 'extended reality' took center stage, thanks in large part to Android XR hardware finally breaking cover in the shape of the Samsung Galaxy XR headset. We also tested prototype Android XR glasses ahead of their expected release in the coming year, and they’re impressive (the glasses at least, the headset less so right now). Google, along with its Android partners, looks set to seriously challenge Meta in 2026. For its part Meta debuted several new smart wearables over the past 12 months, including two pairs of Oakley smart glasses – the stylish HSTNs and the sporty Vanguards, the latter of which are perfect for runners when used with a compatible Garmin watch. We also saw a Gen 2 model of the Meta Ray-Bans, and the company's latest step towards full-on AR specs, the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which as you can probably guess feature a display for the specs to relay info visually. We’ve tested them, and they’re everything Google Glass wanted to be, but right now they're not easy to get hold of. What about VR headsets proper? Valve surprised no one (because the device was so heavily leaked before launch) with its Steam Frame headset announcement. Key details like the price are still a mystery, but it will be landing in 2026 – and when it does, the spec sheet teases a device that could seriously challenge the reigning champion of VR, the Meta Quest 3. Depending on how Valve handles the launch, I wouldn’t be surprised if it makes all other headsets feel obsolete – even the Galaxy XR and Apple Vision Pro. Talking of Apple's mixed-reality spatial-computing headset, we got a new version with an M5 chip and comfier strap, but while it's a worthwhile upgrade the price still feels too high. If 2024 was the year niche UK hi-fi brands took over the dance floor amid a hiatus from audio's heavy hitters (see Bowers & Wilkins' fantastic Pi8 earbuds or Cambridge Audio's inaugural, affordable, adorable P100 cans), 2025 was the year the big dogs returned to the party and got their groove back. We got five major headphones releases in 2025, starting with the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 earbuds in February. The hotly anticipated update to the 2019 Powerbeats Pro proved that Apple could indeed deliver heart-rate monitoring in its earbuds. Cut to May and Sony's WH-1000XM6 landed, to finally knock the 2020-issue WH-1000XM4 off the top spot in our best headphones guide. It was a similar story with the June arrival of the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd Gen), quickly followed by the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) in September – a two-pronged attack on the market that saw Bose reinstated as the king of ANC. However, this roundup wouldn't be complete without a nod to the biggest launch of them all: the fall arrival of Apple's AirPods Pro 3. The shape's different, the ANC is twice as good, and yes, like the Powerbeats Pro 2 they also keep tabs on your ticker, in a slightly different way, and with increasing third-party fitness-app support. Still the most popular earbuds in the world? Absolutely. Elsewhere, Spotify Lossless finally landed, at no cost to Premium subscribers, offering almost-as-good-as-Apple-Music resolution at up to 24-bit/44.1kHz. While Lossless wasn't a huge hit with fans initially, the big green streaming machine's popularity continues to grow, despite concerns over artist payments. Oh, and if you take note of just one audio brand name this year, let it be WiiM. As Sonos continues to tackle trust issues among its once-loyal fanbase, the plucky multi-room underdog unveiled its WiiM Sound (and now the WiiM Sound Lite) premium hi-res speakers – and the firm would love to help you build your wireless sound system around them. 2025 was full of pleasant surprises for photographers. The Sigma BF was truly out of the ordinary, being dubbed ‘the camera Apple would have made’, while the Caira with its Nano Banana AI skills showed us a glimpse of how on-the-go generative editing can work in an actual camera. Fujifilm and OM System showed us that user experience matters with the quirky X half and retro OM-3 respectively, while Hasselblad and Nikon delivered strong offerings of their own – my favorite stills camera ever, the X2D II, and a new player in the cinema-camera game, the Nikon Zr. A special shoutout goes to Nikon for becoming the best-value camera brand this year, notably for the excellent Z5 II, which is our Camera of the Year, and Z50 II. It was arguably an even better year for new lenses than cameras, with Sigma, Sony and Viltrox in particular knocking it out the park with world-first and affordable optics. Canon continues to lock out third parties from its full-frame camera lineup, but that decision feels more justified after it launched the affordable and capable 45mm F1.2 STM prime. A sense of order was restored towards the end of the year when Canon and Sony launched their anticipated mid-range full-frame cameras: the EOS R6 III and A7 V, both of which are integral to their lineups. The long-threatened US ban on DJI products finally came into effect, and we saw a couple of major product launches from the brand in the build-up to it: the incredible (sort of) sub-250g Mini 5 Pro, and the DJI Osmo 360 – its first foray into 360 cameras, and rival to both the Insta 360 X5 and GoPro’s new Max 2. DJI is also being tipped to launch its first 360 drone soon, but Insta360 got there first with the truly innovative Antigravity A1. Overall, it’s been a good year for camera fans, with demand seemingly remaining strong in the face of competition from increasingly capable smartphones. I’m predicting that the consumer and cinema camera spaces will continue converging in 2026, and I hope the likes of Viltrox expand our options with new and affordable autofocus zoom lenses. Gaming in 2025 was largely dominated by the arrival of the Nintendo Switch 2. It’s a safe improvement on the original Switch, and one that epitomizes the ‘evolution not revolution’ approach to console development. The specs sheet won’t blow anyone’s socks off, but it’s a superb package that cements the Switch's position as the go-to handheld console; and it was so popular in the pre-order and launch phases that it took months for retailers to catch up with demand. It’s been backed up by some excellent games too, including Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bananza, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, Kirby Air Riders, and Pokémon Legends Z-A. Sony had its own say in the gaming handheld space, breathing new life into the PlayStation Portal handheld device, which is now capable of excellent cloud streaming. This has elevated the handheld, which we were already big fans of, to impressive new heights. The PS5’s game library got a bump with Death Stranding 2: On the Beach and Ghost of Yotei, as well as titles including Borderlands 4, Battlefield 6, Arc Raiders and TechRadar Gaming’s Game of the Year, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Elsewhere, indie games ruled, with the likes of Blue Prince, Hades 2, and Hollow Knight: Silksong proving standouts in a strong year for releases. It’s been a year to forget for Xbox, however, and its woes only accentuated the aforementioned successes for Nintendo and Sony. For starters, more Xbox games – including Gears of War: Reloaded – arrived on PS5, while others are set to follow, including the symbol of Xbox itself, Halo. Meanwhile studios were shuttered and prospective games cancelled, and to make matters worse the Xbox X/S were outsold by a tiny family console, the Nex Playground, over Black Friday. All in all it’s been tough going for Team Green. As for 2026, it’s beginning to feel like the pace of progress towards next-gen consoles will quicken, and the game release calendar looks well stocked. However, a titan looms: Grand Theft Auto 6 is now slated for release in November after being originally planned for late 2025, and the whole gaming world is going to revolve around its arrival. Last year, I ended my contribution to this round-up by predicting a move away from fitness watches towards screenless trackers, such as a new WHOOP model, writes Matt Evans, Senior Editor, Fitness, Wellness & Wearables. Well, we got not one, but two new WHOOPs, and they were… fine. But, as prices rose, I found the ongoing subscription model far too expensive. However, my prediction that we’d move away from smartwatches hasn’t really been borne out. Wearable tech isn’t changing much in the mainstream, with the highest-profile releases being a slate of new watches from Garmin, Apple, Samsung, Google and OnePlus, and they’ve been as popular as ever. Look beyond those big releases, however, and interesting new stuff is out there. A subscription-free WHOOP competitor band was launched by Polar, while Core Devices, the resurrected Pebble watch company led by its original founder, unveiled a pair of watches inspired by the original Pebble designs, complete with low-power LCD-style screens, and open-source software that anyone with the know-how can tinker with. Core Devices also launched a new kind of smart ring with a button and a microphone, which the company says acts as “external memory for the brain”. Elsewhere, the AirPods Pro 3 now have built-in heart rate sensors, and Meta teamed up with Garmin to bring us the Oakley Meta Vanguard sports specs. Cool new wearable innovations are happening, but it all still feels quite fringe. My innovation of the year, however, came from Google. The Google Pixel Watch 4 is the first properly repairable smartwatch, as you’re able to take it apart and replace the battery and display. This enables you to change individual parts rather than the whole watch, reducing your contribution to e-waste, and saving you money in the long run. Almost every other piece of wearable tech from every other company is still a sealed unit that will ultimately end up being disposed of, and I hope Google's move could be the catalyst for change that the wasteful wearable tech industry sorely needs. The biggest story of 2025 broke late in the year, and it concerned off-screen studio machinations rather than on-screen drama. Netflix’s $82.7bn bid for Warner Bros. sent shockwaves through the industry when it was announced in early December, and provoked a counter-bid from Paramount Skydance. There’s still a long way to go before a deal is approved, but should Netflix acquire one of the film world’s most iconic studios it would be a landmark moment for the streaming sector, and would represent a seismic shift for the entertainment industry as a whole. Turning to the year's big theatrical releases, and numerous new movies flopped at the box office, including some with huge names attached (I’m looking at you, Dwayne Johnson and The Smashing Machine). Heck, with Captain America: Brave New World, Thunderbolts*, and The Fantastic Four: First Steps all underperforming, even the usually reliable Marvel Studios didn’t have a money-spinning hit on its hands. I wonder how many people predicted that animated and live-action/CGI hybrids would rule the theatrical roost, led by multi-billion dollar-spinning flicks like Lilo & Stitch, Zootopia 2, and Ne Zha II… As for the major streaming services, users endured more of the now-customary annual price hikes, while Max raised eyebrows by rebranding itself – again – to HBO Max. On the screen, unexpected hits such as HBO medical drama The Pitt, plus Netflix's ‘one-shot’ drama Adolescence and pop-culture phenomenon Kpop Demon Hunters, proved that not even the savviest industry exec can really be sure what viewers will latch onto. Add in the return of unmissable shows including Severance and Stranger Things amid the glut of great and not-so-great film and TV releases, and there was plenty to keep our eyeballs engaged. Now, what have you got in store for us, 2026? It's been a slow but not insignificant year in home technology as legacy brands scramble to keep pace with bigger, already tech-savvy players vying for their spot in our homes – whether that's Breville reinventing the toaster with a proprietary optical sensor, IKEA launching new renewable energy solutions, or Eufy and Dreame duking it out to give us the most effective stair-climbing robot vacuum.Some brands were less innovative than others though. Dyson left some of us feeling snubbed with its 'new' (read: decade-old) vacuum, while Shark's TurboBlade Cool + Heat failed to impress despite its noble attempt at mimicking other SharkNinja product's viral fame. Elsewhere we saw big plays from Amazon and Google in the smart home space, with the arrival of their AI-bolstered home assistants. Amazon's Alexa+ and Google's Gemini for Home both entered Early Access beta in the US, and while the early reviews for both have been mixed, it's a promising glimpse into the future of the connected home. Both of those services are subscription-based offerings, and subscriptions look set to become a major battleground for smart-home brands, and a bone of contention between brands and their customers, as companies attempt to lock users into their ecosystems, as we've already seen with video doorbells. Between that, and brands like Samsung using screen-loaded appliances as advertising billboards around the home, now might be a good time to really think about which brands you want want to invest in as you build your smart home.

Title: Looking Forward into 2026 – Predictions for a New Year
URL: https://tagn.wordpress.com/2026/01/01/looking-forward-into-2026-predictions-for-a-new-year/
Time Published: 2026-01-01T18:15:46Z
Full Content:
It is time again. Here we sit at the start of a new year and I am once again going to don the mantle of an oracle… false oracle to be sure, but let me do my cosplay… and foretell the doom of this next spin around the sun. And after 2025, I am in a foul mood. It is easy to be that guy who sees only the bad outcomes. As the quote goes: Always predict the worst and you’ll be hailed as a prophet. -Tom Lehrer, quoting a friend So you’ll have to pardon me if my 2026 predictions… and we’re back to predictions after 2025 failed to deliver on wishes in dramatic style… if they are not rife with sunshine and lollipops. Welcome to 2026 That said I once again want to remind people that predictions are not wishes. These are not things I want to come to pass. They are things I think are likely to come to pass given past behavior and the state of the industry and the economy overall. If I am bleak, it is merely because I have been conditioned by the world to have that point of view. For those wanting a past accounting… well, who am I to tell you what to do with your free time. But there is a history here. Now I am back around for another turn. So let’s get on with it. What will 2026 bring? 1. Bloodbath at Redwood Shores EA will be… well, I am not sure what it will be at the end of 2026. But I am pretty sure the Saudis will be getting out the bone saws once more and what was once EA will end up with more pieces cut off than Jamal Khashoggi corpse in the embassy in Istanbul. This seems like a gimme frankly. 2. More Microsoft Mayhem Phil Spencer has but two choices to keep his obscene annual bonus going. He either has to improve sales or he has to cut expenses. Given where the industry has been headed, and the unfavorable reaction to the price increase for the XBox Game Pass, I am going to bet on cost cutting. And what is the biggest expense? Employees. If they don’t cut at least another 1,000 staff from the XBox division I will be amazed. My final score on this one will be the percentage actually cut relative to 1,000. So nobody gets laid off, zero points. But if Phil axes 2,000 people, I am claiming 20 points. So basically, 0.01 points per person laid off. Sorry to value people at such a low rate, but at least I am not throwing them out in the street personally. 3. WoW Midnight Modest Launch We already have a date. I started sketching this post back in October and had a placeholder for the launch date, picking April 20th. But now we know it will be here on March 2, 2026, much earlier than I expected. So prediction alteration time! I am going to predict that there will be no follow up press release about how WoW Midnight was a huge success with cherry picked metrics to prove it was the best ever… WoW expansion with housing, for example, because I think Warlords of Draenor will probably still be ahead of it, and Tom Chilton telling us all that garrisons were housing counts in my book. I will allow no ret-con of that. 4. The Big Chill for WoW Classic My gut and intuition says that the J. Allen Brack “you think you do, but you don’t” faction gained ascendancy at Blizz when WoW Classic didn’t turn into a low-effort eternal cash machine. Between them dropping WoW Midnight on top of the WoW Anniversary Classic launch of The Burning Crusade and the retail team just straight up taking the nostalgia card for itself in the form of the remix seasons to fill out the fact that they cannot, after more than 20 years, make an expansion with two years of content (or make expansions faster FFS), WoW Classic seems on the outs. So my prediction is no new servers, no speeding up the languishing expansions, and absolutely no movement on anything that might feel even a bit like Classic Plus. WoW Classic Warlords of Draenor will land in the back third of the year and that will be it. I am going to claim five bonus points if Blizz puts out a roadmap and doesn’t bother to include and WoW Classic plans. 5. Nothing Else New in Irvine For all the resources they have and the mighty reputation they have earned for quality and polish and stealing ideas and reinventing them better, Blizzard will bring nothing new to the table in 2026. No announcements, no surprises, no additions to their lineup. They will be milking their current titles until the last layoff. See, doing something new is much higher risk than living on past glory. 6 . Lawsuit Wins for Against Pirate Servers Both Blizzard and Daybreak will win their cases against Turtle WoW and The Heroes Journey respectively. I think that is pretty much a gimme here. The case law is clear and none of the arguments offered justify taking another companies IP and assets to start their own business. Fan arguments in support of either made up requirements or different layers of “but I want it.” Now, will the win help the companies or actually shut down similar operations? Not a prediction that is part of the scoring, but I will say “no” on both counts. 7. A Rain of Tears in Norrath Ongoing poor performance by the aging stable of Daybreak titles is going to mean layoffs. Again, predictions are not wishes, but we’ve seen how this has gone in the past… and all the more so with Eros Capital Partners AB now heading the board following their demand for more cash payments straight to their pockets. This will be why, the explanation for my prediction below about an EQII special rules server for 2026. 8. H1Z1 is Still Dead Like the bit about Generalissimo Francisco Franco back in the early SNL days, H1Z1 is not coming back from the dead no matter how many times Ji Ham says to investors that it is an extremely important IP in the Daybreak portfolio. The promise of a new version of the game with a 2026 release will be revealed a fiction… or, more likely, not revealed at all as the Ji Ham is likely to pull a John Riccitiello SWTOR move and drop all mention and claim it isn’t what investors are interested in if pressed at the earnings call. 9. EverQuest 3 Same as H1Z1. It’s dead Jim… or Firiona… or whoever. Daybreak will only buy new titles, like Palia, but won’t make anything outside of their current MMO lines. We probably won’t KNOW it is dead, but it will be the old school Daybreak treatment of never mentioning it again… certainly not in 2026. 10. EverQuest Special Rules Server for 2026 The EQ team is under some pressure. Numbers are down and The Heroes Journey was alleged to have been pulling in something around $100K a month for a dumbed down, multi-box, speed leveling version of the game. (Yes, there was more to it, but I swear that is all most people gushing about it seemed to mention.) That has to have made some impression on the team. Enough to get through their “Hardcore Heritage Forever” mindset? One hopes. What they should do is work on a “Tour de Norrath” special server. Bonus xp, mob health all dropped to make most things soloable at level, even by a warrior who can only shield bash and kick with their auto attack, with expansions being dropped at a dizzying rate; something like 8 weeks for vanilla and then 4-6 weeks for every expansion thereafter. Raids will be sized so that a group of three can do them, save for the Sleeper, who will require a full group. What they will do is turn the dials they already have… xp rate, unlock rate, starting expansion… and pretend they have done something new and innovative. It will not thrill. [I wrote this before we got the news about what Daybreak was planning, but now we know that. so how it plays out will be the biggest part of any scoring.] 11. EverQuest II Special Rules Server for 2026? Nope! We’re not going to get one for 2026. Reasons noted above, but also their popularity has not been established the way the EQ versions have. 12. Norrath Expansions All the same, both EQ and EQII will announce Q4 expansions that will riff off of some location we have visited already. That seems like a safe bet even with the last part. Not a 100% gimme this time. 13. LOTRO Difficult Issue Avoidance SSG has made it clear that they are going nowhere near the scourging of the Shire until they have milked the rest of the appendices of the series completely dry of content and they have trivialized the breadth of Middle-earth with murder for hire and FedEx quests. They’re like the Borg of Middle-earth, and all must be assimilated. But I think they have gone far enough south into Harad. They will need to go in another direction. So, my prediction in three parts; there will be an expansion (2 points), it will ship in December (2 points), and it will be set in the east, somewhere along the shores of the Sea of Rhun (6 points). Fight me! 14. New Eden: Two Expansion, Two Events, One Fanfest EVE Online will follow the now well set pattern of days, with a spring and fall (or summer and winter to use their terms, but May and November aren’t summer or winter where I live) expansion and the Crimson Harvest and Winter Nexus events… and Fanfest. And that will be the roadmap for 2026. Anything else will just be some login rewards, Twitch drops, and a cash shop sale. 15. New Eden to Remain Just EVE Online Neither EVE Vanguard nor EVE Frontier will progress to the point of even an early access launch. The former will remain the wet dream of a few key individuals at the company who still want to will this into being after 15 years of failure. It isn’t going to happen. The latter… well, CCP simply won’t be able to solve the economic contradictions of blockchain, which tries to pretend that supply and demand isn’t a thing. But they cannot drop it due to Marc Andreeson’s money paying the bills, but doing what Andreeson wants will drive any actual gamers away, leaving just the speculator class looking for another get rich quick scheme. If they ship, they die, so they will continue to pretend to be trying to solve the problem while cashing Andreeson’s checks. 16. Drone Regions Consolidation One of the big changes in New Eden this year was the evacuation of the Drone Regions of null sec and the subsequent land rush by smaller groups to grab territory there. There were about 20 groups on the map at one point. That has already slimmed down to 14. By the time we get around to scoring this I am going to say there will be just three groups, either alliances or recognized coalitions of alliances, in the Drones. 17. NetEase to Buy CCP from Pearl Abyss We got hints that CCP was being shopped around in 2025 and, frankly, there are few suitors that make as much sense as NetEase. They already run the EVE Online server in China as well as EVE Echoes. Why not buy the whole thing? They don’t have to close the deal in 2026, they just have to announce it. I mean, the gaming press acts like any such announcement means the deal is complete anyway, so why fight it? The only alternatives are Tencent buying them or Crimson Desert being a smash hit. I’ll give myself a couple points for either of those options just because I mentioned them. But it has to be NetEase for the full 10 points. 18. The Crimson Desert Blahs Years in the making… and promising… we have a ship date for Crimson Desert at last. March 19th. And, frankly, they had better make that date. What then? Will this be the massive hit with rave reviews that restores the fortunes of Pearl Abyss and allow them to hold onto CCP while getting out from under their bad investments. I don’t think so. But how to quantify that for a prediction? Well, thanks to Fantasy Critic League, I now pay attention to review scores. So I will go with that. Crimson Desert is going to land with an Metacritic review score of 80, which is the honorable mention, fine work but not outstanding bracket a lot of game land in. So a score of 80 gets my a full 10 points, but I will tick off 2 points for each point its score goes above or below 80. That will be the partial credit metric. 19. The Perilous voyage of a Ship of Heroes I mean, they shipped their game. They got the business model completely wrong and now it peaks at 10 concurrent players on a good weekend. That is completely unsustainable. There will be no subscription requirement by the end of the year. That simply has to go. Big titles cannot sustain that, these guys certainly won’t make it work. That means it will go “buy to play,” will institute a free to play mode, or will simply shut down. But the subscription idea will die in 2026. Jan 2 addendum: Another one I wrote in October and then forgot to go edit. This already happened, I even wrote about it. So, zero points for predicting the past. Going to need one of those bonus predictions to land if I want a perfect 300 score! 20. Camelot Undone I see three paths forward for this incredibly late bloomer of a title. We’re already a dozen years past the promised ship date… still two years shy of the Duke Nukem Forever slip, but nothing to be proud of either… and the madness of Mark Jacobs is going to have to find an endgame somewhere. So my prediction, like Gaul, is divided into three possibilities. Given the complete lack of success of their other title, Final Bland: Ragnarok, which is now dead and gone, why would we believe Camelot Unchained is going to do any better. At some point investors are going to stop writing checks. The industry remains in a down cycle, investors are already skittish, further funding will look like throwing good money after bad. My special favorite because “Angry Marc” Andreeson, a man so lacking in self reflection that he has become the Pillsbury Doughboy parody of Sand Hill Road venture capitalist, has no interest in video games except to the extent that they further his desire to make even more unearned wealth by implementing a tax on the internet through blockchain. I am going to give myself 10 points if one of these comes to pass… but if Mark Jacobs manages to pull of a second I am going to grant myself a bonus five points, with a full 10 point bonus if he manages the hat trick. [This was the first prediction I wrote back in October, and I was in a bad mood. But it is so complicated, I am going to leave it as is in tribute to past me.] 21. Palworld Injunction Nintendo has been pissed about Palworld for quite a while now and has gone so far as to get patents approved that seem aimed and going after any title that emulates the whole “throw an object to catch a pet” idea that they see as the heart of its Pokemon titles. This year we’re going to get a resolution… and Nintendo is going to lose, having pushed too far while ignoring prior art. 22. No Man’s Sky 10th Anniversary We’ll get a bit update for the game’s tenth birthday. That goes without saying. And it will be a lot of cool stuff. But it won’t hit like Voyagers did with the introduction of corvettes. Peak concurrent users on Steam will be my measure for this. I am going to take stand at the 50K line and my score will go down 2 points for every 10K above that the game goes. This is one where I want to be wrong, but I have to look at history. 23. No Man’s Sky All About the Base Meanwhile, my stab at what we will get in 2026 is bases. The whole base building aspect of the game is a bit chaotic, tossed together, and feels like there is a lot of room to improve. So Hello Games is going to go all in on making sure you can make the space home of your dreams, with a landing pad that will work for your damn corvette already. 24. No Fire to be Lit Light No Fire will remain a ghost title for 2026. No dates, no early access, no roadmap, just vague news and nothing for players at all. 25. Guild Wars: Reforged Content Pack ArenaNet, caught by surprise by the success of Guild Wars: Reforged, will announce a content update for the game. It won’t be a whole new campaign, or even something as big as Eye of the North, but the game has demonstrated that there is demand for it, so why not give the players what they want? 26. Guild Wars 2 Expansion as Usual The pattern has been set, NCsoft expects the income, we’re just going to get another one. Probably in August. Seems about right. 27. No Official Announcement for Guild Wars 3 I mean, doesn’t ArenaNet have enough on its plate. There might be a leak or some discussion of a possibility of such an eventuality… I mean, they have to let GW2 sit untouched for a decade or so in order to go back and farm that the way they did the original… but we’re not there yet for a commitment. 28. The End of the New World as We Know It Amazon will announce the end date for New World. It might not end in 2026, but the end times will be marked in the calendar. We know it is happening and we know that Amazon isn’t going to do something like Dual Universe and make the game playable after the servers close. It will just be the end of days… so get started on that emulator now! 29. Squadron 42? More Like Squadron 86! Chris Roberts was absolutely positive that the long delayed Squadron 42 spin-off of the Star Citizen universe will ship in 2026. He says it is done and fully playable. There was even a special email update about it with “2026” in a huge size to emphasize the point. At this point I simply don’t believe him. No Squadron 42 launch… and I am going to give myself 9 point if we get some chickenshit “well, it is alpha now so you cannot criticize it” routine like we’ve had for Star Citizen for the last decade. Cloud Imperium has yet to ship a game and I don’t see that trend changing in 2026. 30. Not Coming Back Crowfall will remain dead. Alganon too. Seems like a gimme, but somebody out there believes these will return. Bonus Picks! Bonus picks are extra credit, wild ass guesses that don’t count against me if they fail to come to pass, but which get me some points if they somehow manifest into the real world. Bonus Pick 1 – AI to the Death Some studio… will it be you Krafton, or maybe this is a job for the petty and vindictive Tim Sweeney… will go all in on making a game with AI code, art assets, and audio. And it will crash and burn, becoming a complete disaster. This will need to be a big game. If you point out somebody did a tic-tac-toe title with AI, that isn’t going to count. This doesn’t mean somebody ruining their reputation by embracing AI publicly… again, Krafton, EA, and Tim Sweeney are already in that boat… but actually putting their money where there mouth is. Likewise, public revulsion and refusal to buy the game is out of bounds, it actually has to get reviewed and be announced to suck. The only reason this is a bonus pick is I am running a project that is using AI to code it and I have my doubts about the ability to produce anything complex. Bonus Pick 2 – Sports Betting Comes to EA! In looking at the Saudi purchase of EA, I am trying to figure out the upside financially. I mean, sure, the EA Sports franchise can spin money, but not enough to make the deal a net win. Meanwhile, sports betting apps are making so much money off of people that they are buying tons of ads during events to keep the gravy train running. And the Saudis know this. So I suspect that we’ll get some sort of announcement of an integration between EA Sports and gambling, likely first with the NFL, who will go along when the Saudis give them a cut. Summing Up So those are the predictions for 2026. That is 30 predictions to measure this year. Unless otherwise stated, each are worth 10 points, with partial credit available. I have a couple in there that could give me some extra credit, but we shall see if I get any of that. There are also bonus picks. I might add some more of those. But no ret-conning. I promise that. As always, the deadline is December 15th for things to come to pass. So if Amazon announces the end of New World on the 16th, I lose. But if Squadron 42 somehow ships on or after December 16th, I win, full points. That is a hard date. Now we’re off into the new year to see what becomes of us. I’d put one in place from my perspective: WoW private server (prospective) teams will have learned from Turtle WoW and won’t advertise or poke the bear, but instead will quietly continue to gain support for a Classic Plus on their own terms. If Turtle WoW didn’t do the stupid crap they were doing and essentially daring Microsoft to go after them, they’d still be around and doing Classic Plus their way. Other dev teams will learn from that and do their Classic Plus quietly. LikeLike 19. Ship of Heroes is already ‘buy to play’ in 2025. https://shipofheroes.com/new-low-price-no-subscription/ Do you get points for that? LikeLike Crap, you’re right. That was one of my early predictions and then they made the change and I already forgot I had written about it. Well, that will teach me to proof read. Zero points for predicting the past. I am already 10 points down! Let me go edit that so I don’t forget… AGAIN! LikeLike The only reason I didn’t predict PA selling off CCP in 2026 is the pride of the Pearl Abyss C-Suite. Selling the studio off that soon would be too great an admission that Crimson Desert failed. Also, bold prediction that EVE Vanguard doesn’t come out in 2026. If it doesn’t, Hilmar will be very upset. And probably the PA C-Suite because it might lower the value of CCP in a potential sale of the studio. As for Squadron 42, the largest minority shareholder (who owns 22% of CIG) just renegotiated the terms of his sale of his stock because SQ42 didn’t come out in 2025. The stock sale will happen in 2029 instead of 2028 and be based on revenue from 2026-2028 instead of 2025-2027. Another delay and things get really interesting.

Title: Crypto’s 2026 investment playbook: Bitcoin, stablecoin infrastructure, tokenized assets
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-investment-themes-2026-bitcoin-stablecoins-tokenized-assets
Time Published: 2026-01-01T18:00:00Z

After a volatile 2025, investors are rethinking crypto cycles. Here are three investment themes that will shape the market’s next phase in 2026. Cointelegraph in your social feed 2025 didn’t unfold the way many cryptocurrency investors expected. Although Bitcoin (BTC) peaked almost precisely in line with its historical four-year cycle, the long-anticipated blow-off top never materialized. Notably, Bitcoin’s gains failed to cascade into the broader market, leaving hopes for a full-fledged altcoin season largely unfulfilled. As a result, 2026 opens under a cloud of uncertainty. Investor sentiment is extremely negative, marked by caution and skepticism, even as the industry finds itself in an unprecedented position. For the first time in crypto’s 15-year history, institutions, corporations and regulators are largely moving in the same direction, laying the groundwork for broader adoption rather than actively resisting it. After a year defined by unexpected outcomes, identifying the most compelling investment opportunities for 2026 is no simple task. Still, a persuasive case can be made for focusing on assets and sectors with durable, long-term relevance, rather than relying solely on the predictability of four-year market cycles tied to the Bitcoin halving. There is also growing evidence that Bitcoin’s market structure has evolved. Institutional capital, with longer time horizons and stricter mandates, is increasingly influencing price action and liquidity dynamics. In doing so, these participants may be reshaping crypto market behavior, gradually shifting the narrative away from traditional drivers such as miners, long-term holders and Bitcoin whales. Against this backdrop, the following are three cryptocurrency investment themes worth watching in 2026. Related: VC Roundup: Big money, few deals as crypto venture funding dries up Bitcoin is now deep into its fourth halving epoch, and historically, the period following each halving has coincided with the most aggressive phase of the bull market. In prior cycles, Bitcoin typically reached its peak roughly 12 to 18 months after the halving, a pattern that has long shaped investor expectations. If history were to follow a familiar script, Bitcoin may have already marked its cycle high in October 2025, after climbing more than 600% from the 2022 lows. While such a move would be consistent with previous post-bear-market recoveries, it would still represent a comparatively modest gain relative to Bitcoin’s explosive early-cycle rallies, and would reinforce the notion of diminishing returns as the asset matures. However, not everyone is convinced that past cycles still apply. According to Bitwise analysts Matt Hougan and Ryan Rasmussen, Bitcoin may be on the cusp of breaking free from its long-standing four-year rhythm altogether. In 2026, “Bitcoin will break the four-year cycle and set new all-time highs,” they argued, pointing to structural shifts that are reshaping the market. In their view, traditional cycle drivers, such as halving-induced supply shocks, interest-rate volatility and highly leveraged speculative excess, carry less influence than they once did. While leverage remains a feature of crypto markets, its impact has diminished following a sharp deleveraging phase in late 2025, when a cascade of liquidations wiped out billions in open interest in October. That reset, they suggest, has reduced the probability of a classic blow-off top driven by excess speculation. More importantly, Hougan and Rasmussen see institutional capital as the defining variable of the next phase. The approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in 2024 marked the opening salvo, but broader adoption may still lie ahead. “The wave of institutional capital that began entering the space in 2024 is likely to accelerate in 2026,” they said, as major wealth platforms such as Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Merrill Lynch expand access and begin allocating on behalf of clients. A more accommodative monetary backdrop could reinforce that trend. Expected interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve would improve liquidity conditions, historically a favorable environment for risk assets, including Bitcoin. This view aligns with the research of Julien Bittel, a Chartered Financial Analyst at Global Macro Investor, who argues that Bitcoin is more closely tied to business and liquidity cycles than to halving schedules alone. “Based on our work on the business cycle, financial conditions and overall liquidity, the balance of probabilities suggests this cycle extends well into 2026,” Bittel wrote. “In that world, the four-year cycle is effectively dead.” Related: Bitcoin’s volatility below Nvidia in 2025 as investor base grew: Bitwise Beyond Bitcoin, few blockchain applications have demonstrated clearer real-world utility than stablecoins, digital tokens designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to fiat currencies such as the US dollar. Over the past 18 months, the stablecoin market has expanded rapidly, surpassing $300 billion in total circulation, led by dollar-backed tokens such as USDt (USDT) and USDC (USDC). What began as a tool for crypto traders has increasingly evolved into a foundational layer for payments, settlement and onchain liquidity. Regulation has played a central role in that transition. In mid-2025, US lawmakers advanced the GENIUS Act, comprehensive stablecoin legislation aimed at establishing clear rules for issuance, reserves and oversight. The framework, widely regarded as a turning point for the sector, aims to bring stablecoin issuers under a regulated regime while preserving their role in driving financial innovation. In parallel, US regulators have begun laying the groundwork for broader participation by the banking sector. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has proposed rule-making pathways that would allow regulated banks to issue payment stablecoins through approved subsidiaries, potentially integrating stablecoins directly into the traditional financial system. Within this evolving environment, stablecoins are increasingly viewed as a multi-purpose financial tool, enabling faster cross-border payments, facilitating onchain settlement and serving as the foundation for yield-bearing treasury instruments backed by short-term government debt. Policymakers have also framed stablecoins as a mechanism for reinforcing the global role of the US dollar, particularly in regions where access to dollar-denominated banking remains limited. That trend is not confined to the United States. Stablecoins pegged to other fiat currencies, including the euro and various emerging-market currencies, are gaining traction, underscoring their potential role as a global settlement layer rather than a purely dollar-centric product. From an investment standpoint, dollar-pegged stablecoins themselves offer virtually no upside. By design, they are not meant to appreciate, and ideally should never deviate from their peg. The real opportunity lies in the infrastructure that supports them. That infrastructure spans a growing ecosystem of issuers, custodians, compliance providers, blockchain networks and payment rails responsible for minting, redeeming, settling and safeguarding stablecoins at scale. As adoption expands, so too does the value of the platforms enabling these functions behind the scenes. Exposure to this theme has also begun spilling into traditional capital markets. Circle, the issuer of USDC, made a high-profile public debut. At the same time, PayPal Holdings launched its own dollar-backed stablecoin, signaling that legacy fintech firms see stablecoins not as a niche crypto product, but as a core component of future payment infrastructure. Related: Bank lobby is 'panicking' about yield-bearing stablecoins — NYU professor When BlackRock’s Larry Fink, the chief executive of one of the world’s most influential asset managers, says the “tokenization of all assets” is beginning, markets tend to pay attention. For long-term investors, it also signals that a once-theoretical blockchain use case is moving decisively into the mainstream of finance. Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization has evolved rapidly from a niche experiment into one of the most institutionally driven sectors in crypto. Major financial players, including BlackRock, Franklin Templeton and Goldman Sachs, have already launched or participated in tokenized funds, bonds and settlement platforms, placing traditional assets directly onto blockchain rails. Industry data indicate that the tokenized RWA market reached over $30 billion in onchain value by 2025, with private credit and US Treasury–backed products emerging as early leaders. These instruments appealed to institutions seeking yield and faster settlement without abandoning familiar asset classes. More recently, the scope of tokenization has expanded. Tokenized stocks and equity-like instruments are gaining traction, particularly outside the United States, as exchanges and fintech platforms explore blockchain-based representations of stocks and exchange-traded products. Kraken’s rollout of tokenized equities for select international markets has highlighted growing demand for 24/7, programmable access to traditional assets. At the same time, crypto-native companies are positioning themselves for a future where tokenization is no longer peripheral. After Coinbase signaled its push into stock trading, Brian Huang, CEO of Coinbase-backed portfolio manager Glider, said the move could serve as a strategic on-ramp to the tokenized asset market. “Coinbase will have a huge leg up when assets truly begin to become tokenized,” Huang said, citing the exchange’s regulatory positioning and custody infrastructure. For investors, the appeal of RWAs lies less in short-term speculation and more in structural adoption. Tokenization promises faster settlement, reduced counterparty risk and global accessibility. As regulatory frameworks mature and financial incumbents expand their onchain offerings, RWAs could emerge as one of the most durable crypto investment themes heading into 2026.

Title: January 1, 2026

Welcome to the New Year’s issue of the Mutual Fund Observer. We’re glad you’re here. Heraclitus, the famously elusive Greek philosopher, reminded his students that you cannot step into the same river twice. Both we and the river will have changed. According to legend, one of those students – snarky little barstid – replied: “I don’t think you can step into the same river once.” Even as we step, the river flows and changes. As do we. Heraclitus was speaking of a physical river. Centuries later, we have extended his insights to allow us to consider the River of Time itself: the continuous flow in which change happens, meaning accumulates, and our lives—and markets—actually unfold. January has that fluid quality. We think of ourselves standing on the bank of the River, looking backward and forward at once—convinced that the past can be measured and the future mapped, even as the present slips by almost unnoticed. The river does not pause for our resolutions. In reality, we don’t just get to watch time rush past; we are not on the bank, we are in the river. We may think we resolutely face the future, eyes upstream, scrying risk and opportunity. We may turn our back to the torrent, knowing that we can only know what has already passed and contemplating the dark sea into which it must eventually empty. We might be still and resolute, like a stone, or moving along with the flow. The young might experience a mere ankle-deep flow while some of us experience … the deeper currents pulling toward that wine-dark sea. Perspective matters. And metaphors matter because they teach us what to look for. From the riverbank, all motion feels alarming. From within the river, we begin to notice that not all movement means change, not all froth is consequential, and not all change arrives with noise. Some of what most shapes our lives—technological shifts, medical progress, environmental repair—moves steadily, almost invisibly, beneath the surface. This January issue of the Observer lingers over a stretch of the river that many hurried past. Amid the noise and anxiety of 2025, extraordinary things went quietly right: a vast expansion of green energy in China, meaningful progress against several endemic diseases, and other developments that rarely commanded headlines but may shape lives for decades to come. Uncertain times require clear thinking, and clear thinking requires … well, a functioning brain. In “New Year’s Resolution #1: Avoid lobotomies” we look at the threat that AI seductively poses to brains … yours, your alma mater’s, and your investment advisor’s. A short sidebar piece, “What Five AI Told Me About Investing in 2026, and what their answers tell you,” highlights the problematic patterns in AI’s response to an (admittedly unfair) question about what’s going to win in the year ahead. Our colleague Lynn Bolin contributes two complementary pieces exploring income-focused investing for the uncertain years ahead. In “My 2026 Investment Plan,” Lynn walks through the construction of his conservative Core TIRA portfolio – a traditional IRA designed to generate a steady income of at least 4% while limiting drawdowns to -15% during severe bear markets. He demonstrates how different funds yield differently depending on whether they’re responding to interest rate cycles or stock market cycles, and evaluates adding Standpoint Multi-Asset (REMIX) to improve diversification. Particularly valuable: Lynn’s analysis of how his portfolio performed through both the COVID bear market and the Great Normalization’s rising rates, and his discussion of why he’s moved from a 65% stock allocation to 50% as forecasts from the OECD, Federal Reserve, and Conference Board all point to slowing growth ahead. Vanguard’s own time-varying model now recommends a 40/60 stocks-to-bonds allocation – a near-revolutionary flip from the traditional 60/40. In “A Closer Look at Income Strategy,” Lynn drills deeper into the mechanics of generating steady income in an environment where short and intermediate Treasury yields are falling while long-term rates rise. Working from 30,000 feet (which Lipper categories produce income in low-yield environments) down to ground level (specific fund recommendations), he identifies funds that maintained consistent yields through multiple market cycles. His analysis reveals that some funds distribute more when stock market opportunities appear limited, while others fluctuate with interest rates – and a select few provide genuinely steady income regardless of market conditions. The payoff: an example portfolio that achieved 7.7% annual returns with a maximum drawdown of just -9.8% over the past six years while yielding 5.2%. The Shadow, as ever, surveys the month’s most consequential changes in the fund and ETF world in “Briefly Noted.” We also pause, briefly and with gratitude, to acknowledge those who have sustained the Observer—financially, intellectually, and through simple acts of encouragement. And then, before the current carries us onward, we raise a glass to what has been, to what is, and to what may yet emerge from upstream. Pessimism is easy. Way too easy, frankly. If I were to construct the Pessimism Industrial Complex, it would have three pillars: The federal government is controlled by toddlers, a bunch famous for tantrums when their irrational, I-am-the-universe demands are not met. And so we get the Trump Kennedy Center, chaired by Donald J. Trump and the Donald J. Trump US Institute for Peace. The Trump-class battleships that will populate The Golden Fleet. The Trump dollar coin. The Trump accounts for infants. The decision to make access to the national parks free on Trump’s birthday, which, I think, is somewhere in the month of Trumpruary. There are no adults left in the room. Interviews with three departing US senators made two points: (1) every member of the US Senate is appalled and (2) they’re all waiting “for the right time” to, you know, develop a spine, remember their oath of office, or something (“Why Won’t Senators Stand Up to Trump? We Asked 3 Who Called It Quits,” New York Times, 12/13/2025). Until then, the federal response to a global climate crisis is “don’t wanna and you can’t make me!” When you’re dealing with a creature named “The Doomsday Glacier,” it’s easy to foresee Bad Things Aplenty. The media loves reporting bad news. We don’t know where the newsroom adage “if it bleeds, it leads” originated – the confident online assertions about Hearst in the 1890s is unattributed and a random New York Magazine article in 1989 is laughably wrong – but it does express a well-documented truth. Bad news sells, terrible news sells more. A 20-year study of German media found a “significant, positive correlations between explicitly negative cover pages and the magazines’ sales” (Arango-Kure and Marcel Garz, “Bad News Sells,” Journal of Media Economics, 2014). Globally, every additional negative word added to a story’s title increases readership (Robertson, et al, “Negativity drives online news consumption,” Nature: Human Behavior, 2023; btw, their study of 105,000 online news stories also found that positive words in titles drove down readership) and the more negative a story is, the more frequently and widely it’s shared on social media (Watson, et al, “Negative online news articles are shared more to social media,” Scientific Reports, 2024). You love to doom-scroll. Doom‑scrolling, for the three of you who didn’t know, is the practiced art of dragging your thumb down an endless feed of bad news long after you have stopped learning anything new. It is not just “reading the news online”; it is staying locked in the loop of crisis headlines, live‑updated horrors, and algorithm-driven outrage until your mood and sense of the world are thoroughly saturated. Some psychologists speculate that it’s a hard-wired behavior; within evolutionary time-frames, our survival depends on obsessively locating and assessing all potential threats in our neighborhood (“is that a nice kitty or a creature whose nickname for me is ‘niblet’?”), and doom-scrolling is just the latest iteration of the impulse. Surveys and behavioral studies suggest that a substantial minority of adults, and a flat‑out majority of younger users, now report doom‑scrolling regularly (“Gen Z has a doomscrolling problem,” Newsweek, 5/11/2025). In those same studies, heavier doom‑scrolling is consistently associated with higher levels of stress, depression, anxiety, sleep problems, and even secondary trauma symptoms, a joy of witnessing wave after wave of misery through a four‑inch screen (Satici, et al, “Doomscrolling Scale: its Association with Personality Traits, Psychological Distress, Social Media Use, and Wellbeing,” Applied Research in the Quality of Life, 2022). And, boy howdy, is there a fair number of regrettable developments in the world. Andrew Winston’s curiously optimistic essay in Forbes (“2025: the year sustainability didn’t die,” 12/21/2025) began with a fairly bracing list of negatives: … the harsh reality is the world’s greatest challenges [are] getting worse. Inequality grew, especially at the very top, where individuals amassed unfathomable wealth (hundreds of billions of dollars) and some corporate valuations hit unreal heights ($4 trillion to $5 trillion). Meanwhile, climate impacts escalated; political winds don’t change actual winds. For example, part of Los Angeles burned to the ground (at an estimated cost of up to $250 billion) during unprecedented wildfires, historic heat baked India, Pakistan, and the EU, and devastating floods in Texas killed dozens of children. Scientists told us that climate change is “beyond scientific dispute,” at “tipping points,” and “extremely dangerous” (and that the world will blow past the 1.5C warming target). Insurer Allianz issued an eye-popping report that climate change could “destroy capitalism.” In addition, the world got less democratic and pulled to the right and generally away from the sustainability agenda, making collective action even harder. This puts more pressure on businesses. And even facing headwinds, sustainability didn’t die. That’s the top story of the year. Let’s look at that and some other big themes. Well … yeah. But if pessimism feels effortless at the end of 2025, that is not just because the news is bad; it is because you are mainlining it, in real time, on an interface designed never to run out. Much of our success as a species is driven by two factors: a good plan and resilience in executing it. The media’s business model tends to emphasize doom because, well, doom sells. But 2025 offered remarkable evidence that when we commit to sustained action—plugging ozone holes, protecting beaches, installing solar panels, developing breakthrough medicines, restoring ecosystems—we can achieve transformations that once seemed impossible. In our draft letter, what follows are eleven pages of incredibly consequential, positive developments. Chip’s anguished plea, “have mercy on their eyes!” led us to share the news in two forms: a dozen bullet points here and a dozen pages of detail in a sidebar story entitled, “The Big Box of Delights.” So here’s what happened while doom was scrolling: In November, a liquor store employee in Virginia discovered broken bottles and an apparently intoxicated raccoon sleeping on the store’s bathroom floor. An animal control officer noted that he fell through a ceiling tile, “went on a rampage, drinking everything,” with a special fondness for … umm, whisky. The animal showed no signs of injury, according to local animal protection services, though they guessed the raccoon might be grappling with “a hangover” and regret over “poor life choices.” Figure 1: Raccoon regretting its poor life choices. Source: NBC News. The story delighted readers across the political spectrum—a rare moment of shared laughter in a divided time. But it became more than a viral moment when merchandise commemorating the raccoon’s night of debauchery raised a quarter of a million dollars for the local animal shelter that housed him. The Hanover County animal protection service teamed up with apparel maker Bonfire to create shirts, sweatshirts, cups, and stickers featuring the now-infamous image of a raccoon spreadeagled next to a spilled booze bottle, along with the words “Trashed Panda.” Through 12/22, they’ve sold 19,764 against a goal of 20,000. The drunk raccoon reminds us that hope sometimes arrives in unexpected forms: in a hungover raccoon that brings people together, in merchandise that funds animal care, in our capacity to find joy and meaning in the absurd. On Christmas Day, Pope Leo made his traditional papal “Urbi et Orbi” address, Latin for “To the City and to the World,” which summarizes the bad news (see above, plus your danged doomscroll) and prescribes a response: put aside indifference, stop scrolling and start acting, stand with the oppressed rather than the oppressive. “There will be peace when our monologues are interrupted and, enriched by listening, we fall to our knees before the humanity of the other.” Stop wasting our time demonizing one another? Dreamer. Progress is rarely dramatic. It’s built day by day through the determined efforts of scientists, healthcare workers, conservationists, educators, and ordinary citizens working to solve problems both great and small. While 2025’s headlines often focused on conflict and crisis, millions of people worldwide continued humanity’s long tradition of quietly building a better world. They dreamt of better, and acted. The answer to “what’s there to be optimistic about?” is the same as it was in 2025, and will be in 2027: enormous things happened because millions of good people rejected the counsel of despair, and that you probably didn’t hear about because doom sells better than progress. The choice isn’t between naive optimism and realistic despair. It’s between staying informed about what’s actually happening—the turtle populations recovering, the emissions curves bending, the diseases being eliminated, the hungover raccoons raising money for animal shelters—and letting a curated feed of catastrophe convince you that nothing good is possible. Step away from the mediated world and step into the immediate one. Put your phones away. Hug someone today. Smile at a stranger. Do a good deed. Read a book. We recommend Always Remember (2025), a singularly beautiful little 30-minute read that reminds you of important things you already know but need to hear. Subscribe to Nautilus, a site (and magazine) that reminds you that science is cool … and important. Consider joining The Conversation, a site that has actual researchers write clear articles about important topics (“Deepfakes leveled up in 2025. Here’s what’s coming next.”) Be like Jimmy the President. Be like Leo the Pope. Be like the Drunken Raccoon. Make a difference where you are. (Want cool pictures, more detail, and a couple more stories? Open “The Big Box o’ Delights.” Or, if you’re in the long-scroll version, just keep scrolling!) The question’s not hypothetical, at least for investors. In truth, you have no idea of what’s coming. If you knew, you’d be richer than Croesus. Two things are true when we stand in the river of time: we can see neither the river’s bottom nor what’s coming at us from just around the bend. The bottom might fall out. The torrent might be nearly upon us. We cannot know, but we’ve still got to act. In general, the guides that professionals use are called “capital market assumptions” – data-driven estimates of the range of likely outcomes given current inputs. “Given a CAPE of 40 and capex spending of X, the likeliest range of US equity returns over the next 3-5 years falls between…” The recommendations that flow from those assumptions are called “strategic asset allocations,” statements that say broadly “a prudent investor with an intermediate time horizon should plan on holding X% in equities, with the possibility of some adjustments as markets evolve.” The problem is that there are a million factors weighing on markets, but not all million – birth rates in Nigeria? thawing permafrost in Siberia? financial nihilism in Gen Z? – can be incorporated into the models. Different trillion-dollar advisors reach very different trillion-dollar conclusions about what course to chart. Two of the largest firms – BlackRock and Vanguard – seem to have reached starkly different conclusions about prudent investor behavior. Given Vanguard’s intrinsic conservativeness, their new recommendation seems particularly tectonic. Vanguard’s call: For investors with a medium-term outlook (3-5 years), flip the traditional 60% stocks/40% bonds allocation to 40/60. Same expected returns as 60/40, but with substantially less risk. Why? The S&P 500’s CAPE ratio sits at 40.40 – rivaling the dot-com bubble peak. Vanguard projects US equities will return just 3.5% to 5.5% annually over the next decade, while growth stocks (including the Magnificent Seven) may deliver only 2.3% to 4.3%. Meanwhile, bonds now offer 3.8% to 4.8% with far less volatility. Roger Aliaga-Díaz, Vanguard’s global head of portfolio construction: “We see that overvaluation of equity markets more as a risk to the investor than as opportunity.” This isn’t panic or market timing. In a December podcast, Vanguard’s chief economists explained that “stay the course” never meant “never adjust your allocation.” It meant stay invested, avoid emotional decisions, but use evidence-based risk management. Their Time-Varying Asset Allocation model – driven by the Vanguard Capital Markets Model that processes decades of data on risk factors and returns – now suggests this is a moment for conservative asset allocation. They estimate a 25-30% probability that AI disappoints and fails to deliver on current expectations. Goldman Sachs concurs on muted US prospects, forecasting just 6.5% annual S&P 500 returns through 2035 – driven by earnings, not the multiple expansion that powered the last decade. They see better opportunities elsewhere: Emerging Markets (+10.9%), Asia ex-Japan (+10.3%), Japan (+8.2%). The “multiple expansion era” is over, they argue. Profit margins already jumped from 5% in 1990 to 13% today and can’t expand further. BlackRock takes the opposite view: Stay pro-risk, overweight US stocks on the AI theme. Yes, valuations are stretched, and concentration is concerning, but AI capital spending is transforming the economy at an unprecedented scale. The challenge isn’t whether to reduce equity exposure – it’s identifying which companies beyond the current winners will capture AI revenues as they spread across sectors. Their 2026 outlook emphasizes “the diversification mirage” – that traditional diversifiers like long-term Treasuries now offer diminished cushion, so seek idiosyncratic returns in private markets and active strategies instead. T. Rowe Price splits the difference: Neutral on equities overall but underweight US large-cap (-2.0%) while overweight small-cap, international, and emerging markets. They’re concerned about “the narrowness of AI trends” and prefer to position for market broadening. Like Vanguard, they’re underweight long-term bonds, worried about fiscal deficits keeping upward pressure on rates. What’s an investor to make of this? The honest answer is that nobody knows what’s upstream. Vanguard’s systematic approach says: when you can’t see around the bend, measure what you can – valuations, yields, historical risk/return relationships – and position defensively. BlackRock’s view: the AI build-out is real, the momentum is powerful, stay engaged but stay nimble. Both might be right over different time horizons. The shift isn’t just theoretical. Our colleague Lynn Bolin has reduced his overall stock allocation from 65% to 50% over the past year, positioning his conservative Core TIRA portfolio to weather what he expects will be a more turbulent second half of the decade. My own long-term allocation, which we discuss each February along with my portfolio, is 50/50. Research Affiliates, whose long-term asset allocation system has been broadly validated, offers striking support for the defensive shift. Their models project that a global 60/40 portfolio will deliver just 2.5% real returns over the next decade with a Sharpe ratio of 0.16. Their conservative model portfolio – shifting to 40% equity/60% bonds with commodities and inflation-linked assets – projects 3.5% real returns with a Sharpe ratio of 0.44. The more defensive portfolio projects higher returns with better risk-adjusted performance. Their analysis also reinforces Goldman’s geographic thesis: looking across asset classes globally, US large-cap growth shows near-zero risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratio of -0.01), while developed ex-US large-cap value, emerging markets, and smaller international stocks all show meaningfully better prospects. The message is consistent: lighten on US growth, reduce overall equity exposure, look globally. The takeaway isn’t that one firm has discovered the answer. It’s that even trillion-dollar asset managers using sophisticated models reach honestly different conclusions from the same data. Vanguard says reduce equity risk because valuations are stretched and bonds are finally paying again. BlackRock says stay engaged because AI momentum is real and traditional diversifiers don’t work like they used to. Goldman says look elsewhere entirely – emerging markets and Asia offer better prospects than US equities. Research Affiliates’ models strongly favor the defensive positioning. Which suggests that broad diversification driven by your needs – not by greed or fear or the confident pronouncements of any single adviser – remains the most prudent course when standing in a river whose depths and currents we cannot fully know. The evidence from multiple independent sources supports a more conservative stance than the traditional 60/40 for those with intermediate time horizons. Whether that means 50/50, 40/60, or some other mix depends on your own circumstances, goals, and capacity to weather volatility. But the days of assuming that 60/40 will automatically deliver double-digit returns through multiple expansion and tech dominance? Those have already flowed past us. To the good folks we’ve met along the way, and with whom we chat too rarely. To Andrew and Michelle Foster of Seafarer Capital Partners for their vision of a better kind of fund company, and their enduring success. To Mark and Tina Oelschlager, the folks behind the small and excellent Towpath Focus Fund, for thoughtful talks and cheerful humanity … and enduring success.

To Chuck Jaffe, aka “Hurricane Chuck,” who’s still at it after all these years, and to Dan Wiener, who our colleague Ed Studzinski denominated as Dan Dan the Vanguard Man, who has had the sense to take a step back and enjoy life. To our colleague Lynn Bolin, who has done likewise and yet writes better than ever, and to The Shadow, who might yet find cause to slow down. To Victoria Odinotska of Kanter Public Relations, a bright spirit and humane voice who toils bravely while under the burden of the ongoing assault on her beloved homeland.

Title: My 2026 Investment Plan

I recently automated withdrawals from one conservative Traditional IRA (Core TIRA) into my short-term investment bucket for basic spending needs and emergencies. Previously, I automated withdrawals from a more aggressive Traditional IRA for longer-term discretionary spending needs. This exercise increased my focus on income. I just added Janus Henderson AAA CLO ETF (JAAA) to my Core TIRA sub-portfolio as a lower-risk income fund rather than to pursue higher returns. The Core TIRA is conservate Traditional IRA, within the Intermediate Investment Bucket, that is intended to have long-term returns of 7% or more on average, have maximum drawdowns of -15% or less during a severe bear market, and provide steady income of at least 4%. This sub-portfolio has an allocation to stocks of 25%, but utilizes six funds classified as “flexible portfolio” or “alternative”. Now that I have completed the Core TIRA portfolio, I am preparing for a mid-2026 review when a bond matures and needs to be reinvested. In this article, I review historical distribution yields and look at the life-of-fund drawdowns and correlations. I evaluate the performance of the Core TIRA over the past five years with and without Standpoint Multi-Asset as a potential purchase, and compare the results against Vanguard Global Wellesley. I conclude with long-term views of the economy by the OECD, the Federal Reserve survey of professional forecasters, and a look at Vanguard’s time-varying portfolio. I wanted to understand the potential for the funds in my Core TIRA to produce a steady income of 4% per year. Some funds in the Core TIRA have yields, including capital gains, that fluctuate with the interest rate cycle, others that fluctuate according to the stock market cycle, and still others that provide a steady stream of income. I calculated the total distribution since 2019 by year from historical prices at the NASDAQ website and distribution history from Seeking Alpha. Yields for 2025 will change with end-of-year distributions. Table #1 shows the yields per year for each of the funds in my Core TIRA, with red shading indicating the lowest yield and blue shading the highest. All of the funds yielded at least 3.2% over the past six years, with PAIMX yielding 6.0%. Those whose inception date is after 2019 have the symbol highlighted in yellow. Three funds (FPFIX, JAAA, PVCMX) have higher yields when interest rates are high, and may have downward pressure on yields as interest rates fall. Those whose yield fluctuates more with the stock market cycle (PCBAX, AVALX, CTFAX) appear to have larger distributions when opportunities in the stock market appear to be low. PMAIX and PONAX have the most consistent distributions, with PMAIX having the potential for a higher total return. Of the two funds that I am considering adding in my mid-2026 review, EAGMX has high steady yields, while REMIX has a low correlation to the S&P 500 and bonds, and a higher potential for total return. Table #1: Historical Distribution Yield Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset, Seeking Alpha, NASDAQ. The objective of the Core TIRA portfolio, including the bond ladder, is to provide steady returns and cash flow that grow with inflation into my Investment Bucket #1 for spending even through a secular bear market. Table #2 shows how funds in my Core TIRA have performed over their lives, sorted from lowest risk to highest. All of the funds had an APR of almost 4% or higher during their lives. “APR Min 10-yr Roll” shows the return for the worst ten-year rolling period within the life of the fund. The purpose of finding uncorrelated funds is to ensure that funds are not moving down at the same time. For long-term stability, I like CTFAX and PMAIX, which had “APR Min 10-yr Roll” of 4.7% or more. Table #2: Author’s Core TIRA Portfolio – Life of Fund Metrics Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. I used Portfolio Visualizer to further analyze the Core TIRA portfolio for the past five years, including adding REMIX as shown in Table #3. I compare it to Vanguard Global Wellesley (VGYAX, VGWIX), which I also own elsewhere. The link to Portfolio Visualizer Portfolio Backtesting is provided here. Table #3: Analyzing Adding REMIX to the Core TIRA Sub-Portfolio Source: Author Using Portfolio Visualizer Figure #1 shows the growth of $10,000 invested in the Core TIRA with and without REMIX, and Vanguard Global Wellesley (VGYAX, VGWIX). I like how REMIX fits into the Core TIRA portfolio, and it increases income. I own Vanguard Global Wellesley in other accounts for its professional management and simplicity. Figure #1: Analyzing Adding REMIX to the Core TIRA Sub-Portfolio Source: Author Using Portfolio Visualizer The funds can be loosely divided into three groups based on the past six years: 1) those that had low drawdowns (PVCMX, FPFIX, PCBAX, EAGMX), 2) those that had their maximum drawdown during The Great Normalization with rising rates (PONAX, PZRMX, CTFAX, and IAU), and 3) those that had their maximum drawdown during the COVID bear market (PMAIX, AVALX). Table #4 is the correlation matrix for the funds. They have low correlation with each other; however, PONAX, PZRMX, PMAIX, and CTFAX are moderately correlated. Table #4: Correlation Matrix Source: Author Using Portfolio Visualizer My conservative Core TIRA sub-portfolio consists of three funds classified as “alternatives”, three mixed asset funds in the “Flexible Portfolio” Lipper Category, and two in the “Multi-Sector Income” Category. I try to capture the objective and strategy of the funds below: Alternative Global Macro: Lipper Definition: Funds that, by prospectus language, invest around the world using economic theory to justify the decision-making process. The strategy is typically based on forecasts and analysis about interest rate trends, the general flow of funds, political changes, government policies, intergovernmental relations, and other broad systemic factors. These funds generally trade a wide range of markets and geographic regions, employing a broad range of trading ideas and instruments. Morningstar classifies PCBAX as “Macro Trading”, but EAGMX as “Nontraditional Bond”. Absolute Return: Lipper Definition: Funds that aim for positive returns in all market conditions. The funds are not benchmarked against a traditional long-only market index but rather have the aim of outperforming a cash or risk-free benchmark. David Snowball wrote Standpoint Multi-Asset Fund: Forcing Me to Reconsider in the November 2021 MFO Newsletter: “The fund provides exposure to equities (which help in times of economic growth or inflation), fixed income (which buffers deflationary periods and stock market declines), and commodities (which are uncorrelated with the first two, making it possible to minimize the effects of both sustained price changes and of an equity market decline). Half of the portfolio is invested in low-cost ETFs to give exposure to the global equity market. The argument is simple: over time, equities make serious money, especially if you don’t overpay for them. The fund holds eight equity ETFs charging between 3 and 7 basis points. The other half of the portfolio is managed futures positions. The positions can be in stocks and fixed income, as well as currencies and commodities. ‘Once a year we pull down the information on all the future contracts in the world, arrayed from most liquid to least liquid. We exclude the untradeable, then select the 75 most liquid in six sectors which includes equity index futures, bond futures, currencies, metals, energy, and agricultural commodities.’ Using a market following strategy, the futures contracts allow the portfolio’s exposure to equity markets to be increased beyond its 50% base (it was at 65% in mid-summer) or decreased to near zero.” Flexible Portfolio: Lipper Definition: Funds that allocate their investments to both domestic and foreign securities across traditional asset classes with a focus on total return. The traditional asset classes utilized are common stocks, bonds, and money market instruments. Morningstar classifies PZRMX as “Global Conservative Allocation”, PMAIX as “Global Moderate Allocation”, and CTFAX as “Tactical Allocation”. In Figure #2, I compare Standpoint Multi-Asset (REMIX) and Eaton Vance Global Macro Absolute Return (EAGMX) to PCBAX, PMAIX, and CTFAX. Eaton Vance Global Macro Absolute Return (EAGMX) has a smooth, low-risk profile and yields 5.6%. EAGMX had a maximum drawdown of -3% during the Great Financial Crisis, while PCBAX had a drawdown of -29%. I bought PCBAX because it has returned 4.9% annualized since 2010, while EAGMX returned 3.4%. I favor REMIX for its low correlation to other funds in the Core TIRA. Figure #2: Comparison of Funds in Watch List to Core Funds in Portfolio Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. During the first half of this decade, the investment environment has experienced a lot of turbulence. I expect the second half to be more turbulent and have reduced risk accordingly. I recently attended the Economy Watch webinar by The Conference Board. They estimate that global growth will moderate over the next 15 years, and long-term growth in the U.S. will slow to less than 2.0%. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released its OECD Economic Outlook, Volume 2025 Issue 2, which shows its estimates of real GDP growth in the U.S. to be below 2.0% in 2026 and 2027. The Fourth Quarter 2025 Survey of Professional Forecasters by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia estimates that real GDP will be 1.8% in 2026, 2.1% in 2027, and 1.8% in 2028. In my opinion, the U.S. economy is experiencing slowing growth in the late stage of the business cycle. Vanguard updated its time-varying portfolio in Bonds Remain In Favor In Time-Varying Model Portfolio. They describe it as, “The TVAA strategy is built on the framework of the Vanguard Asset Allocation Model (VAAM), driven by forecasts generated by the Vanguard Capital Markets Model (VCMM).” Their TVAA model results in a globally diversified 40/60 portfolio tilted toward value, as shown in Figure #3. The TVAA has an expected annualized 10-year return of 5.7%. Figure #3: Vanguard TVAA Model Source: Vanguard calculations, as of October 31, 2025 I use financial advisors at Vanguard to manage a portion of my portfolio using both index and actively managed funds. The time-varying strategy is not one of the options available. Over the past year, I have lowered my overall stock-to-bond allocation from 65% to 50% with a below-average allocation to technology because I expect stocks to have below-average returns. I invest in Vanguard Global Wellesley in other accounts, which has a 40/60 allocation, but also in Vanguard Global Wellington, which has a 60/40 allocation. I can sleep at night with the Bucket Approach and my Core TIRA account to meet essential spending needs and emergencies even in a secular bear market. During my mid-2026 review, I will ensure that sufficient funds are in place to meet 2027 withdrawals and confirm if I want to: 1) extend a rung in the bond ladder with iShares iBonds Dec 2034 Term Corporate ETF (IBDZ), 2) add Standpoint Multi-Asset (REMIX) to the Core TIRA, 3) increase the allocation to Victory Pioneer Multi-Asset Income (PMAIX) because of its focus on steady and high income, and 4) reduce investments in non-core bond funds. I don’t plan to sell any of the ten core funds in the Core TIRA. I wish everyone a happy and prosperous 2026. Lynn Bolin retired in June 2022 and is immensely enjoying the more relaxed lifestyle.

Star manager Tiffany Hsiao returned to Matthews Asia in mid-November after a stint managing a private fund for Artisan Partners. In mid-December, she was joined by two members of her team from Artisan. It does not appear that she’ll be responsible for individual funds just now but will, instead, work with Mark Headley and the existing Matthews managers “to generate new perspectives and insights across portfolios.” This is unalloyedly good news for Matthews investors, and we’ll reach out to Mark and Tiffany in the month ahead to see what she’s seeing. “The Wildermuth Fund is in liquidation pursuant to a Plan of Liquidation (the “Plan”) adopted by the Fund’s Board of Trustees (the “Board”) in June 2023. Additionally, in June 2023, the Fund suspended sales of Fund shares and quarterly repurchase offers,” with BW Asset Management brought on board to oversee the liquidation. Oddly, 30 months later, the fund has no audited financial statements, which might explain the lack of, well, liquidation? On June 1, 2026, three Baillie Gifford funds will become ETFs. Technically, these are mergers where a shell ETF is created, and it then acquires all of the assets and liabilities of a preceding mutual fund. On January 9, 2026, a series of BNY Mellon fixed income funds will become active, transparent ETFs with “the same management fee and an estimated lower total annual expense ratio” as their predecessors. At an unspecified point “in the first quarter of 2026,” the Impax Global Sustainable Infrastructure Fund will become the Impax Global Infrastructure ETF. The advisor expects a lower expense ratio will follow, but hasn’t offered any details. The Snowball ETF is in registration and has no connection with the Mutual Fund Observer or its editor. It is an actively managed ETF that will invest in U.S. securities and securities of issuers of foreign developed markets through ADRs. The ETF will be managed by Gabe Plotkin. Expenses have not been stated as of this writing. At an unspecified point “in the first quarter of 2026,” the Towle Value Fund (formerly the Towle Deep Value Fund) becomes the Towle Value ETF. Expenses will be capped at 0.85%. Vanguard announced the launch of its Vanguard Core-Plus Bond Index ETF (BNDP), a new fixed income offering designed to deliver broad, diversified exposure to the U.S. taxable bond market. It will have an estimated expense ratio of just 0.05%. Josh Barrickman will lead day-to-day oversight of BNDP. On the topic of Vanguard, it unveiled its first target date fund since 2003, when it offered its Vanguard Target Retirement series. The Vanguard Target Retirement Lifetime Income series will follow the path of its flagship funds until age 55, when it begins allocating to the TIAA Secure Income Account, a savings annuity. A savings annuity lets you build up money over time and later convert it into an income stream for life backed by the insurance company. By age 65, the annuity portion will reach 25% of the portfolio, and investors can decide whether to convert that portion into lifetime income payments. This series will only be available through defined-contribution plans, such as 401(k)s. Fees start at 0.08% for the mutual fund and can be lower for collective investment trusts, depending on plan size. The Invesco QQQ Trust has received approval to be reorganized from a unit investment trust to an open-end ETF. Trading of the reorganized ETF commenced on December 22nd. As part of the conversion, shareholders of Invesco QQQ will benefit from a decrease in the fund’s total expense ratio from 0.20% to 0.18%. The reclassification also provides the opportunity for Invesco QQQ to reinvest income and participate in securities lending. There will be no tax implications from this conversion for QQQ investors. Nope. All is well. Effective March 10, 2026, American Century Disciplined Core Value Fund will be renamed Disciplined Value Fund, while the Equity Growth Fund will be renamed Disciplined Core Equity Fund. On December 8, 2025, AMG Montrusco Bolton Large Cap Growth Fund became the AMG GW&K Small Cap Growth Fund, which involves a complete strategy change from large cap to small cap and from non-diversified to diversified. The new management team has done a perfectly fine job running the AMG GW&K Small/Mid Cap Growth Fund for the past four years. On December 15, 2025, the $7 million Gabelli Automation ETF became the Gabelli Global Technology Leaders ETF. The plan is to become a global, all-cap fund that invests in companies with “market leadership and competitive advantages.” Effective after the close of business on February 13, 2026, the Goldman Sachs Balanced Strategy Portfolio’s name will change to the Goldman Sachs Conservative Allocation Fund, the Goldman Sachs Growth and Income Strategy Portfolio’s name will change to Goldman Sachs Moderate Allocation Fund, and the Goldman Sachs Growth Strategy Portfolio’s name will change to the Goldman Sachs Growth Allocation Fund. There will also be changes to the funds’ investment strategies, which shareholders should investigate. The GS filing did not specify what those changes will be, only that there will be changes and that paragraph 17 of the prospectus should be deleted in its entirety and replaced with … The $5 million Alger Weatherbie Enduring Growth ETF, a mid-cap growth ESG growth ETF, has already liquidated its portfolio and will cease operations on Christmas Eve 2025. The team also runs the larger but not particularly distinguished Specialized Growth Fund for Alger. Ancora MicroCap Fund will cease operations on February 27, 2026. Azoria 500 Meritocracy ETF and Azoria TSLA Convexity ETF disappeared on December 15, 2025. The $12 million ClearBridge Sustainable Infrastructure ETF will liquidate and dissolve on or about January 29, 2026. CoinShares Bitcoin Leverage ETF was dissolved and liquidated on December 16, 2025. Defiance Daily Target 2x Long PM ETF went up in smoke (that’s a joke about the fund’s sole holding, Philip Morris) on December 23, 2025. Defiance Enhanced Long Vol ETF and Defiance Daily Target 2X Long JPM ETF ceased their defiance on December 31, 2025. DWS Floating Rate Fund will be liquidated on or about March 23, 2026. Assuming shareholder approval, the tiny, one-star Fidelity U.S. Low Volatility Equity Fund would be reorganized on a tax-free basis with and into the $1.5 billion, two-star Fidelity Low Volatility Factor ETF on May 26, 2026. The ETF has substantially outperformed the fund, though both invest in US stocks. First Trust/Confluence Small Cap Value Fund will be liquidated on or around February 20, 2026. First Trust Riverfront Dynamic Europe ETF will become noticeably less dynamic on or around January 16, 2026 Goldman Sachs ESG Emerging Markets Equity Fund and Goldman Sachs Emerging Markets Equity ex. China Fund will both cease operations on February 13, 2026. IDX Risk-Managed Digital Assets Strategy Fund will be cashed out on or about January 18, 2026. Invesco Real Assets ESG ETF, Invesco MSCI Green Building ETF, Invesco Alerian Galaxy Blockchain Users, and Decentralized Commerce ETF will all undergo termination and liquidation on February 25, 2026. Invesco Environmental Focus Municipal Fund will be terminated on January 6, 2026. Invesco MSCI World SRI Index Fund is gone as of February 24, 2026. Shareholders have been asked to approve the reorganization of Longleaf Partners International Fund into Longleaf Partners Global Fund. Matthews China Dividend Fund will be merged into Matthews Asia Dividend Fund on or about January 27, 2026. Morgan Stanley Institutional High Yield Portfolio is expected to liquidate on or about January 28, 2026. The one-star, $1 million Morgan Stanley Institutional American Resilience Portfolio will be declared non-resilient on or about January 16, 2026. Neuberger Berman U.S. Equity Impact Fund loses impact on or about February 19, 2026. Neuberger Berman Municipal High Income Fund and Neuberger Berman Municipal Impact Fund are being merged into Neuberger Berman Municipal Intermediate Bond Fund; no date for the merger is available. PGIM Jennison NextGeneration Global Opportunities Fund will be liquidated on February 10, 2026, followed by PGIM Jennison International Small-Mid Cap Opportunities Fund on or about February 24, 2026. The three-star, $44 million Prospector Capital Appreciation Fund and the four-star, $94 million Prospector Opportunity Fund will be liquidated on or about December 30, 2025. The Capital Appreciation Fund was managed at launch by three guys who were sorts of stars: Kevin O’Brien who managed Neuberger Berman Genesis, Richard P. Howard, a long-time manager of T. Rowe Price Capital Appreciation (PRWCX), and John Gillespie of T. Rowe Price Growth Stock and New Age Media, who were hopeful of bringing a fresh take on a strategy that Mr. Howard had done brilliantly with. The fund paced PRWCX for about three years, then began to fall behind. Mr. Howard left in 2014, as did Mr. Gillespie in 2021. The funds on the “WTF were you thinking” short-list disappeared on December 29, 2025: STKd 100% MSTR & 100% COIN ETF (APED), STKd 100% SMCI & 100% NVDA ETF (SPCY) and STKd 100% UBER & 100% TSLA ETF (ZIPP). Assuming shareholder approval, on March 20, 2026, Saturna Bond Income Fund and Saturna Short-Term Bond Fund both merge into Saturna Sustainable Bond Fund, while the $12 million five-star Saturna Global High Income Fund (which is about 30% equities) merges into three-star, $25 million Saturna Core Fund (which is about 63% equities). Shareowners will be asked to vote on these Reorganizations at a shareowner meeting that is anticipated to be held on February 27, 2026. On March 30, 2026, the $25 million Saturna Sustainable Equity Fund, a global fund that’s 50/50 US/international, merges into the Saturna International Fund without the need for shareholder approval. Stewart Investors Worldwide Leaders Fund was liquidated on December 16, 2025. T. Rowe Price Asia Opportunities Fund will be merged with and into the T.

Crypto "died" again in 2025. Yet ETFs pulled $46B, stablecoin laws passed, and Vanguard reversed its crypto ban. Price collapsed; infrastructure won. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. 2025 delivered at least four distinct “crypto is dead” episodes: a January AI-induced flash crash, the October tariff liquidation that erased $19 billion in leveraged positions, months of altcoin carnage, and a fourth quarter slump that wiped out the year's price gains. Mainstream outlets dusted off “crypto winter” language each time. Bitcoin logged more obituaries by mid-year than in all of 2024, bringing the all-time tally past 470 since 2010. Yet, beneath the violent drawdowns and Twitter eulogies, the infrastructure kept building. Stablecoin legislation passed. Spot ETFs pulled in tens of billions. Major jurisdictions published actual rulebooks rather than issuing enforcement threats. The result is a year where crypto “died” repeatedly on price charts but quietly became more entrenched in global financial plumbing than ever before. The latest data from Bitcoin Is Dead show Bitcoin has ‘died’ 431 times, with gold bug Peter Schiff topping the Bitcoin obituary list. The first “crypto is dead” chorus arrived in late January, courtesy of Chinese AI model DeepSeek. On Jan. 27, a cross-asset sell-off hit tech stocks and bled into digital assets. A single session erased roughly $269 billion from the total crypto market cap and wiped out about $850 million in leveraged positions. Bitcoin dropped by more than 10%, from around $105,000 to below $98,000 in a matter of hours. AI-linked tokens fell up to 70% in a day. Analysts suggested that DeepSeek had punctured not just the AI bubble but the entire “risk-on” trade, with Bitcoin singled out as the bellwether whose rally suddenly looked fragile. The timing, barely a month into the year, gave the sell-off extra weight. The crash took Bitcoin only back to late-December levels, not into a bear market regime. Prices later set new all-time highs above $124,000 by July, then another peak in October. Market microstructure analyses framed it as the first major stress test of a more institutionally plugged-in crypto market rather than an existential failure, since the crash was driven by macro and AI repricing. The January episode looked scary in real time, but in hindsight, it played out like a violent shakeout inside a still-bullish tape. The biggest “crypto is dead” moment came on Oct. 10. President Donald Trump's surprise announcement of a 100% tariff on Chinese imports during the thin weekend liquidity triggered what CoinGlass calls the largest liquidation event in crypto history. Estimates cluster around $20 billion of leveraged positions erased in under 24 hours, with more than 1.6 million accounts liquidated. Bitcoin fell from $121,000 to near $107,000 within hours, Ethereum plunged below $4,000, and many altcoins printed near-zero wicks as market makers pulled orders. The episode proved that crypto leverage and market structure were still dangerously fragile, despite the new ETF era. Policymakers explicitly used the event to argue that pending US market structure bills underestimated the systemic risk posed by crypto. JPMorgan identifies crypto-native leverage unwinding as the primary driver of the Bitcoin and Ethereum market downturn. The scale of the liquidations was larger than anything seen in prior cycles, including Terra/Luna or FTX, which made it easy to frame as a reckoning. Yet, prices didn't collapse to prior-cycle levels. Even after the rout and subsequent fourth-quarter slide, Bitcoin mostly traded in a $80,000-$100,000 band into year-end, well above the 2022-23 lows. Structure changed, not vanished. Derivatives open interest dropped by roughly 25% in a single day, but spot ETFs, custodians, and on-chain markets continued to function. Inflows into regulated products remained positive year to date, even after October. CoinShares tallies around $46.2 billion entering crypto ETFs in 2025, and BlackRock alone reports $74.8 billion in inflows to its digital asset ETFs as of Dec. 31. The October liquidation was the largest in history, but the institutional rails passed a stress test. Custodians didn't blow up. Exchanges stayed online. ETFs continued to process creation and redemption baskets. The plumbing worked, even as the speculative superstructure got demolished. Another thread in the “crypto is dead” narrative is the destruction in higher-beta sectors. AI tokens and memecoins took repeated beatings throughout 2025. During the January DeepSeek episode, many AI-linked coins fell 20% or more in 24 hours, with some recording intraday losses of up to 70%. Later coverage turned to “2025 meme and AI altcoin crash” angles, describing how sectors that led the early-year euphoria had given back most of their gains and, in some cases, round-tripped to pre-cycle prices. Trump-themed and election-related meme tokens saw heavy drawdowns as the year wore on. The memecoin wreckage was real and brutal, with hundreds of tokens that had spiked 10-fold or more in early 2025 finishing the year down over 90% from their peaks. This is the perennial story of speculative layers getting decimated while underlying rails consolidate. Chainalysis noted that DeFi TVL recovered significantly from 2023 lows even as hack losses and protocol blow-ups stayed below prior peak levels. The altcoin carnage was a feature, not a bug, consisting of a violent sorting mechanism that punished purely speculative bets while leaving infrastructure plays relatively intact. From mid-November into December, mainstream outlets wrote Bitcoin's obituary again. By mid-November, Bitcoin had fallen about 30% from its October record and given back its year-to-date gains. Mainstream finance publications framed it as erasing 2025 gains and asked whether Trump-driven optimism had run its course. Additionally, the term “crypto winter” was back in usage, which is the richest vein of “crypto is dead” language. 99Bitcoins data show Bitcoin had already logged more “obituaries” in 2025 by mid-year than in all of 2024, with at least 11 separate death declarations tracked by summer. The fourth-quarter slump gave critics ammunition. If the year started with euphoria over Trump's strategic Bitcoin reserve and ended with prices lower than where they began, what was the point? Yet, the counterpoints are strong. Bitcoin ETFs are still $22 billion in inflows this year, and the historically hostile Vanguard reversed course in December, allowing clients to trade third-party crypto ETFs, citing market maturation. With $9.3 trillion under management, Vanguard’s entry into crypto ETFs could usher tens of billions in new demand despite modest initial allocations. Besides, Wall Street moved as generic SEC listing standards opened the door to multi-asset crypto ETFs, including products holding XRP, Solana, and even Dogecoin. For price context, Bitcoin's sub-$90,000 prints in November-December 2025 still leave it multiples above its 2022-23 lows and above its previous cycle top of roughly $69,000. That makes the “dead” label look more like exhaustion after a huge run than genuine collapse. To understand why crypto wasn't actually dead, it is necessary to zoom out from price. Elliptic's Global Crypto Regulation Review 2025 says governments shifted “away from enforcement-led approaches” toward comprehensive frameworks that prioritize innovation, highlighting moves like the US GENIUS Act stablecoin law and broader global alignment. Yellow's “Crypto Regulation Heatmap” tracks how MiCA in Europe, Hong Kong's licensing regime, the UK's reopening to exchange-traded crypto products, and a friendlier US stance collectively made 2025 the first year in which major markets had actual rulebooks rather than pure uncertainty. The SEC's generic listing standards, issued in September, streamlined the launch of new crypto ETFs across Nasdaq, Cboe, and NYSE Arca, allowing multi-asset products like Grayscale's GLDC to clear more quickly. Crypto ETFs registered billions in net inflows into crypto ETFs globally in 2025, even though late-year performance was poor. Away from trading, payment, and settlement rails, work continued to move forward. Visa and other large processors expanded stablecoin pilots on USDC rails for cross-border settlement, while stablecoins captured a growing slice of cross-border flows, particularly in emerging markets. The tension at the heart of 2025: the year produced more Bitcoin “deaths” on paper, record liquidations, and a sickly fourth quarter tape. However, it also established the first genuinely global regulatory frameworks, turned crypto ETFs and stablecoins into mainstream plumbing, and kept usage metrics well above those of any prior cycle. Crypto died four times in 2025, and each time it came back more embedded in the financial system than before.

Title: These 3 Stocks Make Up 50% of Warren Buffett’s Portfolio

Investing Warren Buffett’s company, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B), recently held large positions in Apple (AAPL), American Express (AXP), and Bank of America (BAC) stock. All three of these stocks check the boxes you would expect to see in Buffett’s investments, including reliable sales growth. Sending You to Google News in 3 © https://www.flickr.com/photos/fortunelivemedia/ As you may be aware, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) is in a state of transition. Warren Buffett is retiring from his role as CEO, which will be taken over by Greg Abel. Thus, a legendary career is coming to a close. Still, you don’t need to dump your Berkshire Hathaway shares just because Buffett is retiring. Berkshire’s current portfolio currently reflects the carefully selected stock picks of Buffett and his associates. Thus, whatever’s in the company’s stock holdings list is worth considering. It may surprise you to learn that 50% of Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio consists of just three stocks. This fact is less shocking, however, when you see the three stocks as they represent top-tier businesses. So, without further ado, let’s reveal the three stocks that dominate Buffett’s portfolio right now. Buffett isn’t known for loading up on Magnificent Seven technology stocks very often. Yet, believe it or not, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock shares comprise 21.1% of Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio weighting. That’s a huge portfolio portion for just one stock, you must admit. All told, Berkshire Hathaway holds around 238.2 million AAPL shares, representing a 1.6% stake in Apple. Buffett usually doesn’t explain why Berkshire Hathaway bought a particular stock. Since he’s known as a value investor, we should be able to find a good value in Apple stock. This may not be immediately evident if we apply an old-school valuation metric, the trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Apple’s P/E ratio is 36.58x, which isn’t outrageously high for a Magnificent Seven company but also isn’t extremely low. Instead of focusing on the company’s P/E ratio, perhaps we should observe that Apple stock doubled over the past five years. Furthermore, Buffett surely knows that Apple is a reliable revenue grower. For example, Apple total net sales grew from $391.035 billion in the quarter ended September 28, 2024, to $416.161 billion in the quarter ended September 27, 2024. During that time frame, Apple recorded increases in iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Services sales. Now, we’re starting to see how Apple stock can be a good value irrespective of Apple’s P/E ratio. At the end of the day, Apple’s value comes from the company’s steady growth and the stock’s consistent price appreciation. Therefore, if you believe in Buffett’s portfolio strategies, you might want to own some AAPL shares. Turning to the financial sector, Berkshire Hathaway holds approximately 151.6 million shares of credit card provider American Express (NYSE:AXP). Consequently, Berkshire owns a huge 22% stake in American Express. Interestingly, AXP stock takes up 18.4% of Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio. Why would Buffett like this stock so much, though? Here’s a fact that might startle you. Whereas Apple stock has doubled over the past five years, American Express stock has actually tripled during that time. It just goes to show that financial sector stocks aren’t boring at all. Additionally, there may be a good value here as American Express’s P/E ratio is fairly reasonable at 25.1x. But again, we need to look beyond the P/E ratio. We can peek into American Express’s third-quarter 2025 results to see if the company is really raking in the revenue. As it turns out American Express’s Q3 2025 total revenue net of interest expense grew 11% year over year to $18.426 billion. Notably, American Express’s net interest income increased by 12%, “primarily reflecting growth in balances and net yield expansion.” Clearly, AXP stock isn’t just a safety play; it’s a growth investment, as well. With that in mind, you’re welcome to mimic Buffett’s portfolio and give American Express stock a try. To round out our list of the three stocks that make up 50% of Berkshire Hathaway’s holdings, we have another financial sector pick, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) stock. Comprising 10.2% of Berkshire’s portfolio, Buffet’s company owns more than 568 million shares of BAC. Berkshire Hathaway controls a 7.8% stake in Bank of America, so there’s no denying that Buffett believes in this famous banking firm. And in case you’re curious, Bank of America has a P/E ratio of 15.11x, which seems reasonable enough. Digging deeper than the P/E ratio, it’s worthwhile to see how Bank of America performed during the third quarter of 2025. The company’s total revenue, net of interest expense, increased from $25.345 billion in the year-earlier quarter to $28.088 billion in Q3 2025. It’s also worth noting that, during this time frame, Bank of America recorded increases in credit card and debit card purchase volumes, as well as in total home equity loan production. All in all, it was a solid quarter for Bank of America. Finally, it should be mentioned that Bank of America stock rallied 84% over the past five years, which is nothing to sneeze at. Hence, investors ought to take a look at BAC stock along with AAPL and AXP as great Buffett-backed buy-and-hold portfolio additions. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

The session was marked by extreme sectoral divergence, with the automobile index surging over 1 per cent on robust December sales data, even as the FMCG sector plunged more than 3 per cent following the imposition of fresh excise duty on cigarettes. The trading day witnessed the narrowest intraday range since September 2025, with the Nifty moving within a mere 84-point band, reflecting subdued participation amid global market holidays and continued foreign institutional investor selling. Market breadth remained neutral with 2,211 stocks advancing against 1,952 declining on the BSE, where 4,335 stocks were actively traded. As many as 144 stocks hit their 52-week highs, while 87 touched their 52-week lows. ITC emerged as the session’s biggest casualty, crashing 9.69 per cent to ₹363.95, wiping out massive investor wealth as cigarette stocks reacted sharply to the new excise duty announcement. Other notable losers included Tata Consumer Products, which declined 1.57 per cent to ₹1,173.30, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories down 1.53 per cent at ₹1,252, Bajaj Finance falling 1.13 per cent to ₹975.60, and ONGC slipping 1.03 per cent to ₹237.90. “The domestic market started the year with a range-bound session and ended slightly higher amid thin trading due to global holidays and continued FII selling,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Investments Limited. “Sectorally, auto stocks gained on strong December sales, while value buying supported IT stocks. However, overall advances were capped as FMCG stocks declined following the newly imposed excise duty on cigarettes.” The automobile sector provided the session’s bright spot, with Bajaj Auto leading the gainers’ pack with a rally of 2.59 per cent to ₹9,585. Shriram Finance advanced 2.39 per cent to ₹1,020, NTPC climbed 1.99 per cent to ₹336.10, Eicher Motors gained 1.98 per cent to ₹283.55, and Wipro rose 1.52 per cent to ₹267.30, reflecting strong investor appetite for quality stocks backed by solid fundamentals. Broader markets outperformed the benchmark indices, with the Nifty Midcap 100 rising 0.44 per cent to 60,750.45, gaining 265.95 points, while the Nifty Smallcap 100 closed marginally lower by 0.05 per cent at 17,704.90. Among sectoral indices, Nifty Bank gained 0.22 per cent to close at 59,711.55, Nifty Financial Services advanced 0.19 per cent to 27,666.80, and Nifty Next 50 jumped 0.45 per cent to 69,675.40. “Today, the benchmark indices witnessed a range-bound trading session,” noted Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research at Kotak Securities. “Among sectors, the Auto Index was the top gainer, rallying 1 per cent, whereas the FMCG index corrected sharply, shedding over 3 per cent.” From a technical perspective, analysts maintained a cautiously optimistic outlook. “The zone of 26,200-26,240 will act as an important hurdle for the index,” said Sudeep Shah, Head of Technical and Derivatives Research at SBI Securities. “Any sustainable move above the 26,240 level will lead to a sharp upside rally in the index up to the 26,400 level in the short term.” Looking ahead, market participants expect volatility to pick up as attention shifts to the upcoming third-quarter earnings season and Union Budget expectations. “In the days ahead, Q3 earnings, budget expectations, and global cues such as the India-US trade deal and potential Fed actions are expected to guide market direction, with earnings growth likely to remain the key driver in 2026,” Nair added.

Title: Crypto ETFs Defy The Pullback With $32 Billion In Fresh Investor Cash

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. According to Farside Investors data, US investors put close to $32 billion into US crypto exchange-traded funds in 2025 even as markets lost steam late in the year. Spot Bitcoin ETFs drew the biggest share, with $21.4 billion in net inflows. That is smaller than the $35 billion that poured into Bitcoin ETFs in 2024. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, IBIT, accounted for most of the activity. Reports show IBIT took in about $24.7 billion. That makes its inflows roughly five times larger than the nearest rival, Fidelity’s FBTC. Market watchers noted IBIT ranked near the top among all ETF flows, placing behind only a few broad index funds and a big treasury bond fund. If IBIT’s number is removed, the wider spot Bitcoin ETF group actually finished the year with about $3 billion in combined outflows. Grayscale’s Bitcoin product lost nearly $4 billion on the year. Bitcoin’s price was lower than at the start of 2025; it began the year around $93,500. Based on reports, interest in Ethereum ETFs was real, but the momentum looks uneven. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust, ETHA, sits at nearly $12.6 billion in inflows. Fidelity’s FETH follows at $2.6 billion, while Grayscale’s Ethereum Mini Trust ETF holds about $1.5 billion. Still, public on-chain data showed little renewed demand for spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs in the last month of the year, suggesting flows may slow into 2026. Ether ETFs benefited from being new and giving investors a regulated way to own ETH, but recent days have seen quieter buying. Spot Ether ETFs, which only became widely tradable after their July 2024 launch, gathered $9.6 billion in their first full year. Spot Solana ETFs, launched in late October, added $765 million through year end. Litecoin and XRP ETFs also began trading in the latter half of the year, giving investors more choices for regulated altcoin exposure. The sums are small compared with Bitcoin and Ether. Solana’s $765 million is an example of early interest that has not yet turned into a large, steady stream of assets. These products are being tested by the market. Industry trackers reported that crypto ETFs listed worldwide experienced $2.95 billion in net outflows in November, and there was about $179 billion invested in crypto ETFs globally at the end of that month. Regulators and exchanges moved faster this year under new SEC leadership that was more open to approvals, which in turn helped institutional adoption in the US.

By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: BlackRock's head of talent has 4 pieces of advice for college students who want to work at the firm

Nigel Williams, the firm's head of talent acquisition, has a few pieces of advice for those hoping to nab one of the coveted acceptance letters. Williams said that college students interested in working at the asset management behemoth should do four things before preparing for an interview: research the firm, have a personal elevator pitch, brainstorm specific examples of success, and reach out to an employee beforehand. With their "elevator pitch," Williams said, applicants should explain what's important to them, where they excel, and how they've overcome difficulties or solved problems. "Why would you be great for the company? Being able to give an example, be specific," Williams said, adding that general statements don't tend to land as well. Researching the firm will help applicants anchor their chosen examples in what BlackRock in particular is looking for. Part of what defines the firm, Williams said, is relationship-building. Many applicants know or reach out to someone who works at BlackRock before the interview to learn about the company culture, he said.

Last year, more than 60,000 people applied for the early-career programs, and BlackRock offered some 1,500 jobs globally for its internship and program analyst positions. Every applicant completes a one-way HireVue interview. For those who do make it further into the application process, Williams said he's always interested in learning about "what makes people tick," whether by having them talk through what they've learned from solving a challenging situation, or asking about what they would have done differently. As BlackRock continues to accelerate its technological prowess, Williams also said that AI has transformed his hiring process. Strong applicants can demonstrate both their fluency with AI tools and prompting, and their interpersonal skills. When it comes to younger talent, Williams said he's not just looking for a certain GPA or major, but also those who are engaged in their school communities. BlackRock has, for example, had a lot of success when hiring student athletes. Of those who do make it into the summer intern program, around 75% receive offers to return as analysts after graduating from college, which may be especially helpful in a brutal job market for young talent.

Title: Nvidia Is About to Deliver a Huge Late Christmas Gift to Investors
URL: https://247wallst.com/investing/2026/01/01/nvidia-is-about-to-deliver-a-huge-late-christmas-gift-to-investors/
Time Published: 2026-01-01T09:44:37Z
Full Content:
Investing Nvidia (NVDA) reportedly received orders exceeding 2 million H200 chips from Chinese tech companies for 2026 delivery. Current inventory stands at only 700,000 units. Nvidia asked Taiwan Semiconductor to ramp up H200 production starting in Q2 2026 to address the shortfall. H200 chips are priced at $27,000 per unit for China-specific variants. Shipments could help recover billions in lost Chinese sales from this year. Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. Although Nvidia‘s (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares jumped 38% over the course of 2025, reflecting strong early-year momentum driven by artificial intelligence (AI) demand, the second half of the year was something of a disappointment: The stock largely traded sideways as questions about slowing growth, supply constraints, competitive pressures, and valuation grew. It was the equivalent to investors waking up Christmas morning and finding Nvidia had given them a lump of coal in their stocking. However, as we prepare to turn the page into 2026, Nvidia may be about to deliver a belated gift to shareholders, one that promises a substantial stock price increase through expanded production and sales. It could be a real present for patient investors, one that brightens the prospects for the year ahead and beyond. According to an exclusive Reuters report, Nvidia has approached its manufacturing partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), to dramatically increase the output of the H200 AI chips in response to surging demand from Chinese technology companies. Sources say that these firms have placed orders exceeding 2 million H200 units for delivery in 2026, but with Nvidia’s current inventory standing at approximately 700,000 chips, it created a significant shortfall that prompted the outreach to Taiwan Semiconductor. The H200 is based on Nvidia’s Hopper architecture and produced using Taiwan Semiconductor’s 4-nanometer process. As the second most powerful chip in its portfolio, one that is vastly superior for training complex models than the dumbed down versions Nvidia made to comply with U.S. export restrictions, it also indicates Chinese companies view it as a better option than other regional or locally produced chips. Nvidia has requested that Taiwan Semiconductor begin fabricating additional chips, with production slated to commence in the second quarter of 2026. While the precise volume of the new order remains undisclosed, this step aims to address the gap between Nvidia’s existing inventory and the incoming orders, giving the chipmaker time to ramp up to meet the demand. With the initial shipments fulfilled from its current stock, the first deliveries could potentially arrive before the Lunar New Year in mid-February 2026. This timeline builds on earlier reports the Trump administration authorized the shipment of H200 sales to China again. Pricing for the China-specific H200 variants has been set at around $27,000 per chip, according to the sources, positioning them as a viable option for Chinese buyers seeking high-performance AI hardware amid limited alternatives. This production ramp-up occurs as Nvidia shifts its attention toward its newer Blackwell series and the forthcoming Rubin chips, which are expected to drive future growth. The emphasis on H200 expansion, however, highlights China’s continued role as a major market, even as trade barriers have previously reduced Nvidia’s presence there. A Nvidia spokesperson stated that the company manages its supply chain on an ongoing basis. They added, “Licensed sales of the H200 to authorised customers in China will have no impact on our ability to supply customers in the United States.” Yet the shipments could strain global AI chip availability, as Nvidia must allocate resources across regions while meeting heightened Chinese demand. Taiwan Semiconductor declined to comment on the matter, and China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology did not respond to Reuters inquiries. Investors shouldn’t get too hopeful just yet. The Reuters report relies on anonymous sources and lacks official confirmation from Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor, or Chinese regulators, and Beijing has not approved any H200 imports. However, if the report proves true, this could help Nvidia regain traction in China, countering the billions of dollars in lost sales it recorded this year, and the $5.5 billion writedown on its chip inventory it took. Renewed chip sales to China could also be the first step in regaining its lost market share, while delivering a late Christmas gift to investors. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

Title: Investors funnel $32B into US crypto ETFs despite year-end pullback

Time Published: 2026-01-01T06:25:53Z

BlackRock further separated itself from competitors in the crypto ETF market in 2025, with its Bitcoin and Ether funds, IBIT and ETHA, accounting for the majority of net inflows. Cointelegraph in your social feed US investors poured over $31.77 billion into US crypto exchange-traded funds in 2025 despite the crypto markets stumbling towards the final months of the year. US spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs took the lion’s share of investor interest, accumulating $21.4 billion in net inflows in 2025, according to Farside Investors data. However, it marks a fall from the $35.2 billion net inflows seen in 2024. Spot Ether (ETH) ETFs saw a fourfold increase in inflows from 2024, attracting $9.6 billion of investor money in the year. Ether ETFs launched in July 2024, meaning 2025 was the first full year the ETFs could be traded. Spot Solana (SOL) ETFs were among the new crypto products to hit the US market in 2025, which have tallied $765 million since launching in late October. Institutional adoption has been supported by a more crypto-friendly administration this year, including new Securities and Exchange Commission leadership, which accelerated approvals for new crypto products. BlackRock strengthened its dominance in the crypto ETF market in 2025, with its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) seeing a staggering $24.7 billion worth in inflows to end the year. IBIT’s flow tally is now five times larger than the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), its nearest competitor. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted in mid-December that IBIT ranked sixth in net inflows among all ETFs, trailing only broad index funds and a treasury bond ETF. “If you can do $25b in [a] bad year imagine the flow potential in [a] good year,” he said, noting Bitcoin’s slight fall from $93,500 at the start of 2025. Removing IBIT from the equation, the nine other spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a combined $3.1 billion in outflows for the year. Most other spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a marginal increase in net inflows, while the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF bled around $3.9 billion. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) continues to dominate the Ethereum ETF market despite failing to record an inflow over the last 12 trading days. ETHA’s inflows currently sit at almost $12.6 billion, while The Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) and Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (ETH) round out the top three at $2.6 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. Glassnode data shows that spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs have shown little to no renewed demand over the past month, suggesting these crypto products may see a slow start in 2026. Litecoin (LTC), Solana and XRP (XRP) ETFs also launched in the back half of the year, giving investors greater access to major altcoins through regulated investment vehicles. Industry analysts expect an explosion in the number of crypto ETPs approved in 2026 under the SEC’s new generic listing standards, which no longer require that each application be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Related: 2026 will be red for Bitcoin, but payment tech will improve: BTC OGs Crypto asset manager Bitwise tipped that more than 100 crypto ETFs would launch in 2026, a prediction Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart agreed with but said many wouldn’t last beyond 2027 due to a lack of demand. “We’re going to see a lot of liquidations in crypto ETP products. Might happen at [the] tail end of 2026 but likely by the end of 2027,” Seyffart said in December.

Title: For platforms, here’s what’s not going to happen in 2026

Time Published: 2026-01-01T05:01:00Z
Full Content:
Register by Jan 13 to save on passes and connect with marketers from Uber, Bose and more TikTok existing in the U.S. beyond the realms of a legal ban, Meta winning its antitrust trial, and Omnicom partnering with X were not quite on Digiday’s bingo card for 2025. Which is to say that trying to predict, especially in the world of tech and platforms, what might actually materialize at any time, let alone next year, is nearly impossible. After all, a lot of what the industry thought might happen in 2025, just didn’t. Which is why Digiday has taken a slightly different approach to 2026. Instead of predicting what might happen, here is what Digiday believes won’t actually happen in next year. However long it takes (12 months and counting), the U.S. deal with China over TikTok cannot live in limbo forever. But in the meantime, marketers are simply getting used to living with its uncertainty. As Brainlabs’ managing director of paid social, Michelle Wiltz put it, the political theater around TikTok isn’t designed for resolution but for leverage. Both governments benefit from keeping the ambiguity alive. “2026 won’t deliver a clean answer about TikTok’s U.S. ownership,” she said. “Instead, it will reinforce a new operating reality: geopolitical ambiguity is a feature, not a bug and smart marketers plan for resilience, not resolution.” Nothing has come close to what Twitter was in terms of a real-time conversational platform. Even as X, its real-time factor is its USP — something no platform has been able to replicate. And while ads are already being tested on Threads, it’s still a long way off from getting the type of attention that warrants it becoming a viable advertising track in its own right, rather than a nice add-on placement in Meta’s Advantage+. As Collective Measures’ group director of performance media, Lauren Beerling noted, Twitter wasn’t just a text-based feed, it was heavily driven by journalists, politicians, breaking news, and cultural urgency. “Threads is intentionally avoiding that energy, meaning it won’t inherit the same commercial value,” she said. “Meta seems far more focused on making Threads a ‘pleasant conversation app’ than a real-time newswire. That will attract users, but not the intent or immediacy that generates big ad revenue.” This year was probably one of Snap’s strongest years yet. By the end of Q3, the company had made $1.51 billion in quarterly revenue. But when compared to that of its peers: Meta, YouTube, TikTok — it’s still a drop in the ocean. Basis Technologies’ client strategy and insights partner, Colleen Fielder made the point that eMarketer estimated Snap will only claim 2.1% of social ad spend in 2025. “Snap’s alternative revenue paths feel limited — the Bitmoji subscription is fairly surface-level and while there’s a lot of buzz around a Perplexity partnership, it’s far too early to treat that as a major revenue engine,” she said. Plus Australia’s ban on users under 16 and an ongoing lawsuit with the city of New York — both complicate growth and advertiser confidence. A dramatic profitability jump next year seems unlikely.” Throughout 2025, there’s been an underlying narrative: AI equals efficiency, so headcount should decrease. Except the latest industry layoffs proved that they weren’t necessarily designed to cut costs on headcount, but to open up additional revenue for AI spending. “Companies will continue to use AI to reduce labor costs — especially at the top, where efficiency narratives sell well to boards and CFOs,” said Brainlabs’ managing partner of retail, Dan Connor. “What will slow is the belief that high spending itself equals progress. Companies will stop equating massive AI budgets with innovation; 2026 is the shift from exuberance to efficiency.” Everything we’ve seen so far points to one thing only: it’s no longer IF OpenAI builds an ad business, it’s when. That’s been indirectly confirmed by CEO Sam Altman himself, head of applications Fidji Simo, the latest hires of chief revenue officer Denise Dresser and Christina MacDonald — lead counsel for ads in ChatGPT. Platforms don’t make moves without intention. “Even with the recent ‘Code Red’ which caused OpenAI to pause the ads rollout to focus on product quality, the groundwork is clearly being laid,” said Robert Kurtz, strategic business outcomes partner at Basis Technologies. “2026 feels like the year they start testing ads in earnest.” Back in April, Judge Brinkema sided with the DOJ that Google held illegal monopolies. By September, the closing stage of Google’s ad tech antitrust trial saw the DOJ target the platform’s ad tech stack — AdX. While it’s not asking for a total divestiture, pulling the exchange apart would weaken its ad server. Google’s remedies argued that the DOJ’s proposals are excessive, and offered alternative solutions — it simply wouldn’t take the result lying down. Still, that’s not to say the judge will agree, and the ultimate outcome isn’t expected until next year. Retail media exploded in 2025, creating a more complex environment for everyone. And it looks set to continue next year. “I expect continued fragmentation in 2026 with a few players growing faster, but not true consolidation yet,” said Haley Feazell, vp of global media at Mindgruve. “Real shakeouts are likely later, once growth slows, and operating costs rise — similar to the timeline we’ve seen with CTV, is my expectation.” Similarly, Basis Technologies’ evp, integrated client solutions, Amy Rumpler added that consolidation certainly won’t occur in some of the larger networks that have more advanced capabilities, and ad revenues, already realized (think CVS and Kroger). “The benefits to them owning and operating their own independent networks, where they profit off of O&O inventory and audience data, is too far along to entertain consolidation with another entity,” she said. “Unless the deal was massive (like Amazon buys all of Kroger and consolidates it with their Whole Foods brands), I don’t see it happening.” Potential investors spent 2025 at least considering the idea of buying Perplexity. Apple execs reportedly held internal talks about acquiring the AI company, as did Meta — though the latter decided to invest in ScaleAI instead. Still, what it does mean is Perplexity has spent much of the year in the shop window, while its attempts to scale its ad business barely got off the ground. But by partnering with major companies throughout 2025, such as Snap, PayPal, Pitchbook and Getty, improving its publisher monetization efforts, and releasing its browser, Comet, Perplexity has strengthened its product reach and increased revenue flow, which ultimately make Perplexity more attractive to investors or acquirers considering making an offer — and likely will next year. No one can deny that Amazon is a competitor to The Trade Desk, but it still isn’t a rival. And that’s because The Trade Desk is the DSP to the open web. It’s big enough that it hasn’t had to lower fees, and has focused on being a good partner to its agency clients. And while Amazon will continue to try and claw away at advertisers’ TTD budget (we’ve already seen from reports of Amazon offering like-for-like tests, funded by Amazon) as part of its wider aim for its DSP to become the backbone for the open web. YouTube showed its renewed confidence in live streaming with its latest product updates during its Made on YouTube event this year. And with the worries about AI overtaking creators and content, live actually bypasses those concerns. “Live is the most human format we have: messy, unedited, impossible for AI to fake convincingly (at least for now),” said Natalie Silverstein, chief innovation officer at Collectively. But more importantly, YouTube, for the most part, introduces features and tools with a long-term goal in mind. “I think it will work because everything they touch turns to gold,” said Shamsul Chowdhury, former Jellyfish exec and paid social media expert. “Live video has that rawness to it, almost like that added authenticity. And if they can have some brand safety measures, advertisers will play.” Between generative AI pilot projects and emerging agency hold co models, 2026 will be the year that signals turn into strategy.

Title: Beyond AI: 5 tech trends that will force you to pay more and rethink what’s ‘real’

When a friend and I recently got into a heated debate about artificial intelligence and its impact, I didn’t take sides. Instead, I countered his arguments with facts, even as he grew emotional and claimed that AI was the greatest enemy of humans. At the beginning of last year, I had already predicted that AI would be everywhere, and I was right. As a tech journalist, it comes naturally to me to observe key trends, anticipate the future, and form opinions. That said, it’s not my job to sell you something; influencers and YouTubers are already doing that very well. However, if AI defined 2025, this year is likely to be more decisive and unexpected, as artificial intelligence moves beyond chatbots and smartphones to create entirely new product categories — ones that had been teased for years but never truly materialised from a consumer perspective. But 2026 isn’t going to be about a single trend. It will be shaped by a mix of ideas, some of which may or may not work, but would stay and could shape the personal technology market and social media. I was scrolling through Instagram the other day when my eyes landed on a video featuring two babies engaging in playful banter (precisely the kind of content that gets maximum views in India) portrayed as a girlfriend and boyfriend. I must have watched a few of those short videos before realising they were generated by artificial intelligence, and only after paying close attention did I notice subtle changes that were barely visible without a side-by-side comparison. Since then, AI-generated videos have taken over my feed, especially clips of cartoony cats dancing to songs from Dhurandhar. I remember I joined Instagram (not officially, but through an invisible account) to watch videos of lion cubs, and now there are AI-generated versions of those videos as well, mostly funny and harmless. With platforms themselves encouraging AI videos, and tools like OpenAI’s Sora capable of generating videos of virtually anything in just a few minutes, millions of users will inevitably be fooled into thinking AI-generated videos are real. In India, hardly any such videos carry warning labels, making them almost indistinguishable from reality. That could pose a real problem, blurring the lines of what people can trust. This raises a serious question: it won’t be about whether you can tell the difference between what is real and what is not, but whether AI-generated videos change our relationships with other humans and affect how we perceive the world around us. The year has just begun, and I am already receiving feelers from my sources about an increase in smartphone and laptop prices, and it won’t be short-lived. The trend could continue for almost the entire year. For average buyers, phones already cost a month’s salary, and although many Indians purchase them on EMIs, ownership still comes at a hefty cost. Given the current shortage of memory chips, higher memory costs are likely to be passed on to consumers, which, in turn, will drive up the average selling prices of smartphones. This is primarily due to a shortage of memory chips, particularly dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), which is used in AI data centres and is also critical for smartphones. Lately, DRAM prices have surged as demand has outstripped supply, pushing up component costs. The biggest memory chip suppliers are prioritising data centre and AI companies that are flush with cash, and this shortage is expected to last until at least 2027. I am told that most smartphones launching early this year will be more expensive, though companies are likely to sweeten deals with tempting cashback offers and EMIs. I have also heard that smartphone prices, especially in the low- to mid-range segment, will rise once companies exhaust their existing stock. It is also possible for smartphone brands to launch phones with stripped-down RAM. Laptops, particularly gaming-focused models that are memory-hungry, may also see higher price tags. Enough of apps and the debate over whether to add a telephoto lens to a smartphone or how thin a phone can be. For 2026 and beyond, tech companies are pumped up to find ways to sell smart glasses for your face. While mixed-reality headsets never really took off and augmented reality glasses are still years away from becoming mainstream, in the immediate future (especially throughout this year) I foresee tech companies going all in on smart glasses, offering different capabilities such as small heads-up displays, AI features, built-in cameras, audio-only, and both tethered and wireless designs across varied price points, from mainstream and affordable to luxury. Meta has already proved that there is a market, even if still a tiny one, for smart glasses with its Ray-Ban and Oakley models. Others will follow suit and launch new smart glasses, ideally designed to be worn all day, every day. Just don’t expect smart glasses to replace your smartphone yet. However, tech companies are already plotting strategies to sell basic smart glasses that work as companions, much like your earbuds, smartwatch, or smart ring, and eventually reach a stage where they become as capable as a smartphone. Right now, whether you agree or not, smart glasses are exactly where feature phones once were, and it may take a long time before they become as advanced as modern smartphones. I may sound a bit futuristic, but this time I will take the side of Elon Musk. As the billionaire CEO has been saying for years, he envisions a world filled with humanoid robots. While that may not happen anytime soon, as mainstream adoption is still years away, there is growing interest among Silicon Valley companies and European startups in seriously considering humanoids as the next big thing. This also ties into how China has made humanoid robots a strategic priority in its tech battle with the US, though that’s a discussion for another day. For now, early investments in humanoids are likely to begin with experiments aimed at bringing home robots to consumers. Think of what Amazon did with Astro (a screen on wheels powered by the company’s Alexa voice software) a few years ago. The idea is to build robots with advanced cameras and computer vision software that can navigate homes much like self-driving cars. We will likely start hearing from the world’s biggest tech companies and consumer appliance makers about how they plan to bring AI-infused home robots as early as CES 2026, which takes place in Las Vegas in early January. Evidently, Apple is also interested in personal robotics, and is rumoured to be working on a tabletop AI companion described as an iPad on a movable robotic arm. It’s one space I am personally excited about, after seeing a humanoid robot in Shenzhen, China, last year. Let’s get it straight: foldables are an interesting product category, but I hardly see them as being very different from current smartphones. This may not sit well with many consumers, especially those who have invested in expensive foldables — I myself use a Pixel 10 Pro Fold and a Galaxy Z Fold 7. The main problem with foldables is the software, which, needless to say, holds them back and raises questions about whether the high price is justified. It’s definitely not the chunky, heavy build, an issue Samsung has largely solved or the price point, which Motorola has addressed more aggressively in recent years. Yes, the screen crease issue persists, and I hope it, too, gets resolved with the upcoming foldables. Personally, the user interface on foldables still underwhelms. I am pinning my hopes on Apple, which could finally solve the UI problem and improve how apps behave on a larger screen when it launches its first foldable this year – assuming the rumours turn out to be true. One way to address the software issue on a foldable iPhone would be to borrow elements from both iOS and iPadOS. It would be great to see desktop-grade apps that aren’t available on the iPhone, proper full-window multitasking, and optimal external display support on the iPhone Fold. That would be a dream iPhone for me, and I would be ready to leave my iPhone Air for it.

Saks Global is preparing shortly to file for bankruptcy after missing a debt payment related to its Neiman Marcus acquisition, according to the Wall Street Journal. The Journal noted that the high-end department store Saks Fifth Avenue did not make an interest payment of over $100 million on its bonds and is talking to creditors to secure financing for the bankruptcy process. Rising inflation and a weakening labor market have slowed discretionary spending for many consumers, including on luxury items. Saks Global has had many rounds of layoffs this year. The company aims to sell a minority stake in luxury retailer Bergdorf Goodman to reduce its debt, a Saks Global spokesperson said in September to Reuters. It also aimed to raise cash through the sale of a Beverly Hills property. In August, the company restructured debt, which included $600 million in new money, and exchanged $2.2 billion in senior secured notes. The combination of Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, and other luxury retail and real estate companies aims to make it easier to compete with other department stores such as Nordstrom, Bloomingdale’s, and Macy’s. The deal was funded by new investors, including Amazon, Authentic Brands Group, Salesforce, and others, with $2.2 billion in senior secured notes as well as an asset-based credit facility.

Title: Trump and the end of American hegemony

New York: It has become almost routine to end each year with talk of the “polycrisis,” and to acknowledge the difficulty of anticipating a future that seems pregnant with the risk of new wars, pandemics, financial crises, and climate-driven devastation. Yet 2025 added a uniquely toxic ingredient to this mix: the return to the White House of Donald Trump, whose erratic, unlawful policies have already upended the postwar era of globalization. Faced with so much chaos and uncertainty, can we say anything with confidence about where the US and global economies are heading? One thing we can say is that the US economy is not doing as well as Trump, ever the con man, would have us believe. Job creation is almost at a standstill, which is no surprise, given that Trump has been sowing uncertainty and weakening the economy in unprecedented ways. On the supply side, his most pernicious policy has been the frontal attack on immigrant workers (and American workers with darker complexions more broadly). The administration’s mass deportations—carried out by masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents snatching people off the streets—have killed off the most important source of additional labor supply at a time when the domestic labor force is declining. This matters for everyone, because not only do Americans depend on immigrants in industries ranging from agriculture and construction to hospitality and care work, but these immigrants are also a source of demand. Yet now, many Americans of color, even US citizens, are afraid to leave their homes, lest they be abducted and brutalized by ICE. The negative effects of Trump’s indiscriminate cuts to government have also spread throughout the economy. There are multiplier effects to government contractions, just as there are to expansions, and in the current context, the costs have been amplified by the erratic nature of the process. The administration’s incompetent, blunderbuss approach has sown even deeper uncertainty and induced precautionary behavior on the part of businesses and consumers. Trump’s tariffs—whether levied or threatened—and other on-again, off-again policies should be recognized for what they are: a major supply-side shock to the economy. They have pointlessly added uncertainty to the costs of production and to the prices consumers pay when they shop, making it impossible for businesses to engage in any serious long-term planning. And these are just short-term effects. The US economy’s long-term prospects look even bleaker, all thanks to Trump. After all, America’s comparative advantage has always rested on technology and unfettered higher education. By attacking research and trying to starve universities of federal funds unless they kowtow to his demands, Trump is shooting America’s economy in the foot. As numerous Nobel laureates in economics have emphasized, the “wealth of nations” lies in institutions, not least the rule of law. But Trump is trampling on the rule of law and replacing it with an extortionary regime of deal-making (and self-dealing), where government favors (like export licenses for Nvidia or subsidies for Intel) are granted in exchange for stakes in the company’s future profits. Of course, over time, Trump’s targets for extortion will dwindle. Having recognized the danger of relying on the United States, many countries are already pursuing new trade arrangements. Why, then, is GDP still growing (though not as robustly as it did under President Joe Biden), with the stock market reaching new highs and inflation remaining below the levels critics had warned about? There are multiple explanations for this apparent strength. With respect to the stock market, the boom is actually very narrow, confined largely to a handful of tech giants: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. And yet, these companies’ valuations reflect expectations of long-term monopoly profits that may never materialize. (This is especially true for Tesla, owing to Elon Musk’s embrace of Trump, which has alienated many consumers.) I am among the many commentators who see today’s valuations as the product of a bubble, one that has been sustaining not only the stock market but the entire economy. The massive capital expenditures on AI have been offsetting the weakness in the rest of the economy. But like all such bubbles, this one will eventually burst. Precisely when is anyone’s guess; but with so much of the economy riding on one sector, the collapse will inevitably be felt widely. Worse, if AI succeeds in the way its advocates anticipate, it would be a harbinger of other serious problems, because then the technology would likely displace many workers and cause even greater inequality. Add the downsizing of government demanded by Silicon Valley’s ersatz tech-libertarians, and one can only wonder what would sustain the US economy in the years ahead. As for inflation, there is a simple explanation for why it has not risen sharply yet. For starters, Trump’s tariffs generally have not been as high as he originally threatened (though the 50% punitive tariff imposed on India, a country the US had treated as a friend before Trump’s return, is shockingly brutal). Moreover, the effects of tariffs are often felt with long lags. Many firms refrained from raising prices until they saw what their competitors would do, and some won’t raise prices until the inventories of the goods they purchased before the tariffs are exhausted. But if Trump’s threatened tariffs against China were ever actually imposed, that would be a different matter. In fact, the unraveling of supply chains could unleash price increases greater than the tariffs themselves. That brings me to the critical question: What country would willingly subject itself to the whims of a mad king? It is not as if the US has a stranglehold on the supply of critical minerals or rare earths, without which the modern industrial age crumbles. It is not as if there aren’t markets elsewhere. The law of supply and demand works just as well without the US as with it. As Adam Smith and David Ricardo taught us, economic growth is about leveraging comparative advantages and economies of scale. But as Trump (and Russian President Vladimir Putin) has taught us, relying on unreliable trade partners can be enormously disadvantageous. Besides, the US is not as important as it used to be. It now accounts for under 10% of global exports. While some firms’ profits will suffer in a post-American global economy, others will benefit. While some workers will have to find alternative employment, others will find new demand for their skills. To be sure, the short run will not be easy. But in the new global economy that emerges over the longer term, America will have lost its hegemony. That is where we are heading as we head into the second year of living at the mercy of an unhinged president’s whims. The transition has already begun, and though global growth will suffer, the pain may be less than many fear. In Europe, for example, investments in rearmament—another byproduct of Trump’s self-destructive policies—will provide a major boost. Perhaps the defining moment will come with the 2026 US midterm elections in November. Elections that are not as free and fair as one would expect for a genuine democracy (as many fear) would mark a grim turning point. But if the growing dissatisfaction with Trump’s economic management and the country’s slide toward authoritarianism results in the Democrats recapturing at least one house of Congress, that will be a turning point in the other direction. Either way, the US and the world would still face at least another two years of economic incompetence and uncertainty. Joseph E.

Title: China pushes robot access mainstream with Qingtianzhu’s 1 RMB ‘flash rental’ service

UPDATED 19:29 EST / DECEMBER 31 2025 by Duncan Riley Though 2025 may be remembered for the artificial intelligence boom, not far behind has been the emergence of advanced humanoid robotics. And while the U.S. and the West more broadly have somewhat lagged in robotics, China enters the new year arguably well ahead in the robotics game. According to a report Tuesday from Chia-focused tech site Pandaily on New Year’s Eve, Chinese company Qingtianzhu (Shanghai) Technology Co. Ltd. has launched a “1 RMB robot rental” service across 10 major cities, marking one of the most aggressive attempts yet to normalize on-demand access to humanoid robots. 1 RMB is 14 cents in U.S. dollars. The initiative allows users to reserve humanoid robots for short-term use via QR code, with centralized scheduling designed to support deployment across multiple scenarios. The service is currently available in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Hangzhou, Zhengzhou, Chengdu, Suzhou, Xiamen and Chongqing. It’s positioned as a way to lower barriers to experimenting with humanoid robots in commercial and public settings. Sina Finance reported Tuesday that the 1 RMB price is a promotional entry point that is intended to attract first-time users and accelerate adoption rather than reflect the full commercial cost of robot deployment. Qingtianzhu describes the offering as a “flash rental” model with rapid booking, standardized service workflows and dedicated on-site personnel to ensure stable operation during events. The move is described by Chinese media as part of a broader effort to build a national robot leasing ecosystem. Qingtianzhu’s platform is acting as a kind of “robot Didi,” designed to match demand from businesses, exhibitions, conferences and brand activations with available robot inventory across cities. Didi is mainland China’s most popular ride-hailing service provider and is often described as the Uber of China. The long-term goal is reportedly to scale robot leasing in a way that mirrors ride-hailing and equipment-sharing platforms rather than traditional industrial procurement. The real significance of the initiative lies in distribution and utilization, not margins. The idea is that by encouraging frequent, short-term rentals, Qingtianzhu can gather operational data, refine deployment workflows and expose more customers to humanoid robots in real-world environments. The 1 RMB price could also be described as a loss leader to introduce people to the benefits of renting robots and over time, drive demand for higher-value rentals, long-term leases, or customized robotic services. Meanwhile, in the U.S., the idea of robot rental services is still a pipe dream, though some companies are getting closer with their robotic endeavors. Tesla Inc. debuted its Optimus robots in October 2024 to much fanfare, but not much has been heard of the offering since. With China surging ahead in robotics, companies in the West have a lot of catching up to do, but as AI continues to improve and hence the ability to control robots, 2026 should see more movement in the market. The dream that one day there will be a robot in every house isn’t that far off, albeit one far closer to reality in the Middle Kingdom than in middle America.
