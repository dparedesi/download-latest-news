Title: 'We live in a terrarium': Larry Fink on why today's leaders should be 'more guarded'

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has some words of wisdom for leaders navigating the age of populism and social media: Watch what you say. "You have to be a lot more guarded," Fink said on Thursday. "I can't say everything I really want to say to all of you right now," he joked to the audience attending Forbes's Iconoclast Summit. "The reality is you have to be a lot more systematic in what you say and how you say it internally or externally," he said, adding, "I mean, we live in a terrarium today. We live in a glass bottle." The billionaire cofounder of the world's largest asset manager is no stranger to backlash over the firm's business decisions. Fink's embrace of "ESG" investing, for example, has been derided by Republicans as "woke capitalism," while drawing criticism from climate groups for not going far enough. The state of Texas only recently removed the asset manager from its investment blacklist, allowing the state to reinvest with the firm, after BlackRock withdrew from climate-focused initiatives like the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative. "You have to lead differently," in this era, Frink said. "You have to be a lot more thoughtful in every word you say." He said this holds true when it comes to internal messaging as well. "If you can't get your messaging properly with your employee base, and we have 23,000 employees at BlackRock globally, how are you going to get those messages across to all your clients?" Fink said. Fink told the audience gathered at the Cipriani's restaurant in downtown Manhattan that leaders also need to be led. He gave the example of a trip to the firm's European officers following President Trump's "Liberation Day" trade tariffs were unveiled. "The Europeans were quite frightened," Fink said. They were frightened about the potential for dramatic changes to US policy and the implications this could have on the culture and direction of their US-based employer. "Is BlackRock changing too?" Fink recalled them saying, before he reassured them that it would not. "It was just a wake-up call," Fink said. "Even for me, and I think I'm pretty well experienced in this stuff. Again, when there's great moments of uncertainty, even your top leaders need to be led." Where Big Tech secrets go public — unfiltered in your inbox weekly.

Title: Circle Soars In First-Ever Stablecoin IPO, Making CEO A Billionaire

ByNina Bambysheva ByNina Bambysheva, Forbes Staff. Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, at the Token2049 conference in Singapore in Sept. 2024. Photographer: Suhaimi Abdullah/Bloomberg Circle, the company behind the $61 billion stablecoin USDC, made a roaring debut on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday, becoming the first stablecoin issuer to go public and making CEO and cofounder Jeremy Allaire a billionaire. Shares surged as much as 235% after Circle and some of its shareholders raised nearly $1.1 billion in an initial public offering that was upsized twice amid heavy investor demand. The stock opened at $69, more than double its IPO price of $31, and climbed as high as $103.75. The offering included 34 million shares from Circle and other shareholders including Allaire, up from the 32 million shares announced earlier this week and 24 million initially. The IPO was priced well above its initial $24–$26 range and even its revised $27–$28. Based on Circle’s 2 P.M. stock price of $86, Forbes figures Allaire has a net worth of at least $1.7 billion. A representative for Circle has not yet responded to a request for comment about Allaire's net worth. BlackRock, already an investor, and Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management, were among the reported buyers. The deal was led by JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, alongside 12 other underwriters. “We’re thrilled with the demand,” Circle CFO Jeremy Fox-Geen told Forbes. “We saw a wide range of investor interest from traditional mutual fund complexes through to high-conviction, long-oriented pools of private capital within the broader hedge fund space, as well as various sovereign wealth funds. I think it says that the investor community is understanding that we are on the precipice of what we here call the new internet financial system.” Circle’s listing arguably marks crypto’s most significant public market event since Coinbase’s 2021 IPO. The New York-based firm is a pure-play stablecoin business: USDC is the world’s second-largest stablecoin, making up 27% of the market behind Tether’s 67%. While originally used for crypto trading, stablecoins are increasingly drawing attention from financial giants and tech firms—among them Fidelity Investments, Bank of America and Meta—as rails for payments and cross-border transactions. Since launching USDC in 2018, Circle has processed over $25 trillion in transaction volume, nearly $6 trillion of which occurred in just the first quarter of 2025. The company has long positioned itself as the regulated, transparent alternative to Tether, publishing detailed audited reserve disclosures. In 2024, Circle reported $1.68 billion in revenue and $156 million in net income, up from $1.45 billion in revenue and $268 million in profit the year prior. But its business remains highly concentrated: More than 99% of revenue came from interest income on the cash and Treasurys backing USDC. In its S-1 filing, Circle warned that a 1% drop in interest rates could wipe out $441 million of that revenue. Fox-Geen says diversification is underway: “We have a set of product investments which we have started monetizing recently, which range from subscription and services revenues, such as our blockchain network partnerships, through to transaction revenues, where we monetize certain of the flows across the network where users of the network wish to use a value added service which they're willing to pay for.” Those initiatives generated $20.7 million in Q1. Modest for now, but growing quickly, he noted. The company’s distribution model, however, remains costly. In 2024, Circle paid over $1 billion in distribution fees—$900 million of it to Coinbase. Tether, by contrast, doesn’t pay distributors to maintain dominance. The road to public markets was not a straight one. Circle scrapped a $9 billion SPAC merger in late 2022. In 2023, the company was hit by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, where it had deposited a portion of its reserves. Though Circle ultimately recovered the funds, USDC’s market capitalization took months to rebound. In April, Circle reportedly fielded acquisition offers from both Coinbase and Ripple valuing the company at around $5 billion. It opted instead to go public, filing confidentially for an IPO early this year. It’s likely a bet that regulatory clarity will finally be arriving, and with it, a premium for compliance. “Becoming public has always been part of our strategy,” said Fox-Geen. “This is a multi decade transformation of the plumbing of the financial services industry, but that understates just how profound a technology upgrade this really is.”

Title: Why Microsoft has created its own print magazine

Signal is Microsoft’s response to a world of noise and ephemeral content. Signal is Microsoft’s response to a world of noise and ephemeral content. by Tom Warren Of all the many ways Microsoft could mark its 50th anniversary, I wasn’t expecting the software maker to launch a magazine. “It’s our answer to a timely question: How do we earn trust and hold attention in an age of scroll and skim? How do we create Signal in a world of noise?” asks Frank Shaw, Microsoft’s chief communications officer. Microsoft’s response to a world of people doomscrolling on X and TikTok is a print magazine that you can thumb through in peace and quiet. The first issue of Signal is 120 pages with a focus on AI, both as a topic and, to a small degree, a means of production. Microsoft hopes the magazine will bypass the digital world and reach business leaders directly every few months. “People are overloaded with information, and a lot of the information is pretty ephemeral,” says Steve Clayton, the executive editor of Signal, in an interview for Notepad. “[Signal is] partly a reaction to that, which is: how do we create something that’s more thoughtful and has some more permanence, and is a bit longer-lasting than a five-second TikTok video?” Signal looks like any high-quality magazine you’d find at a newsstand, complete with deep dives on Microsoft technologies, interviews with Microsoft executives, and some lighthearted quiz and trivia sections to round off the magazine format. It’s a magazine from Microsoft’s comms team, so don’t expect to read anything about Amazon or Google in here, or material that strays beyond a clean and tidy image of Microsoft. Instead, you’ve got guest appearances from CEO Satya Nadella and co-founder Bill Gates in the premiere issue I’ve read. The deeper stories on Microsoft will look very familiar to anyone who has read Microsoft’s Source work, where the company writes its own stories about how its technology is being used throughout the world. These digital stories are a good reminder of how influential Microsoft is, but they’re not yarns that the company can easily pitch to journalists like me because they’re simply too self-promotional. Signal feels like a physical manifestation of Microsoft’s strategy with its Source stories. “Microsoft Source and Microsoft stories has been our opportunity to go direct,” says Clayton. Microsoft has printed 1,500 copies of Signal that it’s distributing at its own business-focused events. “Fifteen hundred is a good place to start, and the uptake has been really good. There’s been a lot of demand for it,” says Clayton. “If we get through those and see more demand that we can’t fulfill, then we’ll go and do another print run.” The publication schedule is still in flux as Microsoft gauges interest. “We’re starting to think about what the next few editions will be, and based on the reaction to this one, that will determine the size of the next print run,” says Clayton. Microsoft didn’t want to print 15,000 and have them sitting on shelves at its events, so it’s treading carefully for now with plans to publish every quarter or so. A big inspiration for Signal was the Costco magazine that’s distributed to millions of members every month, a reach that makes it one of the largest magazines in the country and a steady way for the retailer to reach its customers. “The facility, the team, and production that they’d set up, we have a lot of that capability already, so it was an opportunity for us to turn our attention to a new thing,” says Clayton. Costco mails out more than 15 million copies of its magazine with each issue, but Microsoft isn’t expecting to scale Signal to those heights yet. “I don’t think we’re going to go and compete with Costco’s magazine anytime soon, put it that way,” says Clayton. Signal, as you might expect, is very focused on how Microsoft’s technology is being used by businesses. That means it’s also very much focused on AI. I counted mentions on more than 50 of its 120 pages. There’s a story about a women’s soccer team in Spain that was recently promoted and grappled with the use of AI, a deep dive into how Vodafone is deploying AI, and another piece on how Microsoft’s research labs are using AI for science. There are also parts of Signal that look more clearly like promotional material for companies using Microsoft technology, or the types of customer stories that wouldn’t interest readers of The Verge. But there are also interesting, meatier stories. The Vodafone piece might sound like pure marketing, but I could see how it might be useful as a less technical guide for other CTOs thinking about rolling out AI. Microsoft’s Copilot AI assistant helped build small parts of the first issue of Signal, but it’s unclear how deep that’ll go in story creation in future issues. “We certainly didn’t go in intentionally and say that we’re going to have an AI-generated story,” says Clayton. “At the back of the magazine there’s a small quiz that’s generated by Copilot, so you could argue that piece is generated by AI.” Clayton also says he used the deep research functionality of Copilot to help develop Microsoft’s periodic table. “I definitely see us using AI to help us do some of the research and production, and I think we’re open to what we can do with AI in the magazine, but it’s not something that’s front and center,” he says. Microsoft has been working with the Slow Journalism Company in the UK to help produce Signal. “I’ve long been a fan of their work and they were a big help in writing some of the pieces as well, and we’ll continue to work with them,” says Clayton. “They have great writing and editorial talent, and also they just know how to produce a magazine.” Learning how to create a magazine has been a big part of Microsoft’s experiment with Signal. A magazine has to have lighter pieces of content, and it all needs to be arranged in a compelling way to keep readers engaged. There’s a fine art to keep people turning a page in a magazine that’s different from getting someone to click on an online piece. I’ve enjoyed reading Signal, especially the soccer piece and the 50-year anniversary stories. Like any magazine there are parts I could happily skip over, but the design, attention to detail, and stories here are surprising for Microsoft’s first issue. I’m very curious to see whether a trend back to print emerges across other tech companies, and how many hands Signal actually ends up in. I’m always keen to hear from readers, so please drop a comment here, or you can reach me at notepad@theverge.com if you want to discuss anything else. If you’ve heard about any of Microsoft’s secret projects, you can reach me via email at notepad@theverge.com or speak to me confidentially on the Signal messaging app, where I’m tomwarren.01.

Title: Circle Shares Opens at $69 on NYSE Debut, Signaling Strong Appetite for Stablecoin Issuers

Shares of Circle (CRCL) began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on Thursday, opening at $69 a share in early trading. The stock at one point surged to as much as $100, more than 200% above the $31 price it had set the night before. The company announced late Wednesday that it sold roughly 34 million shares in its initial public offering, raising $1.1 billion and landing a valuation of $6.9 billion. The listing marks Circle’s long-awaited arrival on public markets after previous attempts, including a failed SPAC deal in 2021. Cathie Wood's Ark Investment Management expressed interest in buying as much as $150 million worth of the circle shares, with BlackRock also intending to buy 10% of the shares, according to SEC filings and Bloomberg. The IPO draws comparisons to crypto exchange Coinbase's (COIN) 2021 IPO on Nasdaq, which saw a volatile session with shares trading as high as $430 before tumbling to $200 one month later. Elsewhere, crypto-linked stocks, including Coinbase and Strategy (MSTR), along with bitcoin BTC$104,613.63, were trading lower on Thursday. Circle's shares seem to have stabilized around $80 to $83 per share. Circle's debut lands in a market still wrestling with an uncertain macroeconomic environment. Earnings season is winding down, and more companies have flagged weak outlooks for the next quarter than strong ones, suggesting that U.S. stocks could face added pressure in the months ahead. However, Circle’s core business — issuing the dollar-pegged USDC token — is benefiting from a different trend. Demand for stablecoins has grown in 2025, partly due to progress on U.S. regulation. Policymakers have signaled they’re moving closer to establishing clearer rules, which could help legitimize and expand the use of stablecoins in mainstream finance. Deutsche Bank predicted in a report last month that stablecoins are on the verge of going mainstream. The bank cited their growing role in digital payments, cross-border settlement and treasury management while also reinforcing the U.S. dollar's dominance globally. Circle’s IPO may be early evidence of that shift — an investor bet not just on a crypto company, but on stablecoins becoming essential financial infrastructure.

At first glance, throwing Web3 and AI into a headline might seem like a bad example of buzzword soup, the practice of media companies trying to game the algorithms (and your attention) by using a bunch of the most-searched words of the day. But CoinDesk has been following the slow integration of applications that track vast amounts of data on a public blockchain and the artificial intelligence capable of making sense of that data for a decade. In the first-ever CoinDesk Top Women in Web3 & AI list, we consulted with a panel of women judges: Julia Bonafede, Co-Founder of investment management firm, Rosetta Analytics; Olivia Bolec, Google’s Enterprise Global Account Director; Sarah Idahosa, Founder of Women in Defi; Saruul Krause-Jentsch, Head of Podcast at Spotify for Central Europe; and Amélie M., Founder and President of the French branch of the Association of Women in Crypto. This list was brought to life through a collaboration between CoinDesk and Proof of Talk, hosted by XVentures. To help ensure the list selection process was as unbiased as possible we sought out multiple, diverse perspectives. An initial public outreach on social media platforms and to our deeply sourced expert analysts, resulted in more than 300 nominations from every geographic region. After removing the name and contact information from each nomination, CoinDesk’s editorial board narrowed the candidates to 100 semifinalists. A panel of five judges then reviewed the resulting list of semifinalists, looking for the rare combination of innovation, relevancy and influence. Each judge closely reviewed 20 candidates, providing crucial feedback for the final selection process. Rather than focusing exclusively on technical innovation, the list recognizes that the development of emerging technologies involves multiple types of expertise—from product development and business strategy to regulatory compliance and ethical frameworks. As both Web3 and AI move from experimental phases toward broader adoption, these diverse perspectives become increasingly important. For a fuller explanation of the methodology, please see here. Amodei is an architect of responsible AI development, having co-founded Anthropic in 2021 after her principled departure from OpenAI over safety concerns. Under her leadership, the company has achieved a remarkable $61.5 billion valuation through pioneering "Constitutional AI" methodologies and securing major partnerships with Amazon ($8 billion) and the U.K. government. Amodei's commitment to "igniting a race to the top on safety" positions her as the defining voice in an industry grappling with the balance between innovation and responsibility.

The Mexico-born banking prodigy who became a certified teller at 15 following the 1994 Tequila Crisis has channeled her firsthand experience with financial instability into championing blockchain's potential for economic equality. Her 15-year journey from Citigroup through major BNPL platforms to Hedera's CFO role demonstrates a rare ability to bridge traditional finance with Web3 innovation, particularly in advancing Central Bank Digital Currencies and microfinance solutions. Botaitis embodies Web3's disruptive promise with her audacious vision of creating decentralized systems so efficient that her own CFO role would become obsolete, while Hedera's low-fee network serves financial inclusion initiatives across Africa and beyond. The former French regulator who contributed to the crypto framework that "very largely inspired" the European MiCA Regulation has become an influential voice in institutional digital assets. Cabossioras successfully organized a 600-attendee blockchain conference at the French Ministry of Economy, securing pro-blockchain commitments from government officials and demonstrating her ability to build bridges between regulators and innovators. Societe Generale-Forge, the bank’s digital assets arm, recently signed a deal with BCB Markets to distribute its euro-linked stablecoin EURCV. The Harvard-educated former Binance marketing executive has transformed Trust Wallet into the world's leading self-custody platform, scaling from 40 million to over 200 million users while maintaining strict principles of decentralization and user sovereignty. Chen's 2025 roadmap integrates AI-powered security enhancements and simplified user experiences, positioning Trust Wallet as a "personal companion" that makes Web3 as intuitive as traditional applications while preserving individual control over digital assets. Chen started her career in crypto as a host on Phoenix TV, a Chinese television station. After becoming an early investor in what was then called Bitkeep, Chen became its first managing director, and was then promoted to CEO in May 2024. Since her promotion, Bitget has grown from 20 million users to 120 million. It now conducts more than $2 billion a day with $6.8 billion in assets, making it the sixth largest crypto exchange, according to CoinMarketCap. Bitget also has a $100 million fund to invest in Asian crypto startups. More than half of her managerial team are women. A Harvard Business School graduate, Samara Cohen serves as Chief Investment Officer of ETF and Index Investments at BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager. She has played a key leadership role in the success of the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), which has rapidly become one of the top-performing Bitcoin ETFs by assets under management. Cohen has publicly emphasized institutional investors’ strong focus on Bitcoin, a stance that continues to influence market dynamics. Her support for asset tokenization underscores BlackRock’s growing commitment to innovation in digital finance. The former LinkedIn VP has scaled Coinbase into a public company achieving incredible revenue growth and seven consecutive quarters of positive EBITDA through strategic operational leadership. Choi's background in traditional tech M&A, combined with her role in Coinbase's NASDAQ listing, exemplifies the professional maturation required for crypto's transition from speculative venture to mainstream financial infrastructure. She continues to be central in shaping Coinbase as a durable, publicly accountable infrastructure provider for digital assets. Head of Policy Europe at Solidus Labs, Delphine Forma has become a figure in crypto compliance education through founding the 2,000-member Crypto Compliance and Legal TG group and hosting influential podcasts like "MiCA Masters." Her extensive background spanning traditional banks like HSBC and crypto pioneers like BitMEX provides crucial bridge-building expertise. Forma's proactive approach to regulatory dialogue and her emphasis on "market integrity" as competitive advantage positions her as a key architect of the institutional-grade compliance infrastructure necessary for mainstream crypto adoption.

By Amanda Bartolotta June 5, 2025 It’s no secret that massive layoffs are currently devastating American workers. While industries across the spectrum are affected, from retail to manufacturing, the hardest-hit area is America’s tech sector, with companies from Amazon to Microsoft to Meta cutting hundreds of thousands of jobs – over 23,400 tech jobs cut in April alone. While automation and AI are conveniently blamed, hardcore reality comes into view when companies routinely cite “cost-cutting” and “corporate restructuring” – phrases that are often euphemisms for laying off American workers while hiring more foreign workers at lower wages. At the same time, the government of India is openly celebrating the launch of its latest scheme to supercharge the export of Indian workers to the U.S. and other “high-income economies.” Its goal is to facilitate the global mobility and employment of millions of migrant Indian workers directly at the expense of jobs for Americans. Not just immigration, but a global labor-export campaign Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! India’s “Global Access to Talent from India” initiative, or GATI, launched May 6, was personally championed by India’s External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and other officials who essentially describe it as a once-in-a-generation opportunity to redirect jobs, wages and even long-term industry trends away from Americans and into the pockets of India’s government, its outsourcing giants and their international partners. Calling this a “now or never” moment, India warns that the window of demographic advantage could close as competition mounts from African nations, the Philippines, Indonesia, Egypt, Vietnam and Brazil, all vying for their own share of the global labor market. Referring to a November 2024 think-tank report by two India-based entities, which projects a “global labor gap” of 45-50 million jobs in high-income countries by 2030, GATI sees a huge opportunity to flood foreign markets with its mass population to enter the global workforce. The document outlines a goal of doubling or even tripling the annual outflow of Indian workers, aiming for a “potential stock” of millions of Indian migrant workers overseas. But the ambition doesn’t end there. India is positioning itself as a “geostrategic partner” for major economies, hoping to be recognized as the world’s “trusted migration partner” and rebranding its citizens as a global “talent brand.” GATI predicts this “talent gap” could expand dramatically over the next two decades. Behind this bold new push, India has developed a structured and aggressive multi-horizon strategy to unlock its overseas labor potential. Through a combination of diaspora influence, bilateral negotiations, demand-side positioning, skill alignment and financing mechanisms, India calls for a “whole-of-nation” effort to coordinate the mass movement of workers abroad, treating its citizens as a strategic export. At the same time, Jaishankar demands that destination countries eliminate their own protections and reshape their laws to accommodate this outflow. This is not about mutual benefit, but about using foreign labor markets to solve India’s unemployment and economic growth crises. Outbound movement, remittance inflow Thus, by its own admission, GATI has engineered a massive, state-backed campaign to export Indian labor on a scale never before seen. This isn’t just about creating new job opportunities for Indians, it’s about systematically opening foreign markets, expanding India’s labor supply and building a permanent ecosystem that channels workers – and wages – out of America and into India. According to a leader of one of the report’s contributors, the India-based Boston Consulting Group, India’s labor exports could grow to as many as 2.5 million workers per year. Reality check: This is not a workforce solution for the United States. Indian officials publicly celebrate the higher wages their workers earn overseas, calling it “transformative” for India’s economy, while U.S. companies line up to replace Americans with cheaper, more compliant foreign labor. The result is a hollowing out of America’s middle class, not a win-win for both countries. What’s unfolding in America is not an isolated series of layoffs, but rather a deliberate, top-down overhaul of the U.S. labor market, designed by Indian policymakers, embraced by corporate America and propelled by relentless lobbying for ever more visas. In fact, the GATI Foundation openly targets $300 billion in annual remittances, money siphoned from American paychecks and communities, to be spent and invested back in India. India’s leaders make no secret of their endgame to use public-private partnerships to streamline recruitment, training and job placement for Indian nationals, maximizing remittance flows and strengthening India’s economic influence abroad. These remittance inflows have become a critical pillar of India’s economic strategy, pumping billions back into the country every year. Through GATI, India now aggressively markets itself as the world’s “reliable labor supplier,” positioning outbound migration as a strategic national asset. Unfortunately, the true impact of all this is that every job handed to an Indian guest worker is one lost to an American family. Through the GATI Foundation’s deep network of corporate partners, India is lobbying for looser visa rules and making Indian worker preference the “new normal” in major U.S. industries. Meanwhile, American companies are increasingly outsourcing everything from recruitment to training directly to Indian partners, ensuring that foreign nationals fill key roles while qualified U.S. citizens are left behind. Thus, at its core, the GATI Foundation’s blueprint is not about helping Americans or remedying genuine labor shortages, but about exploiting loopholes in U.S. immigration policy and leveraging global labor narratives to cement India’s rise, at the direct expense of the American workforce. The real agenda behind ‘Global Talent Shortage’ The GATI Foundation was created to exploit what India calls a “demand-supply mismatch” in global labor markets. Citing projections that labor shortages in high-income countries could reach 250 million in 25 years, India pitches itself as the answer, if only Western nations open their doors to millions of Indian workers. The GATI Report frames this supposed crisis as an economic certainty, pushing the narrative that countries like the U.S. and Europe must ramp up labor migration or face disaster. But this narrative falls apart on closer inspection. These “shortage” projections ignore millions of Americans and Westerners who have been forced out of the workforce by layoffs, offshoring and corporate cost-cutting. The “labor gap” is little more than an accounting trick, counting open positions that employers refuse to fill at fair wages and normal working conditions. Instead of investing in local workers, companies push for visas to import cheaper labor. And India stands ready to supply it. The contradiction is glaring: GATI and its supporters claim automation and “Gen AI” are both eliminating jobs and creating labor shortages at the same time. It’s a manufactured crisis, a narrative designed to benefit global corporations and foreign governments, but not American families. In truth, India’s campaign isn’t about filling genuine labor gaps, but about lobbying for new visa categories, higher caps and direct government-to-government deals to force open “mature” markets like the U.S., UK, Canada, Germany and Japan. The GATI Report itself concedes that in these countries, mass inflows are possible only if their governments change laws and visa policies – not because the market demands it, but because India’s lobby demands it. After all, if there truly were a dire worker shortage, existing visa programs would be flooded with qualified applicants and positions would fill quickly. Instead, India is manufacturing demand by lobbying for new pathways and is using its diplomatic muscle to export its unemployment crisis and the “remittance gold rush” that comes with it, into Western economies. As detailed in India’s own 2024 Employment Report, India’s job creation is not keeping pace with its exploding youth population. Far from being a demographic advantage, this so-called dividend is a growing liability, with millions of educated young Indians unable to find work at home. But Jaishankar and the rest of India’s leadership are not merely describing labor trends; they’re demanding permanent, government-backed pipelines to move Indian workers into foreign markets, shifting the costs and consequences onto the United States and its citizens. The so-called “global talent shortage” is not a fact of economics, but a tool of policy – propaganda crafted to dismantle labor protections, depress American wages and entrench the power of foreign governments and multinationals, all at the expense of the American worker. The skills mirage: India’s talent shortage cover-up India promotes its vast, English-speaking workforce as the solution to the so-called global talent shortage, marketing the GATI scheme as a direct pipeline of world-class professionals. In truth, GATI is engineered to move as many people abroad as possible, papering over the persistent problems of quality, skills and employability that continue to plague India’s workforce. Leaders like Jaishankar champion “skill development” and “global mobility,” but India’s own data reveals the reality: Fewer than half of Indian postgraduates are employable by international standards, according to India’s Skill Reports. This isn’t about quality; it’s about numbers. Thus, billions are funneled into crash courses, language bootcamps and certifications, not to build genuine expertise, but to create a façade of qualification, often after jobs have already been promised overseas. Even in crucial sectors like healthcare, where Jaishankar boasts India can “solve” Western shortages, the fact remains: India struggles to meet its own domestic needs. Skill reports and experts like Dr. Lekha Chakraborty confirm that Indian training programs consistently fail to prepare graduates for real-world demands, leaving millions underserved and resources misallocated. Yet, rather than closing the skill gaps at home, the focus is on exporting as many workers as possible, regardless of whether they actually meet international standards. The reality is, India isn’t overflowing with world-class professionals; it’s overflowing with people. Thus, the Indian government’s real objective is to wedge as many Indian nationals as possible into good-paying American jobs, often regardless of true qualification or the local impact. Meanwhile, capable American workers are left behind, not due to a lack of ability, but because U.S. policymakers and corporations have bought into India’s narrative and abandoned investment in the American workforce. The hidden cost of investing in India’s labor-supply strategy India has built a vast financial infrastructure to facilitate outbound migration, offering bridging loans, insurance and rotating funds, all subsidized by public and private grants. For employers, it’s cheaper to bring in Indian nationals than to invest in their own workforce. But the GATI strategy doesn’t stop at financing. India is demanding that host countries overhaul their own labor systems to accommodate and protect incoming foreign workers. Grievance mechanisms, legal mandates and resource centers lock in rights for migrants, while incentives including low-interest business loans and reskilling support are used to tilt hiring toward foreign workers. The hidden costs are staggering. American workers are not only undercut by lower-paid foreign labor, but are forced to compete with a workforce backed by another nation’s government and a web of corporate allies. Meanwhile, U.S. training standards and credential requirements are undermined, eroding the value of American education and experience. This isn’t a temporary fix. It is a permanent, self-reinforcing system, channeling billions of dollars in remittances to India and institutionalizing foreign-worker preference in advanced economies. The outcome is inevitable: falling wages, lost jobs and a steady erosion of America’s sovereignty over its own workforce. Every dollar invested in this supply strategy is a dollar stolen from the American economy. It’s time to demand a course correction, one that puts American skills, livelihoods and interests first. Hiring from India is like signing a contract riddled with hidden clauses; by the time the consequences are clear, the damage is done. The American workforce deserves better. Those jobs belong to American workers, not a foreign government’s export strategy. A blueprint for displacement: India’s cold, calculated framework India’s own analysis admits Indian certifications often aren’t recognized overseas due to mismatched skill requirements and quality standards – a clear sign that many of the workers being pushed abroad are not actually qualified for the jobs at hand. To get around these constraints, India’s plan is to “harmonize demand-centric skilling,” lobbying for international recognition of Indian credentials and pushing for government-backed loans to subsidize outbound migration. The goal isn’t to meet genuine needs, but to bypass local standards and flood foreign markets, regardless of the consequences for host countries. Every time a visa barrier is lowered or a new guest worker program is launched, it opens the door for India to embed even more of its surplus labor in Western economies. But the ambitions don’t stop with white-collar tech jobs. India’s leaders are playing a much longer and more aggressive game, openly targeting blue-collar visa categories like H-2A and H-2B, sectors that have long provided stability for American families and local communities. Their policy documents make this crystal clear: India’s strategy is to steadily lobby for the removal of visa caps, to institutionalize so-called “circular migration” so Indian workers can cycle through U.S. jobs indefinitely and to push for changes in immigration law that make Indian labor the default option for both high- and low-skill roles. This is not a temporary workforce solution; it’s a step-by-step plan to permanently transform the American labor market in ways that serve India’s interests while sidelining American workers at every level. America’s future: At a crossroads Bottom line: As American companies outsource everything from recruitment to onboarding to Indian partners, foreign nationals are funneled into critical roles across tech, healthcare, engineering and more, frequently at the direct expense of U.S. citizens. Accreditation standards are diluted. Worker protections are eroded. The playing field is tilted. India’s GATI initiative does not represent an invitation for partnership; it serves as a stark warning. As Indian leaders openly coordinate, lobby and strategize to gain a foothold in U.S. job markets, too many American officials remain silent or, worse, actively complicit. Every so-called “strategic migration partnership” and each new visa pipeline laid is another brick in the wall separating American families from their own economic future. The stakes could not be higher. This is not a tale of isolated layoffs or routine workforce shifts, but a deliberate, foreign-led transformation of the U.S. labor market. It is sold as progress but experienced as loss in every community facing layoffs, stagnant wages and vanishing careers. Each time an American worker is replaced by a lower-paid Indian “guest worker,” it marks another victory for India’s national agenda and another defeat for the American middle class. Unless action is taken, this pattern will only accelerate. American laws, corporations and policymakers risk becoming tools for India’s economic ascent while the American dream is steadily outsourced and rewritten. Americans must demand that their leaders defend their interests by rejecting foreign lobbying, putting an end to corporate collusion that enables mass visa fraud and restoring a workforce system that prioritizes American citizens in their own country. The choice is clear. Either the United States reclaims its labor market, its laws and its future, or the nation will continue down a path where its greatest export is its own prosperity. History will not be kind to those who allowed this nation to be given away. Now is the time to draw the line: America first, in every job, every industry, and every decision. Otherwise, America’s children will no longer compete with the “world” for the American dream – because that dream will belong to India. Editor’s note: This story is one of the most important currently facing Americans – yet outside of WND, it is almost entirely unreported. For years, WND has warned about the dangers of unchecked immigration and global labor schemes. Now, in real time, Americans are witnessing a foreign government making its final, strategic move to overtake their nation, one visa at a time. WND cannot win this battle alone.

Title: BlackRock Escapes Texas Oil-Boycott List After ESG Retreat

BlackRock Inc. was removed from Texas’ blacklist of companies that boycott fossil fuels, ending a three-year standoff over the environmental policies of the world’s largest asset manager. The move means pension funds and other state-run investment accounts — which manage more than $300 billion of assets — will be allowed to purchase BlackRock shares, invest in its exchange-traded funds and hire the firm for advice and risk management. Inclusion on the list resulted in some Texas entities pulling billions of dollars of assets from the firm. State Comptroller Glenn Hegar said BlackRock had rolled back many of its green-focused initiatives, including exiting the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative and stepping back from the Climate Action 100+, a group devoted to cutting greenhouse gas emissions. The move marks a win for BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink, who has been courting Texas leaders. Last year, he took the stage with Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick at a summit focused on shoring up the state’s energy grid, and just months ago BlackRock sponsored a table at the Black Tie & Boots Gala, a celebration of conservative politics in Texas. The company is also backing a Dallas-based Texas Stock Exchange. “We appreciate the Comptroller’s resolution of this matter,” a spokesperson for the firm said in a statement. “BlackRock is proud to help millions of Texans retire with dignity and, on behalf of clients, invests over $400 billion in corporations, local governments, energy infrastructure and other private assets throughout the state. These investments support the continued growth of the Texas economy.” Hegar touted some of BlackRock’s steps. He said while they are “unrelated” to the listing decision, the actions “show a real commitment to overall policy changes and a desire to act as a trusted partner in the growth of the Texas economy.” The company was a major target for conservative activists for years, with groups taking out advertisements around the country targeting the firm and Fink in particular. They argued the company was trying to influence corporate America and wider society through its support for ESG and sustainable investing. Republican officials in several states joined in that campaign, pulling money from the firm and arguing that it was harming fossil-fuel producing states like Texas. Fink himself said he would no longer use the ESG term because it had been politicized. “We never set out to punish any of these firms, and the hope was always that any firm we included on the list would eventually take steps to ensure they were removed,” Hegar said in a statement. “BlackRock, following the lead of many of its competitors, has finally done exactly that. While it took the company longer than others in the financial sector to make the shift, the end results are what matter.” BlackRock and a number of other financial firms including UBS Group AG and BNP Paribas SA were added to Texas’ blacklist n 2022. The action followed a law that restricted business with companies that the state considered to be hostile to the energy industry. Since then, the ESG push at investment firms, pension funds and law practices has faded somewhat, partly because of efforts to avoid attacks by President Donald Trump and Republicans. BlackRock has been seeking to get off the list since it was added. The firm had always maintained it didn’t run afoul of the law.

Title: Seven Days at the Bin Store

9:02 AM EDT on June 4, 2025 This spring, a new business opened on the main drag of my West Philadelphia neighborhood, provoking both excitement and trepidation. “I saw it just the other day and feared it,” one friend texted. “Like what the actual fuck is that shit,” said another. “Why?!!!” said a third. “Who is that for?” Until last summer, the corner storefront at Baltimore Avenue and S. Melville Street was a moderately overpriced hipster vintage store. After it closed, it sat empty for nearly a year. Then, in March, it sprang to life. A “grand opening” banner went up over the door. A miniature wacky inflatable tube man flailed around outside. Posters with the logos for Walmart, Amazon, Costco, and Best Buy covered the windows, declaring “CRAZY DEALS, AMAZING BINZ.” I had to check it out. AMAZING BINZ is on the first floor of a rowhome, narrow and long. There’s one central aisle, and on either side, big wooden tray tables—the proverbial binz—overflowing with undifferentiated piles of consumer stuff: unopened Halloween costumes, an ice mold shaped like a penis, a banner of many glittery penises wearing grass skirts, a staggering number of “reusable hot and cold gel compression sleeve[s] for elbow,” a single loose pregnancy test, something called Wokaar for “waxing the nose beard.” At least half the products are still in boxes, and there are signs on the walls warning customers to NOT OPEN THE BOXES, so you have to scan the barcode with your phone or decipher clipped product descriptions: “module stool,” “gratitude journal,” “Xmas tea light green.” But the great innovation of Amazing Binz is its pricing structure, which is splashed across the facade in Spanish and English and makes good on the promise of CRAZY DEALS. On Fridays, when the bins are freshly stocked, everything costs $10. On Saturdays, $8. Sundays: $6. Mondays: $4. Tuesdays: $2. Wednesdays: $1. Thursday is bin store Sabbath, when the shop is closed and restocked. The store is like nothing else on the block, which boasts, among other things, a yoga studio, two vape shops, a volunteer-run book store and a Marxist reading room, and no fewer than four Ethiopian joints. Where did all this stuff come from? Who opened this store, and why? Is it profitable? What does it mean for the uneven gentrification of Baltimore Avenue and West Philadelphia? I decided to spend a week visiting Amazing Binz every day. Here is what I found. On Thursdays, Amazing Binz is closed. One of the owners, Ahmed, has graciously allowed me to observe the restock. Overall, Ahmed has been very gracious about my fixation on his store. When I arrive at 10:30 a.m., he’s smoking a cigarette and nervously awaiting a delivery truck with 18 pallets of mixed merchandise from Target. Amazing Binz gets its inventory from major corporations’ overstock and returned products, taking advantage of the vast weird world of “reverse logistics.” “ You've got the front end, where you order the product, it comes into the port, it goes to a warehouse, to a store, and then to our front door,” says Cathy Roberson, a researcher at the Reverse Logistics Association, an industry trade group. “What if once it hits our front door, we don't like it, or it's broken or something? That's the reverse part. ” Returns, repairs, refurbished products, and even recalls fall into the purview of reverse logistics. They are joined there by products that never made it to a consumer because the season ended, or a box was a little dented, or the purchaser never picked up their order, or a retailer was just running out of room in their warehouse. That pile of excess stuff is growing. About 17 percent of all merchandise gets returned, according to the National Retail Federation. That’s up from just eight percent in 2019. For online purchases, it’s almost 30 percent. Liquidators are nothing new: T.J. Maxx, Ocean State Job Lot, Nordstrom Rack. But as the scale of the excess grows, the reverse logistics industry is expanding, and methods of disposal are diversifying. Some corporations, like Amazon, do their own reselling through a bulk liquidation page. There are middlemen like B-Stock, an eBay-like site where anyone can shop for truckloads of unwanted stuff. Influencers are buying pallets to unbox on stream, capitalizing on both the goods and the views. It’s a whole universe of brokers, wholesalers, and secondhand retail all trying to claw back a little bit of money from the growing pile. That’s where Amazing Binz comes in. “The goal for all the reverse logistics stuff,” says Roberson, “is to keep things out of the landfill.” Today, Ahmed is expecting half a truckload with about 3,500 to 4,500 individual pieces, ranging from kitchen appliances to toys to clothing; he doesn’t know exactly what. The semi-truck pulls up right on time, and Ahmed unloads it with a forklift, cigarette still in mouth. Pallets fill the sidewalk, glistening shrink-wrapped towers of stuff: air fryers, microwaves, a vacuum, a sled, a machine that tosses a football, My Little Pony-branded diapers, and a go-kart. Inside the store, the bins are still half-full from the last truckload, which came from Amazon. There are many products I’ve only ever seen on the internet: a carrying case and monogrammed straw cover for a Stanley cup, a big plastic grinder for shredding chicken, silicone molds for making the viral Dubai chocolate bar at home. For this restock, Ahmed was hoping for a different caliber of item. It’s a mixed success: some quality products, but more clothing and returned items than he was hoping for. Electronics are the holy grail; appliances and home goods do well, too. The best items are the ones that retain their value, because Ahmed sees his customers as agents in the reverse logistics economy, too. “You can buy stuff from here and then you can resell it,” Ahmed tells me. “Through eBay or Amazon. You can sell on Facebook market. You will get your money back in less than one day if you wanna resell it. Which is a good thing for everybody right now, for the public. A lot of people need to work.” It’s a slog of a day. I leave after a few hours, and come back at 6:00 p.m., nearly eight hours into this operation. Ahmed and two helpers are still unloading and stocking. They won’t be done until after 10:00 p.m. I get to Amazing Binz at 9:35 a.m. It opens at 10:00 a.m. Already, two people are standing at the door with their faces pressed to the glass. Soon, six people are waiting, then a dozen. A woman and her kids show up in a taxi. At least one person has come from the county over. Amazing Binz posts their new hauls on Instagram, so some people have already scouted what they want: a kid’s scooter, a shower caddy. Fridays offer the highest upside: a chance to score something really valuable for just $10. All the real shoppers are lined up this morning, looking for an edge. People are arriving every minute; the line swells to 25. Most of the people waiting are middle-aged black men and women. Some are resellers, and many seem well-versed in Philadelphia’s liquidation economy. A few bring up Turn 7, a giant liquidation warehouse with a bin model that closed last month. I learn about another bin store in New Jersey, and one in Northeast Philly called Black Friday Outlet, a nationwide bin store chain. Someone tells me there’s another bin store opening up today, just 10 blocks away. “When I first got into this industry, there were no more than 10 bin stores in the entire country,” says Nebraska-based wholesaler and content creator Colton Carlson, who opened his first store in 2018. “Fast forward a few years, [and] there ended up being 3,000 bin stores.” Today, he thinks there could be as many as 10,000 in the U.S. Bin stores are distinguished by their pricing model—a set price per item or weight, and falling prices to incentivize quick sales—and by their agnostic approach to inventory. They’ll take nearly anything and everything. “Once people caught on that you could buy a truckload of inventory, you dump it in your bins and you make a ton of money, then they really just started opening that rapid-fire at that point,” says Carlson. The explosion of online returns got the bin-store craze started, but the pandemic put it into overdrive. Factory shutdowns and slowdowns at ports meant for weird lags in the supply chain that led to seasonal products arriving past their season, or goods just being abandoned at port. To try and weather the uncertainty, and keep up with exploding online shopping, retailers overstocked on inventory. “In the beginning of the pandemic, we bought everything in sight,” says Roberson. “Then all of a sudden we, the consumer, decided we've had enough. We've bought everything. We've gotta tighten our belts now.” Consumer spending dropped, and retailers were left holding the bag in overstuffed warehouses. Some, like Target, “ kind of got caught with their pants down,” says Roberson. They were stuck with so much excess inventory, they sold it for pennies on the dollar. The secondhand market flooded with more cheap stuff than normal, creating opportunities for resellers. “On opening day, we had about 300 people lined up down the street,” says Carlson, who thinks his was the biggest bin store in the country at the time. “Every weekend from that, it was just the same thing: a line down the street with 200, 300 people ready to find a deal.” This Friday morning at Amazing Binz, there are now over 30 people waiting to be let inside. Finally, the doors open and the crowd floods into the narrow shop, honing in on the premier items. Scooters and grills and Target-branded home goods fly out of the bins. People are hauling around air fryers so no one else can take them. It is, frankly, a bit of a mad house. One reseller, who didn’t find anything he wanted, says, “One of these days, someone’s going to get shot.” A woman declares, “I will never do this again.” Generally, people seem happy with their finds. The guy who wanted the scooters gets the scooters; the woman who wanted the shower caddy gets the shower caddy. It all happens fast. By the end of the day, the first two bins are completely empty. It’s farmer’s market day in West Philadelphia, Baltimore Avenue’s busiest day. The store is much calmer than Friday morning, but still doing a brisk business. Where yesterday there were piles of home goods and appliances, the bins have been restocked with less high-end fare: soccer balls, bike inner tubes, sand art kits, clothing, shoes. I want to get a sense of how neighbors are feeling. Once, while digging in the bins, I heard a young guy muttering to himself. “This is so weird. What am I looking at?” We made eye contact. “Have you ever seen a store like this?” he asked me. “It doesn’t feel right. I don’t think this will be here long.” I check West Willy, the easily parodied local Facebook group. A post about Amazing Binz has over 50 comments, ranging from “omg I am EXCITED,” to “Maybe I can find things I need and not weep over the price,” to “No offense to the owners but this store feels like where late stage capitalism goes for one final hurrah.” I ask the book vendor who sets up outside the Marxist storefront how he feels about Amazing Binz. “It shows the corporation’s incursion into the neighborhood at every level, big to small,” he says. He adds that he likes that it’s a minority-owned business. I ask a resident who happens to be walking by, a long-timer who moved to the neighborhood in the 1970s when it was, as he says, Philadelphia’s answer to Haight-Ashbury. “It means a potential downturn of the local market that had been popping up with restaurants and boutiques,” he says. Baltimore Avenue runs from the University of Pennsylvania campus in the east, west through a neighborhood that’s a mixture of million-dollar houses, squats-turned-group-houses, and some of the city’s most persistent poverty. For the six-ish years I’ve lived here, I’ve watched a handful of bougie businesses open and quickly fold, leaving behind empty storefronts. Housing prices just go up and up, but the retail strip suggests an uneven gentrification. Those fluctuating fortunes are mirrored in starkly divergent views of whether Amazing Binz is an “amazing store with amazing stuff and amazing prices” (their first Google review) or “a place that sells crap” (a post on West Willy). It’s an odd location for a store like this. Liquidators usually look for huge spaces, in industrial areas or big shopping centers at the edge of town. When I ask Ahmed how he came to open Amazing Binz here, he said it was actually not his first choice. He wanted to open a cafe or a sweet shop, but says he couldn’t get the permits or the zoning. The landlord wouldn’t give him a break on rent, which is nearly $4,000 a month. So after about eight months of sitting on the location, Ahmed decided he needed to open something with low overhead and little startup capital. There’s a few bin stores in Northeast Philly, where he lives, so he’d seen this model before, and thought it would be good for the neighborhood. At the start of this week, he hung a Free Palestine flag behind the counter. He’s from the West Bank and felt comfortable hanging the flag because, he says, “Our neighbors support us.” Nearly every time I’m here, there are happy customers, usually quite a few. There's a real mix of the neighborhood. Serious diggers, often in headphones, methodically overturn every pile. A PTA mom sends her husband home for the car after she fills three baskets with school supplies. Some gigglers revel in the slop and the strangely sentimental: the Dick Pics in Nature calendar, the crystal heart paperweight engraved with a 25th wedding anniversary message. But there are haters. At parties and potlucks across West Philadelphia, my neighbors split into camps: for or against the bin store. Houses divide against themselves. Pros: It’s cheap, it’s fun, and at least the stuff isn’t getting thrown away. Cons: An uncanny feeling of glimpsing the collective consumer psyche, AI slop in consumer form, the horrors of production for production’s sake. At the farmer’s market, a friend of a friend calls Amazing Binz “dark and sinister,” and compares it to a big sifting funnel. All the consumer drivel of the world goes in at the top, and all the unsaleable, undigested, unwanted stuff just falls out the bottom. “The bin store,” he says, “is like the last step before they just throw it in the ocean.” When I get to Amazing Binz, Omran—Amazing Binz’s social media hype man—is filming a video with a shopper who found the toner she usually buys at Sephora, for $65, here in the bins for $6. This is one of Omran’s Instagram shticks. He asks customers what they bought and how much they paid, and then replies, “I know daht’s right,” a phrase also tagged on all the posts. Omran does some of the ordering for Amazing Binz. He says he buys his inventory through direct relationships with people at warehouses, not through auction sites, where the prices are often higher. Ahmed tells me the average truckload costs about $16,000, and will contain thousands of individual pieces. The key is to keep the cost per item at around $2, and to get a mix of higher- and lower-value items so they balance each other out. Most bin stores do a hybrid model, where they sell higher-quality stuff on the side at prices above $10. Amazing Binz calls it the VIP section. With this week’s Target haul, I assumed that the nicer items would end up there. But no, the owners priced most of it at $10, hoping the allure of a huge discount on a big-ticket item draws people in and gets them to spend more. This is the bin-store promise: teasing the chance to find Oura rings and AirPods for just $10. Once, while I talked to Ahmed, a neighbor walked by and waved. “She got those Beats headphones here,” he says. “Ten dollars. She was so happy.” But the price flattening works in both directions, I realize on a $6 Sunday. A friend is shopping for a mermaid-themed bachelorette party, and we find plenty: That previously mentioned garland of penises is still here (two, actually), as well as a sheet of mermaid stickers and a curly straw that spells "BRIDE." The problem is that $6 is too expensive for a straw, especially a straw that I know has been here for three weeks, at least. This is one effect of the bin store: There’s plenty of legitimately good stuff, at good prices, but that usually gets snapped up in the first few days. Anything that remains through the whole pricing cycle and back again is revealed to be worth nothing at all. My friend, digging for penis straws, says maybe it’s good to see. We have to confront this stuff. This is the cost of our collective Amazon addiction. There are times when the bin store does feel like an art installation, a message, or a warning. Wander through it for a few days and you will start to feel like you are in a room in a haunted house, one where the corporeal forms of the world economy’s least-wanted products are trapped, unable to move on. With or without Amazing Binz, all of this stuff is just out there, already made. A lot of it is useful but excessive, rendered obsolete by an overheated economy. Shopping here can feel a bit like fighting the last, losing battle of reverse logistics. What can still be made useful enough to be kept out of the landfill, just a little longer? It’s a slow day at Amazing Binz, again. This week has been big on gloomy weather, and low on foot traffic. I find a Trump 2024 Punisher logo drink koozie in the pile. These have been popping up in the bins since that first Amazon haul, along with MAGA and Let’s Go Brandon flags. Every time a customer points one out to the owners, they throw it away. A woman approaches the counter with a pair of leopard-print flats, but the two shoes are connected by a stretchy white loop of elastic that’s gotten tangled up with at least five other pairs’ elastic, creating an unholy rats nest of shoes that she needs help untangling. On slower days, it’s hard not to wonder how long Amazing Binz will last. Philadelphia may be behind the times. In the rest of the country, the bin-store bubble has started to burst. On YouTube, I find a cadre of wholesale and reselling influencers, including a bin-store niche. I watch their videos touting the model, how easy it is to start one, and how to succeed. Then I watch them change their tunes. “Unpopular opinion: Bin stores really suck right now,” declared creator Lindey Glenn in November 2023. She linked to Carlson’s most recent video: “Bin store burnout.” After opening his first store in late 2018, Carlson had a few good years riding high on the novelty of the business model and the glut of unwanted pandemic-era merchandise. But as more bin stores opened, the demand and prices for the same truckloads went up. Colton says that after a while, he was just breaking even on the bins, which at his store, started at a high of only $5. He found other revenue streams, like selling entire pallets to resellers, and sorting out the niche and expensive products to flip on Poshmark or eBay. But the challenges persisted. The bin store is a finely tuned operation. A broker might promise a great haul with new electronics, and then deliver a bunch of dirty and broken returns. A truckload could arrive late, or not at all, leaving owners in the lurch on what should be their most profitable day. These problems are exacerbated in small stores, like Amazing Binz, where it’s hard to store extra merchandise to weather that uncertainty. And the stuff itself creates logistical headaches. Boxes get opened, sometimes from theft, sometimes just from jostling around in the bins. Pieces get lost, trash and detritus build up alongside the unsold products, the difference between them increasingly hard to discern. In fact, when it was time to clear his bins, Carlton would dump all of the unsold inventory mixed with trash back onto a pallet and sell the whole thing for $50, with the caveat that the buyer had to go toss the garbage somewhere else. Carlson saw the writing on the wall. He sold his bin store in 2023. Now he’s focusing on his wholesale business, and opening a side-by-side discount grocery and clothing store, which is where he thinks the secondhand retail trends are headed. The Reverse Logistics Association has also seen a decline in bin-store fortunes. Roberson says they lost a few bin-store members because of bankruptcy. After the pandemic, “it was getting more difficult to buy up that excess inventory because there really wasn't excess inventory.” But economic shocks are good for the secondhand economy. Roberson thinks tariffs could, eventually, lead to another bin-store bump. At the start of 2025, she says, many retailers overstocked on inventory again, filling their warehouses to get ahead of price hikes. That could mean they’ll soon be sitting on overstock, especially if consumers decide they’re not willing to pay higher prices. Supply chain disruptions will produce more excess. Already, goods are stalled at ports around the world. Roberson predicts a temporary dip in the fortunes of bin-store owners, as secondhand goods get more expensive along with everything else, and then a resurgence. Carlson agrees. “ I think the secondhand market is going to keep growing because that's the whole reason people are shopping at these stores [to see] if they can save $10. I don't see consumer spending going down for this industry, or even like thrift stores at all. I think that's gonna continuously go up. However, the problem's gonna lie on whoever owns the bin store.” Ahmed seems extremely tired today. He’s barely taken a day off since they opened, not even for Eid. Everything is pretty picked over. The sand art is all gone, the bedding and curtains. There’s just two soccer balls left. I do my customary scan of the bins, from the back of the store to the front. There’s nothing new, just increasingly empty boxes of gel compression elbow sleeves, loose whippit canisters, and batteries rolling across the bottom. According to Ahmed, the cost of pallets is going up. On a recent load of electronics, he paid $12 per item. For the time being, Amazing Binz is just breaking even, but it’s not sustainable. Ahmed says he may have to raise prices, and that he’ll even have to reevaluate the whole business in a few months. “This type of business, it’s not for this neighborhood,” he says. Omran, ever the salesman, is darkly optimistic that they can keep prices low. "Anything to save the community some money,” he says. "We're not looking to get rich. Being rich is pointless nowadays. It's about, how can you survive? How can I feed my kids? How can we pay our bills?” I’m reminded of a conversation I had with the truck driver, Nick, who dropped off the Target load. He used to drive a taxi, until Uber ruined that. He prefers truck driving, but it was better at the height of the pandemic, when everyone was shopping online. Around that time, Nick’s wife was a third-party seller on Amazon. She stocked her inventory based on social media trends, a task complicated by the algorithm. The more she looked at videos of, say, people showing off their Stanley cup accessories, the more TikTok fed her those videos, until it was hard to know if people were actually buying them in the real world, or if she was just in an online feedback loop. Plus, Amazon charges high storage fees, so unsold product just sitting in their warehouse cost her money. She quit, and abandoned her merchandise. That’s where a lot of the stuff in the Amazing Binz came from: failing third-party vendors, looking to offload the detritus of brief and bygone trends. For a second, an image of the 21st century economy seems to come into focus here at the bin store. Nick, his wife, Amazing Binz’s owners, and even me, a freelance journalist, we’re all supposedly free agents, “entrepreneurs,” but in reality, we’re limited to buying whatever gets kicked down the funnel, and flipping it for all it’s worth. It’s like I can see our labor getting discounted by the day. Already, I've asked my editor if I can resell a version of this story elsewhere, to recoup a little more of my Amazing Binz investment. At 6:45 p.m. on Wednesday, a little over an hour until closing time, the shop is packed. Everything is now one dollar. An elderly woman finds a shoe she likes, a black slide with gold studs all over. But it's just one shoe. Ahmed is insisting she buy it, and says he’ll keep the other shoe for her when he finds it. “For a dollar you can’t beat it,” he says. He’s in a good mood, joking with this woman and her daughter. She’s apparently been looking for three days. “Those shoes are really cute,” I tell her. “Do you work here?” she asks. Maybe I’ve been here too long. After days of finding empty boxes, I finally find a loose elbow gel sleeve. It is heavy, slinky, comforting. After this, I find many of them, hiding in the bins like eels. Everything swims around the piles, and I revisit them as old friends, including the unopened boxes, known only by their clipped epithets: “Kiss Me I’m Irish wooden sign with lights,” “Lazy Susan for Refrigerator New.” The Jujube Enucleator box is full one day, and empty the next, without me ever seeing what was inside. The Dick Pics in Nature calendar remains, week after week. Who knows how many times these items have been bought and sold before they arrived here, how many more times they might be bought and sold. I imagine it all ending up in the same places eventually: the landfill or the waterways, where it will exist forever, first as choking hazard, then as nurdle. In the dwindling bins, I find another Trump flag, folded in plastic but unmistakable. Omran says I can have it. I unfurl it, stiff and plasticky, creased into a grid. I don’t want it, but what am I supposed to do? It will end up in the garbage one way or another. I stuff it in my bag. I ask, “How long have you guys been open?” It’s April 16, and Omran says they opened the doors on March 21. “I thought it was more than a month,” says Ahmed. “It’s been a long month,” says Omran. The Trump flag joins a small museum of items I have purchased since the bin store opened: a cat bed ($10), a felted flower garland ($6), four post-Valentine heart-shaped chocolate boxes ($5 for all), two small spring-form pans ($4 each), a large penis-shaped ice cube mold ($4), four bike inner tubes ($2 each), a box of ant traps that don’t work ($2). Did I need any of these things? Maybe the ant traps, if they’d worked, maybe the inner tubes. Mostly, I bought them because they were there, the same way I watch an Instagram reel because it pops up next. The irony is that if I were in the market for new pans or bedding, Amazing Binz would at this point be my best local option. It’s also simultaneously the most fun and most unsettling store on Baltimore Avenue, a combination that I find addictive, as many bin enjoyers do. I take one last lap, back into the farthest corner of the store, where the oldest stuff has accumulated in deep drifts, where the Wokaar lives, now separated from its box. Looking for what? I don’t know. It’s concentrated back here, layers of unwanted product, filtered all the way down the supply chain to this last bin, where it’s piling up like sand. As I stare at the piles, I almost expect them to start breaking down in front of me, each individual item decomposing into a pool of microplastics, what remains of its value finally depleted. I leave the store, and the bins where they are. They’ll be full again tomorrow. If you liked this blog, please share it!

Title: Seven Days at the Bin Store

9:02 AM EDT on June 4, 2025 This spring, a new business opened on the main drag of my West Philadelphia neighborhood, provoking both excitement and trepidation. “I saw it just the other day and feared it,” one friend texted. “Like what the actual fuck is that shit,” said another. “Why?!!!” said a third. “Who is that for?” Until last summer, the corner storefront at Baltimore Avenue and S. Melville Street was a moderately overpriced hipster vintage store. After it closed, it sat empty for nearly a year. Then, in March, it sprang to life. A “grand opening” banner went up over the door. A miniature wacky inflatable tube man flailed around outside. Posters with the logos for Walmart, Amazon, Costco, and Best Buy covered the windows, declaring “CRAZY DEALS, AMAZING BINZ.” I had to check it out. AMAZING BINZ is on the first floor of a rowhome, narrow and long. There’s one central aisle, and on either side, big wooden tray tables—the proverbial binz—overflowing with undifferentiated piles of consumer stuff: unopened Halloween costumes, an ice mold shaped like a penis, a banner of many glittery penises wearing grass skirts, a staggering number of “reusable hot and cold gel compression sleeve[s] for elbow,” a single loose pregnancy test, something called Wokaar for “waxing the nose beard.” At least half the products are still in boxes, and there are signs on the walls warning customers to NOT OPEN THE BOXES, so you have to scan the barcode with your phone or decipher clipped product descriptions: “module stool,” “gratitude journal,” “Xmas tea light green.” But the great innovation of Amazing Binz is its pricing structure, which is splashed across the facade in Spanish and English and makes good on the promise of CRAZY DEALS. On Fridays, when the bins are freshly stocked, everything costs $10. On Saturdays, $8. Sundays: $6. Mondays: $4. Tuesdays: $2. Wednesdays: $1. Thursday is bin store Sabbath, when the shop is closed and restocked. The store is like nothing else on the block, which boasts, among other things, a yoga studio, two vape shops, a volunteer-run book store and a Marxist reading room, and no fewer than four Ethiopian joints. Where did all this stuff come from? Who opened this store, and why? Is it profitable? What does it mean for the uneven gentrification of Baltimore Avenue and West Philadelphia? I decided to spend a week visiting Amazing Binz every day. Here is what I found. On Thursdays, Amazing Binz is closed. One of the owners, Ahmed, has graciously allowed me to observe the restock. Overall, Ahmed has been very gracious about my fixation on his store. When I arrive at 10:30 a.m., he’s smoking a cigarette and nervously awaiting a delivery truck with 18 pallets of mixed merchandise from Target. Amazing Binz gets its inventory from major corporations’ overstock and returned products, taking advantage of the vast weird world of “reverse logistics.” “ You've got the front end, where you order the product, it comes into the port, it goes to a warehouse, to a store, and then to our front door,” says Cathy Roberson, a researcher at the Reverse Logistics Association, an industry trade group. “What if once it hits our front door, we don't like it, or it's broken or something? That's the reverse part. ” Returns, repairs, refurbished products, and even recalls fall into the purview of reverse logistics. They are joined there by products that never made it to a consumer because the season ended, or a box was a little dented, or the purchaser never picked up their order, or a retailer was just running out of room in their warehouse. That pile of excess stuff is growing. About 17 percent of all merchandise gets returned, according to the National Retail Federation. That’s up from just eight percent in 2019. For online purchases, it’s almost 30 percent. Liquidators are nothing new: T.J. Maxx, Ocean State Job Lot, Nordstrom Rack. But as the scale of the excess grows, the reverse logistics industry is expanding, and methods of disposal are diversifying. Some corporations, like Amazon, do their own reselling through a bulk liquidation page. There are middlemen like B-Stock, an eBay-like site where anyone can shop for truckloads of unwanted stuff. Influencers are buying pallets to unbox on stream, capitalizing on both the goods and the views. It’s a whole universe of brokers, wholesalers, and secondhand retail all trying to claw back a little bit of money from the growing pile. That’s where Amazing Binz comes in. “The goal for all the reverse logistics stuff,” says Roberson, “is to keep things out of the landfill.” Today, Ahmed is expecting half a truckload with about 3,500 to 4,500 individual pieces, ranging from kitchen appliances to toys to clothing; he doesn’t know exactly what. The semi-truck pulls up right on time, and Ahmed unloads it with a forklift, cigarette still in mouth. Pallets fill the sidewalk, glistening shrink-wrapped towers of stuff: air fryers, microwaves, a vacuum, a sled, a machine that tosses a football, My Little Pony-branded diapers, and a go-kart. Inside the store, the bins are still half-full from the last truckload, which came from Amazon. There are many products I’ve only ever seen on the internet: a carrying case and monogrammed straw cover for a Stanley cup, a big plastic grinder for shredding chicken, silicone molds for making the viral Dubai chocolate bar at home. For this restock, Ahmed was hoping for a different caliber of item. It’s a mixed success: some quality products, but more clothing and returned items than he was hoping for. Electronics are the holy grail; appliances and home goods do well, too. The best items are the ones that retain their value, because Ahmed sees his customers as agents in the reverse logistics economy, too. “You can buy stuff from here and then you can resell it,” Ahmed tells me. “Through eBay or Amazon. You can sell on Facebook market. You will get your money back in less than one day if you wanna resell it. Which is a good thing for everybody right now, for the public. A lot of people need to work.” It’s a slog of a day. I leave after a few hours, and come back at 6:00 p.m., nearly eight hours into this operation. Ahmed and two helpers are still unloading and stocking. They won’t be done until after 10:00 p.m. I get to Amazing Binz at 9:35 a.m. It opens at 10:00 a.m. Already, two people are standing at the door with their faces pressed to the glass. Soon, six people are waiting, then a dozen. A woman and her kids show up in a taxi. At least one person has come from the county over. Amazing Binz posts their new hauls on Instagram, so some people have already scouted what they want: a kid’s scooter, a shower caddy. Fridays offer the highest upside: a chance to score something really valuable for just $10. All the real shoppers are lined up this morning, looking for an edge. People are arriving every minute; the line swells to 25. Most of the people waiting are middle-aged black men and women. Some are resellers, and many seem well-versed in Philadelphia’s liquidation economy. A few bring up Turn 7, a giant liquidation warehouse with a bin model that closed last month. I learn about another bin store in New Jersey, and one in Northeast Philly called Black Friday Outlet, a nationwide bin store chain. Someone tells me there’s another bin store opening up today, just 10 blocks away. “When I first got into this industry, there were no more than 10 bin stores in the entire country,” says Nebraska-based wholesaler and content creator Colton Carlson, who opened his first store in 2018. “Fast forward a few years, [and] there ended up being 3,000 bin stores.” Today, he thinks there could be as many as 10,000 in the U.S. Bin stores are distinguished by their pricing model—a set price per item or weight, and falling prices to incentivize quick sales—and by their agnostic approach to inventory. They’ll take nearly anything and everything. “Once people caught on that you could buy a truckload of inventory, you dump it in your bins and you make a ton of money, then they really just started opening that rapid-fire at that point,” says Carlson. The explosion of online returns got the bin-store craze started, but the pandemic put it into overdrive. Factory shutdowns and slowdowns at ports meant for weird lags in the supply chain that led to seasonal products arriving past their season, or goods just being abandoned at port. To try and weather the uncertainty, and keep up with exploding online shopping, retailers overstocked on inventory. “In the beginning of the pandemic, we bought everything in sight,” says Roberson. “Then all of a sudden we, the consumer, decided we've had enough. We've bought everything. We've gotta tighten our belts now.” Consumer spending dropped, and retailers were left holding the bag in overstuffed warehouses. Some, like Target, “ kind of got caught with their pants down,” says Roberson. They were stuck with so much excess inventory, they sold it for pennies on the dollar. The secondhand market flooded with more cheap stuff than normal, creating opportunities for resellers. “On opening day, we had about 300 people lined up down the street,” says Carlson, who thinks his was the biggest bin store in the country at the time. “Every weekend from that, it was just the same thing: a line down the street with 200, 300 people ready to find a deal.” This Friday morning at Amazing Binz, there are now over 30 people waiting to be let inside. Finally, the doors open and the crowd floods into the narrow shop, honing in on the premier items. Scooters and grills and Target-branded home goods fly out of the bins. People are hauling around air fryers so no one else can take them. It is, frankly, a bit of a mad house. One reseller, who didn’t find anything he wanted, says, “One of these days, someone’s going to get shot.” A woman declares, “I will never do this again.” Generally, people seem happy with their finds. The guy who wanted the scooters gets the scooters; the woman who wanted the shower caddy gets the shower caddy. It all happens fast. By the end of the day, the first two bins are completely empty. It’s farmer’s market day in West Philadelphia, Baltimore Avenue’s busiest day. The store is much calmer than Friday morning, but still doing a brisk business. Where yesterday there were piles of home goods and appliances, the bins have been restocked with less high-end fare: soccer balls, bike inner tubes, sand art kits, clothing, shoes. I want to get a sense of how neighbors are feeling. Once, while digging in the bins, I heard a young guy muttering to himself. “This is so weird. What am I looking at?” We made eye contact. “Have you ever seen a store like this?” he asked me. “It doesn’t feel right. I don’t think this will be here long.” I check West Willy, the easily parodied local Facebook group. A post about Amazing Binz has over 50 comments, ranging from “omg I am EXCITED,” to “Maybe I can find things I need and not weep over the price,” to “No offense to the owners but this store feels like where late stage capitalism goes for one final hurrah.” I ask the book vendor who sets up outside the Marxist storefront how he feels about Amazing Binz. “It shows the corporation’s incursion into the neighborhood at every level, big to small,” he says. He adds that he likes that it’s a minority-owned business. I ask a resident who happens to be walking by, a long-timer who moved to the neighborhood in the 1970s when it was, as he says, Philadelphia’s answer to Haight-Ashbury. “It means a potential downturn of the local market that had been popping up with restaurants and boutiques,” he says. Baltimore Avenue runs from the University of Pennsylvania campus in the east, west through a neighborhood that’s a mixture of million-dollar houses, squats-turned-group-houses, and some of the city’s most persistent poverty. For the six-ish years I’ve lived here, I’ve watched a handful of bougie businesses open and quickly fold, leaving behind empty storefronts. Housing prices just go up and up, but the retail strip suggests an uneven gentrification. Those fluctuating fortunes are mirrored in starkly divergent views of whether Amazing Binz is an “amazing store with amazing stuff and amazing prices” (their first Google review) or “a place that sells crap” (a post on West Willy). It’s an odd location for a store like this. Liquidators usually look for huge spaces, in industrial areas or big shopping centers at the edge of town. When I ask Ahmed how he came to open Amazing Binz here, he said it was actually not his first choice. He wanted to open a cafe or a sweet shop, but says he couldn’t get the permits or the zoning. The landlord wouldn’t give him a break on rent, which is nearly $4,000 a month. So after about eight months of sitting on the location, Ahmed decided he needed to open something with low overhead and little startup capital. There’s a few bin stores in Northeast Philly, where he lives, so he’d seen this model before, and thought it would be good for the neighborhood. At the start of this week, he hung a Free Palestine flag behind the counter. He’s from the West Bank and felt comfortable hanging the flag because, he says, “Our neighbors support us.” Nearly every time I’m here, there are happy customers, usually quite a few. There's a real mix of the neighborhood. Serious diggers, often in headphones, methodically overturn every pile. A PTA mom sends her husband home for the car after she fills three baskets with school supplies. Some gigglers revel in the slop and the strangely sentimental: the Dick Pics in Nature calendar, the crystal heart paperweight engraved with a 25th wedding anniversary message. But there are haters. At parties and potlucks across West Philadelphia, my neighbors split into camps: for or against the bin store. Houses divide against themselves. Pros: It’s cheap, it’s fun, and at least the stuff isn’t getting thrown away. Cons: An uncanny feeling of glimpsing the collective consumer psyche, AI slop in consumer form, the horrors of production for production’s sake. At the farmer’s market, a friend of a friend calls Amazing Binz “dark and sinister,” and compares it to a big sifting funnel. All the consumer drivel of the world goes in at the top, and all the unsaleable, undigested, unwanted stuff just falls out the bottom. “The bin store,” he says, “is like the last step before they just throw it in the ocean.” When I get to Amazing Binz, Omran—Amazing Binz’s social media hype man—is filming a video with a shopper who found the toner she usually buys at Sephora, for $65, here in the bins for $6. This is one of Omran’s Instagram shticks. He asks customers what they bought and how much they paid, and then replies, “I know daht’s right,” a phrase also tagged on all the posts. Omran does some of the ordering for Amazing Binz. He says he buys his inventory through direct relationships with people at warehouses, not through auction sites, where the prices are often higher. Ahmed tells me the average truckload costs about $16,000, and will contain thousands of individual pieces. The key is to keep the cost per item at around $2, and to get a mix of higher- and lower-value items so they balance each other out. Most bin stores do a hybrid model, where they sell higher-quality stuff on the side at prices above $10. Amazing Binz calls it the VIP section. With this week’s Target haul, I assumed that the nicer items would end up there. But no, the owners priced most of it at $10, hoping the allure of a huge discount on a big-ticket item draws people in and gets them to spend more. This is the bin-store promise: teasing the chance to find Oura rings and AirPods for just $10. Once, while I talked to Ahmed, a neighbor walked by and waved. “She got those Beats headphones here,” he says. “Ten dollars. She was so happy.” But the price flattening works in both directions, I realize on a $6 Sunday. A friend is shopping for a mermaid-themed bachelorette party, and we find plenty: That previously mentioned garland of penises is still here (two, actually), as well as a sheet of mermaid stickers and a curly straw that spells "BRIDE." The problem is that $6 is too expensive for a straw, especially a straw that I know has been here for three weeks, at least. This is one effect of the bin store: There’s plenty of legitimately good stuff, at good prices, but that usually gets snapped up in the first few days. Anything that remains through the whole pricing cycle and back again is revealed to be worth nothing at all. My friend, digging for penis straws, says maybe it’s good to see. We have to confront this stuff. This is the cost of our collective Amazon addiction. There are times when the bin store does feel like an art installation, a message, or a warning. Wander through it for a few days and you will start to feel like you are in a room in a haunted house, one where the corporeal forms of the world economy’s least-wanted products are trapped, unable to move on. With or without Amazing Binz, all of this stuff is just out there, already made. A lot of it is useful but excessive, rendered obsolete by an overheated economy. Shopping here can feel a bit like fighting the last, losing battle of reverse logistics. What can still be made useful enough to be kept out of the landfill, just a little longer? It’s a slow day at Amazing Binz, again. This week has been big on gloomy weather, and low on foot traffic. I find a Trump 2024 Punisher logo drink koozie in the pile. These have been popping up in the bins since that first Amazon haul, along with MAGA and Let’s Go Brandon flags. Every time a customer points one out to the owners, they throw it away. A woman approaches the counter with a pair of leopard-print flats, but the two shoes are connected by a stretchy white loop of elastic that’s gotten tangled up with at least five other pairs’ elastic, creating an unholy rats nest of shoes that she needs help untangling. On slower days, it’s hard not to wonder how long Amazing Binz will last. Philadelphia may be behind the times. In the rest of the country, the bin-store bubble has started to burst. On YouTube, I find a cadre of wholesale and reselling influencers, including a bin-store niche. I watch their videos touting the model, how easy it is to start one, and how to succeed. Then I watch them change their tunes. “Unpopular opinion: Bin stores really suck right now,” declared creator Lindey Glenn in November 2023. She linked to Carlson’s most recent video: “Bin store burnout.” After opening his first store in late 2018, Carlson had a few good years riding high on the novelty of the business model and the glut of unwanted pandemic-era merchandise. But as more bin stores opened, the demand and prices for the same truckloads went up. Colton says that after a while, he was just breaking even on the bins, which at his store, started at a high of only $5. He found other revenue streams, like selling entire pallets to resellers, and sorting out the niche and expensive products to flip on Poshmark or eBay. But the challenges persisted. The bin store is a finely tuned operation. A broker might promise a great haul with new electronics, and then deliver a bunch of dirty and broken returns. A truckload could arrive late, or not at all, leaving owners in the lurch on what should be their most profitable day. These problems are exacerbated in small stores, like Amazing Binz, where it’s hard to store extra merchandise to weather that uncertainty. And the stuff itself creates logistical headaches. Boxes get opened, sometimes from theft, sometimes just from jostling around in the bins. Pieces get lost, trash and detritus build up alongside the unsold products, the difference between them increasingly hard to discern. In fact, when it was time to clear his bins, Carlton would dump all of the unsold inventory mixed with trash back onto a pallet and sell the whole thing for $50, with the caveat that the buyer had to go toss the garbage somewhere else. Carlson saw the writing on the wall. He sold his bin store in 2023. Now he’s focusing on his wholesale business, and opening a side-by-side discount grocery and clothing store, which is where he thinks the secondhand retail trends are headed. The Reverse Logistics Association has also seen a decline in bin-store fortunes. Roberson says they lost a few bin-store members because of bankruptcy. After the pandemic, “it was getting more difficult to buy up that excess inventory because there really wasn't excess inventory.” But economic shocks are good for the secondhand economy. Roberson thinks tariffs could, eventually, lead to another bin-store bump. At the start of 2025, she says, many retailers overstocked on inventory again, filling their warehouses to get ahead of price hikes. That could mean they’ll soon be sitting on overstock, especially if consumers decide they’re not willing to pay higher prices. Supply chain disruptions will produce more excess. Already, goods are stalled at ports around the world. Roberson predicts a temporary dip in the fortunes of bin-store owners, as secondhand goods get more expensive along with everything else, and then a resurgence. Carlson agrees. “ I think the secondhand market is going to keep growing because that's the whole reason people are shopping at these stores [to see] if they can save $10. I don't see consumer spending going down for this industry, or even like thrift stores at all. I think that's gonna continuously go up. However, the problem's gonna lie on whoever owns the bin store.” Ahmed seems extremely tired today. He’s barely taken a day off since they opened, not even for Eid. Everything is pretty picked over. The sand art is all gone, the bedding and curtains. There’s just two soccer balls left. I do my customary scan of the bins, from the back of the store to the front. There’s nothing new, just increasingly empty boxes of gel compression elbow sleeves, loose whippit canisters, and batteries rolling across the bottom. According to Ahmed, the cost of pallets is going up. On a recent load of electronics, he paid $12 per item. For the time being, Amazing Binz is just breaking even, but it’s not sustainable. Ahmed says he may have to raise prices, and that he’ll even have to reevaluate the whole business in a few months. “This type of business, it’s not for this neighborhood,” he says. Omran, ever the salesman, is darkly optimistic that they can keep prices low. "Anything to save the community some money,” he says. "We're not looking to get rich. Being rich is pointless nowadays. It's about, how can you survive? How can I feed my kids? How can we pay our bills?” I’m reminded of a conversation I had with the truck driver, Nick, who dropped off the Target load. He used to drive a taxi, until Uber ruined that. He prefers truck driving, but it was better at the height of the pandemic, when everyone was shopping online. Around that time, Nick’s wife was a third-party seller on Amazon. She stocked her inventory based on social media trends, a task complicated by the algorithm. The more she looked at videos of, say, people showing off their Stanley cup accessories, the more TikTok fed her those videos, until it was hard to know if people were actually buying them in the real world, or if she was just in an online feedback loop. Plus, Amazon charges high storage fees, so unsold product just sitting in their warehouse cost her money. She quit, and abandoned her merchandise. That’s where a lot of the stuff in the Amazing Binz came from: failing third-party vendors, looking to offload the detritus of brief and bygone trends. For a second, an image of the 21st century economy seems to come into focus here at the bin store. Nick, his wife, Amazing Binz’s owners, and even me, a freelance journalist, we’re all supposedly free agents, “entrepreneurs,” but in reality, we’re limited to buying whatever gets kicked down the funnel, and flipping it for all it’s worth. It’s like I can see our labor getting discounted by the day. Already, I've asked my editor if I can resell a version of this story elsewhere, to recoup a little more of my Amazing Binz investment. At 6:45 p.m. on Wednesday, a little over an hour until closing time, the shop is packed. Everything is now one dollar. An elderly woman finds a shoe she likes, a black slide with gold studs all over. But it's just one shoe. Ahmed is insisting she buy it, and says he’ll keep the other shoe for her when he finds it. “For a dollar you can’t beat it,” he says. He’s in a good mood, joking with this woman and her daughter. She’s apparently been looking for three days. “Those shoes are really cute,” I tell her. “Do you work here?” she asks. Maybe I’ve been here too long. After days of finding empty boxes, I finally find a loose elbow gel sleeve. It is heavy, slinky, comforting. After this, I find many of them, hiding in the bins like eels. Everything swims around the piles, and I revisit them as old friends, including the unopened boxes, known only by their clipped epithets: “Kiss Me I’m Irish wooden sign with lights,” “Lazy Susan for Refrigerator New.” The Jujube Enucleator box is full one day, and empty the next, without me ever seeing what was inside. The Dick Pics in Nature calendar remains, week after week. Who knows how many times these items have been bought and sold before they arrived here, how many more times they might be bought and sold. I imagine it all ending up in the same places eventually: the landfill or the waterways, where it will exist forever, first as choking hazard, then as nurdle. In the dwindling bins, I find another Trump flag, folded in plastic but unmistakable. Omran says I can have it. I unfurl it, stiff and plasticky, creased into a grid. I don’t want it, but what am I supposed to do? It will end up in the garbage one way or another. I stuff it in my bag. I ask, “How long have you guys been open?” It’s April 16, and Omran says they opened the doors on March 21. “I thought it was more than a month,” says Ahmed. “It’s been a long month,” says Omran. The Trump flag joins a small museum of items I have purchased since the bin store opened: a cat bed ($10), a felted flower garland ($6), four post-Valentine heart-shaped chocolate boxes ($5 for all), two small spring-form pans ($4 each), a large penis-shaped ice cube mold ($4), four bike inner tubes ($2 each), a box of ant traps that don’t work ($2). Did I need any of these things? Maybe the ant traps, if they’d worked, maybe the inner tubes. Mostly, I bought them because they were there, the same way I watch an Instagram reel because it pops up next. The irony is that if I were in the market for new pans or bedding, Amazing Binz would at this point be my best local option. It’s also simultaneously the most fun and most unsettling store on Baltimore Avenue, a combination that I find addictive, as many bin enjoyers do. I take one last lap, back into the farthest corner of the store, where the oldest stuff has accumulated in deep drifts, where the Wokaar lives, now separated from its box. Looking for what? I don’t know. It’s concentrated back here, layers of unwanted product, filtered all the way down the supply chain to this last bin, where it’s piling up like sand. As I stare at the piles, I almost expect them to start breaking down in front of me, each individual item decomposing into a pool of microplastics, what remains of its value finally depleted. I leave the store, and the bins where they are. They’ll be full again tomorrow. If you liked this blog, please share it!

Title: Wall Street Embraces Crypto: 4 IPO Listings In 7 Months

ByTomer Niv ByTomer Niv, Contributor. Illustration of Nasdaq and Bitcoin logos. Circle, the issuer of USD Coin (USDC), debuted on the NYSE today by raising $1.05 billion at $31 per share, valuing the company at roughly $8 billion. The IPO exceeded expectations and was one of the largest crypto-related listings since Coinbase in 2021. It signals a significant shift: crypto firms, especially those dealing in infrastructure or stablecoins, are now being viewed as more “institutionally safe” than speculative assets. Circle’s CEO, Jeremy Allaire emphasized in his X account that going public promotes transparency and trust - essential ingredients for bridging crypto and traditional finance. Crypto related IPOs. Galaxy Digital uplisted to Nasdaq in May 2025. Previously listed in Toronto, the firm made the move to gain greater liquidity and access to U.S. capital. Although it didn’t raise money on the day of its listing, Galaxy soon followed with a secondary offering. The uplisting was seen as a regulatory milestone - Galaxy shifted domicile from the Cayman Islands to Delaware to meet listing requirements. eToro, the Israeli social trading platform, went public the same week. Priced at $52, the stock surged nearly 30% on debut, giving it a ~$5.6 billion valuation. eToro’s pivot to regulatory compliance, such as limiting its U.S. crypto services and settling with the SEC, played a major role in making the IPO viable. Crypto now forms a significant chunk of eToro’s revenue, blurring the line between fintech and crypto-native businesses. Exodus, maker of a self-custody crypto wallet, uplisted to NYSE in late 2024. Though smaller in size (~$800–900 million market cap), its listing marked a step forward for crypto software firms. The move followed the election of President Trump and a more crypto-friendly regulatory tone, signaling a potential shift in how smaller crypto players can access public markets. Yoni and Ronen Assia, co-founders of eToro, after the eToro IPO event outside the Nasdaq in New ... More York. Coinbase’s direct listing in April 2021 was historic. It opened at $381, peaking at $429, and ended the day with a valuation around $85 billion. The listing legitimized crypto on Wall Street and established a blueprint for future IPOs. Today, Coinbase has gained further credibility by entering the S&P 500 index in 2025. Robinhood, though not crypto-native, made its mark in July 2021. The IPO raised $2 billion at a $32 billion valuation. Robinhood’s significant crypto trading volumes made it a proxy for retail crypto enthusiasm. Its listing reinforced the narrative that consumer fintechs with crypto exposure could thrive in public markets. Brian Armstrong, co-founder and CEO of Coinbase. Companies like Marathon, Riot, and Strategy (formelly known as MicroStrategy) went public before they were crypto-linked: Marathon and Riot pivoted to Bitcoin mining from totally different businesses (patents and biotech) and reached $4-5 billion market caps during bull cycles. Strategy, originally an analytics software company, became a de facto Bitcoin ETF, amassing over 568,000 BTC and reaching a $25 billion valuation. These firms illustrate how legacy businesses have transformed into crypto leaders, even if their IPOs predated the sector’s rise. Michael Saylor, co-founder and CEO of Strategy. Several crypto companies are considered strong IPO candidates: ConsenSys (developer of MetaMask and other Ethereum developer tools) is viewed as nearly IPO-ready, with a $7 billiob valuation and ongoing internal preparations. It could become the first pure-play blockchain infrastructure listing. Ledger, the hardware wallet maker, is likely to IPO on Euronext or a U.S. exchange. With $500+ million in funding and strong global brand recognition, it could appeal to security-conscious investors. Fireblocks, an institutional custody provider, is valued at $8 billion. While in no rush to go public, it has been hiring C-suite leaders in preparation. Chainalysis, the blockchain intelligence and analytics firm, is a key compliance partner to governments and businesses. Leadership changes and new board members hint at IPO readiness. Kraken may be the next major U.S. exchange to list. It’s been expanding globally and acquiring traditional trading platforms like NinjaTrader. Revolut, while not crypto-native, is seen as a possible candidate for IPO. With its massive user base and crypto integration, it would highlight the fintech-crypto convergence. 1. Maturing Crypto Businesses: Firms like Circle and Coinbase now resemble traditional fintechs - with compliance teams, revenue transparency, and risk management. This appeals to public investors seeking durable growth. 2. Regulatory Shift: Under the Trump administration, the U.S. has signaled a more crypto-friendly stance. The SEC’s softer tone (e.g. approving spot Bitcoin ETFs and dismissing many lawsuits against crypto companies) and moves toward stablecoin legislation reduce uncertainty for would-be public companies. 3. Institutional Buy-In: Heavyweights like BlackRock, Visa, and Fidelity are not only backing crypto firms, taking part in their IPOs, but also launching crypto-related services. Their involvement lends legitimacy and opens doors for broader investment. 4. Better Investor Protections: Public listings require disclosures and financial oversight, giving both retail and institutional investors greater confidence. 2025 is emerging as a watershed year in which crypto and traditional finance begin to truly converge. What was once considered a fringe sector defined by volatility and skepticism is now producing companies that are not only IPO-ready, but in some cases are joining the ranks of the S&P 500. Crypto-native firms like Circle, Galaxy Digital, eToro, and Exodus have all gone public over the past year, signaling that digital asset businesses are entering the financial mainstream. They join earlier listings from Coinbase and Robinhood, which helped lay the groundwork for what is now a rapidly expanding category of “crypto stocks.” For investors, this shift presents a broader and more diversified opportunity set. The market now includes publicly traded exchanges, self-custody wallets, institutional infrastructure providers, and fintech apps with integrated crypto trading and staking features. This diversity reflects a maturing industry that is increasingly defined not by speculative trading, but by real business models and long-term strategic vision. Importantly, the move into public markets also brings greater accountability. Listed companies must meet higher standards for financial reporting, compliance, and governance - which in turn makes them more attractive to institutional capital. While significant risks remain, including regulatory fragmentation across jurisdictions and persistent market volatility, the underlying foundation of the crypto sector is stronger than ever. Going public enables these companies to access capital and scale responsibly, under the watchful eye of both regulators and public shareholders. In short, crypto’s entrance into public equity markets marks a pivotal step toward institutional credibility, market discipline, and sustainable growth.

Highlights Crypto culture is diverse and tribal, with distinct archetypes like bitcoin maximalists, builders, degens, yield farmers, OG HODLers and now institutional players — each with unique ideologies, goals and influence on the ecosystem. Builders and degens shape innovation and speculation, where builders focus on long-term infrastructure and user experience, while degens embrace high-risk, fast-paced strategies like yield farming and meme coin trading. Institutional adoption is legitimizing crypto, with major firms and banks entering the space — shifting the balance of power but raising concerns over regulation, centralization and the original ethos of decentralization. The cryptocurrency landscape can be tribal, full of vibrant archetypes that each hold distinct ideologies and goals.

Δ From bitcoin maxis to degens and yield farmers, even OG HODLers, the crypto space isn’t just pure technology. To its most diehard supporters, the industry represents a powder keg of culture, ideology and economics, all crashing into each other on-chain. For traditional players, understanding how different factions describe themselves can serve as a way to understand what they are looking to get out of, or build into, at the intersection of finance and blockchain. The bitcoin maximalist is one of the more recognizable personas dominating the crypto sphere. To maxis, bitcoin isn’t just the first cryptocurrency. It’s the only one that matters. They can be found pushing things like strategic bitcoin reserves and telling anyone who will listen that the value of bitcoin will one day reach the millions. These bitcoin maxis, who can frequently refer to themselves as being “orange-pilled,” were once on the fringe. But they are becoming more mainstream as crypto itself becomes more embraced across the financial landscape. Dozens of companies, following the lead of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), have now launched corporate bitcoin treasuries, turning their businesses, in essence, into a financial bet on the digital currency’s future value. In April, a new company formed by Cantor Fitzgerald, Tether Holdings SA and SoftBank Group, Twenty One Capital, aimed to become one of the largest public holders of bitcoin by deploying billions of dollars to stockpile the digital asset. Meanwhile, J.P. Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said May 19 that the bank now offers its clients access to bitcoin. The bank announced Wednesday (June 4) plans to offer financing to clients using spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) such as BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as collateral. “I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke,” Dimon said in May. “I defend your right to buy bitcoin.” Read also: Are Crypto Markets Going Mainstream?

These are the developers, engineers and entrepreneurs deploying smart contracts, creating payment networks, and launching Layer 2 solutions. They are often chain-agnostic and driven by a hacker ethos of permissionless innovation. “The biggest problem in crypto is not adoption, it’s the user experience,” Mesh CEO and co-founder Bam Azizi told PYMNTS last month. “You need to make payments so simple that even a grandmother will use it one day, maybe without even knowing that the mechanism behind the scenes is a stablecoin … to do that, you need to do a lot of heavy lifting.” That’s where the builders come in. They can be dismissive of the hype cycles (and market collapses) but are invested in shipping products that work and bring blockchain closer to institutional-grade architecture. “Banks are in the state where they are thinking about blockchains as public infrastructure that they need to rely on,” Chainalysis co-founder and CEO Jonathan Levin told PYMNTS in April. “Back in 2014 … cryptocurrency only meant blockchains that had native cryptocurrency tokens. Today, people are putting all types of financial instruments on the blockchain.” Degens represent the risk-tolerant end of the spectrum. They are the high-flying crypto market traders, found on exchanges like Binance and formerly FTX. For them, crypto is a game of high-stakes strategy. Yield farming, airdrop hunting, meme coin speculation — these activities aren’t just profit-driven, they’re cultural rituals. Degens are all about tokenizing everything onto the blockchain and then trading or building financial products with it. To gain their favor (and investment fees), the marketplace is responding. Crypto exchange Kraken is planning to offer tokenized versions of more than 50 stocks, called xStocks, including names like Apple, Tesla and Nvidia, along with exchange-traded funds (ETFs), showing that blockchain is increasingly maturing beyond its earlier history. Kraken’s xStocks aren’t targeting American day traders or Wall Street veterans. Instead, they’re aimed at retail investors in emerging and underserved markets. But as crypto market regulation starts to shape up in the United States, what might happen next could be anyone’s guess. Yield farmers are similar in that these individuals or entities are seeking to maximize their returns by strategically moving their crypto assets across different decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Yield farming is essentially the act of putting crypto assets to work to earn passive income, often in the form of interest, rewards or tokens. Yield farmers seek out platforms offering the highest annual percentage yield. They may switch protocols frequently, sometimes daily or hourly, in pursuit of better returns. See also: The CFO and Treasurer’s Guide to Digital Assets The OG HODLers are the original gangsters of crypto, so to speak. These are the individuals who bought in early, weathered the Mt. Gox collapse, and held through multiple bear markets. To them, crypto is not a career or a play-to-earn game. It’s a multi-decade revolution, and OGs often sit on holdings and prefer cold wallets to constant engagement. Some may argue this tribalism is holding the industry back, creating echo chambers and slowing down consensus on technical standards. Others believe it’s a feature, not a bug, the sign of a healthy, pluralistic ecosystem. As crypto matures, the stakes get higher. Governments are crafting regulations, institutional money is flowing in, and technological standards are being codified. In this landscape, who gets to speak for crypto? Who sets the rules? Who gets funded? New archetypes are also entering the arena, such as crypto corporates. Once derided, institutional players are now a dominant force. Whether it’s BlackRock pushing Bitcoin ETFs, Visa integrating stablecoins, or Coinbase going public, corporate involvement is legitimizing crypto in the eyes of regulators and traditional investors. However, many experts worry that this comes at the cost of KYC, surveillance and centralization. Still, the capital and stability these entities provide are reshaping the competitive landscape. And their regulatory capabilities are helping shape the future.

Title: Switch 2 Stock Tracker: Select In-Store Availability, Online Target Restock Tomorrow
URL: https://www.cnet.com/deals/nintendo-switch-2-restock-tracker/
Time Published: 2025-06-05T15:19:00Z
Full Content:
Nintendo's highly anticipated handheld is out now, and we're keeping a close eye on retailers to help you get your hands on one. Our expert deal-hunting staff showcases the best price drops and discounts from reputable sellers daily. If you make a purchase using our links, CNET may earn a commission. After months of anticipation, Nintendo's brand-new Nintendo Switch 2 is (technically) available now. As anticipated, the consoles are flying off shelves faster than retailers can stock them, so it'll be a bit of a challenge if you're hoping to get your hands on one anytime soon. That being said, challenging doesn't mean impossible, and CNET is here to help give you the best chance of success. Our dedicated shopping team is scouring the web for any availability -- whether it's online or in-store -- and bringing you all the latest updates. We've rounded up everything you need to know about current stocks below, and we'll continue to update this page regularly in the coming days, so be sure to check back often. As of right now, Best Buy does not have the Switch 2 available for purchase online, though you may be able to snag one in person at the nearest location. At the moment, the Switch 2 is only available in person at Best Buy. As with the US, Best Buy Canada is only offering in-person availability for the Switch 2 at the moment. Even with the Switch 2's boosted storage, you may want to increase its memory with a microSD card. This Samsung Express microSD is designed specifically for Nintendo's new console and features a unique Mario-inspired design. It costs $60 and can be purchased online. As with other US retailers, the standalone console and Mario Kart World bundle are currently sold out online at GameStop. A limited supply was available for purchase at the midnight release, so you may be able to find one in-store if you're lucky, but chances are pretty slim. Like all other retailers, GameStop is currently sold out online. The Switch 2 console is also sold out at GameStop Canada. If we do see some restocks here, it's important to note that orders are limited to one Switch 2 per household. After last night's restocks, the Switch 2 is now sold out online at Walmart. The retailer also had some in-person availability for a midnight release, and while it's likely sold out just about everywhere, you can check if any nearby stores have it in stock. The Switch 2 is now sold out online at Walmart and most in-store locations. Just like the US, Walmart Canada is now completely sold out online. Note that an unverified third-party retailer is selling the standalone console for an outrageously inflated price, but we definitely recommend avoiding this. Target is offering in-person shopping today, and if you're lucky, you may be able to find it in stock near you. You can check online to see if any nearby stores have availability, but note that you can't order it for pickup. Target has also staggered its release and will offer online availability tomorrow. However, there aren't any times yet, so set your alarm for midnight ET just to be safe. You can shop the console in-store now, with an online restock set to go live tomorrow. Even with the Switch 2's boosted storage, you may be looking to increase its memory with a microSD card. This Samsung Express microSD is designed specifically for Nintendo's new console and even features a unique Mario-inspired design. As of now, Newegg is still sold out of both versions of the console, and it's unclear when the next restock will be. Though it's worth noting that Newegg is slightly less popular than major retailers like Walmart or Target, which could give you a better chance of securing an order during any future restocks, so keep an eye out. Both the standalone console and Mario Kart World bundle are currently sold out. This compact camera costs $55 and plugs directly into the Switch 2 console or dock's USB-C port. It allows you to chat with friends or access in-game features for select titles. The camera has a wide-angle lens, which you can adjust to keep yourself in frame easily. It also automatically adjusts its brightness so your face is always visible. To help combat scalpers, Nintendo requires you to have an invitation to purchase the Switch 2, with priority being given to Nintendo Switch Online members who've had a paid membership for at least 12 months and have had a minimum of 50 total gameplay hours as of April 2. These invitations are first come, first served and will be valid for 72 hours. You can still register now if you haven't already. As with its preorders, you'll have to register and receive an invitation to purchase the Switch 2 directly from Nintendo. You can register your interest for either console, but you have to log in to do so. Just like US shoppers, Canadian gamers will have to register and then wait to receive an invitation to purchase the Switch 2 directly from Nintendo. As with the Switch 2 console, accessories like the $85 Pro Controller will require you to register for an invitation if you want to order one directly from Nintendo. The Switch 2 is not available for purchase at Amazon in the US, but Canadian shoppers can request an invite for either the standalone console or the Mario Kart World bundle. As of now, the Switch 2 is still not available at Amazon in the US, and there's no information about whether or when that will change. Canadian shoppers can request an invite if they're hoping to grab either the standalone console or the Mario Kart World bundle at Amazon. Costco is one of the only retailers with online availability right now, but you'll need to be a member to grab one of these consoles. Act fast if you don't want to miss out. Costco has a unique Switch 2 bundle available. It includes the console and Mario Kart World, as well as a 12-month Nintendo Switch Online membership and upgrade packs for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom. Several Staples stores around the country have the Switch 2 available for purchase in-store. You can check the list of participating locations here, but note that this does not reflect current availability. Staples has a limited supply of Switch 2 consoles available for purchase in person. Please note that not all locations are participating, and orders are limited to one per person. UK shoppers are in luck if they're hoping to grab the Switch 2 right now. A handful of online retailers -- including Amazon, Argos and Very -- currently have one or both versions of the console available for purchase online. However, we don't expect that to remain true for long, so we'd recommend getting your order in as fast as possible if you don't want to miss out. Note: We have no confirmation that the digital download code for Mario Kart World in the UK Switch 2 bundle will work with non-UK Nintendo accounts. The power cables are also different for each region. If you plan to buy a UK Switch 2 from outside the country, please know there's no guarantee it'll work as expected. Both the Switch 2 and the Mario Kart World bundle are in stock now at Amazon UK (at the time of publishing), but you'll have to be quick if you want to grab one before they're sold out. Unlike the US and Canada, UK shoppers don't need an invitation to purchase the Switch 2 directly from Nintendo. You will, however, need a paid Nintendo Online Membership. Games and accessories are also available now. Both versions of the console are currently sold out. Both the standalone console and Mario Kart World bundle are in stock right now. ShopTo has the Switch 2 available for "backorder," though we're somewhat wary as there's no way of knowing when you'll actually receive the console. The standalone console is currently in stock, but the Mario Kart World bundle has sold out. Both versions of the console are currently available online but are sold out in-store. The basic console and Mario Kart World bundle are now sold out, but a handful of console and accessory bundles are in stock. Both versions are now sold out online. Only the standalone console is currently available, but you'll also find plenty of games and accessories in stock. There's no joy for Nintendo fans at The Game Collection right now, with listings for the Switch 2 console and the Mario Kart World bundle showing as out of stock. The Switch 2 is officially available now, though you'll likely have a challenging time getting your hands on one. The vast majority of retailers are currently sold out online, and while there may be some stragglers available for purchase in-store it will ultimately depend on where you're located. We'll be keeping a close eye on stocks as they fluctuate in the coming days, so be sure to check this page often for the latest on availability. Read more: How Nintendo Is Combating Switch 2 Scalpers There was some concern that the new US tariffs were going to lead to some significant price hikes on the standalone console and the Mario Kart World bundle. Fortunately, Nintendo has confirmed that the original pricing still stands. The console is available for $450, with the Mario Kart World bundle priced at $500. However, there has been a change to the price of some accessories, with some increasing by $5. For the new Switch 2, Nintendo has ditched the colored Joy-Cons for a more sleek, monochrome look -- although there are still pops of red and blue around the analog sticks. As of now, Nintendo hasn't said anything about additional colors. Additionally, it's rumored that Samsung -- which makes the displays for the Switch 2 -- is pushing for an OLED version of the console. The Mario Kart series has been a long-standing tentpole for Nintendo and fans were thrilled to hear that a new title would be accompanying the new console. But the excitement was dampened by the announcement that the new game will come with an increased price tag: $80 for the digital edition or $90 if you want a physical copy. However, you can bundle a digital copy with the console for $500 total, which saves you $30 compared with buying them separately. It's an excellent value if it's a game you're certain you want in your library and likely the only "discount" we'll see on this title for quite some time. Plus, Nintendo recently announced that this bundle will be available only "through fall 2025," which means you'll have a limited chance to take advantage of these savings. There are still some mixed feelings about Nintendo's newest console. While some are happy to see that Nintendo hasn't altered much about the wildly popular original Switch, others feel not enough has changed to justify the $150 price hike -- with CNET gaming expert Scott Stein calling it a console that "feels a lot like an updated version of a system many people already own." The confirmation that the US tariffs won't be leading to any further price increases has helped stifle gamers' exasperation a bit, but many are still unhappy with the fact that select games will be selling for up to $20 more than the standard $60. We're eager to see if most gamers consider the price hikes worth it now that they're finally getting their hands on the new console and games.

Title: Investors Might Need A Waste Bag For Freshpet’s Stock
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/06/05/investors-might-need-a-waste-bag-for-freshpets-stock/
Time Published: 2025-06-05T14:28:00Z
Full Content:
ByDavid Trainer ByDavid Trainer, Contributor. Pet food is displayed in a refrigerated cases at the Freshpet Inc. production facility in Bethlehem, ... More Pennsylvania, U.S., on Monday, Nov. 9, 2015. Freshpet produces the only industrial refrigerated pet food on the market, which is made with only fresh ingredients and eschews preservatives. Sales of premium dog food have surged 45 percent to $10.5 billion in the U.S. since 2009 and now account for more than half of the market. Photographer: Chris Goodney/Bloomberg I originally put Freshpet Inc. (FRPT) in the Danger Zone on February 2, 2022 and most recently reiterated my bearish opinion on the stock in October 17, 2022. Despite falling 45% YTD, I’m here to remind you: this stock remains dangerous. Figure 1: Freshpet Outperformance as a Short From 2/3/22 Through 5/9/25 FRPT Performance as Danger Zone Pick Freshpet has successfully grown its retail presence and increased its total store count (stores that sell Freshpet products) by 380 from the end of 4Q24 to the end of 1Q25. Similarly, the company’s revenue increased 18% YoY in 1Q25, mainly driven by volume gains of 15% and favorable price/mix of 3%. Additionally, Freshpet’s adjusted EBITDA increased from $31 million in 1Q24 to $36 million in 1Q25, though I show below why this metric is misleading. Retail improvements and top-line growth aside, Freshpet’s fundamentals remain in very poor shape. The company missed earnings estimates in its 1Q25 report and lowered full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance to the range of $190-$210 million, compared to prior guidance of “at least $210 million”. Freshpet’s management provides a misleading view of the company’s profitability when it directs investors to its “Adjusted” EBITDA. From 2019 to the TTM, Freshpet’s Adjusted EBITDA improved from $29 million to $167 million, while its GAAP net income rose from -$1 million to $16 million. Over the same time, the company’s economic earnings, the true cash flows of the business, fell from -$11 million to -$88 million. It is a big red flag when the company’s preferred non-GAAP metric is rising while its economic earnings are declining, or even worse, when its GAAP net income gets outpaced as well. The discrepancy between the metrics comes largely from the company removing $8.8 million in non-cash share-based compensation when calculating 1Q25 adjusted EBITDA. For reference, Freshpet’s 1Q25 GAAP net income was -$13 million. The discrepancy should come as no surprise as Freshpet openly admits in earnings releases that “the non-GAAP measures are not and should not be considered an alternative to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures”. Figure 2: Freshpet’s Adjusted EBITDA vs. Net Income vs. Economic Earnings: 2019 – TTM FRPT Misleading Earnings 2019-TTM Freshpet’s total operating expenses, which include cost of goods sold and selling, general, and administrative expenses have remained high for years. For instance, over the last five years, total operating expenses averaged 106% of revenue. More recently, Freshpet’s total operating expenses rose from 96% of revenue in 1Q24 to 104% of revenue in 1Q25. The increase was driven by SG&A expenses rising from 36% of revenue to 44% of revenue over the same time. Considering the company’s high operating costs, it should come as no surprise that Freshpet has been and continues to burn cash. Freshpet’s free cash flow (FCF) has been negative on an annual basis every year in my model (dating back to 2017). On a quarterly basis, Freshpet’s FCF has been negative in 34 of the 36 quarters in my model. The only two quarters with positive FCF occurred in 4Q16 and 2Q18. From 2019 through 1Q25, Freshpet has burned through a cumulative $1.2 billion (29% of enterprise value) in FCF excluding acquisitions. See Figure 3. Figure 3: Freshpet’s Cumulative Free Cash Flow Since 2019 FRPT FCF Burn 2019-1Q25 Despite its cash burn rate, I did not make Freshpet a Zombie Stock because its cash on hand can support its TTM cash burn rate for 34 months (more than the 24 months cut off) from the end of May 2025. Note that Freshpet was a Zombie Stock before Jana Partners, in 4Q22, took a 10% stake in Freshpet and boosted the company’s cash on hand enough to extend its cash burn runway past 24 months. Jana Partners exited its position in Fresphet in 2Q24. Consequently, FRPT is at risk of going back on the Zombie Stock list should its cash burn runway fall below 24 months. Freshpet faces direct competition from both larger companies like Nestle (NSRGY), Mars Inc., General Mills (GIS), Colgate-Palmolive (CL), and Chewy (CHWY), as well as smaller, lesser-known start-ups. Additionally, the company faces heavy competition from private label pet food brands. In the most recently available comparable public data (Mars is privately owned and doesn’t disclose pet business sales every year), the pet food market was dominated by Nestle and Mars. In 2023, Nestle (32%) and Mars (29%) combined to make up 61% of the global pet food market. Hill’s Pet Nutrition (owned by Colgate-Palmolive) General Mills (GIS), The J.M. Smucker Company (SJM), rounded out the top five. Freshpet held just over 1% market share. See Figure 4. Figure 4: Freshpet’s Market Share Compared to Peers FRPT Market Share 2023 Importantly, these companies have significant competitive advantages in the form of larger manufacturing scale, a more extensive distribution network, and other business lines that generate cash to re-invest in the business. If I analyze estimated market share based on Freshpet’s 2024 sales and the estimated pet food market size in 2024, I find that the company holds just 1% of the estimated market. Competitors also include general retailers, such as Walmart (WMT), Costco (COST), and Amazon (AMZN), each of which sell their own private label pet brands. Freshpet not only lags the competition in market share, but also in profitability. Even though Freshpet achieved a record net operating profit after-tax (NOPAT) of $50 million in 2024, profits have fallen to -$10 million in 1Q25, down from $9 million in 1Q24. Similarly, the company’s return on invested capital (ROIC) hit a peak of 4% in 2024, but has fallen to 2% in the TTM ending 1Q25. Per Figure 5, Freshpet has the lowest ROIC and one of the lowest NOPAT margins in the industry. Figure 5: Freshpet’s Profitability Vs. Peers: TTM FRPT Profitability vs. Peers Taking market share in an industry already dominated by larger and more profitable companies will be hard to do, especially considering that Freshpet’s revenue is entirely undiversified or 100% dependent on its pet food sales. Below, I use my reverse discounted cash flow (DCF) model to analyze the future cash flow expectations baked into Freshpet’s stock price. Freshpet’s stock is priced as if it will grow profits at accelerated rates while also taking huge chunks of market share. I also present additional DCF scenarios to highlight the downside risk in the stock if Freshpet fails to achieve these overly optimistic expectations. To justify its current price of ~$80/share, my model shows Freshpet would have to: In this scenario, Freshpet would generate $11.7 billion in sales in 2034, which is 12x its TTM sales, 3x Colgate-Palmolive’s TTM pet food sales, and 5x General Mill’s pet food sales. This scenario also implies Freshpet’s NOPAT would reach $608 million in 2034, compared to the company’s all-time high NOPAT of $50 million and TTM NOPAT of $30 million. The implied sales in this scenario equate to 7% of the forecasted global pet food market in 2034, which is far above the company’s estimated 1% market share in 2024. Furthermore, companies that grow revenue by 20%+ compounded annually for such a long period are “unbelievably rare”, making the expectations in Freshpet’s share price even more unrealistic. If we, instead, assume Freshpet: the stock would be worth $49/share today – a 40% downside to the current price. In this scenario, Freshpet would grow sales to $7.2 billion in 2034, which would be around 8x the company’s TTM sales, 2x Colgate-Palmolive’s TTM pet food sales, and 3x General Mill’s pet food sales. The implied sales in this second scenario would represent 4% of the pet foods market in 2034, which is 4x the company’s market share in 2024. If I instead assume Freshpet: the stock would be worth just $26/share today – a 68% downside to the current price. The implied sales in this scenario would still represent 3% of the projected global pet foods market in 2034. Figure 6 compares Freshpet’s implied future revenue in these scenarios to its historical revenue. For comparison, I include the TTM pet food sales of peers Colgate-Palmolive (CL) and General Mills (GIS). Figure 6: Freshpet’s Historical and Implied Revenue: DCF Valuation Scenarios FRPT DCF Implied NOPAT Scenarios Each of the above scenarios assumes Freshpet grows revenue, NOPAT and FCF without increasing working capital or fixed assets. This assumption is highly unlikely but allows me to create best-case scenarios that highlight the unrealistically high expectations embedded in the current valuation. For reference, Freshpet’s invested capital grew 43% compounded annually from 2019 through the TTM. If I assume Freshpet’s invested capital increases at a similar rate in the DCF scenarios above, the downside risk is even larger. Given that the performance required to justify its current price is overly optimistic, I dig deeper to see if Freshpet is worth buying at any price. The answer is likely no. The company has $477 million in total debt, $42 million in outstanding employee stock options, and just $226 million excess cash. Freshpet has an economic book value, or no-growth value, of <$1/share. In other words, I do not think equity investors will ever see anywhere close to the level of economic earnings required to justify anything more than $1/share under normal operations.

Title: Investors Might Need A Waste Bag For Freshpet’s Stock

ByDavid Trainer ByDavid Trainer, Contributor. Pet food is displayed in a refrigerated cases at the Freshpet Inc. production facility in Bethlehem, ... More Pennsylvania, U.S., on Monday, Nov. 9, 2015. Freshpet produces the only industrial refrigerated pet food on the market, which is made with only fresh ingredients and eschews preservatives. Sales of premium dog food have surged 45 percent to $10.5 billion in the U.S. since 2009 and now account for more than half of the market. Photographer: Chris Goodney/Bloomberg I originally put Freshpet Inc. (FRPT) in the Danger Zone on February 2, 2022 and most recently reiterated my bearish opinion on the stock in October 17, 2022. Despite falling 45% YTD, I’m here to remind you: this stock remains dangerous. Figure 1: Freshpet Outperformance as a Short From 2/3/22 Through 5/9/25 FRPT Performance as Danger Zone Pick Freshpet has successfully grown its retail presence and increased its total store count (stores that sell Freshpet products) by 380 from the end of 4Q24 to the end of 1Q25. Similarly, the company’s revenue increased 18% YoY in 1Q25, mainly driven by volume gains of 15% and favorable price/mix of 3%. Additionally, Freshpet’s adjusted EBITDA increased from $31 million in 1Q24 to $36 million in 1Q25, though I show below why this metric is misleading. Retail improvements and top-line growth aside, Freshpet’s fundamentals remain in very poor shape. The company missed earnings estimates in its 1Q25 report and lowered full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance to the range of $190-$210 million, compared to prior guidance of “at least $210 million”. Freshpet’s management provides a misleading view of the company’s profitability when it directs investors to its “Adjusted” EBITDA. From 2019 to the TTM, Freshpet’s Adjusted EBITDA improved from $29 million to $167 million, while its GAAP net income rose from -$1 million to $16 million. Over the same time, the company’s economic earnings, the true cash flows of the business, fell from -$11 million to -$88 million. It is a big red flag when the company’s preferred non-GAAP metric is rising while its economic earnings are declining, or even worse, when its GAAP net income gets outpaced as well. The discrepancy between the metrics comes largely from the company removing $8.8 million in non-cash share-based compensation when calculating 1Q25 adjusted EBITDA. For reference, Freshpet’s 1Q25 GAAP net income was -$13 million. The discrepancy should come as no surprise as Freshpet openly admits in earnings releases that “the non-GAAP measures are not and should not be considered an alternative to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures”. Figure 2: Freshpet’s Adjusted EBITDA vs. Net Income vs. Economic Earnings: 2019 – TTM FRPT Misleading Earnings 2019-TTM Freshpet’s total operating expenses, which include cost of goods sold and selling, general, and administrative expenses have remained high for years. For instance, over the last five years, total operating expenses averaged 106% of revenue. More recently, Freshpet’s total operating expenses rose from 96% of revenue in 1Q24 to 104% of revenue in 1Q25. The increase was driven by SG&A expenses rising from 36% of revenue to 44% of revenue over the same time. Considering the company’s high operating costs, it should come as no surprise that Freshpet has been and continues to burn cash. Freshpet’s free cash flow (FCF) has been negative on an annual basis every year in my model (dating back to 2017). On a quarterly basis, Freshpet’s FCF has been negative in 34 of the 36 quarters in my model. The only two quarters with positive FCF occurred in 4Q16 and 2Q18. From 2019 through 1Q25, Freshpet has burned through a cumulative $1.2 billion (29% of enterprise value) in FCF excluding acquisitions. See Figure 3. Figure 3: Freshpet’s Cumulative Free Cash Flow Since 2019 FRPT FCF Burn 2019-1Q25 Despite its cash burn rate, I did not make Freshpet a Zombie Stock because its cash on hand can support its TTM cash burn rate for 34 months (more than the 24 months cut off) from the end of May 2025. Note that Freshpet was a Zombie Stock before Jana Partners, in 4Q22, took a 10% stake in Freshpet and boosted the company’s cash on hand enough to extend its cash burn runway past 24 months. Jana Partners exited its position in Fresphet in 2Q24. Consequently, FRPT is at risk of going back on the Zombie Stock list should its cash burn runway fall below 24 months. Freshpet faces direct competition from both larger companies like Nestle (NSRGY), Mars Inc., General Mills (GIS), Colgate-Palmolive (CL), and Chewy (CHWY), as well as smaller, lesser-known start-ups. Additionally, the company faces heavy competition from private label pet food brands. In the most recently available comparable public data (Mars is privately owned and doesn’t disclose pet business sales every year), the pet food market was dominated by Nestle and Mars. In 2023, Nestle (32%) and Mars (29%) combined to make up 61% of the global pet food market. Hill’s Pet Nutrition (owned by Colgate-Palmolive) General Mills (GIS), The J.M. Smucker Company (SJM), rounded out the top five. Freshpet held just over 1% market share. See Figure 4. Figure 4: Freshpet’s Market Share Compared to Peers FRPT Market Share 2023 Importantly, these companies have significant competitive advantages in the form of larger manufacturing scale, a more extensive distribution network, and other business lines that generate cash to re-invest in the business.

Competitors also include general retailers, such as Walmart (WMT), Costco (COST), and Amazon (AMZN), each of which sell their own private label pet brands. Freshpet not only lags the competition in market share, but also in profitability. Even though Freshpet achieved a record net operating profit after-tax (NOPAT) of $50 million in 2024, profits have fallen to -$10 million in 1Q25, down from $9 million in 1Q24. Similarly, the company’s return on invested capital (ROIC) hit a peak of 4% in 2024, but has fallen to 2% in the TTM ending 1Q25. Per Figure 5, Freshpet has the lowest ROIC and one of the lowest NOPAT margins in the industry. Figure 5: Freshpet’s Profitability Vs.

Title: Rise Of The Machines: A Dividend Revolution Yielding Up To 9.7%

ByBrett Owens ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Army of robots. 3D illustration Big companies are about to make even more money. They have discovered they no longer need armies of new hires to grow—extremely bullish news for shareholders because human employees are expensive. Good ones can also be notoriously elusive. For example, I’m the longest-standing member of my kids’ school marketing committee, and we’re always scrambling for volunteers (what non-profit isn’t?). Until now, that is. Over the weekend, we welcomed the most talented marketer I’ve ever worked with to our team: ChatGPT 4.5. “GPT” graciously accepted our volunteer position, and we’re already actively boosting online referrals for the school. I’m learning cutting-edge “AI referral” techniques straight from the entity that invented them. It was the easiest recruitment effort I’ve ever experienced. GPT and I were already collaborating closely to market and sell several software products, so extending our teamwork to the non-profit world was seamless. The same dynamic is quietly playing out at for–profit companies, particularly the tech giants that dominate the cap-weighted S&P 500. A senior executive friend at Meta (META) recently confirmed to me that the company has essentially frozen hiring, pivoting entirely toward AI-driven growth. It already shows in the numbers. Over the past year Meta has increased revenues by 22% while only hiring 10% more people. Sales are growing faster than humans, a trend that I expect to accelerate in the months and years ahead. In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if Meta has already reached peak headcount—which means profits are set to surge even more. And Meta isn’t alone in this “growing without hiring” trend. Alphabet (GOOG) grew revenues by 14% without any net new hires. And Nvidia (NVDA) did grow headcount by 13%, but for good reason—sales exploded by 126%! Microsoft (MSFT) is likewise sailing along without the need for new engineers, with 16% revenue growth on just a 3% headcount increase: Tech Growth The AI adoption at these companies is just beginning. These profit machines are already selling $1 to $2 million in product per employee, but their profits are going to pop as they sell even more without the expense drag of adding new employees! This four-pack packs 20% of the S&P 500 index. When we combine Amazon (AMZN), Tesla (TSLA), Netflix (NFLX) and Apple (AAPL)—four more tech companies that are scaling without hiring—we have 32% of the index. Earlier in the year, I warned that the “tech heaviness” of the S&P 500 was dangerous—and it sure was during the tariff troubles of March and April. But with trade tensions fading and tech profits exploding thanks to lean payrolls, these big 8 companies are now set to power the index higher. Plus, we have a weakening US dollar. Stocks are, of course, priced in dollars. So, a softer dollar is another bullish catalyst for the S&P 500. As income investors, we can tap this rising tide for steady income. To do so, we’ll use covered calls—a strategy where we buy stocks and then sell (“write”) call options to other investors. We earn income now from the option premiums we collect, paid upfront to agree to sell our shares at a higher price later. Market volatility from a tumultuous spring means these options pay generous premiums right now (covered call options pay more when things are bouncing around!). So, this is a good market moment to cash in on leftover fear. I’m talking about dividends up to 9.7% that will benefit from the S&P 500 soaring towards 9000. (Yes, it sounds wild—but with record profits plus a declining dollar, this is a potential price target before the end of Trump 2.0.) Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Global Diversified Equity Income Fund (EXG) yields 9.2% and trades at a 6% discount. That’s a sweet deal because it holds big winners like Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft, then boosts income by selling covered calls on the S&P 500 and international indices. The income from these constantly expiring calls is the key to the EXG’s sky-high “synthetic yield.” The fund collects premiums from option buyers immediately after it writes these calls, generating steady income for shareholders. We can think of this as “renting” out positions to generate extra cash. EXG owns the underlying shares behind the S&P 500. Each month it leases its collection of stocks and collects the option premiums. Rinse and repeat. Nuveen S&P 500 Buy-Write Income Fund (BXMX) pays 8.1% and trades at a 9% discount to its net asset value (NAV)—another good deal because we’re talking Apple and Amazon for 91 cents on the dollar. Finally the Global X S&P 500 Covered Call ETF (XYLD) dishes a 9.7% dividend. It is an ETF, so it trades at par (“fair value”), as most do. XYLD owns the S&P 500 stocks and has also written calls on the S&P 500 that expire later in June. When that happens, the fund will write new calls for July—delivering more tasty income to its investors. Covered Call Funds As sellers of covered calls, they exult in market volatility that delivers high option premiums. Plus, their NAVs have a tailwind—tech profits popping!

U.S. President Donald Trump’s social media company, Truth Social, is wasting no time in trying to launch a spot bitcoin BTC$104,613.63 exchange-traded fund (ETF). Crypto asset manager Yorkville America Digital, who is sponsoring the fund, filed an S-1 document with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday, just two days after filing a 19b-4 document. Typically, issuers upload the S-1, a document used to register an offering of asset-backed securities, first. The listing exchange then files a 19b-4 — necessary to propose a rule change by a self-regulatory organization (SRO), after. But NYSE Arca, an arm of the New York Stock Exchange, uploaded documents before Truth Social filed its own paperwork. While the reasons are unclear, the 19-b4 filing ties the SEC to a strict deadline of 240 days to approve or reject the filing, while the agency doesn’t have to adhere to a deadline when an S-1 is filed. If approved and listed, Trump’s bitcoin ETF would trade under the name Truth Social Bitcoin ETF with its assets being custodied by Foris DAX Trust Company, which also serves as the custodian for Crypto.com’s assets. The fund would join a long list of already existing spot bitcoin ETFs, including from issuers like BlackRock, Grayscale, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, and more. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has become one of the most successful ETF launches in the history of U.S. ETFs, with nearly $70 billion in assets since launch.

Title: Why JPMorgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon Could be the Right Candidate for President
URL: https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/why-jpmorgan-chases-jamie-dimon-could-be-the-right-candidate-for-president
Time Published: 2025-06-05T13:56:57Z
Full Content:
Yale SOM leadership expert Jeffrey Sonnenfeld and co-author Stephen Henriques write that the CEO’s two decades as a pragmatic, stabilizing force make him an attractive alternative. Jamie Dimon at Fox Business Network Studios in New York City in April. This commentary originally appeared in Fortune. The views expressed are the authors’ own. What do the names H. Ross Perot, Lee Iacocca, Bob Iger, Mark Cuban, Mike Bloomberg, Carly Fiorina, Doug Bergum, Andrew Yang, Tom Styer, Herman Cain, and Howard Schultz all have in common? First, they are prominent businesspeople who have either run for office or considered a presidential candidacy. And second, not one of them is JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. In fact, while some of these CEOs have compelling cross-sector leadership qualities and might govern well, Dimon has developed a transcendent national image as the systemic stabilizer of JPMorgan in the 21st century. Dimon made headlines on Friday after a wide-ranging interview with CNBC’s Morgan Brennan at the Reagan National Economic Forum. The JPMorgan CEO has long been known for his provocative candor, but Dimon decided to ratchet it up a notch for the inaugural event, perhaps inspired by the memory of America’s revered 40th president, covering everything from public policy and foreign affairs to financial markets and public office. An emboldened Dimon proceeded to administer a sobering dose of realism about the fragility of U.S. democracy and its capitalist system, as well as the potential policy solutions and sacrifices necessary to actually make America great again. Much of the media attention has focused on his astute warning of “the enemy within” being the biggest threat to the U.S. However, it was the banking chief’s response to Brennan’s last question that conspicuously lingered. Asked “What would be the scenario that you would entertain to consider public service?” Dimon humbly quipped, “If I thought I could really win, which I don’t think I could.” While the question has been asked and shrugged off many times by Dimon, interview listeners were left hopefully wondering if he could really win. Let’s first contrast his business success with the failure of Donald Trump as CEO. Trump played the role of a business tycoon, but Dimon authentically is one. Despite starting his career with half a billion dollars from his dad, Trump has suffered from a more spotted track record in business, which includes four bankruptcies and an enterprise circling the drain many times, until he began monetizing the presidency. As a businessman and financier, Dimon, instead, is in rarefied air. The venerable but underperforming JPMorgan Chase bought Bank One—hemorrhaging after a merger with First Chicago—largely to get Dimon. Even then, in 2006, the first author ran an in-person survey of the leaders of the Financial Services Industry Association as to whom they most admired, and Jamie Dimon came out as their No. 1 choice. Two decades later, JPMorgan stock has risen almost 1,100% since Dimon took the helm in December 2005. As a benchmark for comparison, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF—which tracks the performance of the S&P 500—is about half that. The more relevant S&P Bank ETF (KBE) is nearly flat, up approximately 2.5% over the same two decades. In 1998, Dimon played a significant role, with peers, in catalyzing the collective actions of 14 major banks and brokerages and the New York Federal Reserve to stabilize the financial system with a $3.6 billion capital infusion to support the imploding Long Term Capital fund, which threatened dangerous ripple effects on capital markets. That fund, ironically, had been created a few years earlier by Nobel Prize winners. Such fortitude through adversity was again shown through his turnaround triumph at Chicago’s Bank One a few years later. Similarly, at a Yale CEO Summit in the June of 2007, Dimon presciently warned, “Many risky assets are underpriced and will soon, categorically, across-the-board, be repriced.” Eschewing the simplistic fast-recovery reassurances offered by the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve, he insisted that the collapse of the subprime market would spread beyond real estate to include many derivative financial products, which were inaccurately graded by credit rating agencies, allowing for dangerous hedge fund leveraging. He said that he and his team were going to spend the summer unraveling JPMorgan Chase’s exposure to such risk, adding that laments about needed regulation were “parochial.” But the speculation regarding Dimon is not for another finance job or even the Treasury secretary. As Dimon said last November after Trump’s post-election staffing did not include him in the cabinet, “I’ve not had a boss [other than his board] in 25 years and I am not ready to start now.” So, what would his policy views be as president? Dimon is a long-time Democrat, like Trump was, but unlike Trump, he shows no signs of switching parties for opportunity. He is a self-described moderate in the most traditional sense. Dimon has consistently espoused a political philosophy of social consciousness with fiscal prudence. The ever-pragmatic executive will promote policies embracing smaller, more efficient government, sensible regulations, and speedy permitting processes, then pivot to cutting special tax breaks (including carried interest), doubling the earned income tax credit, investing in public education, defending voting rights, and championing the cultural and economic importance of cities. Dimon has articulated a desperate need for the U.S. to strengthen its defense capabilities while recognizing that strong international security alliances and economic partnerships have been key to the nation’s success. While Dimon has been critical of the Trump administration’s approach to implementing its tariff policy, he acknowledges the need to rebalance some trade relationships and rebuild supply lines, at home and abroad with allies, for goods that could pertain to U.S. national security. To him, China has become a powerful peer that should be respectfully but forcefully engaged, not estranged, in the global economy. With Russia, there is no question who the U.S. should be supporting. In his 2023 annual letter, Dimon cut straight to the point: “Staying on the sidelines during battles of autocracy and democracy, between dictatorship and freedom, is simply not an option for America today. Ukraine is the front line of democracy.” His balance of realism and optimism is a much-needed reset amid a Republican Party that has submissively redefined itself around the MAGA movement and a Democratic Party that has been captured by detached populist policies from the likes of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders. For example, amid contested debates around DEI, instead of capitulating to political or social pressures, Dimon aptly guided JPMorgan Chase through the polarization by maintaining and communicating its long-held corporate policy as one that ensures equal opportunity, not equal outcomes. The bank under his watch has pioneered investments to promote equal opportunity in urban communities across America, most notably in Detroit. Over a decade-plus, JPMorgan Chase has effectively invested more than $200 million into neighborhood revitalization, affordable housing, skills training, small-business growth, and financial literacy as the city emerged from bankruptcy. There was no political or personal motivation for investing in the “Motor City” other than helping the historic city in a time of need. That act of goodwill was echoed by Goldman Sachs, Walmart, Target, and many other corporations that sponsored cities in similar ways. Dimon’s ability to lead through crucial moments that will affect a diverse stakeholder base as large as JPMorgan Chase’s is a rare trait that has defined his career trajectory. He possesses an appealing combination of resilience, confidence, and sharp intellect, with humility and a propensity for listening. He does not insist upon grandiosity and the servile obedience Trump demands of his cabinet’s “Dear Leader” chorus of homage. At one of our CEO summits a decade ago, he opened his comments by sharing his experience of being fired at Citigroup by his boss, Sandy Weill, in part because he was critical of the performance of Weill’s daughter, who was on his team but soon left. Dimon’s reconciliation with Weill was at Dimon’s own initiative. He then saluted his colleagues: “JPMorgan Chase—there’s been a lot of suffering to build this thing. I still travel the world, and they still know David Rockefeller and Dennis Weatherstone. We’ve been doing business with Saudi Aramco for 75 years. What has been built here is unbelievable. This is the result of hundreds of thousands of people working for hundreds of years, way before I got here. My job is to just make this shine a little better than what came before. “I was standing at a session like this, and a woman was giving a talk saying, ‘Leadership, you always have to have one truth teller that will always tell you the truth, always, or else you will get in trouble.’ And I got up and said, if you have ten around you and only one is a truth teller, you should fire the other nine. You can’t survive in any business if that becomes the norm. Corporate headquarters becomes a place where the people feel like they’re the enemy. If I were ever going to write a book, it would be about the disease of corporate headquarters.” The renowned banker has leaned on those qualities to lead the organization through multiple crises, including financial disasters, recessions, scandals, pandemics, and many political emergencies. He is willing to publicly admit mistakes, as he did with the London Whale trading debacle of 2012. Despite warning about the impending doom because of poor lending practices for subprime mortgages at banks in 2006 and 2007, Dimon did not go around telling everyone, “I told you so.” Instead, he quickly jumped into action, ready to support political leaders, regulators, his bank peers, financial markets, and the public. Similarly, in one notable exchange between House Banking chair Maxine Waters and major bank CEOs who benefited from TARP bailout money, she asked them if they increased credit availability to customers. Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis mocked the way she asked her question due to some wrong terminology—hence winning the battle but losing the war. When Dimon followed, he congratulated Waters on a good question, correcting her terminology for accuracy, and then said his own bank, if held to the standards she set, was not doing as well as it should. Dimon’s natural desire to tell the truth, no matter the consequences, is another rare quality found only in the best leaders. He has condemned the financial industry when necessary, calling out the excesses of private capital and the inequality of the carried interest tax carveout, for instance. He has publicly expressed disapproval of political leaders from both parties, whether that be the folly of not engaging with the private sector or the misdirected efforts of establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve. JPMorgan’s employees have not been spared criticism either. In a leaked audio recording gone viral, listeners can hear the chief executive berating those staff members whining about the bank’s return-to-office policy. While the Democrats have no shortage of policies, they are desperate for a unifying leader at the top. Many of the frontrunners are exemplary, but the case for Dimon outshines them all. Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders have been drawing huge crowds around the nation in their Fighting Oligarchy tour, filled by those outraged by the Trump administration’s domestic and international policies, prompting some to speculate about a 2028 presidential bid by one or both. However, their populist anti-business message electrifies a vocal but narrow base of the party, and their populism does not match the broader public sentiment. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is the first African American to hold his post, and his chances to seize the House Speaker job have quelled speculation he might run for president. The eloquent congressman Ro Khanna has a bright future as a “pro-capitalist progressive,” intriguing many. Maryland Governor Wes Moore has inspired many by his strong performance and forceful rhetoric. However, both are still early in their respective leadership positions, especially compared to Dimon. California Governor Gavin Newsom would present a formidable opponent with his long tenure at the helm of the Golden State, but he’s had hiccups, such as mismanaging the government response to COVID-19 and the wildfire disasters. Perhaps Dimon could preempt such rivals by enlisting them for cabinet roles or as running mates or by complementing his business leadership with other distinguished public officials, such as Governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan or former police chief and congresswoman Val Demings of Florida, as partners to share the ticket. Regardless, none of the expected candidates seems to inspire voters. A new CNN/Gallup poll shows general low public regard for Democratic political leaders, with only 16% seeing the Democrats as the party with strong leaders, while 40% see Republicans as the party of strong leaders. Similarly, 36% of the American public sees Republicans as the party able to get things done while Democrats are seen as effective by only 19%. This suggests a business leader with a strong track record would be a welcomed fresh alternative to Democratic voters. Of course, there may be practical reasons for Dimon to decide against a presidential bid in 2028, but even the best candidates with years of political experience carefully consider running for higher office. It is, after all, called “public service” for a reason. The costs, though, are far outweighed by the benefits that the banking executive would bring to Washington, D.C. Some may say, if Dimon lost an election, he risks prematurely concluding his soaring career on a downbeat note. But he is not unfamiliar with leading a comeback. In 1998, Dimon was fired from Citigroup, but instead of ignoring the issue, he often openly discusses how that moment developed his personal and professional resilience. Look where it led him. Others may say Democratic socialists or populists who label themselves as self-styled “progressives” will never accept him. That might not be all bad. Progressives have opportunistically derailed the Democratic Party with 1930s cliches, falsely conflating oligarchs and corrupt individuals with the average businessperson and wrongly focusing the 2024 presidential campaign on corporate greed as the source of inflation when there simply were not soaring profits as alleged. Grocery stores then and now were lucky to get a 1% to 2% profit margin, lower than almost any major nonprofit in the nation. Inflation was due to lingering post-pandemic supply chain snags, bird flu killing a third of the nation’s egg-laying hens, and Fed rate hikes that put mortgages out of reach for many. Progressives may also complain about Dimon’s criticism of some financial regulatory bodies, such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the brainchild of Senator Elizabeth Warren. While its checkered performance had some successes, it also missed many big problems, like the collapse of regional banks and the massive scandal at Wells Fargo. Dimon has argued that some regulations are redundant or harmful, with the CFPB overstepping its authority, colliding with 11 other financial regulatory agencies, and increasing opportunities for consumer data privacy breaches and fraud. While he has called for agency consolidation, he is not opposed to needed financial regulation and has called knee-jerk anti-regulation critics “parochial” at industry gripe fests, and he’s suggested sharply reducing regulation would create great risks for capital markets. Similarly, last week, he derided as “greedy” those self-interested financiers who wanted to protect their carried interest gains from taxation and mocked the calls for strategic Bitcoin reserve stockpiling, calling for a stockpiling of the nation’s military weapons instead. Inexperience with campaigning may be another critique cast against Dimon. He has never run for public office, arduously stumping cross-country to court the favor of key constituencies and powerful figures. Yet that could be a strength, not a weakness, as he would not be beholden to anyone. His campaign could be free to focus on the merits of the issues with a fresh track record that voters can more easily assess on their own. Would-be critics may say he frequently accuses the government of excess bureaucracy, like President Trump and Elon Musk. However, so does most of the voting public. President Bill Clinton oversaw a government efficiency initiative more than two decades ago that was more responsible and effective than the vindictive, reckless, and ineffective dismantling under the current administration. Some critics will correctly point out that Dimon failed to be in the vanguard of CEOs who spoke out against Trump’s various abuses of office in his first term. In August 2017, Dimon was not among the group of CEOs—including from Merck, Walmart, AT&T, UPS, PepsiCo, Cisco, IBM, GM, BlackRock, and Campbell Soup—who led the stampede of exits from Trump’s business advisory councils, but he was in surgery at the time. Similarly, Dimon did not join the wave of CEOs who boldly spoke out in unison following Trump’s efforts to undermine the 2020 presidential election. That collective voice was the first set of civic leaders to confirm the truth of the certified results and helped defuse the constitutional crisis Trump attempted to create. We helped to catalyze these initiatives, and Dimon’s absence was a disappointment to many. However, Dimon never spoke out against such effective collective action by the CEO community nor supported Trump’s illegal power assertions. Furthermore, some argue that by keeping his powder dry, he preserved his authority to openly challenge other ineffective, controversial Trump policies regarding trade, tariffs, diplomacy, and national security. He recently admonished Trump that standing on the sidelines of Ukraine’s battle for self-defense against the Russian invasion was not an option with Europe and many democratic sovereign nations endangered. He warned that the president’s attack on allies was driving them toward China, saying the “America First” policy may end up as “America alone.” Finally, political pundits may say he essentially endorsed Trump in January 2024 at Davos, referencing an interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box. Live on air, Dimon praised the then-former president, saying: “[Trump] was kind of right about NATO…immigration…grew the economy quite well…tax reform worked…he was right about some of China…that’s why they voted for him.” Dimon later defended his comments, acknowledging he should have been more careful about his words while reiterating 74 million people did vote for Trump in 2020. It may seem foreign in politics to praise the achievements of the other party, but Dimon is not, and would not be, a contemporary politician, nor does he trade insults with adversaries, as he respects rivals. Decrying the politics of vilification, he would likely govern on a bipartisan basis in the best interest of America. Dimon offers the Democratic Party a chance to recapture Reagan and Bush Democrats, and even some Republicans. Democrats need to learn what Donald Trump realized in 2016. That is, Americans do not hate business success but admire it as long as it is not won through cheating the system. Rather than resenting success as Marx predicted, Americans—as Thorsten Veblen’s “Theory of the Leisure Class” laid out in 1899—seek to emulate the successful. Trump ignites that desire for success and the belief in a fluid American class structure. Dimon could be just the leader to restore domestic faith in responsible capitalism, global partnerships, and balanced trade. Given recent candidate profiles, perhaps the lingering question is whether Dimon, now 69 years old, is too young to run.

Title: Time To Buy AMZN Stock?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. A view of the Amazon warehouse in Pawlikowice, Poland on May 29, 2025. (Photo by Jakub ... More Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is really leaning into AI, recently announcing a massive $10 billion investment in new data centers in North Carolina. Like Google and Microsoft, Amazon has been a major player in the AI boom, spending a whopping $222 billion on capital expenditures since 2022. The stock has seen a nice jump lately, climbing 24% from around $167 on April 21 to $208 now. This rally seems to be fueled by the broader market’s positive reaction to new trade deals and a pause on reciprocal tariffs between the U.S. and China. The probability of the U.S. economy going into a recession this year has also come down from 60% earlier to 40% now, according to J.P. Morgan Research. Given the change in overall market sentiment, you might be wondering if Amazon is still a smart investment after its recent climb. We believe it is. Even with the recent rally, Amazon shows strong operational growth and solid financial health, and its stock isn't overpriced. Our analysis dives deep into Amazon’s investment potential by looking at its current valuation compared to its recent operating performance and overall financial health. We’ve assessed Amazon across key areas like Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience. Our findings show that Amazon has a strong operating performance and financial condition. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – RGTI Stock: What’s Next After An 1,100% Rally? When we look at AMZN stock against the broader market, it seems pretty reasonable. Amazon’s price-to-sales ratio is 3.4 times, which is pretty close to the S&P 500’s 3.0 times. Its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 33.3 times is higher than the market’s 26.4 times, but its price-to-free cash flow ratio is 19.3 times, which is slightly better than the S&P 500’s 20.5 times. This means Amazon is doing a good job generating cash compared to its price. Check out our dashboard on Amazon’s Valuation Ratios for more details. This moderate valuation suggests that Amazon isn't really getting a premium for its growth potential right now. It's likely that those high capital expenditures we mentioned earlier have made some investors a bit nervous. While that higher P/E ratio signals that the market expects Amazon's earnings to keep growing, it also means the stock could be vulnerable if that growth slows down. However, it's worth noting that this 33x P/E is actually lower than Amazon's average P/E of 46x over the past two years. Amazon’s revenue just keeps climbing, showing how good they are at expanding across all their different businesses. Over the last three years, their annual revenue has grown by an average of 11%, much better than the S&P 500’s 5.5%. This strong performance continued in the past year, with revenues jumping 10.1% from $591 billion to $650 billion. Looking at their most recent quarterly results, things are still looking good. Revenues grew 8.6% to $156 billion compared to $143 billion in the same period last year. This consistent growth, whether we're looking at annual or quarterly numbers, really highlights how Amazon's diverse business model keeps them expanding, even as they get bigger and bigger. While Amazon’s revenues are trending higher, its profitability tells a slightly different story, and it might explain why some investors are a bit hesitant. For instance, their operating margin is 11.0%, which is a bit lower than the S&P 500's average of 13.2%. This suggests they're facing some challenges in turning all that revenue into efficient operations. Similarly, Amazon's net income margin of 10.1% also lags behind the broader market's 11.6% average. However, Amazon’s operating cash flow margin is 17.5%, actually beating the S&P 500’s 14.9%. This means they’re doing a great job at generating cash, even if their accounting profits seem lower. This difference often comes down to Amazon’s huge investments in growth and infrastructure. These investments might hit the company’s short-term profit margins, but they’re setting it up for bigger growth down the road. Amazon’s balance sheet is incredibly strong, giving them a really solid base to handle any economic bumps in the road. The company’s debt-to-equity ratio is super low at just 6.1%, which is way better than the S&P 500’s average of 19.9%. This conservative approach means Amazon has tons of financial wiggle room for big investments. They’re also sitting on a good amount of cash. Cash and cash equivalents make up 14.7% of their total assets, slightly more than the broader market’s 13.8%. With $95 billion in cash and $643 billion in total assets, Amazon has serious resources to chase new growth opportunities and ride out any tough times. Looking back at how Amazon's stock performed during past market downturns gives us some good insights. It shows they can be pretty resilient, but also quite volatile. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Amazon actually held up pretty well. Their stock only dropped 22.7% compared to the S&P 500's 33.9% plunge, and it bounced back to pre-crisis levels in just two months. However, things were a bit different during the 2022 inflation shock. Amazon's stock took a bigger hit, falling 56.1% while the market dropped 25.4%. It took almost two years for the stock to fully recover, which just goes to show how growth stocks can feel more pain when interest rates go up and valuations get squeezed. The 2008 financial crisis presented similar challenges, with Amazon declining 65.3% against the market's 56.8% drop, though it also recovered within two years. These patterns suggest that while Amazon tends to swing more during severe market stress, it typically has the underlying strength to bounce back over time. We believe Amazon is an attractive investment right now. It offers a good valuation combined with incredibly strong fundamentals and a solid financial position. The company is delivering double-digit revenue growth and boasts a fortress-like balance sheet. These strengths outweigh any minor concerns about profitability. Notably, Amazon’s AWS segment is far more profitable, boasting estimated EBITDA margins of around 45% last year, than its other businesses, which have EBITDA margins under 15%. With AWS's contribution to the company's overall sales on the rise—up from 12% in 2021 to 17% last year—the overall profitability will also improve. Furthermore, with a proven ability to recover from downturns, Amazon provides an excellent entry point into the long-term growth trends of the ongoing AI boom. It’s a strong addition for growth-oriented portfolios. However, it’s important to consider the potential risks. Amazon’s growth could slow down, and it might underperform during times of economic uncertainty. There’s also the question of whether its significant investments in AI will pay off. You should definitely weigh these risks. Not too happy about the volatile nature of AMZN stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Symbiotic Releases Cross-Chain Staking As SEC Clarifies Staking
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/lawrencewintermeyer/2025/06/05/symbiotic-releases-cross-chain-staking-as-sec-clarifies-staking/
Time Published: 2025-06-05T13:00:43Z
Full Content:
ByLawrence Wintermeyer ByLawrence Wintermeyer, Contributor. Connection of different chains with a link On May 29, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a statement that clarified protocol staking on DeFi proof-of-stake networks does not in itself constitute a securities offering. For those building and providing DeFi infrastructure that deploys staking, it is a long-awaited regulatory green light. The timing could not be better for Symbiotic, the re-staking protocol on the move, who announced “Relay” a new universal staking protocol, earlier this week. Relay is designed to enable staking on one blockchain protocol and verify decisions across many. Relay is pitched as a “crypto-economic” coordination layer for the modular multichain future of Web3. Symbiotic, recently completed a $29 million Series A round backed by Pantera, Coinbase Ventures, Paradigm, and hundreds of angel investors. The round helps to take on rival market leader EigenLayer, and to further fund the development of Relay. Staking is foundational to DeFI infrastructure with total value locked (TVL) market of $116.6 billion, according to DeFiLlama. Ethereum dominates this market with over $62 billion in DeFi TVL and is seen as a main destination for real-world-asset (RWA) tokenization, a market Solana is now a serious contender for. Staking is the process of distributing the economic benefits of Web3 across the network, while defraying and reducing the many risks of network participation, to help ensure the bedrock of the protocol network remains stable. New transactions are added to DeFi networks through Proof-of-take (PoS) consensus mechanisms, allowing users who stake their tokens, like ETH or SOL, to earn fees in return. Staked tokens are “locked” in the DeFi protocol ecosystem and earn fees as new user transactions use the network digital rails. Liquid staking is very popular in DeFi as it enables earning fees from two DeFi networks. With liquid staking, once the original token is staked, a derivative Liquid Staking Token (LST) of the same value as the original staked token is issued and can be then re-staked in the DeFi ecosystem for further incentives. The LST is swapped back when the original token is un-staked. Liquid staking (re-staking) is similar to “collateralization” in the TradFi world, popular with sophisticated financiers and asset managers, and is one of the key incentives for seasoned finance professionals to deploy capital in the Web3 ecosystem. Q2 2025 liquid staking alone accounted for over $58.9 billion in TVL across the DeFi landscape. Symbiotic’s Relay enables developers to “plug into” and unlock the ability to stake from any ecosystem to verify protocol decisions on any supported chain. This enables protocol developers to build bridges, settlement layers, oracles, and rollups without relying on multisigs or proof-of-authority setups, and without sacrificing decentralization. It also means that a protocol can secure decisions on Ethereum and execute or settle on Solana or Monad or tap into Bitcoin-based systems that support programmable layers. Algys Ievlev, co-founder of Symbiotic, says, "Until now, building secure multichain infrastructure meant expensive custom work or reliance on centralized relayers. Relay solves that. It makes verifiable, stake-backed coordination between chains as simple as a plug-in, without any trust assumptions or permissioning." The DeFi market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 53.7% from 2025 to 2030, considered a conservative estimate by many in industry. Leading crypto exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken offer staking services to their customers, facilitating broader participation in staking activities while specialist platforms like Lido, Rocket Pool, and Marinade Finance command the liquid staking market. Eigenlayer, backed by a16z, Coinbase Ventures and Polychain, is the largest and most established re-staking protocol and leads the re-staking market with $15 billion of TVL. Eigenlayer enables ETH and LSTs Allows ETH and LSTs to be re-staked to secure Actively Validated Services (AVSs), that are continuously monitor and verify services by a network of validators to ensure their integrity, security, and accuracy. Symbiotic supports a mainnet already live across 14 networks with over $1 billion staked. Relay now enables crypto’s largest ecosystems to be unified into one seamless interoperable layer. The Bitcoin Network brings a $2.2 trillion market cap to add to $116 billion DeFi TVL with thousands of programmable assets across Ethereum, Solana and other protocols, now no longer siloed. Historically, developers had to choose which trade-offs to embrace when choosing protocols for projects. Relay seeks to remove “protocol walls” by allowing protocols to use staked capital on one chain to verify and secure actions on another, whether Symbiotic is natively deployed on the protocol. Developers are already exploring use cases from fast-finality rollups to oracles and decentralized insurance layers. Relay integrates directly with Symbiotic’s validator set and SDK, enabling teams to add multichain coordination without reimplementing consensus mechanisms. Symbiotic Relay’s launch arrives at an opportune time. The SEC’s recent statement addresses a key concern for developers about whether building protocol-level staking mechanisms could expose them to securities enforcement. The answer, for the time being, appears to be no. The SEC’s ruling follows the U.K. Treasury’s January legal amendment clarifying that crypto staking necessary for proof-of-stake blockchains such as Ethereum and Solana doesn’t fall under the definition of a “collective investment scheme (CIS),” and is outside the scope of the CIS regulations. In a space where regulatory uncertainty often slows innovation, that kind of clarity has been, in recent years, rare and is proving commercially valuable. It shifts the conversation from fear of noncompliance to a renewed focus on DeFi infrastructure design. Financial institutions deploying distributed ledger technologies (DLT) such as Blackrock, JP Morgan, and Goldman Sachs will be spurred on by more favorable regulatory signals, and the recent SEC staking statement is likely to help accelerate this. Relay’s architecture, which is open-source, permissionless, and has no custodial token wrappers, is precisely the kind of model that fits into this regulatory shift. Symbiotic Relay represents a broader trend being witnessed in the DeFi landscape - the push toward a more modular and interoperable infrastructure in Web3. According to Electric Capital’s 2024 Developer Report, 34% of active crypto developers now work across multiple blockchains, a significant jump from just 10% in 2015. The tooling needs to catch up. Whether Symbiotic Relay becomes a standard, or even “the” standard remains to be seen in this very hotly contended competitive space. One thing is for sure, a week is a long time in DeFi. Symbiotic’s timing couldn’t be better with this week’s Relay announcement on the back of last week’s SEC staking clarification. For DeFi developers building the next wave of multichain apps, it might just be the interoperable plug-in they didn’t know they were waiting for. For seasoned stakers, it is a killer app. Timing is everything.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. 06/05 update below. This post was originally published on June 04 Bitcoin has surged over the last year, propelled higher by Wall Street’s embrace of crypto and U.S. president Donald Trump’s support (despite Google revealing a serious BlackRock bitcoin nightmare just got a lot worse). Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price set a new all-time high of $112,000 per bitcoin last month, surging 50% from its April low and helped by U.S. vice president JD Vance issuing a huge crypto prediction. Now, as the Covid-era meme stock craze turns to bitcoin, Tesla billionaire Elon Musk has restarted his campaign against out-of-control U.S. government spending, backing a warning that bitcoin could “take over” from the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Tesla chief executive Elon Musk has reposted a wild bitcoin prediction following the huge bitcoin ... More price rally. “If the electorate doesn’t hold Congress accountable to reducing the deficit, and start paying down the debt, bitcoin is going to take over as reserve currency,” Brian Armstrong, the chief executive of crypto exchange Coinbase, posted to X in comments reposted by Musk. “I love bitcoin, but a strong America is also super important for the world. We need to get our finances under control.” 06/05 update: Elon Musk’s endorsement of Armstrong’s warning comes at a time of increased pressure on the U.S. dollar, with analysts at Morgan Stanley predicting the U.S. dollar will fall to levels not see since the Covid pandemic this year, pushed down by Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and the rise of rival currencies. "We think rates and currency markets have embarked on sizeable trends that will be sustained — taking the US dollar much lower and yields curves much steeper — after two years of swing trading within wide ranges," the strategists wrote in a note seen by Business Insider, adding they expect the dollar to fall 9% over the next 12 months to a value of 91 on the dollar index. JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon has added to fears, predicting spiraling U.S. debt may create a "tough time" for the bond market as spreads widen. "If people decide that the U.S. dollar isn’t the place to be, you could see credit spreads gap out; that would be quite a problem," Dimon said during an interview with Fox Business. “It does feel like we’re entering into a more secular downturn for the dollar,” Peter Vassallo, a portfolio manager at BNP Paribas Asset Management who focuses on currencies, told MarketWatch. “The worst-case scenarios surrounding tariffs have been reduced. But the broad ideas around U.S. policy being more volatile and more hostile to foreign trade — that hasn’t gone away.” Musk, who last year embarked on a campaign against spiraling U.S. debt while supporting U.S. president Donald Trump’s second bid for the White House, has come out against Trump’s signature tax bill just days after leaving his role in Trump’s administration. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates Trump’s so-called “big, beautiful bill” will add $3.8 trillion to the U.S.’s $36 trillion in debt over the next decade, taking it to an eye-watering $40 trillion. "I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore," Musk, who set up and led the Doge department of government efficiency, posted to X. “This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination.” Musk wrote that those who voted for it “know you did wrong," and added in a follow up post that it “will massively increase the already gigantic budget deficit to $2.5 trillion and burden American citizens with crushingly unsustainable debt.” Huge government spending through Covid lockdowns turbo-charged U.S. debt, leading to warnings the Federal Reserve will have to step in to prop up bond markets, devaluing the dollar and potentially spiking inflation.

More of the U.S. dollar. Bitcoin, a scarce digital asset that’s often compared to gold, has seen its price rocket higher as countries around the world, and led by the U.S., fuel their economic growth with debt. Companies are beginning to shift their corporate treasuries to bitcoin, a trend started by ailing software company MicroStrategy in 2020 that’s propelled it into the Nasdaq 100 and been copied by dozens of companies. “As the U.S. dollar continues to devalue, we’re going to see this shift happening more and more as investors scramble to protect their assets,” Nic Puckrin, bitcoin and crypto analyst, investor and founder of The Coin Bureau, said in emailed comments. “With bitcoin holding steady above $100,000 for 20 days and counting, it’s fast becoming the new safe haven.”

Title: The Last Bitcoin Cycle? Swan Says History’s Turning

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitcoin is drifting just above $105,000 on June 5, its lowest realized volatility in almost two years, yet Swan, the Los-Angeles-based “Bitcoin-only” financial services firm, contends the market is on the verge of its most radical re-pricing ever. In a X thread on Wednesday night, the company argued that the familiar four-year boom-and-bust cadence is giving way to “the last rotation”—a silent transfer of coins from retail speculators to institutions whose investment horizons stretch decades. “People less committed to the long term are exiting […] and a whole new class of investors is entering,” Swan is quoting Michael Saylor, framing the hand-off from retail traders to corporate treasuries, ETFs and multinationals such as BlackRock and Fidelity. So far, 2025 has defied the script. The third calendar year of every prior cycle—2013, 2017 and 2021—delivered the vertical moves that defined those eras. This year has offered “big moves, but also shallower corrections and longer periods of sideways chop,” Swan writes, conceding that the price action “is boring people.” The firm’s thesis is that boredom masks an invisible supply squeeze: long-time holders taking profits above $100,000 while “long-only buyers,” in Swan’s words, methodically absorb the float. “These corporations, they’re long-only buyers. Not traders of Bitcoin,” Swan argues, underscoring the firm’s view that coins migrating into corporate vaults are effectively removed from circulation. The thread portrays three intertwined rotations: Between entities – Trustees, lawyers and early adopters are exiting; ETFs, corporations and “sovereign-grade balance sheets” are stepping in. Between intentions – Speculation gives way to allocation. “This new wave of buyers isn’t speculating,” Swan writes. “They’re allocating.” Between generations. The Silent Generation hoarded gold; Boomers compounded in equities; Gen X surfed tech; now Millennials, “entering their peak accumulation years,” are “inheriting trillions—and they’re choosing Bitcoin.” Supply dynamics, Swan contends, make those rotations irreversible. “When long-term capital meets inelastic supply, the float starts vanishing,” the firm warns. “That’s when things get explosive.” The macro backdrop adds pressure: Swan points to a “rare and dangerous split” in which the US dollar is weakening even as bond yields surge—an environment, it says, that could funnel excess capital toward a neutral store of value. “This isn’t just the next cycle. It’s the end of an era,” Swan concludes. “If you’re selling now, understand you’re likely handing your Bitcoin to an institution that plans to hold it indefinitely. Once it’s gone, you’re probably never getting it back.” For Swan, the implication is stark. The apparent tranquility near $105,000 is less a sign of exhaustion than the quiet before a permanent liquidity event—one in which the marginal seller disappears, the marginal buyer never sells, and price must eventually mark higher to find equilibrium. “Think twice,” Swan advises would-be profit-takers. “The float is drying up. The buyers are built different. This is the last Bitcoin rotation.” If the firm is right, history is not repeating so much as culminating, and the market’s current stillness may soon be remembered as the eye of a generational storm.

Title: The Great Quack Revival
URL: http://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-rfk-jr-maha-quacks.html
Time Published: 2025-06-05T09:00:05Z
Full Content:
Six months into the second Trump administration, it has become clear that now is the time of con men. Scams and snake oil proliferate, as do the hucksters who promote them. Before Mike Huckabee became our ambassador to Israel, he advertised Relaxium, an herbal supplement whose makers falsely pledged it would help a restless nation sleep. Other supplement-makers see a champion in Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who not only opposes vaccines but has said the Food and Drug Administration should free the nation from the “aggressive suppression” of dubious vitamins and herbal substances. Kennedy has even hired David Geier to conduct a study into the debunked link between autism and vaccines, though authorities once punished Geier for experimenting on autistic children in a basement laboratory. Like his late father, Mark, Geier believes the puberty blocker Lupron can treat autism and says vaccines caused the developmental condition. Neither claim is true, but in the greater Make America Healthy Again universe, facts can be inconvenient. Dubious supplements and false cures have always been part of the quack’s tool kit, but Kennedy and his ilk aren’t limiting themselves to the mere promotion of pseudoscience. They’re attacking scientific research at the same time. Funding cuts and layoffs are weakening major institutions like the National Institutes of Health and the FDA, which were established to monitor our food supply and medicines for safety. The administration has canceled research grants to universities, slowing the pace of innovation. Scientists searching for cures and treatments for Alzheimer’s, various cancers, and genetic diseases say their work is in jeopardy — if it can continue at all. The MAHA war on expertise leaves Americans ever more vulnerable to predators and scams, which in turn exacerbates a much older problem: The quack has too much power and prospers in times of inequality and mistrust. In 2019, the Pew Research Center found 86 percent of Americans felt confident in the work of the country’s scientists. That figure declined during the pandemic, and though it rebounded slightly by 2024, it remains lower than its pre-COVID levels. Behind the numbers are hucksters who prospered during the pandemic thanks in part to Donald Trump himself. Although the president’s first term oversaw the rapid development of COVID vaccines, Trump also told people to inject disinfectant to fight the virus. Grifters peddled ivermectin, a horse dewormer, along with an anti-malarial drug called hydroxychloroquine, which is not an effective COVID treatment. Trump would later tout it at a press conference, leading to fatal consequences for at least one listener. Hydroxychloroquine sounds a lot like chloroquine, a non-pharmaceutical chemical sold to clean fish tanks. An Arizona couple had purchased the substance to treat their koi pond and decided to drink it after tuning in to Trump’s performance. The wife lived; her husband did not. Meanwhile, luminaries like the disgraced televangelist Jim Bakker sold colloidal silver as a COVID remedy. There is no evidence that colloidal silver can treat any physical ailment or that ivermectin has a use beyond the elimination of parasites. Yet people still take them, often to their own detriment. Scott Adams, the right-wing creator of “Dilbert,” recently admitted he had used ivermectin to treat his prostate cancer. It didn’t work, and Adams says he expects to die from the disease this summer. Amy Carlson, the QAnon-adjacent cult leader better known as Mother God, consumed so much colloidal silver that her skin had turned blue by the time she died. Both discovered what scientists and physicians already knew: Quackery may promise good health, but it can’t make good on its pledge. At best, it does nothing; at worst, it kills. Despite this, quacks endure, and so does the risk they pose to public health. If MAHA sweeps the scientific Establishment aside, history suggests a wild and dangerous era awaits. Quackery is at least as old as the United States itself. Frontier life promised all sorts of dangers, and early settlers brought bizarre therapeutics with them to stave off fever and premature death. Unscrupulous apothecaries and makers of nostrums, as quack medicines are sometimes known, discovered a lucrative new market that alarmed professionals with medical training. In The Toadstool Millionaires, historian James Harvey Young quotes one colonial physician who suggested a “licensing system” that would “remove the ‘Shoemakers, Weavers, and Almanack-Makers, with their virtuous Consorts, who have laid aside the proper Business of their Lives, to turn Quacks.’” But profit beckoned, and quacks proliferated for many decades to come, though they achieved no results worth mentioning. In the 18th century, the Connecticut physician Elisha Perkins devised a pair of “metallic tractors,” or rods, that could allegedly cure painful ailments like rheumatism and generated a brief international mania. The Connecticut Medical Society expelled Perkins for nostrum-making, but he persisted, convinced of his own genius. When yellow fever struck New York City in 1799, he went out to treat the sick with a mixture of “marine salt, vinegar, and water” until he inevitably fell ill, died, and was buried in a potter’s field near what is now Washington Square Park. During the Gilded Age, the growth of the newspaper industry, the rise of public advertising, and the construction of railroads coincided with radical social and economic inequality — a complex situation that nostrum-makers could and did exploit. In one extreme case, Henry T. Helmbold spread word of “buchu,” a plant native to southern Africa, along the length of the Union Pacific Railroad. The bold advertising strategy worked, and Helmbold became a wealthy eccentric who enjoyed ruling-class patronage for years. In New York, his “Temple of Pharmacy” boasted “sarcophagus soda fountains, floor-to-ceiling mirrors, monogrammed gas globes, marble floors with the doctor’s initials inlaid in brass, fountains for dispensing perfume, and canary birds tweeting in their cages,” Young wrote. Temple attendants in elaborate uniforms sold buchu to Boss Tweed and John Jacob Astor. The problem? Buchu didn’t work, and Helmbold was an alcoholic. The temple closed, the birds died, and then so did Helmbold, in 1892. Helmbold courted the rich while other quacks pursued the poor. In the years before Helmbold constructed his temple, the Philadelphia nostrum-maker William Swaim sold a “panacea” for use in a city almshouse. Though Swaim said the drug had cured a patient there, the Philadelphia Medical Society eventually concluded the opposite was true: The patient had died. Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. observed in the 1840s that quacks, “in trumping up ‘Dispensaries,’ ‘Colleges of Health,’ and other advertising charitable clap-traps,” had used “the poor as decoy-ducks for the rich.” A façade of respectability allowed them to prey on the unsuspecting, however, and by 1906, Congress felt pressured to act. The Pure Food and Drug Act made it illegal to sell misbranded or adulterated food and drugs, and it helped establish the FDA, though quack medicines still appeared on market shelves. The skeptic researcher Joe Nickell wrote in 1998 that patent medicines like Dr. Worden’s Female Pills and Dr. McBain’s Blood Pills were sold by mail-order companies years after the act took effect, and he noted that the later rise of “alternative medicine” could threaten modern generations if left unchecked. Today’s quacks have learned to manipulate various regulatory loopholes to sell fake cures to the masses. Homeopathy is hardly more sophisticated than Dr. McBain’s Blood Pills, but consumers can still purchase bottles of such medicines at Whole Foods. Insurance companies will often cover chiropractic treatment, though the field was founded by a spiritualist who got the idea from a ghost. My brother and I used to giggle at “horny goat weed” in our local gas stations, but the side effects aren’t that funny; it can make the user puke or hallucinate. These days, you can buy it on Amazon. Wealthier consumers may prefer to shop from Goop, which sells a “gemstone heat-therapy map” for $1,049. A bro who tunes in to Joe Rogan may hear of wondrous nootropics like Alpha Brain, created by a Rogan friend; a 2024 lawsuit accused the maker of “deceptive” advertising. The FDA “can’t even require that supplements be effective before they are sold,” KFF Health News reported in February. Medical scams and nostrum-making are still popular — and profitable, too, even though they can be dangerous. In January, a Michigan child burned to death inside a hyperbaric oxygen chamber where he had endured 36 futile treatments for ADHD and sleep apnea. Though the United States does not stand alone in its susceptibility to nostrums, its unfettered free market is a bonanza for hucksters. The FDA hasn’t approved the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for conditions like autism and ADHD, but clinics and med spas across the country advertise miraculous effects and remain largely unregulated, which frees them to maximize profits at the expense of consumers. Social media spreads dubious medical claims further than even Helmbold could dream. On Instagram, TikTok, or YouTube, anyone can be a quack or work for one. So-called “alternative medicine” was a multibillion-dollar business in the U.S. before Trump ever took office. Now that he’s back in power, with Kennedy helming public health, we are poised for a new golden age of quackery. Trump is in some respects the quintessential president of the quack. He is a huckster in his own right, as former Trump University students may attest, and pseudoscience can prop up an authoritarian government. Dr. David Gorski, a surgical oncologist and the editor of Science-Based Medicine, has called the MAHA movement “the new Lysenkoism,” invoking a Soviet scientist who rose to prominence during Stalin’s regime. Trofim Lysenko repudiated Darwinism and the emerging field of genetics on ideological grounds, and his unfounded agricultural theories helped Stalin starve millions of people. We’re not there, but quackery still exacts a significant human toll. A nationwide measles outbreak has killed at least two children, but anti-vaccine parents and some doctors have attempted to treat the disease with cod-liver oil, though there’s no evidence that it works. Kennedy has nevertheless promoted the oil as a treatment for measles in his public statements. In May, Trump nominated Kennedy ally Casey Means to be surgeon general, though Means has questioned the childhood vaccine schedule and called researcher Dale Bredesen a “medical hero” — though Bredesen no longer practices medicine, he promotes a complicated diet and supplement regime that he claims can reverse symptoms of Alzheimer’s. Mostly, it’s expensive. People can pay $810 to join Apollo Health, Bredesen’s company, which matches them with a Bredesen-approved physician. The New York Times reported one Illinois couple spent $25,000 to treat Alzheimer’s the Bredesen way before concluding that the Bredesen protocol doesn’t work. Lawmakers thus face a difficult if urgent task, and so do the nation’s experts. Trump won’t be around forever, and he’s making sure pseudoscience will outlast him. The root of the problem isn’t necessarily public ignorance but exploitation. Right now, it’s a predator’s market, and that’s not a coincidence. Without robust public institutions and a health-care system that prioritizes care over profit, mistrust will fester. Americans will lead sicker and shorter lives, and the next pandemic may be even deadlier than COVID. Others will waste money on treatments that don’t work or sacrifice their children to scam artists. Fighting Trump means fighting MAHA and, with it, the quack and the huckster. Rebuilding the federal government and closing regulatory loopholes will cost nostrum-makers some cash, but it’s the only way to make America healthy at last.

Title: Amazon's Lab126 ventures into "Physical AI" with new robotics team
URL: https://www.neowin.net/news/amazons-lab126-ventures-into-physical-ai-with-new-robotics-team/
Time Published: 2025-06-05T07:54:01Z
Full Content:
Amazon has announced that it’s forming a new agentic AI team within its secretive hardware research and development division, Lab126, to begin work on physical AI. Specifically, the company is looking to develop an agentic AI framework for use in robotics, which could start to impact blue-collar jobs, especially at its warehouses. Agentic AI is one of the latest developments in AI, superseding the previous generative AI that took off with the launch of ChatGPT. Agentic AI models are special because they can complete multi-step actions for the user to complete complex tasks. Thanks to all the visual and audio capabilities added to generative AI in previous years, these agentic models can perceive their environment, reason, plan, and act to achieve goals with minimal human intervention. If Amazon can successfully bring agentic AI to robots, they will finally be able to interact with the real world in a way they can’t today, as software running on a computer. Many people are concerned about AI’s impact on white-collar jobs right now, but when Amazon develops physical AI, it will also affect blue-collar manual work. The work is going to be carried out by Amazon’s R&D company, Lab126. It was set up over 20 years ago and has created many iconic Amazon devices, including the Kindle, Fire tablets, Amazon Fire TV, Amazon Echo devices, and more. The biggest impact of physical AI developed by Lab126 will be on Amazon’s warehouses and logistics. The company said it wants to create robots that can perform tasks based on natural language instructions. As usual for a big tech company, Amazon claims that these robots will be assistants, but it’s difficult to see how they won’t reduce the need for people. Solely based on Amazon’s plans to automate work in its factories, customers will see an indirect impact from the move through faster deliveries and potentially lower costs. The decision by Amazon to focus on agentic AI in robots is pretty interesting because so far, we’ve mainly been hearing about agentic AI limited to computer applications, such as intelligent web browsers like Opera Neon. Amazon has a reputation for being an efficient company, particularly when it comes to the employment of warehouse workers who are known to have strict restroom breaks. Creating robots that can help speed up warehouse activities will further boost efficiency at the company and could potentially reduce its costs and improve safety. The beginning of work on physical AI is just the next evolution of AI that we could start to hear about in the coming months and years. As agentic AI gets better, companies will be looking to see what they can advance next and physical AI may be where they choose to go next; it certainly seems like this is what Amazon has settled on in this move. If Amazon’s physical AI doesn’t lead to mass layoffs of warehouse employees, it could drastically boost worker safety. Employees could potentially be less fatigued from moving around so much, which could lead to better concentration and fewer accidents. Right now, Amazon claims that these robots will only be assistants and not replacements. While Amazon will certainly be a leader in physical AI, given its massive wealth to throw at the problem, once the technology is available, it will likely be available for sale to other businesses to use, too. While it’s a notable development, it still sounds like Amazon is in the early stages of developing these physical AI systems, given that it has only just set up the team. We also don’t know what specific products Amazon is planning to build or the timelines for deployment. Ever since generative AI came onto the scene, there has been discussion of AI safety. With AI moving into the physical world, it will also bring up discussion about the safety concerns. Current measures are mainly concerned with AI software running on computers, not when it interacts physically with the world. Finally, and probably the biggest concern, what will these “assistants” do to people’s jobs? Companies will likely find themselves bringing in fewer new hires initially, but it could also displace people from their jobs. Source: CNBC

Title: Circle raises $1.1 billion in upsized IPO, prices shares at $31
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/circle-raises-1-1-billion-in-upsized-ipo-prices-shares-at-31/
Time Published: 2025-06-05T02:42:53Z
Full Content:
Circle Internet Group Inc., a prominent player in the stablecoin arena, successfully navigated its initial public offering (IPO), raising nearly $1.1 billion in an upsized deal that saw shares priced above the initially marketed range. This strong market reception is being interpreted as a significant indicator of the increasing acceptance and perceived legitimacy of stablecoin issuers within the broader financial landscape. The stablecoin firm, along with some of its existing shareholders including co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Jeremy Allaire, sold a total of 34 million shares on Wednesday at a price of $31 each, according to a statement confirming an earlier Bloomberg News report. This pricing gives Circle a market valuation of approximately $6.9 billion based on the outstanding shares detailed in its regulatory filings. When accounting for employee stock options, restricted share units, and warrants, the company’s fully diluted valuation reaches about $8.1 billion. The offering’s success was underscored by significant investor interest. The upsized deal reportedly fielded demand for more than 25 times the number of shares available by the time orders closed on Tuesday, according to people familiar with the matter. This overwhelming demand prompted Circle to increase the size and price of its IPO earlier in the week. On Monday, the target for the offering was raised to 32 million shares at a price range of $27 to $28 per share, a notable increase from the initial plan to sell 24 million shares within a $24 to $26 price range, as indicated in its earlier filings. In the final tally, Circle itself sold 14.8 million shares in the IPO, while the selling shareholders divested the remaining 19.2 million shares. Circle’s successful public offering comes at a pivotal time for stablecoins – digital tokens typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. Legislation currently before the US Congress aims to regulate these assets, a development that many believe will confer greater legitimacy upon them and potentially pave the way for broader adoption. However, this evolving regulatory landscape may also attract new and formidable competitors. The Wall Street Journal reported last month that some of Wall Street’s largest banks are jointly exploring the possibility of issuing their own stablecoins. Circle’s flagship product, USDC, held approximately 29% of the stablecoin market as of the end of March, according to data from CoinMarketCap cited in the company’s filing. As of May 29, there was about $61 billion worth of USDC in circulation, according to information on Circle’s website. The IPO has attracted notable institutional investors. ARK Investment Management, the technology-focused investment firm founded by Cathie Wood, expressed interest in purchasing as much as $150 million worth of shares in Circle’s IPO, according to the filing. Furthermore, BlackRock Inc., the world’s largest asset manager, reportedly plans to acquire about 10% of the IPO shares, people familiar with the matter have said. This interest is particularly significant given BlackRock’s existing relationship with Circle; BlackRock manages a government money market fund on Circle’s behalf, which holds 90% of the reserves backing its USDC stablecoin. The Circle Reserve Fund reportedly had a balance of $53.3 billion as of May 29. This IPO marks a significant milestone in Circle’s journey. The company was valued at $7.7 billion after a funding round in 2022, according to data provider PitchBook. Circle had initially filed confidentially for a listing in early 2024, more than a year after it had abandoned a previous attempt to go public through a merger with a blank-check company (SPAC). That earlier SPAC deal would have valued the company at $9 billion. The current IPO is being led by a consortium of Wall Street giants, including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc., and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Circle’s shares are expected to begin trading on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol CRCL.

Title: AI Could Turn Democrats Into the New Welfare Class

Time Published: 2025-06-05T00:28:38Z
Full Content:
The New York Times’s jeremiad last week about AI’s impact on entry-level jobs — particularly in tech — merely underscores trends that have been clear for well over a year. Silicon Valley firms have been slashing jobs despite record profits, and since 2022 California has actually shed positions in the information sector. An astonishing 82% of millennials fear AI will drive down their compensation. They have every reason to be concerned. This trend could create a political storm of massive proportions. In recent decades the Democratic Party has been able to compensate for its ebbing support among blue-collar workers by winning over college-trained professionals. Almost all college-educated professionals — excluding those in the military and airline pilots — lean overwhelmingly Democratic. College degrees, particularly graduate ones, are among the strongest indicators of a Leftist tilt, yet are becoming ever less salient in terms of garnering higher salaries. This base is under increased assault, as universities are forced to confront declining enrollments and ever less public approval. At the same time, the supply of entry-level graduate jobs at major firms such as Salesforce, Meta, Amazon and Lyft are dwindling due to the introduction of AI. Google, most notably, has recently laid off 12,000 workers — a number that is expected to grow to 30,000. The damage may be even greater at the grassroots level. Within months of AI’s emergence, freelance work in software declined markedly, along with pay. In a survey earlier this month, two-thirds of business leaders suggested that ChatGPT will lead to large layoffs of white-collar workers over the next five years. Already, new AI programmes are allowing software firms to do without lower-level programmers, particularly new hires. To be sure, Americans without college degrees are not immune to the effects of AI. But in the near term, it’s college professors, administrators, lawyers, accountants, and psychologists — largely Democratic-leaning professionals — who are increasingly in the crosshairs. Even Hollywood, a traditional Democratic stronghold, faces mounting threats: as entertainment becomes more digitised, layoffs have accelerated, and studios find it far easier to shift production to lower-cost regions such as Eastern Europe. Who wins here? It will be those professions that use AI to build things, such as drones, spaceships and robots. These firms are not as heavily concentrated in places like Silicon Valley, which has largely embraced software, social media and consumer services, leaving its once proud industrial heritage behind. This is a huge opportunity for Texas in particular, since the state has always been oriented towards tangible engineering. Texas may have missed the social media boom, but its industrial legacy has left it well placed to dominate the “deep tech” builder space. This field often requires reliable and affordable energy — something not easy to get in states such as California or New York. Beyond elite AI engineers, the other likely winners may be those in physical, hands-on jobs — mechanics or oil rig workers — that are much harder to automate. AI pioneer Rony Abovitz told me that the big winner in the coming years will be the “sophisticated, technically capable blue-collar worker”. Young people might be better off ignoring Joe Biden’s famous advice to “learn to code” and instead consider trade schools which teach practical, in-demand skills.

Stablecoin Giant Circle Raises $1.1B in IPO, Valued at $6.9B Ahead of NYSE Debut Circle has priced its initial public offering at $31 per share, raising approximately $1.1 billion in an upsized deal that exceeded both initial size and guidance. The offering values the stablecoin issuer at $6.9 billion based on outstanding shares, with a fully diluted valuation of $8.1 billion including options and warrants. The company and selling shareholders sold a total of 34 million shares, up from 32 million as of Monday. Circle initially aimed to sell 24 million shares at $24 to $26. A surge in demand pushed the range up to $27–$28 earlier this week, before pricing topped it late on Wednesday. Shares will begin trading on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker CRCL. USDC, Circle’s flagship product, currently accounts for about 24.5% of the stablecoin market with $61.5 billion in circulation, according to CoinGecko data. BlackRock, which manages the $53.3 billion reserve fund backing USDC, is expected to acquire 10% of IPO shares, according to sources cited by Bloomberg. ARK Invest also expressed interest in purchasing up to $150 million worth of shares. Circle reported $156 million in net income on $1.68 billion in revenue for 2024, a decline from $268 million in net income the prior year, according to its April S-1 filing. The listing comes as Congress advances legislation to regulate stablecoins, with final passage expected sometime in August. Circle, which received a New York BitLicense in 2015, is widely seen as one of the most compliance-forward players in the space. This story is developing and will be updated once trading begins.

Circle's IPO was oversubscribed by more than 25x on the back of robust demand from institutional investors and major financial firms. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Circle is poised to price its initial public offering above its marketed range after receiving investor orders for more than 25x the number of shares available, Bloomberg reported on June 4, citing people familiar with the matter. The stablecoin issuer and its backers are offering 32 million shares at a price range of $27 to $28, aiming to raise up to $896 million. At the high end of that range, Circle’s implied market capitalization would be approximately $6.2 billion, with a fully diluted valuation of about $7.2 billion, according to regulatory filings. The IPO, expected to price on the evening of June 4 in New York, reflects strong demand from institutional investors. The offering was originally sized at 24 million shares with a range of $24 to $26. Final allocations are expected to favor long-term holders. Circle is the issuer behind USDC, the second-largest stablecoin in circulation, which held roughly 29% of the stablecoin market as of March. The IPO arrives as US lawmakers debate stablecoin legislation that could bring regulatory clarity and mainstream legitimacy to digital dollar-pegged tokens. The stablecoin issuer’s offering has drawn interest from major financial firms. Ark Invest is looking to buy up to $150 million worth of shares in the IPO, while BlackRock is expected to acquire about 10% of the total offered shares. JPMorgan, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs are leading the underwriting for the offering. Circle is set to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “CRCL.” The IPO comes as traditional financial institutions explore stablecoin initiatives of their own, with several Wall Street banks, including JPMorgan, reportedly examining joint issuance efforts.

Title: Trump Crypto Venture Charges Into Digital Space With Wallet Launch Amid Uproar

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. US President Donald Trump’s circle moved closer to rolling out two big crypto products this week. One announcement sparked a public mix‐up over who’s doing what. The other took a formal step toward a Bitcoin exchange‐traded fund. Both moves show the family’s push for more crypto ties. According to reports, @GetTrumpMemes on X said on Tuesday that a new crypto wallet branded with US President Trump’s picture is coming. The post said Magic Eden will power the wallet and that users could grab up to $1 million in TRUMP token rewards by joining a waitlist. Some readers rushed to sign up. But then Donald Trump Jr., who serves as Web3 Ambassador to World Liberty Financial (WLFI), posted that his family isn’t involved in that exact product. He called out the official TRUMP token account and said WLFI will launch its own branded wallet at a later date. With Billions of Trump fans around the world, the $TRUMP mission has always been to make it super easy for Trump supporters to get into crypto and join the $TRUMP community. The $TRUMP Wallet powered by @magiceden is coming soon. Join the $TRUMP community!… pic.twitter.com/7nIubWIdqw — TrumpMeme (@GetTrumpMemes) June 3, 2025 Eric Trump chimed in too, saying he and his brother have no link to the version teased by the TRUMP token team. That disagreement left fans scratching their heads. Who really owns this wallet? It’s clear that the brand name draws attention, but so does the split between the token’s official page and the Trump family’s own statements. Based on filings, NYSE Arca took the first legal step on Tuesday to list a Truth Social Bitcoin spot ETF. The 19b-4 request went to the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Yorkville American Digital, a Florida asset manager, is the sponsor. If approved, this would become the 13th US Bitcoin spot ETF and join big names like BlackRock and Fidelity. The move follows an April partnership between Trump Media and Crypto.com to launch “Made In America” exchange‐traded products that include Bitcoin and Crypto.com’s Cronos token. Back then, people in crypto circles saw a sign that Trump Media aims to bundle patriotism with digital coins. Now the new filing shows they’re serious about offering a mainstream Bitcoin fund. People watching this space know that WLFI dipped into stablecoins before. And Trump Media said it plans a Bitcoin Treasury worth $2.5 billion at launch. So the family name is already tied to crypto money. Yet the wallet announcement on X and the family’s denials highlight how fast things can sound official—especially when magic Eden and a popular meme token are involved. One side says, “We’re doing it,” while the other side says, “Not us.” When branding blurs the lines between projects, users may wonder which link to trust. That split can hurt credibility, even if the goal is to ride high on an eye‐catching name. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out.

It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: US-based ETFs offering staking set for growth despite some regulatory, macro tailwinds

Recent regulatory developments and potential US-China trade talks outcomes could boost are expected to benefit staking ETFs. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Upcoming exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that integrate staking yields stand to benefit significantly as US lawmakers and regulators clarify the legal status of on-chain rewards, according to a June 3 report. The report noted points to two parallel policy moves. First, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) confirmed on May 29 that staking does not constitute a securities sale, provided customers keep ownership of their assets and receive risk disclosures. This understanding applies to solo, delegated, or carried out through a custodial service staking. Second, the bipartisan Digital Asset Market Clarity Act (CLARITY Act) would shift the oversight of most secondary market token trading to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) while leaving initial fundraising events under the jurisdiction of the SEC. The CLARITY Act is also a recent move in the US crypto industry, filed on the same day as the SEC shared its statement on staking. However, no ETF offering staking has received regulatory approval as of June 4. Nansen argues that the twin actions remove a structural barrier for issuers planning products that wrap staking rewards inside an ETF chassis. The note named BlackRock, Fidelity, and Bitwise as manufacturers preparing to capitalize on the change alongside significant staking assets such as Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and BNB, as well as liquid staking protocols like LIDO. The report also mapped two macro paths tied to US-China trade talks that could add fuel to boost ETFs offering to stake. Under the base case scenario, which assumes talks “muddle through” and the Senate softens a pending tax provision, Bitcoin (BTC) retests its record. At the same time, staked currencies receive an extra boost from regulatory momentum. In the bearish scenario, a tariff re-escalation pressures equities first. Yet, the report still shared expectations that staked tokens and related ETFs would outpace stocks because their yield component would offset price weakness. Data from DefiLlama reveals that ETH staking and liquid staking yields range between 2.5% and 3% on the largest platforms by total value locked (TVL). The average for SOL using the same data ranges from 6.5% to 8%, while Staking Rewards data highlight a 2.1% average yield for BNB. Beyond the scenario matrix, the research cited a drop in the equity risk premium below 2.5% and subdued equity volatility as evidence that traditional markets may undercompensate investors for risk. By contrast, staking-enabled ETFs combine crypto upside with a yield stream that does not rely on corporate earnings. Nansen concluded that regulatory clarity, macro diversification, and investor appetite for blockchain yield create an opening for funds that pass staking rewards through to shareholders.

Title: Global Trade at Gunpoint

Time Published: 2025-06-04T19:00:00Z
Full Content:
President Donald Trump stood behind a podium in a large clearing of the Rose Garden, American flags hanging vertically between each White House column, to lambast a global trade system in which ​“our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike.” It was April 2, which Trump deemed ​“Liberation Day,” and he was declaring ​“economic independence” from the rest of the world. The message was that of an underdog finally standing up against abuse. Workers have ​“watched in anguish as foreign leaders have stolen our jobs, foreign cheaters have ransacked our factories and foreign scavengers have torn apart our once beautiful American dream,” the president said. ​“We had an American dream that you don’t hear so much about.” The headlines were dramatic. ​“Trump’s tariffs mark the end of an era for free trade in North America,” the Washington Post proclaimed. But what were the president’s actual grievances? About five minutes into the announcement, Trump started waving what he called a ​“special book” back and forth, like a prosecutor holding up evidence in a courtroom. The misdeeds against the United States, he said, are ​“detailed in a very big report by the U.S. Trade Representative.” The document, the 2025 National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers, is a 377-page laundry list of what the United States views as ​“trade barriers” but what people in other countries might see as legitimate protections and regulations. These barriers, for example, include a bird-flufood safety measure in Morocco and a requirement in Nigeria that certain imports are certified ​“safe for human use and consumption.” They also include Canada’s ​“comprehensive agenda to achieve zero plastic waste by 2030” and Colombia’s requirements that imports of U.S. milk powder meet lactic acid and other quality standards. The barriers Trump cited in his Liberation Day address are, in many cases, measures that protect working-class people in the United States and around the world. There is little clarity about the trade deals Trump claims to be pursuing; his administration says he wants to negotiate 90 deals in 90 days. But there is every reason to be concerned he is using tariffs as leverage to advance some of the most coercive aspects of U.S. power: to undermine national sovereignty of other countries, trample on public goods and expand the brute power of the United States and its multinational corporations. Put another way: Behind all the lunch pail rhetoric, antiestablishment posturing and feigned concern for the working class, what Trump is proposing is more heavy-handed, anti-worker, military-driven economic policies. But the situation is not just ​“free trade” as usual. It is an agenda to expand corporate power, in the hands of a president who takes coercion to new heights. In the same executive order that established ​“reciprocal tariffs” on April 2, Trump was explicit about setting up a protection racket. The order states that the United States may decide to reduce tariffs if a country changes its policies to ​“align sufficiently with the United States on economic and national security matters.” For Trump’s Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR), it’s a problem that South Korea prioritizes domestic technology for its own weapons production. South Korea is a close U.S. ally and hosts 80 U.S. military base sites and nearly 29,000 American troops. Yet, for this administration, South Korea must also keep its doors perpetually open to purchases from the American weapons industry, which is already the largest in the world. Among the unfair trade barriers that must be torn down, the USTR report says, are ​“policies that prioritize local technology and products over foreign defense technology.” Cathi Choi, executive director of Women Cross DMZ, which organizes for peace in Korea, explains that the idea aligns ​“with all of the vested financial interests in maintaining the forever war in Korea. Weapons manufacturers profit from this war, and it’s everyday people who are losing out.” The Korean War, to which the United States is officially a party, never formally ended, which has led to a dangerous demilitarized zone littered with landmines, as well as perpetual, forced family separations. The report’s mention of these ​“defense” barriers is no small thing, as the document provides guidance for trade policy under Trump. ​“This report lays out both the type of policies and the exact policies that the United States is trying to dismantle around the globe,” says Arthur Stamoulis, executive director of the Citizens Trade Campaign, a coalition of environmental, labor and other civil society groups. It’s ​“one of the best indicators we have right now of the Trump administration’s trade priorities.” The annual report typically skews pro-corporate. It’s been published every year since 1985, and the reports have purveyed ​“free trade” dogma under both Democratic and Republican administrations. But Trump’s national trade estimate is more extreme than in recent years, especially when it comes to opposing big tech regulations, like privacy protections, and pushing back against most anything that would limit profits for the weapons industry. The report reads like a corporate wish list, identifying environmental protections and public health and safety measures as barriers to trade. And Trump is using tariffs as a bludgeon, to force other countries to agree to these demands. “It’s really the coercion of the tariff threat that’s new,” says Léa Auffret, a Brussels-based leader with the Transatlantic Consumer Dialogue, a network of 76 consumer and digital rights groups. The 2025 report marks an escalation from previous years when it comes to the U.S. weapons industry, and the barriers to U.S. weapons companies in South Korea it mentioned were never brought up under Biden. The report also charges that measures around the world that limit the purchasing of American arms are barriers to trade, from Brazil’s prioritization of domestic defense manufacturing to Colombia’s requirement of ​“government-to government agreements for some defense procurements.” In all, there are 62 mentions of ​“defense” in the 2025 report, up from 29 in 2024 and 33 in 2023. It also mentions more jurisdictions (countries and regions) — 17 in 2025, versus 11 in 2024 and 15 in 2023. But the USTR is not just protecting American weapons companies. The new report also targets environmental policies, including Thailand’s renewable energy incentive, which ​“aims to increase biofuel and renewable energy consumption to 30% by 2037.” Climate change poses an immediate existential threat to Thailand: Bangkok is sinking into the sea as ocean levels rise, and the capital could be 40% flooded by 2030, according to the World Bank. The report also names a European Union plan to reduce deforestation as a trade barrier, as well as an EU regulation to protect public health and the environment from toxic chemicals, including carcinogens. Labor unions supported the regulation, known by its acronym REACH, when it was first implemented in 2007; workers had a stake in ensuring they were not exposed to hazardous chemicals on the job. It’s not the first time the EU’s chemical regulations have been in the crosshairs of the United States. When the Obama administration tried, in 2013, to negotiate the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, a massive trade deal, the administration also took issue with the EU’s chemical regulations, along with a host of other protections, from ​“reimbursement of medicines to how we treat food safety,” Auffret recalls. In light of Trump’s national trade estimate report, she is bracing for more. “When your laws are listed, you’re under pressure,” Auffret says. ​“It’s a signal from the U.S., ​‘We’re watching this issue and we’re going to bring it up and up and up all over again.’ ” Esther Lynch, general secretary of the European Trade Union Confederation, says ​“there can be no doubt” that the Trump administration is going to use trade deals to undermine protections around the world. “We are calling on the [European] Commission not to give in to this type of bullying,” Lynch says. The report lists public health and safety measures, too, as barriers to trade, including higher standards and regulations on vehicle safety in Japan, Taiwan and Egypt. Egypt has one of the highest rates of deadly road traffic accidents in the world, killing around 12,000 people a year. The so-called barriers continue into, for example, price caps on coronary stents and knee implants in India. The report also identifies the Indian Patents Act that imposes limits on frivolous patents, which thereby helps ward off pharmaceutical monopolies, as a barrier. This law helps keep the cost of medicines down in a country where 7% of the population—or 100 million people — are thrown into poverty every year because of healthcare spending.K.M. Gopakumar is a New Delhi-based legal advisor and senior researcher with the Third World Network, which promotes just and sustainable development in the Global South. He says this language is concerning, because ​“price control offers an important tool to protect people from the exploitation of commercial actors.” When it comes to the regulation of big tech, Trump’s report has more corporate giveaways to ​“commercial actors” than the Biden administration. Trump’s USTR identifies ​“digital trade barriers” in 35 countries plus the European Union, and takes aim at the regulation of artificial intelligence, privacy protections and digital services taxes, which allow countries to tax big tech companies that aren’t physically located within their borders. ​“In essence, President Trump has declared a trade war on countries who have the temerity to regulate Big Tech in the interests of their people,” Public Citizen, a watchdog organization, asserted in a statement. The 2024 report recognized that countries have ​“a sovereign right to adopt measures in furtherance of legitimate public purposes,” wording that had given some social justice organizations hope that the USTR, under Katherine Tai, would take a different tack. Melinda St. Louis, the director of Public Citizen’s Global Trade Watch, says, ​“Last year’s report under President Biden had a more nuanced approach, removing a number of public interest laws from the list. But now they’re back in.” Canada’s policy to decrease plastic waste, for example, was included in 2022 but then omitted in 2023 and 2024. Now it’s back. The very concept of a ​“non-tariff barrier” to trade has been used since the Nixon administration as a euphemism for steamrolling basic public goods and regulations to make way for corporate profits, David Dayen points out in The American Prospect. Stamoulis, of the Citizens Trade Campaign, is concerned that the concept is now at the center of Trump’s trade policy. ​“This is the most powerful country on Earth dictating what governments are and aren’t allowed to do to protect the health and well-being of their populations on a day-to-day basis,” he says. ​“This impacts food safety, access to medicine, online safety. Real stuff with real life-and death consequences.” On Liberation Day, Trump announced a 10% baseline tariff on all countries, as well as dramatically steeper ​“reciprocal tariff ” rates for dozens of countries from South Korea to Taiwan to China. The steeper rates were soon suspended for 90 days, except on China, to allow Trump to negotiate trade deals — an open strategy to use tariffs as a stick to extract concessions. (Though on May 12, the United States reached an agreement to temporarily reduce its tariffs on China to 30%, while China cuts its import duty to 10% on U.S. goods.) We already know that Trump has a propensity toward using tariffs to reward friends. He did so during his first term, when he imposed tariffs on some imports from China in 2018, yet granted exemptions to donors and associates. A 2024 study in the Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis found that companies had a 1 in 5 chance of getting an exclusion from the tariffs if they had donated to Republican candidates, versus a 1 in 10 chance if they had given to Democrats. There is reason to think that this trend is continuing into the present. ProPublica found that firms with political connections, or those that heavily lobby the Trump administration, ​“might be winning carve-outs” from sanctions. And the Washington Post found that, amid tariff trade talks, U.S. embassies and the State Department are pressing countries to license with Starlink, the satellite internet company owned by Elon Musk, Trump’s powerful associate and largest donor. The Liberation Day tariffs are far more sweeping than any in Trump’s first term, and any concessions will be extracted at gunpoint. The guns are not just metaphorical. There are signs that Trump will try to use tariffs, or trade more broadly, to fortify the U.S. military, which is by far the most heavily funded on the planet, with an estimated 750 military bases around the globe. Bloomberg reported April 21 that Trump has ​“raised the financial contribution Tokyo makes to support U.S. military bases in Japan as an issue of concern, including before a meeting with Japanese trade negotiator Ryosei Akazawa last week.” (There are at least 50,000 U.S. troops stationed in Japan, where U.S. military bases have faced local protests for decades over environmental pollution, sexual assaults and other issues.) “China is clearly the number-one target of these tariff policies,” says Lindsay Koshgarian, program director for the National Priorities Project, which produces research about military spending. ​“Diplomatic relationships between the U.S. and China have fallen apart. This is a key ingredient setting us up for actual military conflict.” In response to the ​“reciprocal tariffs,” China is stepping up its own efforts to cultivate trade and investment deals with other countries, a move that could ultimately weaken the U.S. empire. But even this tit for tat has consequences. ​“This is the classic Cold War arrangement of lack of diplomacy and aligning countries against each other,” says Koshgarian. ​“There’s the possibility not just of direct war, but proxy wars and military buildup.” Trump has used tariffs to bolster other violent aspects of the U.S. security state. Even before declaring Liberation Day, he used the threat of tariffs to press countries into participating in his imprisonment and deportation of immigrants, or escalating their own border militarization. In January, for example, Trump successfully used the threat of tariffs to pressure Colombia into accepting flights of deported migrants. (Colombia had initially resisted to protest the administration’s poor treatment of migrants.) In February, Trump threatened tariffs unless Mexico deployed its military to parts of the border with allegedly high rates of border crossing. Trump already has one major domestic policy proposal we can review to understand his trade priorities. His proposal of a $1 trillion military budget is the most bloated domestic industrial policy we have in this country (and is actually higher when militarized spending in other budgets is included). Every year, around half of the military budget goes to military contractors like Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics, which are manufacturing the bombs being dropped on Yemen and Gaza or loaded onto the warships encircling China. In turn, Trump’s USTR does the bidding of the U.S. weapons industry, giving countries black marks for measures limiting U.S. weapons industry profits. “I think what we’re witnessing is an embrace of all the tools of U.S. imperialism,” says David Vine, a political anthropologist and author of Base Nation: How U.S. Military Bases Abroad Harm America and the World. According to Vine, we are seeing this imperial bent with Trump’s territorial claims, ​“threatening to invade and seize Greenland,Gaza, Canada, Panama. “He is embracing forms of economic imperialism that certainly have been part of past administrations, but he’s embracing them in profoundly broader ways and deeper ways.” No doubt, capital was not happy with Trump’s announced reciprocal tariffs. The stock market tanked near bear market territory, and millionaires and billionaires took the rare step of speaking out against Trump’s policies. But just because the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase and BlackRock vocally denounced them doesn’t mean they’re somehow a bulwark against the excesses of capital; the pushback likely came against uncertainty, day-to day volatility and caprice, rather than against the ultimate goal of maximizing American corporate power. “Trump is trying to use the failures of the system to win workers’ votes,” says Manuel Pérez-Rocha, an associate fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies, who has spent nearly three decades researching trade. ​“But workers are being defrauded.” There is a debate to be had about the role sectoral tariffs could play in a larger industrial policy to protect wages and working conditions. United Auto Workers, for example, has argued in favor of certain tariffs and even praised Trump’s auto tariffs in late March, parting with the Canadian auto union Unifor. Labor journalist Luis Feliz Leon has suggested there are more internationalist frameworks for labor to take up, like cross-border coordination focused on protecting workers throughout corporate supply chains. But perhaps Trump’s reciprocal tariffs are not, functionally, tariffs at all. As David Dayen argued in The American Prospect on April 3, they’re best understood as sanctions, ​“only he’s doing it against the whole world, all at once, for the assumed harm of ​‘ripping off ’ the United States for decades.” As Dayen wrote: ​“It is no different from a mob boss moving into town and sending his thugs to every business on Main Street, roughing up the proprietors and asking for protection money so they don’t get pushed out of business.” One major thing Trump’s tariffs have in common with sanctions: On Liberation Day, Trump invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 as the authority for his reciprocal tariffs. For decades, the act has been used by presidents to impose sweeping— and devastating — economic sanctions on countries from Venezuela to Cuba to Iran to Vietnam. Before Trump took office, it had been used by presidents 69 times, according to the Congressional Research Service, and it ​“sits at the center of the modern U.S. sanctions regime.” But there are also key differences. Sanctions are framed as punitive against ​“enemy” countries, whereas reciprocal tariffs are ostensibly aimed at trade relations with the entire world. And they are being used against U.S. allies, raising questions about whether Trump is pursuing empire in traditional terms, by expanding spheres of American influence. Whether or not reciprocal tariffs constitute formal sanctions, Trump is using them (or the threat of them) as a cudgel against other countries in what appears to be a bid to project American strength. They should be viewed as part of a longer history of the United States using economic pressure to achieve might. Even should Trump ultimately be bluffing, his bluffing has tremendous economic and policy implications, as we are seeing with the global frenzy to respond to tariff threats. This is true even as U.S. courts question the fundamental legitimacy of the ​“Liberation Day” tariffs, with the chance that they could be overthrown for good, though the Trump administration is digging in its heels. Does this moment mark a break from neoliberalism, or an intensification of it? Are we closer to a 19th- or 20thcentury colonialism, or a more modern form of economic nationalism coupled with imperialism? Trump himself has been erratic: He has presented himself as a defender of American workers despite waging an unprecedented war on the basic rights of workers to collectively bargain, meanwhile gutting public programs for the poor at a headspinning pace. He bemoans the free trade system while embracing its most destructive components, such as opposition to public health, environmental protections and welfare programs, and his own renegotiation of NAFTA during his first term ended up being a huge disappointment for workers. And there are reasons to think there are divisions within the Trump administration, as Elon Musk parts with Trump on tariffs while some advisors, like Peter Navarro, double down. Ultimately, it’s not rhetoric or buzzwords that are important, but the material policies the most powerful person on Earth is advancing. And while it is difficult to know what is going on in the president’s psyche, there is a consistent throughline that runs throughout his actions: marrying trade and militarism as a means to undermine other countries’ sovereignty and democratic decision-making, and projecting an image of American strength that is rooted in violent domination and the erosion of the welfare state. On Liberation Day, Trump stood on the Rose Garden lawn and called out ​“American steelworkers, auto workers, farmers and skilled craftsmen, we have a lot of them here with us today. They really suffered gravely.” And they have, in the United States and around the world, due to decades of pro-corporate measures that have battered workers and left them without basic protections. It’s a trend Trump is by no means reversing, but escalating — complete with new, faux-populist branding — at a breakneck pace.

Title: JPMorgan to accept Bitcoin ETFs as loan collateral, consider digital holdings in evaluations

JP Morgan integrates Bitcoin ETFs and digital asset holdings into lending criteria amid growing institutional confidence. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. JPMorgan is set to begin accepting Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds as collateral for loans, Bloomberg News reported on June 4. The lender also plans to consider digital asset holdings when evaluating a client’s net worth and liquid assets, placing crypto alongside traditional categories such as equities, vehicles, and fine art when assessing lending eligibility. The move signals growing institutional confidence in digital assets and an evolving approach to wealth management under a more permissive regulatory landscape in the US. The program will initially include BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and will be made available to both trading and wealth-management clients in the coming weeks, the report said, citing individuals familiar with the matter. The shift positions the largest US bank to compete more aggressively as crypto investment products gain traction among retail and high-net-worth clients alike. The policy will be implemented globally across JPMorgan’s private client tiers, offering structured credit backed by crypto ETF holdings. While the bank had previously reviewed such collateral on a case-by-case basis, the new framework formalizes the practice and paves the way for the inclusion of additional spot Bitcoin ETFs over time. Bitcoin ETFs have seen rapid growth since their debut in January 2024, with US-listed products now overseeing more than $128 billion in assets. Their popularity has surged in tandem with a broader political and institutional embrace of the sector following the election of President Donald Trump. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has consistently expressed personal skepticism about Bitcoin but reaffirmed the firm’s commitment to providing access for clients seeking exposure. He recently said the lender would “support” Bitcoin since clients want it even if he doesn’t like it personally during the bank’s May investor presentation. JP Morgan is also involved in a joint venture with other major Wall Street lenders looking to launch a stablecoin. The decision comes amid a marked shift in Washington’s approach to digital assets. Since returning to office, President Donald Trump has backed a series of pro-crypto policies, dismantling several barriers that previously deterred large banks from engaging fully with the sector. His administration’s stance, bolstered by industry donations and growing political support, has fueled renewed optimism across US markets and digital assets. Trump-affiliated firms have also expanded their presence in the crypto ecosystem, from Bitcoin treasury purchases and a spot ETF to speculative ventures involving meme tokens and infrastructure play With traditional finance and digital assets increasingly intertwined, JPMorgan’s collateralization policy marks a significant step in the institutionalization of crypto. As demand for yield, liquidity, and alternative exposure continues to rise, banks are racing to offer products that bridge old and new markets.

Stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group may price its upcoming initial public offering (IPO) well above its marketed range after demand from investors far outpaced supply, according to Bloomberg. The company has reportedly received orders for more than 25 times the number of shares available in the offering. Circle is expected to finalize its pricing following U.S. market hours on Wednesday. Circle’s most recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) showed plans to sell 32 million shares at a range between $27 and $28 apiece. At the high end of that range, the IPO would value the company at roughly $7.2 billion on a fully diluted basis. Investors placing orders could include major institutions such as BlackRock and Ark Invest. Allocations will favor buyers who plan to hold the stock over the long term, according to the report. The outsized interest signals strong demand for exposure to crypto-related firms, even as the industry navigates an evolving regulatory landscape. Circle, best known for issuing the USDC stablecoin, plays a critical role in the blockchain-based payments and finance infrastructure.

Title: Dan Ives' Wedbush ETF tracking AI stocks launches

Dan Ives, a tech analyst known for his bullish calls on Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla, and the generative AI boom, is offering investors a way to buy into his thesis — literally. On Tuesday, Wedbush Securities, where Ives is the managing director, launched the Dan Ives Wedbush AI Revolution ETF (ticker: IVES), a portfolio of 30 U.S. tech companies selected by Ives and his team for their exposure to AI. The fund trades on the NYSE Arca and carries a 0.75% expense ratio. The ETF includes familiar names such as Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla (TSLA), and Palantir (PLTR) — companies Ives has championed as foundational to the next phase of digital transformation. The ETF tracks what Wedbush calls the “Ives AI 30,” a list of companies the company sees as best positioned to commercialize and scale AI across sectors — from semiconductors to cloud platforms to next-gen software. “It’s based on our research,” Ives told CNBC. “As new companies come in, then some companies could come out. This is a living organism, in terms of this AI 30. It’s not static. And that’s a key part of the theme here, because the theme will continue to evolve.” That puts the fund into what Wedbush executives say is a bit of a hybrid category. “We’re kind of walking this line between active and passive,” said Cullen Rogers, chief investment officer at Wedbush Fund Advisers, who is overseeing the ETFs day-to-day operations. “We’re just looking to leverage Dan’s ideas as well as we can in an institutional framework... that gives investors a consistent, predictable structure.” Ives has been among Wall Street’s most vocal AI bulls, describing the moment as a generational investment opportunity. In recent client notes, he’s called AI “the biggest tech transformation in over 40 years” and likened AI chips to “the new gold and oil.” “The AI revolution is the biggest tech theme we’ve ever seen,” Ives told Yahoo Finance. He said he started the ETF “because it’s about the second, third, fourth derivatives of AI playing out, and that’s the important thing for investors.” The launch lands at a time when AI-related stocks are surging. But whether or not the market stays this hot is a big question. “Dan’s track record speaks for itself,” Wedbush CEO Gary Wedbush said in a press release. “He’s been identifying the drivers of tech disruption for years, and the IVES ETF gives investors a chance to follow that insight in a disciplined, transparent way.” Wedbush is betting that the AI rally is far from over — and that the company’s strategy can stand out as the space matures.

Title: ‘I think the build up is so much worse’: Leaving Cert students relieved after first exam completed

Emotions were high this morning in Belmayne Educate Together Secondary School (ETSS) in north Dublin, where the school’s first cohort of sixth year students began their Leaving Certificate exams with English Paper 1. For Zuzanna Zoltowska (18), anticipating the exams has been nerve-racking. “It’s honestly just a stressful experience ... Going into that exam I was like ‘Oh my God, I’m going to die.’” Zoltowska wants to study physics in Dublin City University (DCU), a subject that she is feeling more confident about tackling. “I think I have one of those more technical minds. English isn’t my strongest subject, I’ll say that.” [ Carl O’Brien: ‘Day one done’ - Leaving Cert tips for students and their supportersOpens in new window ] Her six years at Belmayne ETSS, which was established in 2019, have “gone by really fast”. “Until the last second you’re like, it’s not going to happen, and then suddenly you’re in the room and you’re doing your Leaving Cert.” The “mixture of anxiety and tiredness” school principal Aisling Kenevey saw among Zoltowska and her classmates before they turned over their first exam papers on Wednesday morning had been replaced by relief and animated reflection by 11.50am. Students gathered around their English teacher, Sinéad McGowan, to dissect the paper. Ms McGowan said students in her class had the chance to show off their creative flair with the opportunity to write a short story about their family pet, a task several gravitated towards. “I have a lot of lads that are really funny so I think they really leaned into that and their sense of humour will shine out, hopefully.” The theme of the underdog resonated with students who took the Higher Level English paper this morning. “This year we feel like the underdogs,” said Ms McGowan, “I think they connected emotionally with that one because they do feel hard done by in that the inflated grades ended just in time for them.” A “postmarking adjustment” applied to students’ grades this year will reduce from 7 per cent to 5.5 per cent, meaning students’ grades will be lower, on aggregate, compared with the bumper grades achieved over recent years. English is Sarah Osbourne’s (18) favourite subject, and one she wants to continue in college. She has Arts in Maynooth and a creative writing course in Blackrock College on her Central Applications Office (CAO) form. There was a period where I wanted to drop out,” said Osbourne, who is now glad she decided to complete her Leaving Certificate. “Those last two years make or break you. They push you and then once you’re finished it’s just such a relief. I think that the build up is so much worse.” Páidí Malone (19) is hoping to study politics and history in DCU while Arron Kavanagh (18) plans “to start working and save up a bit of money, probably go travelling”. Cormac Taaffe (18) has “an electrician apprenticeship lined up” for next year, while Ilyas Ugurlu (18) is looking forward to studying engineering technology.

Title: Constellation Energy Stock Up On Meta Deal. More AI Energy Plays Ahead
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2025/06/04/constellation-energy-stock-up-on-meta-deal-more-ai-energy-plays-ahead/

ByPeter Cohan ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Big tech’s appetite for energy could means upside for nuclear power stocks ETTERS, PENNSYLVANIA - SEPTEMBER 21: The Three Mile Island Nuclear Plant is seen on September 21, ... More 2024 from across the river in Etters, Pennsylvania. Microsoft and Constellation Energy reached a deal that would restart Unit 1 of the Three Mile Island Nuclear plant, which was previously retired in 2019. (Photo by Matthew Hatcher/Getty Images) Data center demand for energy could grow 160% by 2030, according to Goldman Sachs. Constellation Energy runs nuclear power plants that big tech companies are using to run AI chatbots. Since last September, Constellation Energy stock has risen, fallen, and recovered. Talen Energy — which struck a deal now in limbo with AWS — could also benefit from this demand. Shares of Constellation Energy — which contracted to provide Microsoft nuclear power from Three Mile Island, as I wrote in a September 2024 Forbes post — have risen 29% this year, according to GoogleFinance. Will the stock price rise further? There are two reasons to consider doing so: I would hesitate to buy Constellation Energy because the shares have been volatile and analysts estimate they are somewhat overvalued. "It's clear that we're in a whole new ball game on cost," Constellation CEO Joseph Dominguez said on a company earnings call last month, reported Reuters. “Certain natural gas plant builds, for example, have tripled in cost over the last decade in some cases,” he added. Nevertheless, demand for nuclear power is likely to grow and other providers — such as PacifiCorp — may be worth considering. Generative AI fueled significant demand for energy in 2024 and is likely to grow considerably by 2028. Last year data centers used 200 terawatt-hours of energy — between 27% and 38% of which powered AI-specific servers, according to the Department of Energy. That is about the amount of power Thailand uses in a year, noted the DOE. By 2028, much more energy will go to data centers. Between 2024 and 2028, data center consumption of U.S. electricity may triple, from its current 4.4% to 12%, DOE notes. AI’s share of that energy will rise substantially. Between 2024 and 2028, the power going to AI-specific purposes will rise at a 32.6% average annual rate to 244 terawatt-hours per year — the midpoint of a forecast range between 165 and 326 terawatt-hours per year, DOE estimated. Nuclear energy accounts for a fraction of the U.S. energy supply but that is expected to grow in the future. Today, only 20% of electricity here comes from nuclear — representing “a fraction of AI data centers’ operations,” reported MIT Technology Review. While Meta, Amazon, and Google have joined a pledge to triple the world’s nuclear capacity by 2050, additional nuclear capacity could take “years, perhaps decades, to materialize,” MIT Technology Review noted. Last September, Constellation Energy announced a deal to supply nuclear energy to Microsoft — and on June 3, Meta inked a very different nuclear deal, according to CNBC. Constellation — which owns the Three Mile Island facility in Pennsylvania that suffered an accident in March 1979 — signed a 20-year agreement for Microsoft to pay the nuclear energy leader about $16 billion, last September, noted my Forbes column. This week Meta signed a 20-year agreement to buy “about 1.1 gigawatts of nuclear power from Constellation’s Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois,” beginning in 2027, CNBC reported. While terms of the deal were not disclosed, Meta will not use the power for its data centers. Instead, Constellation — which will expand Clinton’s output by 30 megawatts — will keep supplying the power to the regional grid while contributing to Meta’s “goal of 100% clean electricity,” wrote CNBC. Before Meta’s commitment, Clinton was at risk of closing in 2027 when its zerio emissions credit expires. “We are proud to partner with Meta,” Dominguez told CNBC. “They figured out that supporting the relicensing and expansion of existing plants is just as impactful as finding new sources of energy. Sometimes the most important part of our journey forward is to stop taking steps backwards,” he added. Meta also expressed enthusiasm for this arrangement. “Securing clean, reliable energy is necessary to continue advancing our AI ambitions,” Meta head of global energy Urvi Parekh said. “We are proud to help keep the Clinton plant operating for years to come and demonstrate that this plant is an important piece to strengthening American leadership in energy.” It is not all good news for Constellation investors. The company’s stock rose sharply on the announcements of these deals — yet it has fallen after recent earnings reports. Moreover, analysts view the stock as somewhat overvalued. For example, after the September 20 announcement of its deal with Microsoft, the stock rose 22%, according to SeekingAlpha. Moreover, the deal with Meta propelled Constellation’s shares up 15%. However, Constellation has lost value after recent earnings reports. For the June 2024-ending quarter, the company fell short of earnings and revenue expectations, noted my Forbes post. While the company’s third-quarter profit and revenue that beat expectations and raised its full-year outlook — which it had not done in more than a year — Constellation’s stock price fell after a disappointing regulatory ruling, according to MarketWatch. To be sure, Constellation’s fourth quarter 2024 report featured better than expected revenue and operating income — however, the stock lost about a third of its value in the six weeks following the report. Finally, Constellation stock fell in May after reporting disappointing earnings for the March 2025-ending quarter. Rising costs to build and operate its electricity infrastructure “caused the major U.S. power company to miss Wall Street expectations for first-quarter profit,” noted Reuters. Wall Street considers the stock slightly overvalued. Based on 12 Wall Street analysts offering 12 month price targets, Constellation Energy stock trades slightly above the average price target of $303.20, noted TipRanks. In March 2024, Talen Energy struck a deal to sell for $650 million its Cumulus data center — which is adjacent to a Pennsylvania nuclear plant, reported Data Center Frontier — to Amazon Web Services. However, in November 2024, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ruled to block an interconnection service agreement that would have allowed Talen to increase the power supplied to the AWS data center co-located with its Susquehanna nuclear plan due to uncertainty about whether it would boost electricity rates, noted Data Center Frontier. Talen’s first quarter report echoed Constellation’s. Higher interest and energy expenses contributed to Talen’s first quarter loss. The utility’s interest costs “jumped 25.4% to $74 million during the reported quarter, while total energy expenses increased by 10.8% to $235 million,” Reuters reported. The absence of gains from the 2024 sale of the Cumulus data center to AWS also diminished Talen’s profit. If Talen can sell more such nuclear data centers to cloud services providers, its revenue, profits and stock price could rise.

Title: Amazon files WARN notice for Reno fulfillment center closure

Amazon has filed notice with the state of Nevada for employee layoffs as the company moves forward with closing its Reno fulfillment center this summer. A WARN notice was sent by Amazon on Monday, June 2, and posted by the Nevada Department of Employment, Training, and Rehabilitation on Wednesday morning. It confirmed that it will close its facility at 8000 N. Virginia St. on Aug. 2, 2025. WARN notices are 60-day notifications required by law when a company enacts massive layoffs. The notice is named after the 1989 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act. WARN notices are required during: The Reno Gazette Journal first confirmed the planned closure of the Reno facility with Amazon in October. At the time, the facility employed about 500 people. Today, Amazon’s Reno fulfillment center has about 325 people working at the site, according to the company. Amazon has also provided transfers to more than 100 employees. “As we wind down operations at our Reno fulfillment center, we’re working closely with all affected employees to provide the latest information about transfer opportunities at other Amazon facilities in Reno and elsewhere,” an Amazon spokesperson told the Reno Gazette Journal. “For employees who choose not to remain with Amazon following this closure, we’re offering support through this transition.” Amazon also confirmed that it still plans to open a new same-day delivery facility in south Reno. Amazon filed a building permit in September for a new facility at the 580 South industrial center just across Mount Rose Highway from the Shayden Summit Reno mall. Employees affected by the closure of the Reno fulfillment will be given advance notice about job opportunities at the new same-day delivery center, according to Amazon. Construction of the new south Reno facility, however, has been pushed back from its initial late 2025 completion date. Work on Amazon’s new south Reno facility is expected to continue through 2026, Amazon confirmed. Amazon first opened its RNO4 fulfillment center in Reno in 2015. At the time, the 630,000-square-foot facility — which shipped its first package on Jan. 21 — was touted not just for its size but also technologies such as embedded wires that sync with forklifts and allow for the use of very narrow aisles plus a machine that can build on-demand custom-size boxes as needed. In just a decade, however, the Reno fulfillment center is now considered as an older facility and Amazon decided to not renew its lease. The company is also focusing more on increasing its number of smaller same-day delivery centers. “We weigh a variety of factors when deciding where we open new facilities, enhance existing facilities, and close others — including business need as well as how we can best improve the experience for employees, customers and partners,” said Amazon spokesperson Steve Kelly at the time. “With our lease expiring at our facility in Reno, we’ve made the difficult decision to end operations out of that site next year.”

Title: Roads policing numbers at historic low of 618 gardaí, figures show
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/2025/06/04/garda-road-policing-numbers-drop-safety/
Time Published: 2025-06-04T17:03:39Z
Full Content:
The number of gardaí involved in roads policing units has dropped to a historic low of 618, according to the latest Department of Justice figures. There has been a steady decline since 2009 when official figures for those engaged in roads policing began to be regularly published. That year 1,046 gardaí were assigned to road policing duties and the numbers involved fell to a low of 623 in 2017. They rose over the next four years to 736 in 2021 but have fallen again, down to 627 last year. In January this year the number of gardaí in the units dropped to 626, to 623 in February and was down to 618 by the end of April. Every region and county has seen the number of roads policing gardaí drop, in some cases by more than 50 per cent since 2009. Garda Commissioner Drew Harris told the Oireachtas Transport Committee in May last year “we plan to add 75 gardaí to roads policing this year and a further 75 in 2025, and working towards this, we are proactively recruiting into our roads policing units”. A recruitment campaign was undertaken in eastern, north-western and southern regions last year. But Susan Gray of road safety campaign group Parc said the figures show a reduction of nine members at the end of April compared to last year. “They are just playing catch up all the time.” The figures show the Sligo/Leitrim Garda Division had 23 members in 2021, but it was down to 11 in February this year. Donegal had 31 Garda roads policing members in 2021, which fell to 21 last year, a reduction of 10 officers in three years. Official Road Safety Authority data shows 17 road deaths in Donegal last year, “the highest number since 2010 when 19 died”, Ms Gray said. Sixty-nine people have died on Irish roads so far this year, she said. In the Dublin Metropolitan Area the numbers have dropped from their 2009 high but have remained consistent over the last two to three years. In Dublin’s eastern region which goes from Dún Laoghaire to Stepaside and takes in Dundrum, Blackrock, Shankill and Cabinteely, the numbers dropped from 18 in 2009 to four in 2023 and rose to nine the following year, where they have remained. In Laois/Offaly there were 42 dedicated roads policing officers in 2009 which fell to 24 in 2023 and dropped to 18 in April this year. “It is very disappointing,” said Ms Gray. “Everybody talks about road safety being a priority and everywhere we look it’s obvious it’s not a priority,” she said. “We hoped to see the figures going up rather than down for gardaí involved in roads policing.” Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up for push alerts to get the best breaking news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phone Listen to In The News podcast daily for a deep dive on the stories that matter Marie O’Halloran is Parliamentary Correspondent of The Irish Times © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

BlackRock has been removed from Texas’s investment blacklist, a major reversal that follows the asset management giant’s decision to scale back some of its controversial climate commitments. The move, announced Tuesday by Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar, ends a three-year ban that had prevented state pension and investment funds from doing business with the world’s largest asset manager over its environmental, social and governance (ESG) policies. “This marks a meaningful shift,” Hegar said. “Texas has played a leadership role in standing up to financial institutions that try to push political agendas under the guise of environmental concern. We’re seeing a course correction.” Texas funds hold an estimated $50 billion in assets. A BlackRock spokesperson told The Post: “We appreciate the Comptroller’s resolution of this matter.” “More than $4 billion in Texas funds are invested with BlackRock,” the rep said. The Larry Fink-led company had $11.55 trillion in assets under management at the end of the fourth quarter in 2024. We are “proud to help millions of Texans retire with dignity and, on behalf of clients, invests over $400 billion in corporations, local governments, energy infrastructure and other private assets throughout the state,” the spokesperson said “These investments support the continued growth of the Texas economy.” BlackRock had drawn fire from Republican-led states like Texas for supporting climate-focused investment strategies and for its involvement in initiatives aimed at reducing global emissions. But over the past year, the New York City-based firm has distanced itself from some of those efforts. In January, it exited the Climate Action 100+ investor group. It also withdrew from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, a UN-backed coalition focused on reducing portfolio emissions. The rollback appears to have helped smooth tensions with officials in Texas, where fossil fuels remain a key pillar of the economy and political identity. The Texas comptroller’s office had added BlackRock and other financial firms to its restricted list in 2022 after lawmakers passed legislation targeting perceived boycotts of the oil and gas industry. That law required the comptroller to identify firms that “discriminate” against fossil fuel companies and to direct state funds to divest from them. Since then, the blacklist has become a flashpoint in the national debate over ESG investing. While many conservatives have argued that large asset managers wield too much influence in promoting progressive agendas, others — including some within the financial industry — warned that the restrictions risked limiting returns and politicizing fiduciary decision-making. BlackRock has repeatedly pushed back on claims that it engages in coordinated efforts to undermine the fossil fuel sector. “We never set out to penalize any company,” Hegar said Tuesday, “but we made clear there would be consequences for putting politics ahead of financial performance.” Despite the thaw in relations, BlackRock remains the subject of a separate legal fight with a coalition of Republican attorneys general, including Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who allege the firm has violated antitrust laws through its ESG commitments. BlackRock has denied the charges, calling them baseless. Advertisement

Title: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is ‘motivated by fear and guilt,’ biographer says

Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang may run one of the most important companies in the world, but he can’t credit his success to the power of positive thinking. “I think the most surprising thing about Jensen is that he’s almost totally driven by negative emotions,” said Stephen Witt, who spent hours interviewing the Nvidia co-founder for his book, “The Thinking Machine.” “This is his fuel. This is his gasoline, [and it’s] what makes him go is this anxiety,” he told CNBC. According to Witt, Huang fears Nvidia (NVDA), which is valued at more than $3.3 trillion, could fall apart at any time. Witt said he was surprised by how much negative emotions seem to motivate Huang, who “becomes very uncomfortable and nervous when things are going well.” Huang does best when acting like Nvidia is “on the brink of failure at all times,” Witt said. “This is the narrative he generates around himself — that he could fail at any time and be disgraced. And this is what motivates him.” Witt continued: “Jensen, of course, is an obvious, huge go-getter, but it’s all coming from this place of almost beating himself up for not working hard enough all the time. I didn’t expect to see that.” While that mindset might sound exhausting, it has worked well for Huang, who according to Forbes, is the 16th richest person in the world in 2025. Huang co-founded Nvidia in 1993 with two colleagues, and steered the company through an period where it almost had to close up shop just a few years later. Now, the chipmaker has never been more prolific. It reported $44.1 billion in revenue for the fiscal first quarter this year.

JPMorgan to Allow BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Shares as Loan Collateral Wall Street giant JP Morgan plans to allow its wealthy clients to use shares in crypto ETFs, like BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, as collateral for loans. Unnamed sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg, who first reported the news, that the bank will also begin taking crypto holdings into account when assessing clients' net worth and liquid assets. This would mean that crypto gets the same treatment as real estate and vehicles when assessing a client's ability to repay a loan. "We can confirm the contents of the Bloomberg story are accurate," a JP Morgan spokesperson told Decrypt in an email. The bank has had a love-hate relationship with Bitcoin. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has long been a Bitcoin skeptic, but recently said the bank would begin allowing customers to trade Bitcoin and Ethereum. The billionaire banker has said that Bitcoin is a "pet rock" and that crypto's "true use case" was for criminals. But the bank has long used blockchain—a technology launched by Bitcoin's creator—for its own projects to move money. JP Morgan is the latest high-profile traditional finance giant to offer clients exposure to crypto—a multi-trillion dollar asset class. The likes of Fidelity and Standard Chartered have also this year launched digital asset trading services for both institutional and retail clients. The Securities and Exchange Commission last year approved Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, giving investors previously shut out from the crypto investing world the ability to buy and sell digital assets via shares that trade on a stock exchange. Managed by the likes of BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale, the funds have been highly popular, with the Bitcoin products having the most successful launch in the history of ETFs. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has led the charge, and currently has over $70 billion in assets under management. Editor's note: This story was updated to add a comment from JP Morgan.

Title: Cuts to USAID severed longstanding American support for Indigenous people around the world
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/06/04/indigenous-affairs-doge-cuts/
Time Published: 2025-06-04T15:52:16Z
Full Content:
By GRAHAM LEE BREWER NEW YORK (AP) — Miguel Guimaraes Vasquez fought for years to protect his homeland in the Peruvian Amazon from deforestation related to the cocaine trade, even laboring under death threats from drug traffickers. A leader in an Indigenous rights group, Vasquez said such efforts were long supported by financial assistance from the U.S. Agency for International Development, which spent billions of dollars starting in the 1980s to help farmers in Peru shift from growing coca for cocaine production to legal crops such as coffee and cacao for chocolate. The agency funded economic and agricultural training and technology, and helped farmers gain access to international markets. But the Trump administration’s recent sweeping cuts to the agency have thrown that tradition of U.S. assistance into doubt, and Indigenous people in the Amazon worry that without American support there will be a resurgence of the cocaine market, increased threats to their land and potentially violent challenges to their human rights. “We don’t have the U.S. government with us anymore. So it can get really dangerous,” said Vásquez, who belongs to the Shipibo-Konibo people and is vice president of the Interethnic Association for the Development of the Peruvian Rainforest. “We think the situation is going to get worse.” Several Indigenous human rights defenders have been killed trying to protect their land, Vasquez said, and in some of those cases U.S. foreign aid provided money to help prosecute the slayings. “We really needed those resources,” he said. When Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, began dismantling USAID shortly after President Donald Trump began his second term, it all but eliminated U.S. foreign aid spending, including decades of support to Indigenous peoples around the world. USAID’s work with Indigenous peoples sought to address a variety of global issues affecting the U.S., according to former employees. Its economic development efforts created jobs in South America, easing the need for people to work in illicit drug markets and reducing the likelihood they would migrate to America seeking jobs and safety. And its support for the rights of Indigenous peoples to steward their own land offered opportunities to mitigate climate change. That included Vásquez’s organization, which was about to receive a four-year, $2.5 million grant to continue fighting illicit activity that affects Indigenous people in the region. Vásquez said that grant was rescinded by the new administration. In January, DOGE launched a sweeping effort empowered by Trump to fire government workers and cut trillions in government spending. USAID, which managed about $35 billion in appropriations in fiscal year 2024, was one of his prime targets. Critics say the aid programs are wasteful and promote a liberal agenda. Trump, Musk and Republicans in Congress have accused the agency of advancing liberal social programs. “Foreign assistance done right can advance our national interests, protect our borders, and strengthen our partnerships with key allies,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement in March. “Unfortunately, USAID strayed from its original mission long ago. As a result, the gains were too few and the costs were too high.” Musk last week announced his departure from the Trump administration, marking the end of a turbulent chapter that included thousands of layoffs and reams of litigation. Former USAID employees said political pressure from the U.S. often kept foreign governments from violating some Indigenous rights. In the three months since thousands of foreign aid workers were fired and aid contracts canceled, the Peruvian government has moved quickly to strip Indigenous people of their land rights and to tighten controls on international organizations that document human rights abuses. It’s now a serious offense for a nonprofit to provide assistance to anyone working to bring lawsuits against the government. The National Commission for Development and a Drug-Free Lifestyle, the country’s agency that fights drug trafficking, did not respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. “The impact was really, really strong, and we felt it really quickly when the Trump administration changed its stance about USAID,” Vásquez said. The U.S. spends less than 1% of its budget on foreign assistance. Tim Rieser, a senior foreign policy aide in the Senate who works for Democratic Vermont Sen. Peter Welch, called DOGE’s cuts to USAID a “mindless” setback to years of work. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. USAID’s work reached Indigenous communities around the world. It sought to mitigate the effects of human rights abuses in South America, created programs in Africa to enable Indigenous people to manage their own communities and led the global U.S. effort to fight hunger. One of the most recent additions to USAID’s work was incorporating international concepts of Indigenous rights into policy. Rieser, for instance, was responsible for crafting legislation that created an adviser within USAID to protect the rights and address the needs of Indigenous peoples. The adviser advocated for Indigenous rights in foreign assistance programs, including actions by the World Bank. “That provided Indigenous people everywhere with a way to be heard here in Washington,” Rieser said. “That has now been silenced.” That adviser position remains unfilled. Vy Lam, USAID’s adviser on Indigenous peoples, who said he was fired in March as part of the DOGE downsizing, said the idea of Indigenous rights, and the mandate to recognize them in foreign operations, was new to USAID. But it gained momentum under President Joe Biden’s administration. He said concepts such as “free, prior and informed consent” — the right of Indigenous people to give or withhold approval for any action that would affect their lands or rights — were slowly being implemented in American foreign policy. One of the ways that happened, Lam said, came in the form of U.S. political pressure on foreign governments or private industry to negotiate mutually beneficial agreements between Indigenous peoples and their governments. For instance, if an American company wanted to build a hotel in an area that could affect an Indigenous community, the U.S. could push for the deal to require Indigenous approval, or at least consultation. “We had that convening power, and that is the thing that I grieve the most,” Lam said. U.S. foreign aid workers were also able to facilitate the reporting of some human rights violations, such as when a human rights or environmental defender is jailed without charges, or Indigenous peoples are forced off their land for the establishment of a protected area. In some cases, USAID supported travel to the United Nations, where Indigenous leaders and advocates could receive training to navigate international bodies and document abuses. Last year, under the Biden administration, USAID awarded a five-year grant to support Indigenous LGBTQIA people through the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Indigenous People, an agency that offers financial support to Indigenous peoples to participate in the U.N. At $350,000 per year, it was the largest grant from any member state in the U.N., fund Secretary Morse Flores said. The money would have paid for attendance at the U.N. and other international bodies to report human rights abuses and to testify on foreign policy. In February, the fund received notice that the grant would be terminated. The State Department does not plan to fulfill its pledge to fund the remaining four years of the grant. In most cases, people receiving assistance to attend major meetings “are actual victims of human rights violations,” Flores said. “For someone who’s unable to come and speak up, I mean, it’s really just an injustice.” This story was published in partnership with Grist, a nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to reporting on climate change.

Title: CrowdStrike Stock Is Sinking, But Analysts Are Staying Bullish

Shares of CrowdStrike (CRWD) are falling Wednesday after the company's revenue forecasts came in short of estimates, but analysts are staying bullish on the cybersecurity software maker. Analysts from Bank of America, Deutsche Bank, Jefferies, and Oppenheimer all raised their price targets for CrowdStrike to $470, $450, $520, and $520, respectively. Of the analysts tracked by Visible Alpha, 25 call CrowdStrike a "buy," while four others rate it as a "hold," with an average price target of $488.39. Bank of America analysts, lifting their price target but downgrading the stock to "neutral," said they "favor CrowdStrike's fundamentals and growth prospects, but believe the valuation leaves only limited upside from the current level," adding that they expect revenue growth to accelerate in the back half of this year but slow in the coming years. UBS analysts, retaining their $545 price target as one of the most bullish on Wall Street, said they are "inclined to look past some of the near-term revenue headwinds from the company’s outage-related discounting program," which pressured first-quarter revenue and CrowdStrike's second-quarter forecasts. Analysts from Deutsche Bank said they are "bullish on CEO George Kurtz's articulation of how AI is expanding the attack surface and driving the need for better cyber defense (and thus more CrowdStrike)." However, they added that they "remain on the sidelines given valuation and our concerns for consolidation cyclicality." CrowdStrike shares were down 4% in recent trading to roughly $466, but are still up about 37% since the start of the year.

Her new book is The Genius Myth: A Curious History of a Dangerous Idea, and it explores how the definition of what it means to be a genius has changed radically over the centuries, how it became linked to all sorts of weird biological theories, and how Elon Musk has come to personify genius in our time (and whether his failure at the Department of Government Efficiency spells the end of his genius moment). Lewis and Reason's Nick Gillespie also talk about The Beatles; William Shockley, who turned to racial science after winning a Nobel Prize for helping to invent the transistor; and her notorious 2018 interview with Jordan Peterson for British GQ, which has racked up over 70 million views. 0:00— Introduction 1:36— The Genius Myth 7:20— How dead geniuses fueled national myths 11:30— Thomas Carlyle and the Great Man theory 18:18— Are inventions inevitable? 23:22— Francis Galton and eugenics 33:35— Pro-natalism and declining fertility rates 37:14— William Shockley 48:00— Shakespeare and The Beatles 57:22— Jackson Pollock, Lee Krasner, and the gender dimensions of genius 1:03:50— Lewis' Jordan Peterson interview 1:07:18— Germaine Greer and second wave feminism 1:11:05— The gender debate in the UK vs US 1:14:14— Elon Musk's rise and fall? 1:20:57— Do geniuses have second acts? Upcoming events: This is an AI-generated, AI-edited transcript. Check all quotes against the audio for accuracy. Nick Gillespie: Helen Lewis, thanks so much for talking to Reason. Helen Lewis: Thank you for having me. Let's start with the obvious question. The book is The Genius Myth: A Curious History of a Dangerous Idea, which is a great subtitle. But why did you write The Genius Myth? Do you know what, it's one of those things where it's evolved over time, so I may be now lying to myself about why I wrote it. But I did have a conversation with a friend a couple of years ago about the idea that—he has always said that genius is a right-wing concept, which I thought was a really interesting idea because it's about the individual over the collective. It's about people with sublime achievement who are not part of the common throng. And I thought that was interesting. I thought, well, I hear loads and loads of left-wing people use it very casually, and I don't think they're accepting this kind of idea behind it. And then that made me think, well, hang on a minute, what other ideas are kind of being smuggled in in that little word? And that's where the book kind of came from. That's fascinating. And it puts me in mind—the book is fantastic. I mean, it is a great read. It's better than 99 percent of novels I read. And I love—it's a series of stories about kind of crazy people and the people, including all of us, who enable them. But part of what you talk about in The Genius Myth is that being a genius meant radically different things in different eras. Explain in ancient Greece—and I don't know why we care about what ancient Greece thought about anything—but the Greeks talked about having genius, or being a genius meant that you were possessed with a visiting spirit. Can you explain what that means? Yeah, you have a genius—that's the original sense of it. You're visited by this spirit, and you know, it might be the muse of poetry speaks through you, or the muse of history. And they called it furor poeticus, furor divinus—divine fury. And I think that captures something really well. I don't know if you would describe yourself as a genius, Nick, but most of us wouldn't. But you must have had moments when you've sat down— No, very few people have defined me as a genius, so thank you. But you might have had times when you sit down to write a piece or do some piece of work, and it just clicks. Something just feels really good. And I think most writers probably spend most of their life kind of chasing that dragon for the rest of the time. You go, 'when will it come back?' And that's what writing should feel like, and most of the time it's just a kind of grind. So I think they did a very good thing then in capturing something that we've all felt to some extent. There are moments that work. You talk about how, particularly in the context of things like pop music and whatnot—and this is certainly true for writers and novelists in particular—you go on a streak where you are just performing at a higher level. I want to get into an argument about the Beatles for any number of reasons. It's independent of you—I have this argument every morning. But when you look at somebody like Paul McCartney, who you talk about in an interesting way, he's got to understand that whatever he's been doing for the past 40 years is not what he did for that 5- to 10-year period. He was on. So you go from that classical understanding of genius as a visiting spirit or something is speaking through you—which now is almost always the province of serial killers, right? I guess I had the dog talk to me, and it told me to kill me. They're the last classical geniuses in this tattered world. But then in the Renaissance things shift—the Renaissance and the early modern period. How does being a genius change in that period? Maybe even a little bit later than that, because the thing about the Renaissance is always that the word comes from rinascita—rebirth. So the idea was that they were, as they saw it, bringing back the classical tradition. And it was kind of quite imitative—you were trying to learn these things about proportion and form. Well, I don't want to get sidetracked. I'm just going to say yes—they were smuggling what they wanted to do by saying, "What we're really doing is merely bringing back these eras of former greatness." There's the American Renaissance in American literature, which was created in the 1940s about the pre–Civil War period. And I believe there's a racial journal now called American Renaissance, which—they want to rebirth things. So in this early modern period redefinition of genius, what's going on? Then you get this very, very important book that I had to say I didn't really know about, which is Giorgio Vasari's Lives of the Artists. And it is a group biography of—I have to say, all the artists that I would have known growing up because they were also Ninja Turtles, like Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael, Michelangelo. But there is a sense that that was a period of a kind of burst of creativity, and he puts them together in this kind of pantheon. And it's one of the first times that you begin to see, in a really systematic way—this is what I mean by the genius myth. These are stories that we tell about people who are innovators or scientists or artists. So you have, for example, the story of Leonardo da Vinci. And the myth that's imposed on him is that he couldn't settle on anything. He had a kind of—an uber level of ADHD. He was designing the helicopter, then he wanted to learn how to paint directly onto a wall using tempura, then he was doing something else. He was kind of a scatterbrain. We have all met that person in our first semester in college as well—who's just so brilliant. Obviously Leonardo accomplished a few things, as well. It's true—not all of the people that you meet in the first semester at college go on to paint the Mona Lisa, or anything like it, sadly. But what I was getting at is that the Mona Lisa wasn't really the Mona Lisa until centuries after it. Until it got stolen. This is one of my favorite things in all of it. It's the same way that Shakespeare died a respectable playwright, but he didn't die the guy that we should enthrone forever as the crowning jewel of English literature. That really a century later. And exactly the same thing with the Mona Lisa. The Mona Lisa was—and I'm going to be really rude here and say—quite a sludgy gray and green painting, and not seen as the crowning achievement of the Renaissance by any means. It gets stolen in the 1920s and ends up in Italy. And it becomes—actually, as lots of these things do—about national myths, because Leonardo was Italian or proto-Italian, but he was working for most of his life in France. So it becomes a kind of 'Who owns this great genius?' and 'Therefore, who should have the Mona Lisa?' And then it becomes a kind of inter-country fight. It's also great because, in the United States in particular, Italians have always claimed Christopher Columbus. But now many of us Italian Americans are like, "Oh, maybe he was working for Spain, and maybe he is a Jew, so forget it. We don't need Columbus anymore." He's not The Sopranos… But da Vinci is one model of a Renaissance genius. Talk about Michelangelo or some of the others. The person categorizing them said, "OK, well, there are different gradations." He seemed very much like a boy with a bunch of Pokémon dolls or something where he's rank ordering them things like that. Yeah, well, he definitely had a bias. He had a pro-Florentine bias. So he's quite rude about Titian, who was born—I think— Venice or the Alps. But he kind of gets relegated to second status because he's not from the right place. But Michelangelo, he uses as a different example, which is something you find all the time in genius myths: which is someone who had to struggle. So that's turned into a story about how hard it was to paint the Sistine Chapel, and how he had to design all the stuff you'll hear if you go on the tour of the Sistine Chapel. The other thing that you will know from visiting the Sistine Chapel is that it's a lot. It's quite—it is a statement, is it not? Yeah. And I think that's kind of fascinating too—that you have to have a level of ambition. The film critic called it white elephant art. Which he didn't intend as a compliment—these films that kind of announce themselves as a masterpiece. And I think that actually is also quite pertinent to this. The fact that Ulysses by James Joyce is very hard to read—not an enjoyable novel in the conventional sense—is actually taken as being a sign of its genius. The fact that the Sistine Chapel is big…if he'd done that much individual painting and separated it out by canvases, we wouldn't find it quite so impressive as this one—you know, what's that German word? Kunstkammerwerk—you know, the kind of the whole thing is it. You have that word written on your computer, and you use it in every conversation that you ever have. That's true. I do, actually. Yeah, you've rumbled me. But you know what I mean—like that idea of the kind of… You still see it now when you have like, oh, Birdman, it's filmed like it was in a single shot, or The Revenant, oh it only filmed in natural light, or Tom Hanks really lost all the weight for Cast Away, or Charlize Theron made herself ugly for Monster. These are kind of—there's a price to greatness. I like the movies where people gain weight, because anybody can lose weight, right? If we may jump forward a little bit—and I want to skip over him a little bit, both because he deserves to be forgotten, but I want to get to a later figure in Victorian England—but Thomas Carlyle pops up a couple of times in your work. And he is kind of the modern conceptualizer, right, of Great Man Theory, which is related to genius but it's not quite the same thing. Life writing takes form, and then you get the Industrial Revolution and capitalism. And what you then get is genius really as a marketing tool. So, if you're an artist in the 14th century, what you need is a rich aristocratic patron. If you're an artist in the 18th century, 19th century—well, actually, at this point there'd be things like, you know, gallerists start arriving, things like newspapers arrive, mass media arrives, and you might therefore be able to brand, basically. But what's interesting is that most of the time, or at least at that point, it seems to be less the person selling themselves as a genius, and they have a Boswell—or they have somebody around them who is writing them up as, like, "Oh, this is the real guy," like a hype man. A Flavor Flav. Yeah, everybody needs an 18th century Flavor Flav. Yes, it's true. But then you have somebody like Thomas Carlyle, who, you know, very much of a… in the context of his time, it's not like he was a right-winger. And he hated capitalism, certainly. And he hated all of the liberal economists who actually thought that Irish people and Blacks in Jamaica were human in the same way he was. But how does he talk about Great Man Theory, and how does that kind of add to the genius lore before it gets kind of quantified and mathematized later in that century? Yeah, he has this line, which I'm going to mangle, but it's something like, "The history of the world is, at root, only the history of great men." And that was very in keeping with a certain type of patrician Victorian thinking—that you just needed these once-in-a-generation personalities. One of their references would have been someone like Napoleon Bonaparte, the great French general. And I think there's a lot to that argument—that actually, the military decisions that Napoleon made at the times that he made them changed the history of Europe. He was a consequential figure. In the same way that now The Atlantic just ran a cover story on Donald Trump that said he's the most consequential president of the 21st century. I do think it's a reasonable point to say that some people are kind of hinge points in history. I was gonna make a joke about like, what's his competition so far though? You know, it's—zombie Abe or whatever. And you thought—"No, I love Obama and I would never say anything mean about him." Well, I know. I said, unfortunately, from my stupid libertarian point of view, I see an immense continuity between George W. Bush, Obama, Trump I, [Joe] Biden, Trump II. And it's not a good continuity. But, you know, this is part of what you're talking about when you talk about The Genius Myth—you're not saying everybody is exactly the same, and it's just a social construction that Leonardo gets called a great artist, but actually anybody around him was as good. But it is this storytelling and kind of creating this sense that these people are the limit of everything that we're doing. But with Carlyle—so Carlyle—I guess in a way systematic thinking— this is what the Enlightenment was about. And to some degree, the Renaissance—it hadn't quite got there. And you certainly get there with somebody like [Karl] Marx and [Freidrich] Engels, where they kind of say, actually it's the system. It's the base—typically the economic base—that actually determines everything else. So we might forgive Carlyle this one thing of not really understanding. Oh, I totally forgive him because, you know, what's the easiest thing to do is to go, "Actually, it's both," because it obviously is both, right? Some people do make decisions, but also they are products of fundamental forces that are in society. And I guess—now let me, because I outed myself on my libertarian podcast show as a libertarian—maybe it's people like Adam Smith who started to talk about how things don't just happen. There are a lot of kind of occult forces, invisible hands and whatnot, that create order among seeming chaos. And you could extend that to individuals. I feel like this is a big part of your life's work—the meta story that you tell now—which is just that it's a mix of both. It's circumstance and it's individual effort. And that should in no way ever be controversial, but it seems like it constantly needs to be relearned. Absolutely. Because you bring up Carlyle, and he was writing defensively. That's what I didn't really realize until I looked more at that stuff. I sort of assumed everybody in the Victorian era was swanning around going, "Of course the thing is that just a couple of men changed the world." But no—he was writing to defend that idea against what he saw as the kind of forces of egalitarianism. There's a fantastic book called How the Dismal Science Got Its Name by David Levy, which is a study mostly of how Carlyle and other people like him treated the Irish in popular culture and academic discourse basically in the long 19th century. And they were mad that people were saying, "No, actually the Irish are pretty much like the rest of us. They follow incentives. They're not all gorillas or chimpanzees." And that's why Carlyle named the dismal science "the dismal science," because he said that was its main truth—that all humans respond similarly to incentives. What a dismal science that we're not somehow more elevated than the lower order. That's great—to accidentally coin a really great phrase like that when you're trying to be rude. Yes, right. But the point I try to make in the book is that we always end up coming back to Great Man Theory—even people on the left—because we want stories. And stories demand protagonists. Frankly, your biography of Napoleon is going to sell a lot better than your book about agrarian upheaval in France in the 18th and 19th centuries. It's just more interesting to have… You know, when you write a screenplay, the first thing anyone will ever tell you is you have to have a protagonist and they have to be active—they have to make decisions. That's how our minds want history to kind of work. But there's a brilliant paper that I reference in the book from 1922, about "Are Inventions Inevitable?" And the list that they have of the number of things that got invented simultaneously—the most obvious one is the telephone, right? Two people came up with the telephone, and only one of them gets the credit. I write about Edison—Thomas Edison—later in the book. And everybody had the idea for the light bulb. Every man and his dog had that idea because it's quite a simple conceptual idea. What they couldn't do for 100 years was manufacture it and reliably make it work. And the real genius of Edison, if he had it, was, I think, the New York City power grid. But again, that's just not as compelling a story as "Man invents light bulb" that you can see and hold in your hand. And Edison, then—and you point out that he ended up in a fight that he lost. I mean, he lost a lot of his invention battles overall. He was a proponent of direct current, and alternating current won out and ultimately kind of swallowed a lot of his activity. And with Edison, I mean, there's always the fascinating concept of Edison versus Tesla. So you have Edison as one kind of genius, and then Tesla as another—crazy, more romantic genius, because he ended in failure. Do you know, my favorite anecdote is the fact that Tesla walked out of Edison's lab—where he worked for a while—because they had a bet, which Tesla won, and then Edison got really grumpy about him. And I just think this is fascinating because—I don't know if you know this—a couple of months ago, the podcaster Sam Harris told the story. He had a bet about deaths during the coronavirus pandemic with Elon Musk, and Sam Harris won. And then he said, "So, where's my—pay up, son?" And then Elon Musk kind of just got weird—kind of grumpy—and ended their friendship. I like that. That is a great way for Sam Harris to call himself a genius. —is to call himself Tesla. But it is also interesting that, in the book, I had already made this comparison between Edison and Elon Musk—both in the sense of the style of invention they do, their talent for publicity, but also the ego, frankly, that has made them want to play the public role of an inventor. And I think that's where the bet story really comes from. Neither of them likes to be beaten or humiliated. They were both schemers—not ivory tower scientists happy to do their own thing and let the chips fall where they may. They both want to be out there in the world selling themselves. And so that echo was very pleasing. Yeah. And we'll talk more about Musk at the end, I think—or toward the end of this conversation. But Edison also was—he really did work long hours, but he also did what Benjamin Franklin called "visible industry." Like, he made sure you knew. How did you know Edison worked 24 hours a day? Because he told you every time he saw you, or he had people in the press who were either sycophants or on his payroll or whatever, who were telling people. It's not clear that he ever said that creativity or genius is 99 percent perspiration and 1 percent inspiration, but that captured the image that he was pushing. Oh yeah. I mean, I've got actually—I think more respect for Edison as a businessman and as a marketer than I had when I came in. But you're right, because everyone wanted the myth to be that they were kind of—you know, the easiest mark is somebody who wants to believe what you're selling them. And everybody wanted to believe that he was this American Prometheus. You know, he was stealing fire from the gods. And this is what I mean—to come back to nationalism again. This was a time in which America was the future. Europe was kind of classy, but it was old and hidebound and dying. And America was the new continent of steel and electricity and the railroad and these big barons. And Edison fit that image that America had of itself at that time. So he slotted himself in very neatly. There was a pre-made genius myth for him as an American genius. Right. And if I'm remembering, there was a fantastic series of kids books called Childhood of Famous Americans. All right. And it was the same story told over and over again, but they would change the names and places. And there was one of Edison, and part of his myth is that at some point he was working as a baggage boy on a railroad or something, and he was missing his train, and he gets pulled in by his ears—which caused hearing loss. So he became a great telegraph operator, and his kids were nicknamed Dot and Dash. But a lot of it came from: he was a small kid from nowhere who had bad hearing because of this industrial accident, and then he becomes the greatest inventor of all time. And he gets rewritten as well as "Tom" Edison—young Tom Edison, like Tom Sawyer—rather than his actual first name, which was Alva. And that again just speaks to the kind of— The country hasn't been invented yet that's going to promote an "Alva" as their great inventor. Yeah. And there's a famous movie called Young Tom Edison with, like, Jimmy Stewart or somebody playing him. So this gets done again and again. But now let's bring it back to the evil effects of the British on public discourse, and let's talk about Francis Galton. Because what is interesting—you have the geniuses themselves who become public either because somebody writes about them or they're creating their own myth. But then you have somebody like Francis Galton, who helped kind of quantify—or tried to quantify—what genius meant, and also why it's hereditary and why it persists in certain types of people but not others. Explain who Francis Galton is. He was a really brilliant dilettante—from the time when you could just skip around and come up with lots of different things. He tried to create a beauty map of the British Isles and work out where the women were hottest. I mean, very much actually the precursor of Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook in that respect. But was he a lifelong bachelor? He definitely was childless, right? He married, yes, but I can't detect any real enthusiasm for women—or, indeed, any other people at all. Did he marry—did he fight? Like, he was like, "The Orkney Islands have the hottest babes, so I'm going there," or something? No, I think it was—I think it was an arranged marriage. There's a bit in his memoir of his essentially like gap year, where he goes to Africa. One of the chieftains offers him a woman as a "temporary wife," and he declines because she's covered in— that orange pigment, and he doesn't want to get it on his white linen suit. And it's just the sort of most Englishman-abroad kind of colonial power. That's pretty amazing.You have a lot to be ashamed of. OK, thank you. I'll take that one actually. He was also the half-cousin of Charles Darwin. He came from this very storied family in the 19th century, and he therefore was familiar with the idea of evolution by natural selection. You know, this was the idea that survival of the fittest—that people passed down something that now we think of in terms of genes. They didn't have that kind of biological basis to it initially. But he was very interested to think, well, hang on a minute—you can breed dogs in all these different ways. You can breed cattle. Maybe we could breed humans. And this is what I mean about him not showing really any kind of… It just doesn't make sense… Right. Him not showing any kind of fellow feeling for other humans. It was like, "Where could this possibly go wrong? I'm sure this won't have any bad consequences whatsoever." And of course, it did, right? Because he coined the term eugenics, which is from "good birth," essentially, and then dysgenics—which you hear a bit about today. He wrote this book called Hereditary Genius, in which he tried to work out how frequently genius and high achievement occurred in the population and how it was passed down. And people were kind of slagging it off from the very beginning. There's a great dunk of it from a Victorian writer at the time—because he works out that there's a whole family of judges, and he essentially posits the existence of a kind of hereditary judginess. And someone else calls them a "snug little galaxy of jobbers," which I think is right. Just the idea that actually, if you're a judge and your nephew wants to be a judge, then there may be other ways by which that happens rather than pure genetic inheritance. But that's a very influential book among a whole generation of statisticians, because he was a brilliant statistician. And they were also heavily influenced by eugenics. Can I ask was he actually a brilliant statistician, or was he just really novel in what he applied statistics to? Like, he measured a lot of stuff and then said, "OK, well, it means this," but. I mean, the question is— —have concepts like standard deviation, correlation, things like that—they come from his thinking and his work. So he's there right at the birth of this discipline as an academic one. So I think you can say that he was brilliant. And to go back to the idea of, like, do individuals create inventions or do larger forces produce them—is he, as England is moving out—or as the modern world, certainly Europe, is moving out—of kind of inherited aristocracy, he provides a rationale for why the ruling class deserves to be. And this is more of a Marxist kind of interpretation, but it's that Victorian England had to produce Francis Galton, because otherwise people would be like, "Why am I listening to these people simply because they, when I was born, had more money than me?" Yeah, I think that's very true. And also, he provides an excellent justification for imperialism, which was also a great enthusiasm of England at the end of the 19th— He didn't create it. But then provides a justification for what's happening anyway. Which, yeah, in a lot of social theory—that probably, well, now that I'm thinking about it, might be a better interpretation of a lot of social theory—that it's not leading where society goes, but it's rather kind of explaining why we're doing what we're already doing. Yeah, I think you can say there was a kind of Francis Galton–shaped hole in the discourse, and he popped into it quite neatly to say, "Europeans are of better racial stock than Africans," right? And that was obviously something that white Europeans were very keen to hear at the end of the 19th century. Well, some of them, right? Because it really took a couple more generations to figure out, "OK, well, which…who are the Europeans who are actually European, as opposed to Africa due north?" I mean, by the end of the 19th century, you had people who were like, "Well, the Nordics and the Alpines are OK, but these Mediterraneans, like, nah—they're not really…" Well, that's where we have to flick it over to the Americans really taking up the mantle on that. Because they just went, "Hang on a minute. Polish people aren't quite European. Italian people aren't quite European. Irish people aren't quite European. We mean the Nordics, right?" And that's how our racial laws are going to say that the true descendants of the ancient Greeks, bizarrely. I don't know why the ancient Greeks got away scot-free, despite being from Southern Europe, as being very intelligent. If they were so good, they wouldn't have gone away. I mean, this is what I just—I don't understand. But yeah, you're right. He just becomes a very influential figure in what then develops into eugenics and race science. His name has recently been taken off a lot of buildings at University College London. And it's one of those ones where I think I'm ok with it. You know, I think there are lots of cases for whether—- went too far… Am I remembering correctly—part of his research method was measuring the column inches or the number of mentions in encyclopedias of famous people to kind of— He did obituaries, yeah. And then Havelock Ellis, who was a sexologist, does another book in which he basically gets out a ruler. And this is the problem that always happens with these people—they get completely stuffed by Shakespeare, about whom we know very little, and Jane Austen, who lived a very quiet, boring, blameless life in a parsonage. So the biographical idea that you just—you have a lot of biographical detail and you get written about a lot—completely falters. And then they just end up fudging these supposedly scientific lists. Which is the methodology that Charles Murray used in his book Human Accomplishment, where he looked at reference works and measured column inches. Which I think probably calls more for a Freudian interpretation rather than a mathematical interpretation of what's going on. Right. I think you can say it's all interesting data, but it's not objective scientific data. Because you can measure how someone's reputation has changed over time, but you can't say there's a kind of version of just desserts where the most intelligent people get the most column inches. I think our own media at the moment would heavily debunk that idea. Talk about eugenics briefly, because we're also—and this is in the Muskosphere and Peter Thielosphere and stuff like that—where people are talking about eugenics. It's one thing if you're saying the state is running things and saying, "You can mate with these people but not those people," and things like that. You know, when you are going to Burning Man or you're at the Bohemian Grove and it's a voluntary association, we all are eugenicists. We all practice some form of "good birth," where we choose these people rather than those people. Is there a way to disentangle eugenics from its kind of history? Is there a eugenics which does not immediately—or quickly—devolve into racial sorting and some kind of horrific cataclysm of human suffering? In practice, I think, no. I think in theory, you're right—it doesn't have to go in those directions. And I think actually—again, I think you're kind of alluding to this—most people, when you drill down to it, are softly eugenicists themselves. Most people: A, they choose their partner because they think their partner is attractive and smart and would be a good father or mother—which is itself kind of eugenics. The second thing is that most people are broadly supportive of women having abortions of babies with severe and life-limiting illnesses—even those like Down syndrome that aren't necessarily fatal. So, lots of people think that looking after a disabled kid would be really hard, and people should have the choice to opt out of that. I have this argument with one of my friends, who has written brilliant books about eugenics. And I said, "But that is eugenic." And you just don't want to call it eugenics because, to you, eugenicism is bad. But you support this. And I think that's what I mean about in practice, I think there are things that people do agree with that you could describe as eugenic. But in any kind of organized movement, it is so unbelievably tainted by what happened in California in the '30s—huge amounts of sterilizations of the quote-unquote "feeble-minded"— by what had happened under the Nazis, that no reputable scientist would touch it with a 10-foot bargepole. And I don't really see the need to rehabilitate it in these individual cases. Do you see any—I realize it's a little bit off topic—but we are now, because there is a demographic collapse happening. It's women's fault. Women are having fewer children now that they have more job opportunities. Right, because they're grasshoppers, and they reproduce by themselves. Yeah, it's women's fault, yeah. But throughout the West—certainly in the U.S., but then especially in those old parts of Europe that maybe really aren't European, places like Hungary—there's a big push for natalism. The state needs to pump up the volume of kids being born. And countries like Singapore spend millions—or billions—of dollars a year trying to do that. Is that a form of eugenics as well? Should we be concerned, from a history-of-eugenics point of view, about what happens when the state starts to say, "You need to be having more kids"? I think the main contradiction to that is that we don't have any evidence that it works. Stalin had a medal that was like—if you had 10 kids, you got a medal. Yeah, I think it was six or something, but yeah. I mean, to me, what I consider to be a lot of children. And there have been regimes through history that have tried to—currently, Viktor Orbán in Hungary said very explicitly, "I don't want more immigrants. I want more Hungarians." And he has put in tax breaks for people who have more than three children, reductions on the people carrier, you know. But with negligible effects, from what I can see. Unless you're running a really brutally directive society like China, where you can dictate to people how many kids they have— And that it was more about having fewer. But now it's like, "Please, please, can you—people—start having children again? We've realized this is a demographic problem." And I think that will be harder to reverse than the previous one-child policy. That's the thing that's interesting. And I think actually—oh, I've forgotten her name, the brilliant researcher Alice—and I've just talked to Ross Douthat about this at The New York Times—that actually it's not even just the West. Quite conservative societies in North Africa are also seeing this reduction in birth rates. No, it tracks perfectly with the proxy that I've seen brooded about a lot is the number of years of education women have on average. As that increases, fertility rates decline—always and everywhere. And it's that the world has become more modern, meaning that women have more opportunity and more equality and more education. I know Mexican women in Mexico have more kids than they do in America. They cross the border, and they have fewer kids. And that's not even that big a difference. But everywhere, yeah—it's a global phenomenon. And I think it contributes as a sign of progress, actually. Because it means more people, I think, are making more choices. I think it's a sign of progress. I think it's very hard to square with our current gerontocracies in terms of our political systems. I mean, that's the problem. In Britain having fewer working-age people to support more older people is a problem, when those older people are on unsustainably high pensions and earlier retirement… You know, I have a political ideology of limited government and a basic social safety welfare net that I would love to sell to you right now. The problem isn't that people are getting older; it's that we have unsustainable entitlement programs that we can thank Bismarck for. Oh, right. OK. Yeah, OK—so we've put, so far, the villains of today's podcast as the English and Otto von Bismarck. OK, good to have the enemies list updated. Come on, surely let's argue about the Beatles now, Nick. You've been holding out on me. Yeah, well, before we get to them, I want to talk about William Shockley, who is somebody that I think a fair number of my audience will remember. He encapsulates something perfect—partly because he is related, he's a kind of semi-direct descendant intellectually of Galton. But he is also fantastic because he brings us closer to Silicon Valley. William Shockley won a Nobel Prize for his role—contested as it may be—in developing the transistor. And then he became a—you know, he took that— He was a massive prick. And everybody left his firm, and they went on to found Silicon Valley. That's the short way. That's right. On the business end, he had this great creation, or he was part of a great invention, and then he was such a terrible manager that everybody who worked for him—who were incredibly talented—were like, "Fuck it, we're going to start our own company." And that became modern Silicon Valley. And then he spent the rest of his life, "electronics, who cares, I want to talk about racial differences that are quantifiable." And he is the genius, in a way, who precedes many other figures that we'll talk about, but where he was great at one thing, and then spent most of his time talking about stuff—that is just crazy pants—and it takes away from his luster as a great inventor. Yeah, I was just rereading the interview that he did with Playboy. It was one of those kind of great heyday-of-Playboy, nine-billion-page interviews. And it's just—it's really sad to see somebody who obviously had a great scientific brain, but they've just picked up a load of goo, basically. Like, for example, he didn't—you know, the interviewer talks to him about his decision to donate to the so-called Genius Sperm Bank, which is a kind of cursed idea from the start. But he has no idea that men's sperm degrades with age and that at 70, the old swimmers might not be in the best condition. And he just completely hasn't looked into that. And it's a kind of sad version of someone who obviously had a great and flexible intellect in their youth, and they've just kind of hardened. And I don't know about you, but when I was reading that, it felt like one of those kind of internet–social media–era midlife crises ahead of its time. I'm sure the obvious example is Naomi Klein's book about Naomi Wolf, a great feminist scholar, gets caught out and then drifts into the kind of QAnon sphere Wolf found out on—was it the BBC? Live on radio. She basically had a book that was about gay men. And she said that there were a number of them who were executed for sodomy. And it turned out that the phrase that had been written was "death recorded." And that didn't mean they'd been executed. That meant that they'd had a death sentence and actually most of them had ended up commuted or whatever. But it was just this very embarrassing thing that dented her credibility in the liberal sphere. So she went over to the other side. And here is—I'm going to make—this is an act of genius that I almost certainly won't pull off, because I'm not a genius. But that moment where she is live talking to the interviewer who points that out to her, and she's like, "Oh… oh." I mean, you just see something change. It's almost like having a stroke. It's very similar to the moment—and I believe you mention this in the book—the Peter Jackson documentary about the Beatles, Get Back, when the song "Get Back" comes into recognizable form. Where the Fab Four are noodling around, and then suddenly you hear this classic song come into being. Yeah, it's a live-action shot of somebody who basically—and I think this is exactly what happened to Shockley. Shockley won his Nobel Prize, the career stalled, he couldn't understand what happened to it. He made, I think, one idle comment about IQ and everyone screamed at him. And he did exactly what happens to lots of people now in that situation, where he felt like that was unfair and unjust, and so he kind of did it harder. And he became a provocateur, and he got into this mindset of, "The more that I'm owning the libs, the righter I must be." And I think you just—you see that. I still think you see that now, and I understand it psychologically. Yeah, like you say, "I'm this thing that you know is horrible, and it's like I'm going to be your worst nightmare version." And in the point about Shockley—and this is, I mean, a credit to the book and to your work—is that Shockley was not— here was an ongoing study of IQ and super-smart kids in California that he did not make the cut for. So you have a guy who becomes obsessed with IQ as this thing that is free-floating and independent from all sorts of influences. And you have to—I mean, anybody reading that in the contemporary world would say, "Oh, he became obsessed with IQ because he was a genius, but he was not ratified as a genius in this grammar school or high school study going on in California." I found that very telling. Yeah, that's Lewis Terman's Genetic Studies of the Gifted, and the cutoff point was either 140 or 135 on this particular IQ score. And he claims that his mother got an IQ score of 150, but he was below it. And actually, there was one other Nobel Prize winner, Luis Alvarez, who also didn't make the cut. And the really sad thing is, in that Playboy interview, he says, "Well, you know, I think probably my IQ has gone up a bit since then," which isn't really how it works between being a school kid and being 70, right? But obviously—you can—yeah, I think you're exactly right. When I read that, I thought, oh, there's the chip on the shoulder. That actually, he's had all the success—what more success could you want than having a Nobel Prize if you're in the sciences? But somehow, there's some little bit of him that still feels he's not enough. And actually, if he clings to this idea of superiority through IQ—racial superiority through IQ—that rubs a little bit of salve on that chip. What goes into people who—and I want to get to the Beatles, because I can talk about The Beatles endlessly. And I met Paul McCartney once— Oh, wow! Yeah, as a college kid. So it was quite exciting, and it led to one of the reasons that I no longer like The Beatles so much. Oh, ok? So that's a good tease, right? But to focus on Shockley a little bit—what goes on where you are a genius in this field or this set of fields—manufacturing, science, invention, electricity—and then you say, "Well, fuck it. What I really want to talk about is race and IQ"? You mentioned, like, his career seemed to stall because nobody—literally nobody—wanted to work with him. They were like, "I'm leaving. You cannot lock me in this factory anymore. I'm just going." But how does that happen? Because this is part of what the book is about. We're in a golden age now where if you are really good at making money on Wall Street, or if you are really good at inventing an electric car, if you are really good at making pop music, we really want to hear your thoughts about all of these other fields that you know absolutely nothing fucking about. I know. It's strange, isn't it? I think, yeah, that does seem to me the Shockley story. There is a heavy suggestion that he kind of piggybacked on the precise version of the transistor that won the Nobel Prize—it was really other people's work—and that people in the lab got tired of him being a kind of credit hog. And then he started getting into applying psychometric testing to his employees, which is always a red flag, I would say. If I may—I've never had to take a psychometric job test, or one that presented itself as such, but my father worked for a shipping company and he used to tell this story that I found very funny. It was called Sea-Land, and it kind of popularized containerized shipping in the postwar era. But it was founded by a guy named Malcolm McLean, who was an illiterate son of sharecroppers in North Carolina. And then, at a certain point, when the company got big enough, they were like, "OK, you've got to start taking business seriously." And they had all of the employees take kind of basic IQ tests to see if they were Sea-Land–worthy people. And Malcolm McLean failed it—because he was basically illiterate, and he was not functioning at the higher level. But, you know—so you had this moment in the heyday of scientific management, where a guy who revolutionized shipping would not be hired at his own company because he was kind of retarded. Wow, that's wild. Yeah, so I always— It doesn't surprise me, because I think that, you know, you would always want to have a higher IQ than not. But I think people overrate that—when you're getting way above the average—how important it is versus personality traits like conscientiousness, openness to experience, whatever it might be. So I think I'm entirely unsurprised by that, but your question kind of speaks to one of the things I talk about in the book, which is this idea of galaxy brainlessness. Which is the idea that, "I'm a smart person, all my opinions are smart." And I think it's just demonstrably not true. And the other thing is—I think it's really sad for the geniuses themselves. Because you look at someone like Shockley, and he has his success because his type of intelligence and his breakthroughs interact with a particularly fertile moment in the history of Silicon Valley, right? He had the right brain for the right time. And what often happens to people is that that lasts for a while, and then it goes away. And that is a really traumatic process for them—particularly if they've become kind of high on their own supply, and they believe that they're a superior sort of person. You know, "Why—I'm pressing the gas pedal and the car's not moving forward anymore," and they can't understand it. And that does often, I think, lead people to kind of bitterness and resentment rather than a kind of appreciation of, "Most people don't get one hot streak. Maybe I won't get two, but the one I had was pretty good." So this is a good segue to talk about The Beatles and the music or creativity streaks where either you're hot, and then suddenly you're not. And I guess part of—we have been, I don't know, and I'm assuming broad social trends in Britain are similar to America—but certainly over the past 30 or 40 years, we have been pushing galaxy brain ideas on schoolchildren and things like that. You know, the idea that you have a domain-specific genius or intelligence doesn't seem to be in favor. We talk about general intelligence, and it's kind of like if you're good at one thing, you're going to be good at everything. So—I mean, we're kind of reaping that whirlwind. I'm not even sure I'm using that term properly, but—because people like Elon Musk are told when they're a kid, "Well, you are really smart. You do great on standardized tests, so everything you say—you get an A in every subject." So like, why wouldn't you start talking about fertility or something like that? So let's talk about the Beatles a bit. How did The Beatles—I mean, it's fascinating, you know, Shakespeare and The Beatles are like the two great British exports, right? Yeah, yeah. And I really appreciate your focus on the way that all of this stuff plays into national myth-making and things like that. When you talk to French or German people, they're like, "Yeah, Shakespeare's pretty good, but he's not great." English-speaking people—and Americans, I think, probably love Shakespeare more than English people—because we have spent, you know, a couple hundred years trying to be like, "No, Melville—he's as good, and Walt Whitman." During graduate school, I studied American literature, and it was fascinating—right around the time that the Berlin Wall came down and then the Soviet Union collapsed. And suddenly, Americanists who had been spending 50 years searching for the American Shakespeare were finally like, "Hey, you know what? We don't actually have to worry. Britain is now a minor literature because America is—our literature matters because we're the world power. We don't have anything to apologize for on some level." But roundabout way of getting to the Beatles—like, you particularly talk about how, within the Beatles mythology, John is seen as the kind of genius, and Paul is—you know, he's like the job, right? He's just a hard worker. What goes into that, and why do you pick Paul over John? Well, for a start, I say this slightly incendiary line, which is: I think in terms of their long-term reputation, we're very lucky that it's Paul who's made it to 80, and John is now a hallowed memory. Because I think if John were still around, he'd be an extremely grumpy reactionary—probably doing quite bad tweets. That would be glorious, though. Whereas Paul McCartney has grown into that kind of father-of-the-nation role, and the younger musicians can make pilgrimage to him. Oh, and it's interesting—I'm sorry to interrupt—but I know George Harrison, who's also important in this kind of holy trinity. And you realize, as age goes on, that Ringo is the only Beatle really worth caring about in the long run. But— Ringo is lovely in Get Back, right? One of my friends described him as being like this sort of lovely Labrador. He's actually like a sort of emotional support animal—because he's there, just exuding Ringo energy. He calms everything down because people don't want to have a row in front of Ringo. And they don't want to upset Ringo. And actually, that is an underrated skill in the high crucible of tempestuous creative motion. Well, but George—towards the end of his life, by the '90s—he was grumpy. When Oasis openly paid a compliment to him by talking about "Wonderwall," which is a reference to his first—or near first—solo album, he was like, "Oasis sucks." He hated everybody younger than him. He was grouchy and grumpy. I mean, Oasis's reputation has not stood the test of time, has it, as a… No, I don't think so. They were— They had a lot of concerts. I think that might be an interesting one to see when people have their own music. Well, and they have their own—that's a variation, right, on the genius theme. The brother who writes everything is really the genius. I mean, they're doing the version of The Kinks with Ray Davies and Dave— Right. And two people who hate each other because they've both got something the other hasn't, right? Liam hates Noel for being able to write songs. And Noel hates Liam for being the charismatic frontman. Anyway, but there's a similar version of that with John and Paul, where John is cast in the role of being the rock bad boy. And that's what people kind of want at the time from their singers. Whereas Paul is seen as kind of domestic and managerial and a bit of a boring admin guy. And his songs focus on mundane stuff, whereas John is writing much more surreal and whimsical stuff—and that's seen as more creative. So you see by the end of the breakup that they've been put into those two categories, and that John has got the much more flattering one. But I don't think it would necessarily— —from a kind of romantic demonic—you know, like the Romantics loving Satan. John is that kind of rock creative genius. Yeah, exactly. Untamable, weird, odd. You know, him and Yoko were kind of wandering around filming their bottoms and all that kind of stuff. He's performing a much more obvious genius role. Whereas Paul McCartney has gone to live on a Scottish island, and send his kids to a public school, and wanting to be, quote, "as normal," right? Trying to live as normal a life as a rock star could live. And therefore—one of the things—I was just talking to a playwright last week about the book. And I said, the thing is, people would rate you as more talented if you were just weirder. You're too normal. You should try and cultivate an aura of eccentricity, because people would misread it as brilliance. I want to get to two other points before we stop talking. And I guess the first is: it's called The Genius Myth. Part of it—I can hear people being like, "Oh, you're just putting down anybody who accomplishes things. You are cutting down the tall poppy or whatever." The Canadian band Rush has a great song called "The Trees," which is about how all the maple trees are trying to keep this oak from growing taller than them. And, you know, they were in an Ayn Rand phase when they produced that. The maple leaf must be the regular Canadian, and they just don't want, you know, Rush to become too big. But it's about the myth, you know. How did you become interested in not the things that people do that are interesting, but in the way that it ends up being talked about? I think people in groups are completely fascinating. Because—I don't know about you—but I find it hard enough to understand individual people. The fact that they think in completely different ways to me. And just—things that to me are completely obvious, they just disagree with me on. And it's kind of life's project to be like, "Oh—other people's brains are different." But then you add in the complexity of them being in crowds, and it becomes completely impossible to understand why people do the things that they do. So lots and lots of my writing—about political movements, about social change—focuses on exactly those kinds of weird emergent properties of people in groups. And that's what interested me about this: you don't get to declare yourself a genius. You can try, right? Lots of people have. And quite a lot of them have been cruelly rebuffed. But genius is created by a crowd looking at you and adoring you and hailing you. And therefore, the interesting question is not just to talk about the properties of the people who are being adored, but the properties of the crowd. So I'm always really interested in celebrity—- Yeah, you talk about Elon Musk in the beginning of the book as an argument about what society values, but also what we're willing to tolerate because it's this whole pact. How did we get to a point where we're going to say—and this is an older example—but it's like, "Well, Roman Polanski deserves to fuck any child that he wants because he made Chinatown." I mean, generally, that is the way that people used to talk about it. They used to say that it was— That's how Bernard-Henri Lévy, the great human rights advocate, said it when Polanski was arrested in Switzerland and was going to be deported to the U.S. Yeah, or like, "It's not rape rape," or, you know, all these kind of weaselly things. Or, "It was Philistines"—that's what one French actress said: "You're Philistine," and then this campaign of smearing against him. And you're like, I'm going to stay at this wild position that I don't think it's good to drug and sexually assault teenagers. Just call me a prude, if you will. And to confess to that. He pled guilty and then he fled because he was worried that the plea bargain that was in place might not come through on the terms that he wanted. To talk about the kind of people who helped create the myth—you have a great chapter, and I'm misreading the title because I don't have it, but it's about the widow of the genius. You talk about people like Orwell's wife, but I'm especially interested in talking about Jackson Pollock and Lee Krasner, who was an artist—plausibly of equal talent, potentially—but she kind of consciously, ultimately played a role of saying, "OK, I'm going to take a break, and I'm going to kind of build up his myth." Can you talk a little bit about that? And also, one of the things that I find fascinating—this is about your work in general—but it's particularly strong in this book— the gender dimension to all of this. Because geniuses—when you think of a genius, you think of a boy genius. You don't think of a girl genius. Oh, the Romantics were quite explicit about this. They thought genius was a male property, but it was a man who had a kind of feminine spirit within him. You know, this was the idea of a poet. But they're not girls. No. It was fae, sort of feminine men—but never butch ladies. No, that was not the same at all. So those roots of the gendering of genius are really, really deep. And I think there's pretty good research that says we're more likely to describe boys as brilliant. That is just an adjective that we apply more readily to men than to women. But is that something relatively recent? And then it becomes hard because in terms of, if we're talking about harder-core patriarchal structures…I had a conversation with Richard Dawkins once where he was talking about various things, and I was just like, "Yeah, it's really weird to me that, like, girls—you look back in human history and girls just couldn't pole vault until about 1985. Is that because of biology?" I grew up in a world, in high school, where girls were not allowed to participate in the pole vault because they couldn't do it. Evolution did not allow them to have the upper body strength to pole vault. How many times do you recognize things that are treated as facts of nature are obviously social constructions and change? And I'm not denying differences between men and women— Oh sure. No, I'm sure women are worse at pole vaulting, right? They do not do as well. It's definitely sex-linked. What I'm getting at is the question of girl and boy geniuses—because we now live in an age where, you know, the equality of sex is certainly under the law. And even in places where testing is used, you know, girls do better in high school, girls get into college more often, they graduate college more often. Are we going to look forward to a future of girl geniuses that are as insufferable as the boy ones? Well, that's the final dream of feminism, isn't it? To be as insufferable as men. Yeah, I don't know—because I think that's a really interesting question. There are undoubtedly women who have really high achievement in ways that they were previously blocked out of. But there's still an open question about whether or not there are sex differences in the kind of selfishness and ambition that's required to be like a William Shockley. Actually—are these traits that we really want to encourage in our children? The kinds of things that make you the Nobel-winning scientist? Or—that's also an interesting question about the fact that science has changed so much. There's very little low-hanging fruit that one person can now do. Most great science projects now are deeply collaborative—often across countries. But it's also about who the crowd wants to hold up as the genius. And I still think that both men and women are more reluctant to idolize women. So I don't think it necessarily will level out, actually. Because again, it's not an objective awarding of a quality—it's not something awarded on merit. It's about why you are celebrating someone—because of what it says about you, or what it says about the qualities you want to stress. So, you know, we definitely do have more women who are celebrated now. And also—the other thing I would say about, to go back to Lee Krasner—my editor made a very good note in that chapter which I incorporated. She has been the benefit of a explicitly feminist genius myth. Which is that feminist historians love the idea of finding overlooked women and lifting them up and celebrating them. You see that with Artemisia Gentileschi, the Renaissance painter. You see it with Krasner. And so there are a new set of genius myths, which are sometimes in themselves quite reductive—the poor, downtrodden woman who never got her flowers during her life, and now we're here, as the historical court of appeal, to make that right. So yeah, there will be some women who benefit from that. But I would doubt that it will level out anytime soon. What kind of pushback do you face when you bring up the social context of the creation of things like genius? Part of what your book is that there's a line or chapter like, "There really is no lightbulb moment." That Edison, tried a million different things, and all these people, etc. But you—for you—you certainly burst into a bigger view when, it was in 2018, when you had that great interview with Jordan Peterson. Yeah, what I like to do is confuse people by getting attacked from a completely different political tendency every couple of years and just switching it up. So, you know, there are people who've spent the last couple of years thinking that I'm this anti-woke conservative. And now I'm going to go through a phase where they think—I think you're right. The people who don't read the book will think this is some misguided egalitarian feminist nonsense that says, "Everybody can be Monet. Everybody can be Einstein. Everybody can be Picasso," or whatever it might be. So yeah, I think that there will be misreadings like that. You can only write the book. You can't force people to read it, tragically. It's a better world where authors cannot force people to read— I was going to say I couldn't read his book, but yeah. Well, he could get you to hold it up, right? And I guess Gaddafi did that too, right? He had his little Green Book—that's all over. I'm sure it's still in the basements of the U.S. Embassy in Benghazi or whatever. But, you know, with that Jordan Peterson interview—what is amazing, like, when it came out, I watched it, and I was like, "OK, this is really—it's just great journalism." I mean, to your credit—what was funny to me, and more clear on a second viewing—is just that you're asking basic questions. And he is a male genius, and he uses ratiocination, he is incredibly learned—but it's like he's about to cry half the time. He is so emotional. Do you think we've entered into a period where men—the kind of male recourse to anger—is now being recognized less as, you know, genius and more as a failure to cope with what's going on in the circumstance? I hope that's true, because I know what you mean—particularly the kind of plethora of those very cruel videos of people having public meltdowns. I think you often see men melting down in public in a way that suggests they've just never learned to process and manage feelings of humiliation or denial, in a way that's quite unhealthy. And I think everybody would probably benefit from working a bit harder on that. But I'm pleased that you picked that up, because I do think it was very funny—because, you know, that was explicitly set up, that interview with Peterson— This was like—if I may make an analogy—this is like when Playboy sent a Black interviewer to General William Shockley. Sending GQ—sending a woman—to interview Jordan Peterson. For their Men of the Year issue. And that's the thing that's very funny, because everybody wanted it to be me—this kind of emotional little lady—and him to be the Great Man of Science loftily delivering his insights. But as you say, I'm there being quite sarcastic, because that's how I brawl. And he's the one who's kind of tearing up. It was actually very gender-nonconforming in that sense. So credit to everyone involved there. He fits into this category. He obviously toiled in the groves in the academy for a long time and had developed a certain kind of expertise and a certain level of reputation. And then when he broke big, now he's giving people tips on how to tie their tie and things like that. Yeah. I was talking to someone who knew him, actually, in Toronto earlier this week. And they said, you know, he was—he was this really great. Like, the research was really good, and the teaching was really good, and his students really liked him. Everybody who knows him from that period in his life is like, "Oh, you were a really great psychology professor, but you are probably not psychologically suited to be an internet commentator." Some people just have hides of inch-thick leather and that sort of thing bounces off of them. But clearly he's somebody who really takes criticism to heart, and it affects him quite deeply. And he's really not cut out for sprawling with people on the internet. Can I ask before—and I promise we'll get to Musk and then I'll let you get on with your day, or tea, or whatever you people are doing in England now—curtsying— —my crumpets —as you drive by… In your previous book Difficult Women, which is excellent—I'm a big fan of kind of second-wave feminism, which now gets read out of context. You read women like Valerie Solanas, the woman who shot Andy Warhol, and they're read out of context. Obviously, she shouldn't have shot Andy Warhol. She should have shot Norman Mailer if she understood her own theory. That would've been great. But what I'm saying is, second-wave feminism from the late '60s and early '70s often gets read in a void. So it just seems like these shrieking harpies who are talking about castrating men, etc., and it's always taken out of context. Like, yeah, they were denied entry into universities or jobs, etc. One of the figures you've talked about a fair amount is Germaine Greer. Talking about Norman Mailer—I mean, if you ever watch the live debate, she just rocks. She throws her fox fur stole over her shoulder and starts talking about building cathedrals in this über-academic way. I mean, it's… oh, I love it. Yeah. No—I mean, you could power all the energy needs of the developing world with the sexual tension… It is really quite something. Germaine Greer, does she fall into a problem of—she was hot, she had a moment. Do you think her thought isn't on a hot streak anymore? It's kind of a amazing because she helped define, certainly in England, second-wave feminism, and now she seems to be hated by most feminists. How does genius age? Oh, I don't think that's true in Britain, where she lived most of all—I mean, she's originally Australian. I think because of the transgender revolt of the last 10 years, she became very unfashionable with the people who came of age at that time. She was seen as being insufficiently inclusive of transgender women. But I think in Britain, the scales have tipped back toward—whatever you want to call it—sex realism, gender-critical feminism. People are now also rediscovering their love of Germaine Greer's brutal, radical honesty, I think we might call it. Personally, my favorite Germaine is not "Why I think naked boys are attractive" Germaine—that was a strange Germaine—nor even the Germaine of The Whole Woman or The Female Eunuch. But her writing on art criticism—she wrote a book about female painters called The Obstacle Race, which I read when I was revising this. As a scholar I think she's got another one called something like Kissing the Rod, which is about Restoration poetry. It's a very Germaine Greer title. She was an exceptional close reader of texts and paintings. And I wonder, actually, when the outrage about her comparing trans women to spaniels has all died down—we will remember the quality of her thoughts. In the same way that people now appreciate—you mentioned Valerie Solanas, but I'm thinking more of Andrea Dworkin. Penguin has just reissued all of Andrea Dworkin's work. Because it's now been long enough that people have kind of gotten over themselves about her controversies and remembered the interesting contributions that she made. But this comes exactly to what the whole book is about, which is: all of that depends on a generation of women—my age or below—who want to remember her, who want to keep enshrining her. This idea of history as a process—you know, we want to keep her memory and what she wrote alive. That's ultimately where the historical judgment comes from. It's whether or not the next generation thinks you're important. It seems to me that Britain has more—you know, and I use this term with air quotes—"TERFs" than American feminism. I think America maybe has a lot of… If you want to define it like this—80 percent of America thinks that sex matters and that there is a difference between trans women and women. Right? But those are none of— Yeah—none of that implies a different legal standing or anything like that. I have struggled. There's a tradition of French feminism, which is its own thing, and then Anglo-American feminism. I found it interesting, I guess, that there are very few American feminists who are on a Germaine Greer level—who exist and are talking publicly about this. Do you have a quick gloss on why it seems like second-wave feminism stuck around longer in England than it did in America? I think it's probably because of the trade union movement and the left feminist movement. Whereas in America, things became much more polarized. And also I think that in America, because abortion dominated the conversation for so long—and continues to dominate it—everybody gets sucked into that. There isn't a lot of space for other stuff. Plus, stuff like employment law being so much more federal in America—what are the kind of big…? And again, in America, race has been such a big part of the conversation for so much longer. I mean, Britain is now a much more diverse country than it was. But in the '90s, it was still 95 percent white. These are just much more recent questions about whether or not feminism is, quote, "white." In 1920, that wasn't a question in British feminism because everybody was white. Whereas it was a huge deal in America. So I think all of those social factors might account for it. I was just thinking as you were talking about England being blessedly white even into the 1990s. Whoa, whoa, whoa—I didn't say that! I was going to say—if you're looking for supplementary material for the eventual paperback edition of this, it would be great to look at Eric Clapton as a genius who then went on to a bit of racial… Very Shockley. A very Shockley trajectory. Like, "Oh, so you loved 'Layla'? Would you also like to hear my thoughts on race?" No—just play "Layla" again. That was really great. And he also has a few thoughts on COVID. I'm sure John Lennon would have had his few thoughts on COVID, I'm just saying. Well, yeah. This is where I think John Lydon—or Johnny Rotten—is kind of… he's a very stable genius, because whatever is dominant thinking, he will be on the other side of it at any given moment in time. But let's talk about Musk quickly. He's not the controlling metaphor of your book, but he is the controlling genius of our moment. Do you think his recent foray into politics—does that tarnish him? Because I was thinking: there's a science writer based in Canada named Dan Gardner. He has a fabulous Substack called Past, Present, Future, or something like that. He wrote a lot about Henry Ford. And he was like, "Hey, I want to tell you a story about a carmaker who really kind of blew his reputation by talking about stuff he didn't really know anything about." And it's about Henry Ford, who was a great genius at mass production and all of this kind of stuff. And then he got bored running a car company, and he's like, "OK, I'm going to solve World War I." And didn't he become a massive antisemite? Oh, he was. He is the Bob Dylan of antisemites. I don't know who's the ultimate Jew. He went electric. Yes, absolutely. And then he also ended up suing people who libeled him for describing him accurately, and then losing status in public court hearings. Because he's an idiot about all of this kind of stuff. Where does that story go? Because he is the epitome of galaxy brain. It's like: he's good at these things, so every thought he has is good, and we have to put up with him. You know, he was working for an administration where people want to have more kids and be Christian. We don't know how many children he has—virtually none of them in a marriage setting. He's divorced, and increasingly it's not even clear how many there are or under what circumstances they were born. That's one thing people tolerate—because he's good at making money and making cars. But then this political foray, where he's going back to Texas—is that the type of thing that destroys his geniusness, or does it remain to be seen? I mean, I think it does. How I've always felt about it is: SpaceX, which is the truly innovative business—if it manages to make reusable rockets work in that way that drives down the cost of space travel, that allows us to become an interplanetary species—I would have thought, in 400 years' time, we're not going to be talking about his bad tweets. But at the current rate, I think he deeply risks falling into that Shockley pattern—of somebody whose juice kind of runs out. Because look at the DOGE as we're talking, he's just been giving this round of kind of exit interviews complaining it was a lot harder than he thought it would be. And you know how he could have found out how hard it would have been? He could have asked me—an idiot—to tell him that. The fact is, governments are harder to run than private businesses, because you can't have creative destruction. You can't just let a government fail and someone else move in—people die, people don't get their Social Security checks. These are important things. But instead, he trampled through that undergrowth like a huge rhino, insistent that he knew best. And—shock horror—if he'd gone into that with his undoubted skills, but had learned more first, he would have been more successful at it. Well, from a Reason angle, it was frustrating, because there are people who work at Reason—but also there's a whole Gulag Archipelago of think tanks—of people who have said, "This is how you cut government spending and waste," etc. And, like, there are almost off-the-shelf plans you can bring in as opposed to going in and not succeeding. Ones that are increasingly picking up traction on the left, right? If you look at the whole abundance agenda—a lot of that is really saying, places like California don't work because they overregulate. What's that phrase of Ezra Klein's? "Everything bagel liberalism"—where it's like, "Why don't we make this housing project also solve racism and wild birds?" So there's definitely a libertarian critique that people feel government is slow and sclerotic. And a more humble man might have read those things first. The point with Musk is that—I guess this is part of where geniuses go to destroy themselves—they really don't think that, as your book argues—and I think it's completely persuasive—that breakthrough technologies are never the result of one person. But when you get exalted like that, then you stop looking around for the expertise or the team that will actually help you produce results. Then you're looking for yes men, or people who will… Your circle becomes—you become Kanye West or something, where nobody around you is going to say no. Yeah. And I think the really interesting examples of that—Picasso and Einstein are probably our most obvious examples. Most people's go-to ideas of artistic and scientific genius. But Einstein never really accepts quantum mechanics. So when he dies, he's more a celebrity than the kind of person in the field that young physicists look to. And Picasso similarly doesn't go to pure abstraction—he doesn't end up in the place of Rothko. That's because they had their paradigm shift. They had the moment where they were the perfect brain to meet the moment. And I think you probably see something very similar with Musk. He had a playbook—which, if you read Character Limit, the book about his takeover of Twitter—you know, he brings in his lieutenants, they lock everybody out of the systems, they fire everyone and rehire that they need. He just had this way that had worked for him in the past. And he went, "Bring on big balls, I'm going to do that to the government too." And he didn't realize that it was not the same environment, and that his one thing that had worked before would now not serve him anymore. And that, to me, exactly is what you're saying. It's a classic genius myth: you think, "I've got the answer," not realizing that different questions have different answers. Right. Yeah—and to go back to that idea of domain-specific intelligence or expertise: not everything is like everything else. That was one of the great myths in American capitalism in the mid-20th century that was destroyed—the idea that all businesses, regardless of what you produce, can be managed by a set of professional managers who are trained in management. And it turns out shipbuilding is very different from oil production, which is different from newspapers, and all of that. If I may—are there good examples of geniuses who run into the wall that Musk has driven his Tesla into with Dogecoin and everything—who then come back? Are there Paul McCartneys, whose second truth or last two-thirds of a career are actually as good or as interesting as the first third? That's a really good question. And I'll probably have to give it more thought than I'm able to on the hoof, because— I'll tell you what—I can't think of any examples offhand, but as you're saying that, I can totally see what a great story that is. And how much people would love that story. So there probably are examples of it. I'm thinking of the kid who was the actor in Indiana Jones who then didn't really do anything for ages and then won the Oscar for Everything Everywhere All at Once. People love that idea that this is the ultimate comeback story. So I can see that happening, where someone had been piddling away for a while and then came back with something. But I don't know. The best versions, I think, of people are your McCartneys or your Springsteens—or, you know, I went to see the Pixies last week. People who just carry on doing something because they clearly love it, the fans love it, and they enjoy it. And the Pixies gig was very interesting, because clearly people were there to hear the songs primarily from Surfer Rosa, their 1980s album. And they play those quite happily. Then they play some of their new stuff too. And I just thought: this is quite a good acknowledgment of: this was the moment we were hottest. We're not in that moment now. But we don't hate those people or resent that. We love that it happened. We're not sad that it didn't go on forever. That is fascinating. Yeah, I started my career as a teen magazine and rock music journalist. And there's nothing worse than bands or artists who hate the work that made them famous. It's an awful life. It's sad, isn't it? It's really sad. It is. And there are people—I'm thinking of someone like Nick Cave or Bob Dylan. They're very different, but Dylan refused to go away. He goes through cycles where stuff starts to make sense, even if it seems horrible the first time. And Cave has certainly been growing as an artist. And someone like Madonna—I think she stopped, in a way, but had a fantastic run. Can I just real quickly do a bit of biography? Because you mention at one point—and I thought this was fascinating in the book—that your father, in the '50s, took one of these inscrutable-to-Americans O-levels or A-levels, or whatever. I've read a ton of Beatles biographies, and they're always talking about how "I ruined my A-levels," and I have no idea what they're talking about. It's not easy to understand—like SATs. Yeah, no, of course—which is its own kind of bullshit. But your father did well on a test, and that meant that he got to go to university. What is your background, and how did you get to be where you're at? So the test you're talking about is the Eleven-Plus, which kids took at the age of 11. At the time—this is after… so my parents were both born in 1945—so this is in the aftermath of the Second World War. The idea was, if you came from a working-class family—and any other kind of family—that they were going to try and make higher-level education more accessible to a greater number of people. But the way to do that was by selecting viability. So you took this test at 11, and if you passed it, you went to a grammar school. If you didn't, you went to what was called a secondary modern or a technical school. The idea was that you either had an academic education or a vocational one based around going into trades. Because at 11—come on—the bread is baked, right? Well, that's a big… I mean, we mentioned Lewis Terman a long time ago. He also, earlier than that, thought that you could kind of pick future winners very early. And that's not always possible. The other thing it did was create—you know, you'll hear people today will say, "the Eleven-Plus was amazing because I got chances that I wouldn't otherwise got." But that's a kind of survivorship bias, because you don't hear as much from the people whose lives were ruined by being told at 11 they were not good enough. But in his case, it meant he was the first in his family to go to university. He went to Aston University in Birmingham to study chemistry. He worked first for Worcester Porcelain—where I grew up, which has its own delightful porcelain—and then for a place that made things you melt steel in—crucibles. Sorry, I know you're loving how much of an English stereotype I am, aren't you? Yeah. "It has a delightful bone china—from the Potteries." But you know, he benefited—definitely—he got lifted up like that. And on my mum's side, my granddad, who was Scottish, he was a coal miner. He moved south and took civil service exams as an adult. So he was the engine, he moved from working class to middle class, at that point. My mum then went to the same school I ended up going to, which was a convent school, a Catholic school. So I came from a really nice, normal middle-class high school. This was in the Midlands in England. I didn't know anybody who was a journalist. I didn't know anybody who lived in London. Even Birmingham was quite exciting to me. So I do have to remind myself every so often: if I could go back and talk to 16-year-old me about what I do and who I know, she would be pretty impressed. It is kind of fascinating, isn't it? There's a version of this in the U.S.—and I think throughout the West, and even much of the developing world—where tests, whether they're IQ tests or aptitude tests, they're used in many ways to reinforce the status quo or to naturalize it. But oftentimes, the goal—even when they were implemented—was not necessarily to do that, but to be more egalitarian and more meritocratic. Intelligence needs to be contextualized, and things like that. You know… Well, it's not necessarily a bad impulse, is it? Because actually, the signature event in my academic career was that I went to Oxford University, and that was determined— I said… A little place, yeah, in the Cotswolds. But that wasn't determined by a test for English—that was determined by an interview. And you know what? That obviously privileges eloquent bullshitters. The die was cast in my future in podcasting, because that's exactly what that selects for. Tests are bad in some ways, but they're also sort of… they're the worst thing apart from all the other things. We haven't yet invented a way of designing education that weeds out bias. The Eleven-Plus was notoriously problematic because it was easier for middle-class kids to pass it. They had more knowledge. Often just flat-out their parents hired tutors to get them through it. Now what happens is that there are very few grammar schools left, and the house prices around them are exceptionally high. So you end up with class sorting by who can afford to buy a house in that area. I mean, that's… to talk about the abundance agenda. And I always think when I hear about Ezra Klein, I'm like: If you want to read what Ezra Klein is going to write tomorrow, read what Reason was publishing 20 years ago. But part of it is—when it comes to educational opportunity and whatnot—the idea that, well, there are only 10 universities. So we have to sort to get the right people into that. It's like, maybe you create a world where there are many, many different universities—or more schooling opportunities—rather than funneling people through. In America, there was starting to retreat—not necessarily for good reasons—but there was this birth of gifted and talented programs. And most of the time, it wasn't just like, "If you hit this level of testing, you'll be in the gifted and talented program." It's like, "We only have a certain number of slots." And, well—if the test says you're gifted and talented, why don't you expand the program? But oftentimes, the function of schooling is not to increase opportunity, but to maintain the existing power structure. That's my idea. No, I know. And there's loads of stuff that happens like that. The Ivy Leagues, which excluded or limited Jewish students in the first half of the 20th century, they did that by saying, "We want to look at well-rounded students." Or they moved their recruitment pools out of New York City and into the outer boroughs—or whatever it might be. That's the only way I think T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound got into Ivy League schools—because they were from Missouri and Idaho. So they benefited from the geographical quota. But this is one of the big themes of the book: a level of humility about the systems we have and whether or not they are free from bias. And when the things that look natural and inevitable to us are actually the result of things we can't see—because, yeah, there are a lot of invisible hands. And actually, sometimes, extremely visible hands, if you care to look for them. Yeah, the Ivy Leagues now have a different way of keeping Jews off campus, right? So they—you know, it's more visible. This is not the first time that America's had debates about affirmative action. It just used to be that the affirmative action was in favor of WASPs in the 1920s. Yes, and I'm glad to live in a post-WASP America, for the most part. Just a final question about your method. Have you ever been called a genius? Hm. Why? One of the things that I find remarkable in your work—both the podcasting but then the writing work. I always take this as a sign of an excellent journalist—and I don't really care about "geniuses" is that you find a topic and then report out on it. And that way, you don't have to worry about a hot streak or a cold streak, because the onus isn't on you to be a genius all the time or to come up with new and novel things to say. You go out into the world and see what's happening. That seems to me that's a very rare model for journalism—but it obviously seems like the best way to do it. It's a great relief to just be like, "I am not actually that interesting. What I do is, I go and put myself in interesting places and meet interesting people—and I will tell you about them." And like you say, I'm surprised more people don't do it, because it's a huge burden off you. If you're not trying to be the main character in your drama—if you're content to be the amanuensis at the side—then yeah, it's a huge weight off your shoulders. And I think this is what drives a lot of modern journalists kind of mad: if you're only telling a story in which you're the protagonist, then you need to keep doing stuff. And actually, just go and talk to other people. Other people are mad. They say crazy things. That's Tom Wolfe, in the introduction to his collection The New Journalism, which was about stuff from the '60s and early '70s, published in the early '70s. He said that, "it was amazing. So many weird things were happening in America, and all you had to do was go out and hang out with people." He's seen as someone who's a genius—he has genius insights and is a stylist—but he says in plain sight:" just go and talk to people who are doing things you think are interesting." And you are interesting. It's also just the most fun. I mean, there's nothing that makes me happier than being in some random bit of backstreet America, just talking to people whose life experiences are completely different from mine. And I wish more people got the opportunity to do it, to be honest. The color that you add to, you know, talking about going to—or witnessing—one of the SpaceX launches or recoveries is brilliant. You know, because it's out in the world. It's wonderful. I have kept you overlong—I apologize for that. Where are the best places people should look for your work? You can find most of it through my Substack, which is helenlewis.substack.com. And also my longer, more considered work is at The Atlantic, who are very kind in giving me—the thing that I really like about working for them is that they invest in you as a person. And like you say, reporting is the best and most fun thing to do. And it's not the easiest thing to do in journalism at the moment. So I give them huge credit for letting me—letting me be my best self. God, that sounded like therapy. Sorry—what a hateful note to end on. I'm going to go and have, like, a muffin and a crumpet and be overly British. Yeah, maybe talk about Princess Diana and how sad it is. Are you up on the royals? Do you like the royals? Oh, yeah. I know. There was a time during the Prince Harry saga where I was threatening to become The Atlantic's royal correspondent, just because I enjoy writing about them. And by God, do Americans love reading about them. I don't understand that. And I think Harry was best when he was following in—was it Edward VII or VIII?—when he was doing the Nazi costumes. I was going to say, "being a Nazi." It's all been downhill for him since then. Helen Lewis, thank you so much. It was a real delight talking to you. The Genius Myth is a spectacular book. It's the best thing you've written recently—until the next one. So thank you very much. Thank you very much.

Elon Musk Nick Gillespie | 6.4.2025 11:00 AM HD Video Download Today's guest is Helen Lewis, a British journalist and podcaster who is a staff writer for The Atlantic. Her new book is The Genius Myth: A Curious History of a Dangerous Idea, and it explores how the definition of what it means to be a genius has changed radically over the centuries, how it became linked to all sorts of weird biological theories, and how Elon Musk has come to personify genius in our time (and whether his failure at the Department of Government Efficiency spells the end of his genius moment). Lewis and Reason's Nick Gillespie also talk about The Beatles; William Shockley, who turned to racial science after winning a Nobel Prize for helping to invent the transistor; and her notorious 2018 interview with Jordan Peterson for British GQ, which has racked up over 70 million views. 0:00— Introduction 1:36— The Genius Myth 7:20— How dead geniuses fueled national myths 11:30— Thomas Carlyle and the Great Man theory 18:18— Are inventions inevitable? 23:22— Francis Galton and eugenics 33:35— Pro-natalism and declining fertility rates 37:14— William Shockley 48:00— Shakespeare and The Beatles 57:22— Jackson Pollock, Lee Krasner, and the gender dimensions of genius 1:03:50— Lewis' Jordan Peterson interview 1:07:18— Germaine Greer and second wave feminism 1:11:05— The gender debate in the UK vs US 1:14:14— Elon Musk's rise and fall? 1:20:57— Do geniuses have second acts?

Helen Lewis: Thank you for having me. Let's start with the obvious question. The book is The Genius Myth: A Curious History of a Dangerous Idea, which is a great subtitle. But why did you write The Genius Myth? Do you know what, it's one of those things where it's evolved over time, so I may be now lying to myself about why I wrote it. But I did have a conversation with a friend a couple of years ago about the idea that—he has always said that genius is a right-wing concept, which I thought was a really interesting idea because it's about the individual over the collective. It's about people with sublime achievement who are not part of the common throng. And I thought that was interesting. I thought, well, I hear loads and loads of left-wing people use it very casually, and I don't think they're accepting this kind of idea behind it. And then that made me think, well, hang on a minute, what other ideas are kind of being smuggled in in that little word? And that's where the book kind of came from. That's fascinating. And it puts me in mind—the book is fantastic. I mean, it is a great read. It's better than 99 percent of novels I read. And I love—it's a series of stories about kind of crazy people and the people, including all of us, who enable them. But part of what you talk about in The Genius Myth is that being a genius meant radically different things in different eras. Explain in ancient Greece—and I don't know why we care about what ancient Greece thought about anything—but the Greeks talked about having genius, or being a genius meant that you were possessed with a visiting spirit. Can you explain what that means? Yeah, you have a genius—that's the original sense of it. You're visited by this spirit, and you know, it might be the muse of poetry speaks through you, or the muse of history. And they called it furor poeticus, furor divinus—divine fury. And I think that captures something really well. I don't know if you would describe yourself as a genius, Nick, but most of us wouldn't. But you must have had moments when you've sat down— No, very few people have defined me as a genius, so thank you. But you might have had times when you sit down to write a piece or do some piece of work, and it just clicks. Something just feels really good. And I think most writers probably spend most of their life kind of chasing that dragon for the rest of the time. You go, 'when will it come back?' And that's what writing should feel like, and most of the time it's just a kind of grind. So I think they did a very good thing then in capturing something that we've all felt to some extent. There are moments that work. You talk about how, particularly in the context of things like pop music and whatnot—and this is certainly true for writers and novelists in particular—you go on a streak where you are just performing at a higher level. I want to get into an argument about the Beatles for any number of reasons. It's independent of you—I have this argument every morning. But when you look at somebody like Paul McCartney, who you talk about in an interesting way, he's got to understand that whatever he's been doing for the past 40 years is not what he did for that 5- to 10-year period. He was on. So you go from that classical understanding of genius as a visiting spirit or something is speaking through you—which now is almost always the province of serial killers, right? I guess I had the dog talk to me, and it told me to kill me. They're the last classical geniuses in this tattered world. But then in the Renaissance things shift—the Renaissance and the early modern period. How does being a genius change in that period? Maybe even a little bit later than that, because the thing about the Renaissance is always that the word comes from rinascita—rebirth. So the idea was that they were, as they saw it, bringing back the classical tradition. And it was kind of quite imitative—you were trying to learn these things about proportion and form. Well, I don't want to get sidetracked. I'm just going to say yes—they were smuggling what they wanted to do by saying, "What we're really doing is merely bringing back these eras of former greatness." There's the American Renaissance in American literature, which was created in the 1940s about the pre–Civil War period. And I believe there's a racial journal now called American Renaissance, which—they want to rebirth things. So in this early modern period redefinition of genius, what's going on? Then you get this very, very important book that I had to say I didn't really know about, which is Giorgio Vasari's Lives of the Artists. And it is a group biography of—I have to say, all the artists that I would have known growing up because they were also Ninja Turtles, like Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael, Michelangelo. But there is a sense that that was a period of a kind of burst of creativity, and he puts them together in this kind of pantheon. And it's one of the first times that you begin to see, in a really systematic way—this is what I mean by the genius myth. These are stories that we tell about people who are innovators or scientists or artists. So you have, for example, the story of Leonardo da Vinci. And the myth that's imposed on him is that he couldn't settle on anything. He had a kind of—an uber level of ADHD. He was designing the helicopter, then he wanted to learn how to paint directly onto a wall using tempura, then he was doing something else. He was kind of a scatterbrain. We have all met that person in our first semester in college as well—who's just so brilliant. Obviously Leonardo accomplished a few things, as well. It's true—not all of the people that you meet in the first semester at college go on to paint the Mona Lisa, or anything like it, sadly. But what I was getting at is that the Mona Lisa wasn't really the Mona Lisa until centuries after it. Until it got stolen. This is one of my favorite things in all of it. It's the same way that Shakespeare died a respectable playwright, but he didn't die the guy that we should enthrone forever as the crowning jewel of English literature. That really a century later. And exactly the same thing with the Mona Lisa. The Mona Lisa was—and I'm going to be really rude here and say—quite a sludgy gray and green painting, and not seen as the crowning achievement of the Renaissance by any means. It gets stolen in the 1920s and ends up in Italy. And it becomes—actually, as lots of these things do—about national myths, because Leonardo was Italian or proto-Italian, but he was working for most of his life in France. So it becomes a kind of 'Who owns this great genius?' and 'Therefore, who should have the Mona Lisa?' And then it becomes a kind of inter-country fight. It's also great because, in the United States in particular, Italians have always claimed Christopher Columbus. But now many of us Italian Americans are like, "Oh, maybe he was working for Spain, and maybe he is a Jew, so forget it. We don't need Columbus anymore." He's not The Sopranos… But da Vinci is one model of a Renaissance genius. Talk about Michelangelo or some of the others. The person categorizing them said, "OK, well, there are different gradations." He seemed very much like a boy with a bunch of Pokémon dolls or something where he's rank ordering them things like that. Yeah, well, he definitely had a bias. He had a pro-Florentine bias. So he's quite rude about Titian, who was born—I think— Venice or the Alps. But he kind of gets relegated to second status because he's not from the right place. But Michelangelo, he uses as a different example, which is something you find all the time in genius myths: which is someone who had to struggle. So that's turned into a story about how hard it was to paint the Sistine Chapel, and how he had to design all the stuff you'll hear if you go on the tour of the Sistine Chapel. The other thing that you will know from visiting the Sistine Chapel is that it's a lot. It's quite—it is a statement, is it not? Yeah. And I think that's kind of fascinating too—that you have to have a level of ambition. The film critic called it white elephant art. Which he didn't intend as a compliment—these films that kind of announce themselves as a masterpiece. And I think that actually is also quite pertinent to this. The fact that Ulysses by James Joyce is very hard to read—not an enjoyable novel in the conventional sense—is actually taken as being a sign of its genius. The fact that the Sistine Chapel is big…if he'd done that much individual painting and separated it out by canvases, we wouldn't find it quite so impressive as this one—you know, what's that German word? Kunstkammerwerk—you know, the kind of the whole thing is it. You have that word written on your computer, and you use it in every conversation that you ever have. That's true. I do, actually. Yeah, you've rumbled me. But you know what I mean—like that idea of the kind of… You still see it now when you have like, oh, Birdman, it's filmed like it was in a single shot, or The Revenant, oh it only filmed in natural light, or Tom Hanks really lost all the weight for Cast Away, or Charlize Theron made herself ugly for Monster. These are kind of—there's a price to greatness. I like the movies where people gain weight, because anybody can lose weight, right? If we may jump forward a little bit—and I want to skip over him a little bit, both because he deserves to be forgotten, but I want to get to a later figure in Victorian England—but Thomas Carlyle pops up a couple of times in your work. And he is kind of the modern conceptualizer, right, of Great Man Theory, which is related to genius but it's not quite the same thing. Life writing takes form, and then you get the Industrial Revolution and capitalism. And what you then get is genius really as a marketing tool. So, if you're an artist in the 14th century, what you need is a rich aristocratic patron. If you're an artist in the 18th century, 19th century—well, actually, at this point there'd be things like, you know, gallerists start arriving, things like newspapers arrive, mass media arrives, and you might therefore be able to brand, basically. But what's interesting is that most of the time, or at least at that point, it seems to be less the person selling themselves as a genius, and they have a Boswell—or they have somebody around them who is writing them up as, like, "Oh, this is the real guy," like a hype man. A Flavor Flav. Yeah, everybody needs an 18th century Flavor Flav. Yes, it's true. But then you have somebody like Thomas Carlyle, who, you know, very much of a… in the context of his time, it's not like he was a right-winger. And he hated capitalism, certainly. And he hated all of the liberal economists who actually thought that Irish people and Blacks in Jamaica were human in the same way he was. But how does he talk about Great Man Theory, and how does that kind of add to the genius lore before it gets kind of quantified and mathematized later in that century? Yeah, he has this line, which I'm going to mangle, but it's something like, "The history of the world is, at root, only the history of great men." And that was very in keeping with a certain type of patrician Victorian thinking—that you just needed these once-in-a-generation personalities. One of their references would have been someone like Napoleon Bonaparte, the great French general. And I think there's a lot to that argument—that actually, the military decisions that Napoleon made at the times that he made them changed the history of Europe. He was a consequential figure. In the same way that now The Atlantic just ran a cover story on Donald Trump that said he's the most consequential president of the 21st century. I do think it's a reasonable point to say that some people are kind of hinge points in history. I was gonna make a joke about like, what's his competition so far though? You know, it's—zombie Abe or whatever. And you thought—"No, I love Obama and I would never say anything mean about him." Well, I know. I said, unfortunately, from my stupid libertarian point of view, I see an immense continuity between George W. Bush, Obama, Trump I, [Joe] Biden, Trump II. And it's not a good continuity. But, you know, this is part of what you're talking about when you talk about The Genius Myth—you're not saying everybody is exactly the same, and it's just a social construction that Leonardo gets called a great artist, but actually anybody around him was as good. But it is this storytelling and kind of creating this sense that these people are the limit of everything that we're doing. But with Carlyle—so Carlyle—I guess in a way systematic thinking— this is what the Enlightenment was about. And to some degree, the Renaissance—it hadn't quite got there. And you certainly get there with somebody like [Karl] Marx and [Freidrich] Engels, where they kind of say, actually it's the system. It's the base—typically the economic base—that actually determines everything else. So we might forgive Carlyle this one thing of not really understanding. Oh, I totally forgive him because, you know, what's the easiest thing to do is to go, "Actually, it's both," because it obviously is both, right? Some people do make decisions, but also they are products of fundamental forces that are in society. And I guess—now let me, because I outed myself on my libertarian podcast show as a libertarian—maybe it's people like Adam Smith who started to talk about how things don't just happen. There are a lot of kind of occult forces, invisible hands and whatnot, that create order among seeming chaos. And you could extend that to individuals. I feel like this is a big part of your life's work—the meta story that you tell now—which is just that it's a mix of both. It's circumstance and it's individual effort. And that should in no way ever be controversial, but it seems like it constantly needs to be relearned. Absolutely. Because you bring up Carlyle, and he was writing defensively. That's what I didn't really realize until I looked more at that stuff. I sort of assumed everybody in the Victorian era was swanning around going, "Of course the thing is that just a couple of men changed the world." But no—he was writing to defend that idea against what he saw as the kind of forces of egalitarianism. There's a fantastic book called How the Dismal Science Got Its Name by David Levy, which is a study mostly of how Carlyle and other people like him treated the Irish in popular culture and academic discourse basically in the long 19th century. And they were mad that people were saying, "No, actually the Irish are pretty much like the rest of us. They follow incentives. They're not all gorillas or chimpanzees." And that's why Carlyle named the dismal science "the dismal science," because he said that was its main truth—that all humans respond similarly to incentives. What a dismal science that we're not somehow more elevated than the lower order. That's great—to accidentally coin a really great phrase like that when you're trying to be rude. Yes, right. But the point I try to make in the book is that we always end up coming back to Great Man Theory—even people on the left—because we want stories. And stories demand protagonists. Frankly, your biography of Napoleon is going to sell a lot better than your book about agrarian upheaval in France in the 18th and 19th centuries. It's just more interesting to have… You know, when you write a screenplay, the first thing anyone will ever tell you is you have to have a protagonist and they have to be active—they have to make decisions. That's how our minds want history to kind of work. But there's a brilliant paper that I reference in the book from 1922, about "Are Inventions Inevitable?" And the list that they have of the number of things that got invented simultaneously—the most obvious one is the telephone, right? Two people came up with the telephone, and only one of them gets the credit. I write about Edison—Thomas Edison—later in the book. And everybody had the idea for the light bulb. Every man and his dog had that idea because it's quite a simple conceptual idea. What they couldn't do for 100 years was manufacture it and reliably make it work. And the real genius of Edison, if he had it, was, I think, the New York City power grid. But again, that's just not as compelling a story as "Man invents light bulb" that you can see and hold in your hand. And Edison, then—and you point out that he ended up in a fight that he lost. I mean, he lost a lot of his invention battles overall. He was a proponent of direct current, and alternating current won out and ultimately kind of swallowed a lot of his activity. And with Edison, I mean, there's always the fascinating concept of Edison versus Tesla. So you have Edison as one kind of genius, and then Tesla as another—crazy, more romantic genius, because he ended in failure. Do you know, my favorite anecdote is the fact that Tesla walked out of Edison's lab—where he worked for a while—because they had a bet, which Tesla won, and then Edison got really grumpy about him. And I just think this is fascinating because—I don't know if you know this—a couple of months ago, the podcaster Sam Harris told the story. He had a bet about deaths during the coronavirus pandemic with Elon Musk, and Sam Harris won. And then he said, "So, where's my—pay up, son?" And then Elon Musk kind of just got weird—kind of grumpy—and ended their friendship. I like that. That is a great way for Sam Harris to call himself a genius. —is to call himself Tesla. But it is also interesting that, in the book, I had already made this comparison between Edison and Elon Musk—both in the sense of the style of invention they do, their talent for publicity, but also the ego, frankly, that has made them want to play the public role of an inventor. And I think that's where the bet story really comes from. Neither of them likes to be beaten or humiliated. They were both schemers—not ivory tower scientists happy to do their own thing and let the chips fall where they may. They both want to be out there in the world selling themselves. And so that echo was very pleasing. Yeah. And we'll talk more about Musk at the end, I think—or toward the end of this conversation. But Edison also was—he really did work long hours, but he also did what Benjamin Franklin called "visible industry." Like, he made sure you knew. How did you know Edison worked 24 hours a day? Because he told you every time he saw you, or he had people in the press who were either sycophants or on his payroll or whatever, who were telling people. It's not clear that he ever said that creativity or genius is 99 percent perspiration and 1 percent inspiration, but that captured the image that he was pushing. Oh yeah. I mean, I've got actually—I think more respect for Edison as a businessman and as a marketer than I had when I came in. But you're right, because everyone wanted the myth to be that they were kind of—you know, the easiest mark is somebody who wants to believe what you're selling them. And everybody wanted to believe that he was this American Prometheus. You know, he was stealing fire from the gods. And this is what I mean—to come back to nationalism again. This was a time in which America was the future. Europe was kind of classy, but it was old and hidebound and dying. And America was the new continent of steel and electricity and the railroad and these big barons. And Edison fit that image that America had of itself at that time. So he slotted himself in very neatly. There was a pre-made genius myth for him as an American genius. Right. And if I'm remembering, there was a fantastic series of kids books called Childhood of Famous Americans. All right. And it was the same story told over and over again, but they would change the names and places. And there was one of Edison, and part of his myth is that at some point he was working as a baggage boy on a railroad or something, and he was missing his train, and he gets pulled in by his ears—which caused hearing loss. So he became a great telegraph operator, and his kids were nicknamed Dot and Dash. But a lot of it came from: he was a small kid from nowhere who had bad hearing because of this industrial accident, and then he becomes the greatest inventor of all time. And he gets rewritten as well as "Tom" Edison—young Tom Edison, like Tom Sawyer—rather than his actual first name, which was Alva. And that again just speaks to the kind of— The country hasn't been invented yet that's going to promote an "Alva" as their great inventor. Yeah. And there's a famous movie called Young Tom Edison with, like, Jimmy Stewart or somebody playing him. So this gets done again and again. But now let's bring it back to the evil effects of the British on public discourse, and let's talk about Francis Galton. Because what is interesting—you have the geniuses themselves who become public either because somebody writes about them or they're creating their own myth. But then you have somebody like Francis Galton, who helped kind of quantify—or tried to quantify—what genius meant, and also why it's hereditary and why it persists in certain types of people but not others. Explain who Francis Galton is. He was a really brilliant dilettante—from the time when you could just skip around and come up with lots of different things. He tried to create a beauty map of the British Isles and work out where the women were hottest. I mean, very much actually the precursor of Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook in that respect. But was he a lifelong bachelor? He definitely was childless, right? He married, yes, but I can't detect any real enthusiasm for women—or, indeed, any other people at all. Did he marry—did he fight? Like, he was like, "The Orkney Islands have the hottest babes, so I'm going there," or something? No, I think it was—I think it was an arranged marriage. There's a bit in his memoir of his essentially like gap year, where he goes to Africa. One of the chieftains offers him a woman as a "temporary wife," and he declines because she's covered in— that orange pigment, and he doesn't want to get it on his white linen suit. And it's just the sort of most Englishman-abroad kind of colonial power. That's pretty amazing.You have a lot to be ashamed of. OK, thank you. I'll take that one actually. He was also the half-cousin of Charles Darwin. He came from this very storied family in the 19th century, and he therefore was familiar with the idea of evolution by natural selection. You know, this was the idea that survival of the fittest—that people passed down something that now we think of in terms of genes. They didn't have that kind of biological basis to it initially. But he was very interested to think, well, hang on a minute—you can breed dogs in all these different ways. You can breed cattle. Maybe we could breed humans. And this is what I mean about him not showing really any kind of… It just doesn't make sense… Right. Him not showing any kind of fellow feeling for other humans. It was like, "Where could this possibly go wrong? I'm sure this won't have any bad consequences whatsoever." And of course, it did, right? Because he coined the term eugenics, which is from "good birth," essentially, and then dysgenics—which you hear a bit about today. He wrote this book called Hereditary Genius, in which he tried to work out how frequently genius and high achievement occurred in the population and how it was passed down. And people were kind of slagging it off from the very beginning. There's a great dunk of it from a Victorian writer at the time—because he works out that there's a whole family of judges, and he essentially posits the existence of a kind of hereditary judginess. And someone else calls them a "snug little galaxy of jobbers," which I think is right. Just the idea that actually, if you're a judge and your nephew wants to be a judge, then there may be other ways by which that happens rather than pure genetic inheritance. But that's a very influential book among a whole generation of statisticians, because he was a brilliant statistician. And they were also heavily influenced by eugenics. Can I ask was he actually a brilliant statistician, or was he just really novel in what he applied statistics to? Like, he measured a lot of stuff and then said, "OK, well, it means this," but. I mean, the question is— —have concepts like standard deviation, correlation, things like that—they come from his thinking and his work. So he's there right at the birth of this discipline as an academic one. So I think you can say that he was brilliant. And to go back to the idea of, like, do individuals create inventions or do larger forces produce them—is he, as England is moving out—or as the modern world, certainly Europe, is moving out—of kind of inherited aristocracy, he provides a rationale for why the ruling class deserves to be. And this is more of a Marxist kind of interpretation, but it's that Victorian England had to produce Francis Galton, because otherwise people would be like, "Why am I listening to these people simply because they, when I was born, had more money than me?" Yeah, I think that's very true. And also, he provides an excellent justification for imperialism, which was also a great enthusiasm of England at the end of the 19th— He didn't create it. But then provides a justification for what's happening anyway. Which, yeah, in a lot of social theory—that probably, well, now that I'm thinking about it, might be a better interpretation of a lot of social theory—that it's not leading where society goes, but it's rather kind of explaining why we're doing what we're already doing. Yeah, I think you can say there was a kind of Francis Galton–shaped hole in the discourse, and he popped into it quite neatly to say, "Europeans are of better racial stock than Africans," right? And that was obviously something that white Europeans were very keen to hear at the end of the 19th century. Well, some of them, right? Because it really took a couple more generations to figure out, "OK, well, which…who are the Europeans who are actually European, as opposed to Africa due north?" I mean, by the end of the 19th century, you had people who were like, "Well, the Nordics and the Alpines are OK, but these Mediterraneans, like, nah—they're not really…" Well, that's where we have to flick it over to the Americans really taking up the mantle on that. Because they just went, "Hang on a minute. Polish people aren't quite European. Italian people aren't quite European. Irish people aren't quite European. We mean the Nordics, right?" And that's how our racial laws are going to say that the true descendants of the ancient Greeks, bizarrely. I don't know why the ancient Greeks got away scot-free, despite being from Southern Europe, as being very intelligent. If they were so good, they wouldn't have gone away. I mean, this is what I just—I don't understand. But yeah, you're right. He just becomes a very influential figure in what then develops into eugenics and race science. His name has recently been taken off a lot of buildings at University College London. And it's one of those ones where I think I'm ok with it. You know, I think there are lots of cases for whether—- went too far… Am I remembering correctly—part of his research method was measuring the column inches or the number of mentions in encyclopedias of famous people to kind of— He did obituaries, yeah. And then Havelock Ellis, who was a sexologist, does another book in which he basically gets out a ruler. And this is the problem that always happens with these people—they get completely stuffed by Shakespeare, about whom we know very little, and Jane Austen, who lived a very quiet, boring, blameless life in a parsonage. So the biographical idea that you just—you have a lot of biographical detail and you get written about a lot—completely falters. And then they just end up fudging these supposedly scientific lists. Which is the methodology that Charles Murray used in his book Human Accomplishment, where he looked at reference works and measured column inches. Which I think probably calls more for a Freudian interpretation rather than a mathematical interpretation of what's going on. Right. I think you can say it's all interesting data, but it's not objective scientific data. Because you can measure how someone's reputation has changed over time, but you can't say there's a kind of version of just desserts where the most intelligent people get the most column inches. I think our own media at the moment would heavily debunk that idea. Talk about eugenics briefly, because we're also—and this is in the Muskosphere and Peter Thielosphere and stuff like that—where people are talking about eugenics. It's one thing if you're saying the state is running things and saying, "You can mate with these people but not those people," and things like that. You know, when you are going to Burning Man or you're at the Bohemian Grove and it's a voluntary association, we all are eugenicists. We all practice some form of "good birth," where we choose these people rather than those people. Is there a way to disentangle eugenics from its kind of history? Is there a eugenics which does not immediately—or quickly—devolve into racial sorting and some kind of horrific cataclysm of human suffering? In practice, I think, no. I think in theory, you're right—it doesn't have to go in those directions. And I think actually—again, I think you're kind of alluding to this—most people, when you drill down to it, are softly eugenicists themselves. Most people: A, they choose their partner because they think their partner is attractive and smart and would be a good father or mother—which is itself kind of eugenics. The second thing is that most people are broadly supportive of women having abortions of babies with severe and life-limiting illnesses—even those like Down syndrome that aren't necessarily fatal. So, lots of people think that looking after a disabled kid would be really hard, and people should have the choice to opt out of that. I have this argument with one of my friends, who has written brilliant books about eugenics. And I said, "But that is eugenic." And you just don't want to call it eugenics because, to you, eugenicism is bad. But you support this. And I think that's what I mean about in practice, I think there are things that people do agree with that you could describe as eugenic. But in any kind of organized movement, it is so unbelievably tainted by what happened in California in the '30s—huge amounts of sterilizations of the quote-unquote "feeble-minded"— by what had happened under the Nazis, that no reputable scientist would touch it with a 10-foot bargepole. And I don't really see the need to rehabilitate it in these individual cases. Do you see any—I realize it's a little bit off topic—but we are now, because there is a demographic collapse happening. It's women's fault. Women are having fewer children now that they have more job opportunities. Right, because they're grasshoppers, and they reproduce by themselves. Yeah, it's women's fault, yeah. But throughout the West—certainly in the U.S., but then especially in those old parts of Europe that maybe really aren't European, places like Hungary—there's a big push for natalism. The state needs to pump up the volume of kids being born. And countries like Singapore spend millions—or billions—of dollars a year trying to do that. Is that a form of eugenics as well? Should we be concerned, from a history-of-eugenics point of view, about what happens when the state starts to say, "You need to be having more kids"? I think the main contradiction to that is that we don't have any evidence that it works. Stalin had a medal that was like—if you had 10 kids, you got a medal. Yeah, I think it was six or something, but yeah. I mean, to me, what I consider to be a lot of children. And there have been regimes through history that have tried to—currently, Viktor Orbán in Hungary said very explicitly, "I don't want more immigrants. I want more Hungarians." And he has put in tax breaks for people who have more than three children, reductions on the people carrier, you know. But with negligible effects, from what I can see. Unless you're running a really brutally directive society like China, where you can dictate to people how many kids they have— And that it was more about having fewer. But now it's like, "Please, please, can you—people—start having children again? We've realized this is a demographic problem." And I think that will be harder to reverse than the previous one-child policy. That's the thing that's interesting. And I think actually—oh, I've forgotten her name, the brilliant researcher Alice—and I've just talked to Ross Douthat about this at The New York Times—that actually it's not even just the West. Quite conservative societies in North Africa are also seeing this reduction in birth rates. No, it tracks perfectly with the proxy that I've seen brooded about a lot is the number of years of education women have on average. As that increases, fertility rates decline—always and everywhere. And it's that the world has become more modern, meaning that women have more opportunity and more equality and more education. I know Mexican women in Mexico have more kids than they do in America. They cross the border, and they have fewer kids. And that's not even that big a difference. But everywhere, yeah—it's a global phenomenon. And I think it contributes as a sign of progress, actually. Because it means more people, I think, are making more choices. I think it's a sign of progress. I think it's very hard to square with our current gerontocracies in terms of our political systems. I mean, that's the problem. In Britain having fewer working-age people to support more older people is a problem, when those older people are on unsustainably high pensions and earlier retirement… You know, I have a political ideology of limited government and a basic social safety welfare net that I would love to sell to you right now. The problem isn't that people are getting older; it's that we have unsustainable entitlement programs that we can thank Bismarck for. Oh, right. OK. Yeah, OK—so we've put, so far, the villains of today's podcast as the English and Otto von Bismarck. OK, good to have the enemies list updated. Come on, surely let's argue about the Beatles now, Nick. You've been holding out on me. Yeah, well, before we get to them, I want to talk about William Shockley, who is somebody that I think a fair number of my audience will remember. He encapsulates something perfect—partly because he is related, he's a kind of semi-direct descendant intellectually of Galton. But he is also fantastic because he brings us closer to Silicon Valley. William Shockley won a Nobel Prize for his role—contested as it may be—in developing the transistor. And then he became a—you know, he took that— He was a massive prick. And everybody left his firm, and they went on to found Silicon Valley. That's the short way. That's right. On the business end, he had this great creation, or he was part of a great invention, and then he was such a terrible manager that everybody who worked for him—who were incredibly talented—were like, "Fuck it, we're going to start our own company." And that became modern Silicon Valley. And then he spent the rest of his life, "electronics, who cares, I want to talk about racial differences that are quantifiable." And he is the genius, in a way, who precedes many other figures that we'll talk about, but where he was great at one thing, and then spent most of his time talking about stuff—that is just crazy pants—and it takes away from his luster as a great inventor. Yeah, I was just rereading the interview that he did with Playboy. It was one of those kind of great heyday-of-Playboy, nine-billion-page interviews. And it's just—it's really sad to see somebody who obviously had a great scientific brain, but they've just picked up a load of goo, basically. Like, for example, he didn't—you know, the interviewer talks to him about his decision to donate to the so-called Genius Sperm Bank, which is a kind of cursed idea from the start. But he has no idea that men's sperm degrades with age and that at 70, the old swimmers might not be in the best condition. And he just completely hasn't looked into that. And it's a kind of sad version of someone who obviously had a great and flexible intellect in their youth, and they've just kind of hardened. And I don't know about you, but when I was reading that, it felt like one of those kind of internet–social media–era midlife crises ahead of its time. I'm sure the obvious example is Naomi Klein's book about Naomi Wolf, a great feminist scholar, gets caught out and then drifts into the kind of QAnon sphere Wolf found out on—was it the BBC? Live on radio. She basically had a book that was about gay men. And she said that there were a number of them who were executed for sodomy. And it turned out that the phrase that had been written was "death recorded." And that didn't mean they'd been executed. That meant that they'd had a death sentence and actually most of them had ended up commuted or whatever. But it was just this very embarrassing thing that dented her credibility in the liberal sphere. So she went over to the other side. And here is—I'm going to make—this is an act of genius that I almost certainly won't pull off, because I'm not a genius. But that moment where she is live talking to the interviewer who points that out to her, and she's like, "Oh… oh." I mean, you just see something change. It's almost like having a stroke. It's very similar to the moment—and I believe you mention this in the book—the Peter Jackson documentary about the Beatles, Get Back, when the song "Get Back" comes into recognizable form. Where the Fab Four are noodling around, and then suddenly you hear this classic song come into being. Yeah, it's a live-action shot of somebody who basically—and I think this is exactly what happened to Shockley. Shockley won his Nobel Prize, the career stalled, he couldn't understand what happened to it. He made, I think, one idle comment about IQ and everyone screamed at him. And he did exactly what happens to lots of people now in that situation, where he felt like that was unfair and unjust, and so he kind of did it harder. And he became a provocateur, and he got into this mindset of, "The more that I'm owning the libs, the righter I must be." And I think you just—you see that. I still think you see that now, and I understand it psychologically. Yeah, like you say, "I'm this thing that you know is horrible, and it's like I'm going to be your worst nightmare version." And in the point about Shockley—and this is, I mean, a credit to the book and to your work—is that Shockley was not— here was an ongoing study of IQ and super-smart kids in California that he did not make the cut for. So you have a guy who becomes obsessed with IQ as this thing that is free-floating and independent from all sorts of influences. And you have to—I mean, anybody reading that in the contemporary world would say, "Oh, he became obsessed with IQ because he was a genius, but he was not ratified as a genius in this grammar school or high school study going on in California." I found that very telling. Yeah, that's Lewis Terman's Genetic Studies of the Gifted, and the cutoff point was either 140 or 135 on this particular IQ score. And he claims that his mother got an IQ score of 150, but he was below it. And actually, there was one other Nobel Prize winner, Luis Alvarez, who also didn't make the cut. And the really sad thing is, in that Playboy interview, he says, "Well, you know, I think probably my IQ has gone up a bit since then," which isn't really how it works between being a school kid and being 70, right? But obviously—you can—yeah, I think you're exactly right. When I read that, I thought, oh, there's the chip on the shoulder. That actually, he's had all the success—what more success could you want than having a Nobel Prize if you're in the sciences? But somehow, there's some little bit of him that still feels he's not enough. And actually, if he clings to this idea of superiority through IQ—racial superiority through IQ—that rubs a little bit of salve on that chip. What goes into people who—and I want to get to the Beatles, because I can talk about The Beatles endlessly. And I met Paul McCartney once— Oh, wow! Yeah, as a college kid. So it was quite exciting, and it led to one of the reasons that I no longer like The Beatles so much. Oh, ok? So that's a good tease, right? But to focus on Shockley a little bit—what goes on where you are a genius in this field or this set of fields—manufacturing, science, invention, electricity—and then you say, "Well, fuck it. What I really want to talk about is race and IQ"? You mentioned, like, his career seemed to stall because nobody—literally nobody—wanted to work with him. They were like, "I'm leaving. You cannot lock me in this factory anymore. I'm just going." But how does that happen? Because this is part of what the book is about. We're in a golden age now where if you are really good at making money on Wall Street, or if you are really good at inventing an electric car, if you are really good at making pop music, we really want to hear your thoughts about all of these other fields that you know absolutely nothing fucking about. I know. It's strange, isn't it? I think, yeah, that does seem to me the Shockley story. There is a heavy suggestion that he kind of piggybacked on the precise version of the transistor that won the Nobel Prize—it was really other people's work—and that people in the lab got tired of him being a kind of credit hog. And then he started getting into applying psychometric testing to his employees, which is always a red flag, I would say. If I may—I've never had to take a psychometric job test, or one that presented itself as such, but my father worked for a shipping company and he used to tell this story that I found very funny. It was called Sea-Land, and it kind of popularized containerized shipping in the postwar era. But it was founded by a guy named Malcolm McLean, who was an illiterate son of sharecroppers in North Carolina. And then, at a certain point, when the company got big enough, they were like, "OK, you've got to start taking business seriously." And they had all of the employees take kind of basic IQ tests to see if they were Sea-Land–worthy people. And Malcolm McLean failed it—because he was basically illiterate, and he was not functioning at the higher level. But, you know—so you had this moment in the heyday of scientific management, where a guy who revolutionized shipping would not be hired at his own company because he was kind of retarded. Wow, that's wild. Yeah, so I always— It doesn't surprise me, because I think that, you know, you would always want to have a higher IQ than not. But I think people overrate that—when you're getting way above the average—how important it is versus personality traits like conscientiousness, openness to experience, whatever it might be. So I think I'm entirely unsurprised by that, but your question kind of speaks to one of the things I talk about in the book, which is this idea of galaxy brainlessness. Which is the idea that, "I'm a smart person, all my opinions are smart." And I think it's just demonstrably not true. And the other thing is—I think it's really sad for the geniuses themselves. Because you look at someone like Shockley, and he has his success because his type of intelligence and his breakthroughs interact with a particularly fertile moment in the history of Silicon Valley, right? He had the right brain for the right time. And what often happens to people is that that lasts for a while, and then it goes away. And that is a really traumatic process for them—particularly if they've become kind of high on their own supply, and they believe that they're a superior sort of person. You know, "Why—I'm pressing the gas pedal and the car's not moving forward anymore," and they can't understand it. And that does often, I think, lead people to kind of bitterness and resentment rather than a kind of appreciation of, "Most people don't get one hot streak. Maybe I won't get two, but the one I had was pretty good." So this is a good segue to talk about The Beatles and the music or creativity streaks where either you're hot, and then suddenly you're not. And I guess part of—we have been, I don't know, and I'm assuming broad social trends in Britain are similar to America—but certainly over the past 30 or 40 years, we have been pushing galaxy brain ideas on schoolchildren and things like that. You know, the idea that you have a domain-specific genius or intelligence doesn't seem to be in favor. We talk about general intelligence, and it's kind of like if you're good at one thing, you're going to be good at everything. So—I mean, we're kind of reaping that whirlwind. I'm not even sure I'm using that term properly, but—because people like Elon Musk are told when they're a kid, "Well, you are really smart. You do great on standardized tests, so everything you say—you get an A in every subject." So like, why wouldn't you start talking about fertility or something like that? So let's talk about the Beatles a bit. How did The Beatles—I mean, it's fascinating, you know, Shakespeare and The Beatles are like the two great British exports, right? Yeah, yeah. And I really appreciate your focus on the way that all of this stuff plays into national myth-making and things like that. When you talk to French or German people, they're like, "Yeah, Shakespeare's pretty good, but he's not great." English-speaking people—and Americans, I think, probably love Shakespeare more than English people—because we have spent, you know, a couple hundred years trying to be like, "No, Melville—he's as good, and Walt Whitman." During graduate school, I studied American literature, and it was fascinating—right around the time that the Berlin Wall came down and then the Soviet Union collapsed. And suddenly, Americanists who had been spending 50 years searching for the American Shakespeare were finally like, "Hey, you know what? We don't actually have to worry. Britain is now a minor literature because America is—our literature matters because we're the world power. We don't have anything to apologize for on some level." But roundabout way of getting to the Beatles—like, you particularly talk about how, within the Beatles mythology, John is seen as the kind of genius, and Paul is—you know, he's like the job, right? He's just a hard worker. What goes into that, and why do you pick Paul over John? Well, for a start, I say this slightly incendiary line, which is: I think in terms of their long-term reputation, we're very lucky that it's Paul who's made it to 80, and John is now a hallowed memory. Because I think if John were still around, he'd be an extremely grumpy reactionary—probably doing quite bad tweets. That would be glorious, though. Whereas Paul McCartney has grown into that kind of father-of-the-nation role, and the younger musicians can make pilgrimage to him. Oh, and it's interesting—I'm sorry to interrupt—but I know George Harrison, who's also important in this kind of holy trinity. And you realize, as age goes on, that Ringo is the only Beatle really worth caring about in the long run. But— Ringo is lovely in Get Back, right? One of my friends described him as being like this sort of lovely Labrador. He's actually like a sort of emotional support animal—because he's there, just exuding Ringo energy. He calms everything down because people don't want to have a row in front of Ringo. And they don't want to upset Ringo. And actually, that is an underrated skill in the high crucible of tempestuous creative motion. Well, but George—towards the end of his life, by the '90s—he was grumpy. When Oasis openly paid a compliment to him by talking about "Wonderwall," which is a reference to his first—or near first—solo album, he was like, "Oasis sucks." He hated everybody younger than him. He was grouchy and grumpy. I mean, Oasis's reputation has not stood the test of time, has it, as a… No, I don't think so. They were— They had a lot of concerts. I think that might be an interesting one to see when people have their own music. Well, and they have their own—that's a variation, right, on the genius theme. The brother who writes everything is really the genius. I mean, they're doing the version of The Kinks with Ray Davies and Dave— Right. And two people who hate each other because they've both got something the other hasn't, right? Liam hates Noel for being able to write songs. And Noel hates Liam for being the charismatic frontman. Anyway, but there's a similar version of that with John and Paul, where John is cast in the role of being the rock bad boy. And that's what people kind of want at the time from their singers. Whereas Paul is seen as kind of domestic and managerial and a bit of a boring admin guy. And his songs focus on mundane stuff, whereas John is writing much more surreal and whimsical stuff—and that's seen as more creative. So you see by the end of the breakup that they've been put into those two categories, and that John has got the much more flattering one. But I don't think it would necessarily— —from a kind of romantic demonic—you know, like the Romantics loving Satan. John is that kind of rock creative genius. Yeah, exactly. Untamable, weird, odd. You know, him and Yoko were kind of wandering around filming their bottoms and all that kind of stuff. He's performing a much more obvious genius role. Whereas Paul McCartney has gone to live on a Scottish island, and send his kids to a public school, and wanting to be, quote, "as normal," right? Trying to live as normal a life as a rock star could live. And therefore—one of the things—I was just talking to a playwright last week about the book. And I said, the thing is, people would rate you as more talented if you were just weirder. You're too normal. You should try and cultivate an aura of eccentricity, because people would misread it as brilliance. I want to get to two other points before we stop talking. And I guess the first is: it's called The Genius Myth. Part of it—I can hear people being like, "Oh, you're just putting down anybody who accomplishes things. You are cutting down the tall poppy or whatever." The Canadian band Rush has a great song called "The Trees," which is about how all the maple trees are trying to keep this oak from growing taller than them. And, you know, they were in an Ayn Rand phase when they produced that. The maple leaf must be the regular Canadian, and they just don't want, you know, Rush to become too big. But it's about the myth, you know. How did you become interested in not the things that people do that are interesting, but in the way that it ends up being talked about? I think people in groups are completely fascinating. Because—I don't know about you—but I find it hard enough to understand individual people. The fact that they think in completely different ways to me. And just—things that to me are completely obvious, they just disagree with me on. And it's kind of life's project to be like, "Oh—other people's brains are different." But then you add in the complexity of them being in crowds, and it becomes completely impossible to understand why people do the things that they do. So lots and lots of my writing—about political movements, about social change—focuses on exactly those kinds of weird emergent properties of people in groups. And that's what interested me about this: you don't get to declare yourself a genius. You can try, right? Lots of people have. And quite a lot of them have been cruelly rebuffed. But genius is created by a crowd looking at you and adoring you and hailing you. And therefore, the interesting question is not just to talk about the properties of the people who are being adored, but the properties of the crowd. So I'm always really interested in celebrity—- Yeah, you talk about Elon Musk in the beginning of the book as an argument about what society values, but also what we're willing to tolerate because it's this whole pact. How did we get to a point where we're going to say—and this is an older example—but it's like, "Well, Roman Polanski deserves to fuck any child that he wants because he made Chinatown." I mean, generally, that is the way that people used to talk about it. They used to say that it was— That's how Bernard-Henri Lévy, the great human rights advocate, said it when Polanski was arrested in Switzerland and was going to be deported to the U.S. Yeah, or like, "It's not rape rape," or, you know, all these kind of weaselly things. Or, "It was Philistines"—that's what one French actress said: "You're Philistine," and then this campaign of smearing against him. And you're like, I'm going to stay at this wild position that I don't think it's good to drug and sexually assault teenagers. Just call me a prude, if you will. And to confess to that. He pled guilty and then he fled because he was worried that the plea bargain that was in place might not come through on the terms that he wanted. To talk about the kind of people who helped create the myth—you have a great chapter, and I'm misreading the title because I don't have it, but it's about the widow of the genius. You talk about people like Orwell's wife, but I'm especially interested in talking about Jackson Pollock and Lee Krasner, who was an artist—plausibly of equal talent, potentially—but she kind of consciously, ultimately played a role of saying, "OK, I'm going to take a break, and I'm going to kind of build up his myth." Can you talk a little bit about that? And also, one of the things that I find fascinating—this is about your work in general—but it's particularly strong in this book— the gender dimension to all of this. Because geniuses—when you think of a genius, you think of a boy genius. You don't think of a girl genius. Oh, the Romantics were quite explicit about this. They thought genius was a male property, but it was a man who had a kind of feminine spirit within him. You know, this was the idea of a poet. But they're not girls. No. It was fae, sort of feminine men—but never butch ladies. No, that was not the same at all. So those roots of the gendering of genius are really, really deep. And I think there's pretty good research that says we're more likely to describe boys as brilliant. That is just an adjective that we apply more readily to men than to women. But is that something relatively recent? And then it becomes hard because in terms of, if we're talking about harder-core patriarchal structures…I had a conversation with Richard Dawkins once where he was talking about various things, and I was just like, "Yeah, it's really weird to me that, like, girls—you look back in human history and girls just couldn't pole vault until about 1985. Is that because of biology?" I grew up in a world, in high school, where girls were not allowed to participate in the pole vault because they couldn't do it. Evolution did not allow them to have the upper body strength to pole vault. How many times do you recognize things that are treated as facts of nature are obviously social constructions and change? And I'm not denying differences between men and women— Oh sure. No, I'm sure women are worse at pole vaulting, right? They do not do as well. It's definitely sex-linked. What I'm getting at is the question of girl and boy geniuses—because we now live in an age where, you know, the equality of sex is certainly under the law. And even in places where testing is used, you know, girls do better in high school, girls get into college more often, they graduate college more often. Are we going to look forward to a future of girl geniuses that are as insufferable as the boy ones? Well, that's the final dream of feminism, isn't it? To be as insufferable as men. Yeah, I don't know—because I think that's a really interesting question. There are undoubtedly women who have really high achievement in ways that they were previously blocked out of. But there's still an open question about whether or not there are sex differences in the kind of selfishness and ambition that's required to be like a William Shockley. Actually—are these traits that we really want to encourage in our children? The kinds of things that make you the Nobel-winning scientist? Or—that's also an interesting question about the fact that science has changed so much. There's very little low-hanging fruit that one person can now do. Most great science projects now are deeply collaborative—often across countries. But it's also about who the crowd wants to hold up as the genius. And I still think that both men and women are more reluctant to idolize women. So I don't think it necessarily will level out, actually. Because again, it's not an objective awarding of a quality—it's not something awarded on merit. It's about why you are celebrating someone—because of what it says about you, or what it says about the qualities you want to stress. So, you know, we definitely do have more women who are celebrated now. And also—the other thing I would say about, to go back to Lee Krasner—my editor made a very good note in that chapter which I incorporated. She has been the benefit of a explicitly feminist genius myth. Which is that feminist historians love the idea of finding overlooked women and lifting them up and celebrating them. You see that with Artemisia Gentileschi, the Renaissance painter. You see it with Krasner. And so there are a new set of genius myths, which are sometimes in themselves quite reductive—the poor, downtrodden woman who never got her flowers during her life, and now we're here, as the historical court of appeal, to make that right. So yeah, there will be some women who benefit from that. But I would doubt that it will level out anytime soon. What kind of pushback do you face when you bring up the social context of the creation of things like genius? Part of what your book is that there's a line or chapter like, "There really is no lightbulb moment." That Edison, tried a million different things, and all these people, etc. But you—for you—you certainly burst into a bigger view when, it was in 2018, when you had that great interview with Jordan Peterson. Yeah, what I like to do is confuse people by getting attacked from a completely different political tendency every couple of years and just switching it up. So, you know, there are people who've spent the last couple of years thinking that I'm this anti-woke conservative. And now I'm going to go through a phase where they think—I think you're right. The people who don't read the book will think this is some misguided egalitarian feminist nonsense that says, "Everybody can be Monet. Everybody can be Einstein. Everybody can be Picasso," or whatever it might be. So yeah, I think that there will be misreadings like that. You can only write the book. You can't force people to read it, tragically. It's a better world where authors cannot force people to read— I was going to say I couldn't read his book, but yeah. Well, he could get you to hold it up, right? And I guess Gaddafi did that too, right? He had his little Green Book—that's all over. I'm sure it's still in the basements of the U.S. Embassy in Benghazi or whatever. But, you know, with that Jordan Peterson interview—what is amazing, like, when it came out, I watched it, and I was like, "OK, this is really—it's just great journalism." I mean, to your credit—what was funny to me, and more clear on a second viewing—is just that you're asking basic questions. And he is a male genius, and he uses ratiocination, he is incredibly learned—but it's like he's about to cry half the time. He is so emotional. Do you think we've entered into a period where men—the kind of male recourse to anger—is now being recognized less as, you know, genius and more as a failure to cope with what's going on in the circumstance? I hope that's true, because I know what you mean—particularly the kind of plethora of those very cruel videos of people having public meltdowns. I think you often see men melting down in public in a way that suggests they've just never learned to process and manage feelings of humiliation or denial, in a way that's quite unhealthy. And I think everybody would probably benefit from working a bit harder on that. But I'm pleased that you picked that up, because I do think it was very funny—because, you know, that was explicitly set up, that interview with Peterson— This was like—if I may make an analogy—this is like when Playboy sent a Black interviewer to General William Shockley. Sending GQ—sending a woman—to interview Jordan Peterson. For their Men of the Year issue. And that's the thing that's very funny, because everybody wanted it to be me—this kind of emotional little lady—and him to be the Great Man of Science loftily delivering his insights. But as you say, I'm there being quite sarcastic, because that's how I brawl. And he's the one who's kind of tearing up. It was actually very gender-nonconforming in that sense. So credit to everyone involved there. He fits into this category. He obviously toiled in the groves in the academy for a long time and had developed a certain kind of expertise and a certain level of reputation. And then when he broke big, now he's giving people tips on how to tie their tie and things like that. Yeah. I was talking to someone who knew him, actually, in Toronto earlier this week. And they said, you know, he was—he was this really great. Like, the research was really good, and the teaching was really good, and his students really liked him. Everybody who knows him from that period in his life is like, "Oh, you were a really great psychology professor, but you are probably not psychologically suited to be an internet commentator." Some people just have hides of inch-thick leather and that sort of thing bounces off of them. But clearly he's somebody who really takes criticism to heart, and it affects him quite deeply. And he's really not cut out for sprawling with people on the internet. Can I ask before—and I promise we'll get to Musk and then I'll let you get on with your day, or tea, or whatever you people are doing in England now—curtsying— —my crumpets —as you drive by… In your previous book Difficult Women, which is excellent—I'm a big fan of kind of second-wave feminism, which now gets read out of context. You read women like Valerie Solanas, the woman who shot Andy Warhol, and they're read out of context. Obviously, she shouldn't have shot Andy Warhol. She should have shot Norman Mailer if she understood her own theory. That would've been great. But what I'm saying is, second-wave feminism from the late '60s and early '70s often gets read in a void. So it just seems like these shrieking harpies who are talking about castrating men, etc., and it's always taken out of context. Like, yeah, they were denied entry into universities or jobs, etc. One of the figures you've talked about a fair amount is Germaine Greer. Talking about Norman Mailer—I mean, if you ever watch the live debate, she just rocks. She throws her fox fur stole over her shoulder and starts talking about building cathedrals in this über-academic way. I mean, it's… oh, I love it. Yeah. No—I mean, you could power all the energy needs of the developing world with the sexual tension… It is really quite something. Germaine Greer, does she fall into a problem of—she was hot, she had a moment. Do you think her thought isn't on a hot streak anymore? It's kind of a amazing because she helped define, certainly in England, second-wave feminism, and now she seems to be hated by most feminists. How does genius age? Oh, I don't think that's true in Britain, where she lived most of all—I mean, she's originally Australian. I think because of the transgender revolt of the last 10 years, she became very unfashionable with the people who came of age at that time. She was seen as being insufficiently inclusive of transgender women. But I think in Britain, the scales have tipped back toward—whatever you want to call it—sex realism, gender-critical feminism. People are now also rediscovering their love of Germaine Greer's brutal, radical honesty, I think we might call it. Personally, my favorite Germaine is not "Why I think naked boys are attractive" Germaine—that was a strange Germaine—nor even the Germaine of The Whole Woman or The Female Eunuch. But her writing on art criticism—she wrote a book about female painters called The Obstacle Race, which I read when I was revising this. As a scholar I think she's got another one called something like Kissing the Rod, which is about Restoration poetry. It's a very Germaine Greer title. She was an exceptional close reader of texts and paintings. And I wonder, actually, when the outrage about her comparing trans women to spaniels has all died down—we will remember the quality of her thoughts. In the same way that people now appreciate—you mentioned Valerie Solanas, but I'm thinking more of Andrea Dworkin. Penguin has just reissued all of Andrea Dworkin's work. Because it's now been long enough that people have kind of gotten over themselves about her controversies and remembered the interesting contributions that she made. But this comes exactly to what the whole book is about, which is: all of that depends on a generation of women—my age or below—who want to remember her, who want to keep enshrining her. This idea of history as a process—you know, we want to keep her memory and what she wrote alive. That's ultimately where the historical judgment comes from. It's whether or not the next generation thinks you're important. It seems to me that Britain has more—you know, and I use this term with air quotes—"TERFs" than American feminism. I think America maybe has a lot of… If you want to define it like this—80 percent of America thinks that sex matters and that there is a difference between trans women and women. Right? But those are none of— Yeah—none of that implies a different legal standing or anything like that. I have struggled. There's a tradition of French feminism, which is its own thing, and then Anglo-American feminism. I found it interesting, I guess, that there are very few American feminists who are on a Germaine Greer level—who exist and are talking publicly about this. Do you have a quick gloss on why it seems like second-wave feminism stuck around longer in England than it did in America? I think it's probably because of the trade union movement and the left feminist movement. Whereas in America, things became much more polarized. And also I think that in America, because abortion dominated the conversation for so long—and continues to dominate it—everybody gets sucked into that. There isn't a lot of space for other stuff. Plus, stuff like employment law being so much more federal in America—what are the kind of big…? And again, in America, race has been such a big part of the conversation for so much longer. I mean, Britain is now a much more diverse country than it was. But in the '90s, it was still 95 percent white. These are just much more recent questions about whether or not feminism is, quote, "white." In 1920, that wasn't a question in British feminism because everybody was white. Whereas it was a huge deal in America. So I think all of those social factors might account for it. I was just thinking as you were talking about England being blessedly white even into the 1990s. Whoa, whoa, whoa—I didn't say that! I was going to say—if you're looking for supplementary material for the eventual paperback edition of this, it would be great to look at Eric Clapton as a genius who then went on to a bit of racial… Very Shockley. A very Shockley trajectory. Like, "Oh, so you loved 'Layla'? Would you also like to hear my thoughts on race?" No—just play "Layla" again. That was really great. And he also has a few thoughts on COVID. I'm sure John Lennon would have had his few thoughts on COVID, I'm just saying. Well, yeah. This is where I think John Lydon—or Johnny Rotten—is kind of… he's a very stable genius, because whatever is dominant thinking, he will be on the other side of it at any given moment in time. But let's talk about Musk quickly. He's not the controlling metaphor of your book, but he is the controlling genius of our moment. Do you think his recent foray into politics—does that tarnish him? Because I was thinking: there's a science writer based in Canada named Dan Gardner. He has a fabulous Substack called Past, Present, Future, or something like that. He wrote a lot about Henry Ford. And he was like, "Hey, I want to tell you a story about a carmaker who really kind of blew his reputation by talking about stuff he didn't really know anything about." And it's about Henry Ford, who was a great genius at mass production and all of this kind of stuff. And then he got bored running a car company, and he's like, "OK, I'm going to solve World War I." And didn't he become a massive antisemite? Oh, he was. He is the Bob Dylan of antisemites. I don't know who's the ultimate Jew. He went electric. Yes, absolutely. And then he also ended up suing people who libeled him for describing him accurately, and then losing status in public court hearings. Because he's an idiot about all of this kind of stuff. Where does that story go? Because he is the epitome of galaxy brain. It's like: he's good at these things, so every thought he has is good, and we have to put up with him. You know, he was working for an administration where people want to have more kids and be Christian. We don't know how many children he has—virtually none of them in a marriage setting. He's divorced, and increasingly it's not even clear how many there are or under what circumstances they were born. That's one thing people tolerate—because he's good at making money and making cars. But then this political foray, where he's going back to Texas—is that the type of thing that destroys his geniusness, or does it remain to be seen? I mean, I think it does. How I've always felt about it is: SpaceX, which is the truly innovative business—if it manages to make reusable rockets work in that way that drives down the cost of space travel, that allows us to become an interplanetary species—I would have thought, in 400 years' time, we're not going to be talking about his bad tweets. But at the current rate, I think he deeply risks falling into that Shockley pattern—of somebody whose juice kind of runs out. Because look at the DOGE as we're talking, he's just been giving this round of kind of exit interviews complaining it was a lot harder than he thought it would be. And you know how he could have found out how hard it would have been? He could have asked me—an idiot—to tell him that. The fact is, governments are harder to run than private businesses, because you can't have creative destruction. You can't just let a government fail and someone else move in—people die, people don't get their Social Security checks. These are important things. But instead, he trampled through that undergrowth like a huge rhino, insistent that he knew best. And—shock horror—if he'd gone into that with his undoubted skills, but had learned more first, he would have been more successful at it. Well, from a Reason angle, it was frustrating, because there are people who work at Reason—but also there's a whole Gulag Archipelago of think tanks—of people who have said, "This is how you cut government spending and waste," etc. And, like, there are almost off-the-shelf plans you can bring in as opposed to going in and not succeeding. Ones that are increasingly picking up traction on the left, right? If you look at the whole abundance agenda—a lot of that is really saying, places like California don't work because they overregulate. What's that phrase of Ezra Klein's? "Everything bagel liberalism"—where it's like, "Why don't we make this housing project also solve racism and wild birds?" So there's definitely a libertarian critique that people feel government is slow and sclerotic. And a more humble man might have read those things first. The point with Musk is that—I guess this is part of where geniuses go to destroy themselves—they really don't think that, as your book argues—and I think it's completely persuasive—that breakthrough technologies are never the result of one person. But when you get exalted like that, then you stop looking around for the expertise or the team that will actually help you produce results. Then you're looking for yes men, or people who will… Your circle becomes—you become Kanye West or something, where nobody around you is going to say no. Yeah. And I think the really interesting examples of that—Picasso and Einstein are probably our most obvious examples. Most people's go-to ideas of artistic and scientific genius. But Einstein never really accepts quantum mechanics. So when he dies, he's more a celebrity than the kind of person in the field that young physicists look to. And Picasso similarly doesn't go to pure abstraction—he doesn't end up in the place of Rothko. That's because they had their paradigm shift. They had the moment where they were the perfect brain to meet the moment. And I think you probably see something very similar with Musk. He had a playbook—which, if you read Character Limit, the book about his takeover of Twitter—you know, he brings in his lieutenants, they lock everybody out of the systems, they fire everyone and rehire that they need. He just had this way that had worked for him in the past. And he went, "Bring on big balls, I'm going to do that to the government too." And he didn't realize that it was not the same environment, and that his one thing that had worked before would now not serve him anymore. And that, to me, exactly is what you're saying. It's a classic genius myth: you think, "I've got the answer," not realizing that different questions have different answers. Right. Yeah—and to go back to that idea of domain-specific intelligence or expertise: not everything is like everything else. That was one of the great myths in American capitalism in the mid-20th century that was destroyed—the idea that all businesses, regardless of what you produce, can be managed by a set of professional managers who are trained in management. And it turns out shipbuilding is very different from oil production, which is different from newspapers, and all of that. If I may—are there good examples of geniuses who run into the wall that Musk has driven his Tesla into with Dogecoin and everything—who then come back? Are there Paul McCartneys, whose second truth or last two-thirds of a career are actually as good or as interesting as the first third? That's a really good question. And I'll probably have to give it more thought than I'm able to on the hoof, because— I'll tell you what—I can't think of any examples offhand, but as you're saying that, I can totally see what a great story that is. And how much people would love that story. So there probably are examples of it. I'm thinking of the kid who was the actor in Indiana Jones who then didn't really do anything for ages and then won the Oscar for Everything Everywhere All at Once. People love that idea that this is the ultimate comeback story. So I can see that happening, where someone had been piddling away for a while and then came back with something. But I don't know. The best versions, I think, of people are your McCartneys or your Springsteens—or, you know, I went to see the Pixies last week. People who just carry on doing something because they clearly love it, the fans love it, and they enjoy it. And the Pixies gig was very interesting, because clearly people were there to hear the songs primarily from Surfer Rosa, their 1980s album. And they play those quite happily. Then they play some of their new stuff too. And I just thought: this is quite a good acknowledgment of: this was the moment we were hottest. We're not in that moment now. But we don't hate those people or resent that. We love that it happened. We're not sad that it didn't go on forever. That is fascinating. Yeah, I started my career as a teen magazine and rock music journalist. And there's nothing worse than bands or artists who hate the work that made them famous. It's an awful life. It's sad, isn't it? It's really sad. It is. And there are people—I'm thinking of someone like Nick Cave or Bob Dylan. They're very different, but Dylan refused to go away. He goes through cycles where stuff starts to make sense, even if it seems horrible the first time. And Cave has certainly been growing as an artist. And someone like Madonna—I think she stopped, in a way, but had a fantastic run. Can I just real quickly do a bit of biography? Because you mention at one point—and I thought this was fascinating in the book—that your father, in the '50s, took one of these inscrutable-to-Americans O-levels or A-levels, or whatever. I've read a ton of Beatles biographies, and they're always talking about how "I ruined my A-levels," and I have no idea what they're talking about. It's not easy to understand—like SATs. Yeah, no, of course—which is its own kind of bullshit. But your father did well on a test, and that meant that he got to go to university. What is your background, and how did you get to be where you're at? So the test you're talking about is the Eleven-Plus, which kids took at the age of 11. At the time—this is after… so my parents were both born in 1945—so this is in the aftermath of the Second World War. The idea was, if you came from a working-class family—and any other kind of family—that they were going to try and make higher-level education more accessible to a greater number of people. But the way to do that was by selecting viability. So you took this test at 11, and if you passed it, you went to a grammar school. If you didn't, you went to what was called a secondary modern or a technical school. The idea was that you either had an academic education or a vocational one based around going into trades. Because at 11—come on—the bread is baked, right? Well, that's a big… I mean, we mentioned Lewis Terman a long time ago. He also, earlier than that, thought that you could kind of pick future winners very early. And that's not always possible. The other thing it did was create—you know, you'll hear people today will say, "the Eleven-Plus was amazing because I got chances that I wouldn't otherwise got." But that's a kind of survivorship bias, because you don't hear as much from the people whose lives were ruined by being told at 11 they were not good enough. But in his case, it meant he was the first in his family to go to university. He went to Aston University in Birmingham to study chemistry. He worked first for Worcester Porcelain—where I grew up, which has its own delightful porcelain—and then for a place that made things you melt steel in—crucibles. Sorry, I know you're loving how much of an English stereotype I am, aren't you? Yeah. "It has a delightful bone china—from the Potteries." But you know, he benefited—definitely—he got lifted up like that. And on my mum's side, my granddad, who was Scottish, he was a coal miner. He moved south and took civil service exams as an adult. So he was the engine, he moved from working class to middle class, at that point. My mum then went to the same school I ended up going to, which was a convent school, a Catholic school. So I came from a really nice, normal middle-class high school. This was in the Midlands in England. I didn't know anybody who was a journalist. I didn't know anybody who lived in London. Even Birmingham was quite exciting to me. So I do have to remind myself every so often: if I could go back and talk to 16-year-old me about what I do and who I know, she would be pretty impressed. It is kind of fascinating, isn't it? There's a version of this in the U.S.—and I think throughout the West, and even much of the developing world—where tests, whether they're IQ tests or aptitude tests, they're used in many ways to reinforce the status quo or to naturalize it. But oftentimes, the goal—even when they were implemented—was not necessarily to do that, but to be more egalitarian and more meritocratic. Intelligence needs to be contextualized, and things like that. You know… Well, it's not necessarily a bad impulse, is it? Because actually, the signature event in my academic career was that I went to Oxford University, and that was determined— I said… A little place, yeah, in the Cotswolds. But that wasn't determined by a test for English—that was determined by an interview. And you know what? That obviously privileges eloquent bullshitters. The die was cast in my future in podcasting, because that's exactly what that selects for. Tests are bad in some ways, but they're also sort of… they're the worst thing apart from all the other things. We haven't yet invented a way of designing education that weeds out bias. The Eleven-Plus was notoriously problematic because it was easier for middle-class kids to pass it. They had more knowledge. Often just flat-out their parents hired tutors to get them through it. Now what happens is that there are very few grammar schools left, and the house prices around them are exceptionally high. So you end up with class sorting by who can afford to buy a house in that area. I mean, that's… to talk about the abundance agenda. And I always think when I hear about Ezra Klein, I'm like: If you want to read what Ezra Klein is going to write tomorrow, read what Reason was publishing 20 years ago. But part of it is—when it comes to educational opportunity and whatnot—the idea that, well, there are only 10 universities. So we have to sort to get the right people into that. It's like, maybe you create a world where there are many, many different universities—or more schooling opportunities—rather than funneling people through. In America, there was starting to retreat—not necessarily for good reasons—but there was this birth of gifted and talented programs. And most of the time, it wasn't just like, "If you hit this level of testing, you'll be in the gifted and talented program." It's like, "We only have a certain number of slots." And, well—if the test says you're gifted and talented, why don't you expand the program? But oftentimes, the function of schooling is not to increase opportunity, but to maintain the existing power structure. That's my idea. No, I know. And there's loads of stuff that happens like that. The Ivy Leagues, which excluded or limited Jewish students in the first half of the 20th century, they did that by saying, "We want to look at well-rounded students." Or they moved their recruitment pools out of New York City and into the outer boroughs—or whatever it might be. That's the only way I think T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound got into Ivy League schools—because they were from Missouri and Idaho. So they benefited from the geographical quota. But this is one of the big themes of the book: a level of humility about the systems we have and whether or not they are free from bias. And when the things that look natural and inevitable to us are actually the result of things we can't see—because, yeah, there are a lot of invisible hands. And actually, sometimes, extremely visible hands, if you care to look for them. Yeah, the Ivy Leagues now have a different way of keeping Jews off campus, right? So they—you know, it's more visible. This is not the first time that America's had debates about affirmative action. It just used to be that the affirmative action was in favor of WASPs in the 1920s. Yes, and I'm glad to live in a post-WASP America, for the most part. Just a final question about your method. Have you ever been called a genius? Hm. Why? One of the things that I find remarkable in your work—both the podcasting but then the writing work. I always take this as a sign of an excellent journalist—and I don't really care about "geniuses" is that you find a topic and then report out on it. And that way, you don't have to worry about a hot streak or a cold streak, because the onus isn't on you to be a genius all the time or to come up with new and novel things to say. You go out into the world and see what's happening. That seems to me that's a very rare model for journalism—but it obviously seems like the best way to do it. It's a great relief to just be like, "I am not actually that interesting. What I do is, I go and put myself in interesting places and meet interesting people—and I will tell you about them." And like you say, I'm surprised more people don't do it, because it's a huge burden off you. If you're not trying to be the main character in your drama—if you're content to be the amanuensis at the side—then yeah, it's a huge weight off your shoulders. And I think this is what drives a lot of modern journalists kind of mad: if you're only telling a story in which you're the protagonist, then you need to keep doing stuff. And actually, just go and talk to other people. Other people are mad. They say crazy things. That's Tom Wolfe, in the introduction to his collection The New Journalism, which was about stuff from the '60s and early '70s, published in the early '70s. He said that, "it was amazing. So many weird things were happening in America, and all you had to do was go out and hang out with people." He's seen as someone who's a genius—he has genius insights and is a stylist—but he says in plain sight:" just go and talk to people who are doing things you think are interesting." And you are interesting. It's also just the most fun. I mean, there's nothing that makes me happier than being in some random bit of backstreet America, just talking to people whose life experiences are completely different from mine. And I wish more people got the opportunity to do it, to be honest. The color that you add to, you know, talking about going to—or witnessing—one of the SpaceX launches or recoveries is brilliant. You know, because it's out in the world. It's wonderful. I have kept you overlong—I apologize for that. Where are the best places people should look for your work? You can find most of it through my Substack, which is helenlewis.substack.com. And also my longer, more considered work is at The Atlantic, who are very kind in giving me—the thing that I really like about working for them is that they invest in you as a person. And like you say, reporting is the best and most fun thing to do. And it's not the easiest thing to do in journalism at the moment. So I give them huge credit for letting me—letting me be my best self. God, that sounded like therapy. Sorry—what a hateful note to end on. I'm going to go and have, like, a muffin and a crumpet and be overly British. Yeah, maybe talk about Princess Diana and how sad it is. Are you up on the royals? Do you like the royals? Oh, yeah. I know. There was a time during the Prince Harry saga where I was threatening to become The Atlantic's royal correspondent, just because I enjoy writing about them. And by God, do Americans love reading about them. I don't understand that. And I think Harry was best when he was following in—was it Edward VII or VIII?—when he was doing the Nazi costumes. I was going to say, "being a Nazi." It's all been downhill for him since then. Helen Lewis, thank you so much. It was a real delight talking to you. The Genius Myth is a spectacular book. It's the best thing you've written recently—until the next one. So thank you very much. Thank you very much.

Title: NYSE: ELV DEADLINE REMINDER: Berger Montague Reminds Elevance Health (NYSE: ELV) Investors of Important Class Action Lawsuit Deadline

June 04, 2025 10:52 ET | Source: Berger Montague Berger Montague PHILADELPHIA, June 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Berger Montague PC advises investors that a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV) on behalf of purchasers of Elevance securities between April 18, 2024 through October 16, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investor Deadline: Investors who purchased or acquired Elevance securities during the Class Period may, no later than JULY 11, 2025, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class. To learn your rights, CLICK HERE. Elevance, based in Indianapolis, Ind., is a healthcare company that, among other things, provides health insurance plans to a variety of markets, including contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits for eligible beneficiaries. States regularly conduct an eligibility review to “redetermine” whether Medicaid beneficiaries still qualify for coverage. According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, Defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the “redetermination” process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the cost profiles. Defendants acknowledged rising Medicaid expenses, yet assured investors that this was adequately reflected in the Company’s guidance for the year. In truth, however, the redeterminations were causing the utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members to rise significantly, as the members being removed from Medicaid programs were, on average, healthier than those who remained eligible for the programs. This shift was not adequately reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The truth began to emerge on July 17, 2024, when the Company revealed that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.” In response to this disclosure, the price of Elevance common stock declined by $32.21 per share, or 5.8%, to a closing price of $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Finally, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its financial results for Q3 2024, revealing that the Company had missed earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations for Q3 by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Further, Elevance lowered EPS guidance for 2024 from $37.20 to $33.00, or 11.3%, as it expected these Medicaid issues to continue. These disclosures caused the price of Elevance common stock to decline by another $52.61 per share, or 10.6%, to a closing price of $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024. To learn your rights or for more information, CLICK HERE or please contact Berger Montague: Andrew Abramowitz at aabramowitz@bm.net or (215) 875-3015, or Peter Hamner at phamner@bm.net. A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation. The lead plaintiff is usually the investor or small group of investors who have the largest financial interest and who are also adequate and typical of the proposed class of investors. The lead plaintiff selects counsel to represent the lead plaintiff and the class and these attorneys, if approved by the court, are lead or class counsel. Your ability to share in any recovery is not, however, affected by the decision whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff. Communicating with any counsel is not necessary to participate or share in any recovery achieved in this case. Any member of the purported class may move the Court to serve as a lead plaintiff through counsel of his/her choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an inactive class member.

Title: Cuts to USAID severed longstanding American support for Indigenous people around the world

The effort to protect the Peruvian Amazon from deforestation related to the cocaine trade was long supported by financial assistance from the U.S. Agency for International Development NEW YORK -- Miguel Guimaraes Vasquez fought for years to protect his homeland in the Peruvian Amazon from deforestation related to the cocaine trade, even laboring under death threats from drug traffickers. A leader in an Indigenous rights group, Vasquez said such efforts were long supported by financial assistance from the U.S. Agency for International Development, which spent billions of dollars starting in the 1980s to help farmers in Peru shift from growing coca for cocaine production to legal crops such as coffee and cacao for chocolate. The agency funded economic and agricultural training and technology, and helped farmers gain access to international markets. But the Trump administration's recent sweeping cuts to the agency have thrown that tradition of U.S. assistance into doubt, and Indigenous people in the Amazon worry that without American support there will be a resurgence of the cocaine market, increased threats to their land and potentially violent challenges to their human rights. “We don’t have the U.S. government with us anymore. So it can get really dangerous,” said Vásquez, who belongs to the Shipibo-Konibo people and is vice president of the Interethnic Association for the Development of the Peruvian Rainforest. "We think the situation is going to get worse.” Several Indigenous human rights defenders have been killed trying to protect their land, Vasquez said, and in some of those cases U.S. foreign aid provided money to help prosecute the slayings. “We really needed those resources,” he said. When Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, began dismantling USAID shortly after President Donald Trump began his second term, it all but eliminated U.S. foreign aid spending, including decades of support to Indigenous peoples around the world. USAID’s work with Indigenous peoples sought to address a variety of global issues affecting the U.S., according to former employees. Its economic development efforts created jobs in South America, easing the need for people to work in illicit drug markets and reducing the likelihood they would migrate to America seeking jobs and safety. And its support for the rights of Indigenous peoples to steward their own land offered opportunities to mitigate climate change. That included Vásquez's organization, which was about to receive a four-year, $2.5 million grant to continue fighting illicit activity that affects Indigenous people in the region. Vásquez said that grant was rescinded by the new administration. In January, DOGE launched a sweeping effort empowered by Trump to fire government workers and cut trillions in government spending. USAID, which managed about $35 billion in appropriations in fiscal year 2024, was one of his prime targets. Critics say the aid programs are wasteful and promote a liberal agenda. Trump, Musk and Republicans in Congress have accused the agency of advancing liberal social programs. “Foreign assistance done right can advance our national interests, protect our borders, and strengthen our partnerships with key allies,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement in March. “Unfortunately, USAID strayed from its original mission long ago. As a result, the gains were too few and the costs were too high.” Musk last week announced his departure from the Trump administration, marking the end of a turbulent chapter that included thousands of layoffs and reams of litigation. Former USAID employees said political pressure from the U.S. often kept foreign governments from violating some Indigenous rights. In the three months since thousands of foreign aid workers were fired and aid contracts canceled, the Peruvian government has moved quickly to strip Indigenous people of their land rights and to tighten controls on international organizations that document human rights abuses. It's now a serious offense for a nonprofit to provide assistance to anyone working to bring lawsuits against the government. The National Commission for Development and a Drug-Free Lifestyle, the country's agency that fights drug trafficking, did not respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. “The impact was really, really strong, and we felt it really quickly when the Trump administration changed its stance about USAID,” Vásquez said. The U.S. spends less than 1% of its budget on foreign assistance. Tim Rieser, a senior foreign policy aide in the Senate who works for Democratic Vermont Sen. Peter Welch, called DOGE’s cuts to USAID a “mindless” setback to years of work. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. USAID’s work reached Indigenous communities around the world. It sought to mitigate the effects of human rights abuses in South America, created programs in Africa to enable Indigenous people to manage their own communities and led the global U.S. effort to fight hunger. One of the most recent additions to USAID’s work was incorporating international concepts of Indigenous rights into policy. Rieser, for instance, was responsible for crafting legislation that created an adviser within USAID to protect the rights and address the needs of Indigenous peoples. The adviser advocated for Indigenous rights in foreign assistance programs, including actions by the World Bank. “That provided Indigenous people everywhere with a way to be heard here in Washington,” Rieser said. “That has now been silenced.” That adviser position remains unfilled. Vy Lam, USAID's adviser on Indigenous peoples, who said he was fired in March as part of the DOGE downsizing, said the idea of Indigenous rights, and the mandate to recognize them in foreign operations, was new to USAID. But it gained momentum under President Joe Biden's administration. He said concepts such as “free, prior and informed consent” — the right of Indigenous people to give or withhold approval for any action that would affect their lands or rights — were slowly being implemented in American foreign policy. One of the ways that happened, Lam said, came in the form of U.S. political pressure on foreign governments or private industry to negotiate mutually beneficial agreements between Indigenous peoples and their governments. For instance, if an American company wanted to build a hotel in an area that could affect an Indigenous community, the U.S. could push for the deal to require Indigenous approval, or at least consultation. “We had that convening power, and that is the thing that I grieve the most,” Lam said. U.S. foreign aid workers were also able to facilitate the reporting of some human rights violations, such as when a human rights or environmental defender is jailed without charges, or Indigenous peoples are forced off their land for the establishment of a protected area. In some cases, USAID supported travel to the United Nations, where Indigenous leaders and advocates could receive training to navigate international bodies and document abuses. Last year, under the Biden administration, USAID awarded a five-year grant to support Indigenous LGBTQIA people through the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Indigenous People, an agency that offers financial support to Indigenous peoples to participate in the U.N. At $350,000 per year, it was the largest grant from any member state in the U.N., fund Secretary Morse Flores said. The money would have paid for attendance at the U.N. and other international bodies to report human rights abuses and to testify on foreign policy. In February, the fund received notice that the grant would be terminated. The State Department does not plan to fulfill its pledge to fund the remaining four years of the grant. In most cases, people receiving assistance to attend major meetings "are actual victims of human rights violations,” Flores said. “For someone who’s unable to come and speak up, I mean, it’s really just an injustice.” ___ This story was published in partnership with Grist, a nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to reporting on climate change. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Ripple Boss Brad Garlinghouse Denies Pursuing Deal To Acquire Stablecoin Giant Circle

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse clarified that his crypto powerhouse never pursued the acquisition of major stablecoin issuer Circle. The statement, which was made during a Las Vegas event, comes after reports claimed that Ripple reportedly offered between $4 billion and $5 billion to purchase Circle. Speaking to Georgetown Law professor Chris Brummer, Ripple asserted that the company was not exploring a potential acquisition of Circle. “Brad was unequivocal — Ripple never pursued an acquisition of Circle. And while he wished the company well, it wasn’t something he was considering,” Brummer revealed in a June 3 post on X, citing a discussion he had onstage at the Ripple Las Vegas conference “48 hours ago.” The session was not broadcast live. Bloomberg was the first to report that Ripple tried to purchase Circle, but the $4 billion to $5 billion bid was rejected as being too low. America’s leading crypto exchange, Coinbase, allegedly made a counterbid. Sources also told Fortune that Circle would sell to Coinbase “in a heartbeat” given their longstanding relationship. Founded in 2013, Circle is a major company in the crypto industry, known as the issuer of USDC, the industry’s second-largest stablecoin by market cap after Tether’s USDT. As ZyCrypto previously covered, the reports of Ripple’s potential takeover of Circle were met with a mixed reaction within the cryptosphere. Cardano co-founder Charles Hoskinson, for instance, suggested that the deal, if successful, could “make the space better.” Meanwhile, MetaLeX Labs founder Gabriel Shapiro speculated that it could lead to a “crypto apocalypse.” “Making Ripple the largest asset issuer on every blockchain would obviously be disastrous and anticompetitive,” Shapiro had explained at the time. According to a recent SEC filing, Circle is seeking a fully diluted valuation of up to $7.2 billion in its upcoming initial public offering (IPO). The company will sell up to 32 million shares priced between $27 and $28 each. Circle’s IPO is attracting significant interest from market participants, with the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, reportedly planning to purchase roughly 10% of the offering.

Title: Bitcoin Could Replace Dollar As World’s Reserve Currency Amid Ballooning US Debt Crisis, Coinbase CEO Posits

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong predicted that Bitcoin might “take over” as the world’s next reserve currency if Congress doesn’t tackle rising national debt quickly. With America’s national debt sitting comfortably around the $37 trillion mark, Armstrong is warning that the burden could one day be the reason the dollar is dethroned by the premier crypto as the reserve currency of the world. “I love Bitcoin, but a strong America is also super important for the world,” the Coinbase boss said in a June 3 post on the X social media platform. “We need to get our finances under control.” If the electorate doesn't hold congress accountable to reducing the deficit, and start paying down the debt, Bitcoin is going to take over as reserve currency.I love Bitcoin, but a strong America is also super important for the world. We need to get our finances under control. https://t.co/aeBE7pUuHo His worries over the debt crisis came as House Republicans passed President Donald Trump’s so-called “One big, beautiful bill” in May that extends tax cuts, boosts military spending, and cuts Medicaid, food aid, and clean energy. Six Nobel Prize-winning economists, including Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz, argued in a June letter that the bill’s structural design would increase inequality and add over $3 trillion to the US debt. Fears of inflation and fiscal strain fuel strong interest in Bitcoin, an anti-inflationary asset with a fixed supply. Investors wary of the government’s apparent failure to rein in its spending are preparing for runaway inflation over the long term by pivoting to the top crypto as the safer bet than the dollar. Tesla CEO Elon Musk also slammed the bill on Tuesday, calling it a “massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill” and a “disgusting abomination.” Musk collaborated with Trump to establish the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.), which triggered controversy due to the agency’s aggressive approach to target various government departments to identify and recommend cost cuts to Trump and Congress. But the wheels have fallen off that initiative. Musk has clarified that he will dedicate most of his time to Tesla, SpaceX, and his other companies from now on. Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong isn’t the only person concerned about what might happen if America runs out of people to buy its soaring debt. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said in a letter to shareholders earlier this year that America’s rising national debt threatens the dollar’s status as the global reserve currency, potentially leading to decentralized assets like Bitcoin taking its place. Bitcoin has historically served as a safe haven during economic tumult, such as the pandemic, and could benefit long-term from eroding trust in fiat systems, especially with the US fiscal outlook worsening. Meanwhile, US President Trump has previously floated using Bitcoin to solve the mounting sovereign debt crisis.

(NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that its missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Title: Citigroup Reverses Its Firearms Policy Months After Trump Called Out U.S. Banks. Here’s What to Know
URL: https://time.com/7291023/citigroup-firearms-policy-reversal-trump-conservatives-banks-pressure/

Reporter A street view of a Citibank branch in San Francisco, Calif., on May 13, 2025. Reporter Citigroup has reversed its policy restricting banking services to retail clients selling firearms, ending the practice that was put into place in 2018. In a statement shared on June 3, the bank said that the decision had been made in response to concerns raised over “fair access” to banking services. As a result, Citigroup said it would “no longer have a specific policy as it relates to firearms.” The reversal comes after criticism from President Donald Trump and other conservatives regarding “de-banking,” citing what they believe to be unfair practices from U.S. banks preventing conservatives from using their services. Advertisement Advertisement Addressing the World Economic Forum in Davos virtually in January, Trump said: “Many conservatives complain that the banks are not allowing them to do business,” taking aim at U.S. bank CEOs. Here’s what to know about Citigroup’s reversal and how it fits into wider discussions about banks and politics in America. Citigroup outlined the specifics of its previous restrictions, saying: “Our U.S. Commercial Firearms Policy was implemented in 2018 and pertained to sale of firearms by our retail clients and partners. The policy was intended to promote the adoption of best sales practices as prudent risk management and didn’t address the manufacturing of firearms.” Since 2018, Citigroup had restricted its services to retail clients selling firearms, requiring them to adhere to three practices. Under the policy, “new retail sector clients or partners,” clients could not sell firearms to those who hadn’t passed a background check, had to restrict the sale of firearms for individuals under 21, and could not sell bump stocks or high-capacity magazines. In its June 3 update, the bank said that after reviewing its policies, it will be updating its "Employee Code of Conduct" and its "customer-facing Global Financial Access Policy," to clearly state that the Citigroup does "not discriminate on the basis of political affiliation." “These changes reinforce our commitment to serve all clients fairly, and we will continue to work with regulators and elected officials on ways to improve transparency and trust in the banking sector,” the statement continued. The banking service introduced new restrictions in March 2018 following a shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida on Feb. 14 of that year, which left 17 people dead. The shooter, Nikolas Cruz, aged 19 at the time, was able to obtain firearms after a background check, despite previous warning signs. Both Cruz’s age and circumstances were addressed in Citigroup’s firearm policy. Not allowing retailers to sell bump stocks was also included in the bank’s 2018 policy, after the device was used during a mass shooting in Las Vegas in 2017. A bump stock allows semi-automatic rifles to fire at a higher rate, and were banned by the Trump Administration in December 2018. However, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down this ban in 2024. After the shooting in Parkland, Florida, investment management firm BlackRock also announced that it would be asking for further details and information on business practices from firearms manufacturers and retailers. In April 2018, Bank of America said that it would be restricting firearms-related business and would stop lending money to manufacturers that make military-inspired weapons to be used by civilians. In particular, Bank of America started to wind down relationships with manufacturers that produced AR-15 style rifles that have been used in mass shootings. In 2024, Bank of America loosened some of its restrictions surrounding lending to the firearms and energy industries, amid pressure from politicians in Texas and Florida. Criticism amongst conservatives and Republicans have long been aimed at banking institutions for imposing restrictions on firearms and other issues. In 2022, a number of conservative-led states considered a number of new bills, with some passing, penalizing banks for such policies. According to Reuters, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Goldman Sachs were all sidelined by state law that barred firms from the municipal bond market if they were found to “discriminate” against the firearms industry in the state. In April 2024, over a dozen Republican state attorneys general addressed a letter to The Bank of America, raising their concerns with the bank’s “de-banking policies and practices threaten the company’s financial health, its reputation with customers, our nation’s economy, and the civil liberties of everyday Americans.” Within the letter, Bank of America was criticized for “systemic biases” against political views. The letter cited a report in which the bank is said to have shared a list with the FBI of anyone who had bought a firearm with a credit or debit card from the bank in Washington, D.C., in the days surrounding the Capitol Riots on Jan. 6, 2021. “We are shocked that Bank of America would so cavalierly disregard its customers’ privacy and their First, Second, and Fourth Amendment rights at the behest of the federal government,” the letter continued. Shortly after his inauguration in January, Trump launched criticism at banks, in particular at the Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, during a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Speaking directly to Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, Trump said: “The Bank of America, they don’t take conservative business… you, Jamie (Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase) and everybody, I hope you’re going to open your banks to conservatives because what you're doing is wrong.” In response, Bank of America said that it “welcomes conservatives” as part of the 70 million customers that it serves. “We would never close accounts for political reasons and don't have a political litmus test,” the bank said in a statement after Trump’s remarks. Elsewhere, the Trump Organization sued Capitol One in March, accusing the bank of closing hundreds of accounts belonging to the company. In its complaint, the Trump Organization said it believes “that Capital One’s unilateral decision came about as a result of political and social motivations and Capital One’s unsubstantiated, ‘woke’ beliefs that it needed to distance itself from President Trump and his conservative political views.” The complaint argued that Capitol One’s decision was “part of a growing trend by financial institutions in the United States of America to cut off a consumer’s access to banking services if their political views contradict with those of the financial institution.” Capitol One responded, requesting that the lawsuit be thrown out, and in turn arguing that the Trump Organization’s complaint “fails to provide any factual or legal support for the claims asserted, requiring dismissal on several grounds.” © 2025 TIME USA, LLC.

Nvidia (NVDA) shares are rising in premarket trading Wednesday, a day after it overtook Microsoft (MSFT) to become the world’s most valuable company again. Nvidia shares are rising nearly 1% in premarket trading Wednesday, after it edged out Microsoft in market cap on Tuesday, closing up nearly 3% to $141.22 and putting the AI chipmaker’s value at $3.444 trillion. Microsoft’s market cap was $3.441 trillion at its close Tuesday. Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple (AAPL) have been jostling to occupy the spot as the world’s most valuable company for nearly a year. They are the only companies to have ever achieved a market value of more than $3 trillion. Despite their gains, Nvidia’s market cap is still below its record of $3.66 trillion from earlier January when shares set their all-time high. Shares of Nvidia as well as others linked to the AI boom tumbled then when China's DeepSeek released a low-cost model that raised investor concerns about the future dominance of American AI firms. On Tuesday, Jefferies added Nvidia to its roster of “Franchise Picks,” touting the company as the “dominant supplier of AI accelerators” to data centers, facilities that house the advanced computers used to develop and train AI models.

The company said on Wednesday U.S. regulators have asked it about certain transactions as well as the July 19 outage. It earlier forecast second-quarter revenue below estimates, partly due to an incentive program meant to retain customers after the outage. Its shares fell more than 5 per cent in afternoon trading. The program ended in the fourth quarter but continues to weigh on subscription growth, as it let customers pick more products or extend usage. The incentives reduced first-quarter revenue by about $11 million and will have a $10 million to $15 million impact each quarter for the rest of the fiscal year.

Title: Flock’s AI Cameras Are Watching Cars All Over America. They’re About To Get A Lot More Powerful.
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2025/06/04/flocks-ai-cameras-are-watching-cars-all-over-america-theyre-about-to-get-a-lot-more-powerful/
Time Published: 2025-06-04T12:00:53Z
Full Content:
ByThomas Brewster ByThomas Brewster, Forbes Staff. Flock has tens of thousands of cameras operating across almost all American states. It's now giving those devices live streaming capability, making them significantly more powerful. Flock Safety, the $7.5 billion car surveillance company, has already built a sizable AI-powered camera network, with tens of thousands of smart license plate readers monitoring roads in 49 American states. Soon its cameras are going to capture a lot more. In the fall this year, cops will be able to turn their Flock license plate readers into something more akin to traditional surveillance cameras. While Flock cameras today take photos of vehicles, flagging any car that’s on a hotlist of suspected vehicles to cops or private industry customers like FedEx or mall provider Simon Property, those same customers will soon be able to request either live feeds or 15 second clips from around the time a vehicle passed through a camera’s field of vision. Garrett Langley, Flock CEO, told Forbes that the update should give cops more “situational awareness.” Police will be able to pull up feeds from Flock cameras when a 911 call comes in, for instance, Langley said. “We will just open up the five nearest cameras in real time and say, here's what's happening right now,” he said. There will also be the option to upgrade to a camera where the angle can be adjusted, for a wider purview. “If it helps us get to our North Star of solving every single crime that happens in America, then it's a cost worth bearing.” For years, civil liberties experts have worried about Flock’s expansion. Last week, 404 Media reported that a Texas agency had used it to locate a woman who’d had a self-administered abortion across state lines. Jay Stanley, technology director at the ACLU, fretted that Flock “is trying to build a nationwide authoritarian surveillance system.” Langley, in response to those privacy concerns, said that Flock’s tech was auditable and transparent. It was down to democratically-elected individuals and groups to decide if Flock was right for them and what they do with the data the cameras collect, he said. Flock’s expansion comes on the heels of Axon Enterprise announcing a rival product to Flock’s license plate readers in April. Flock and Axon, a $59 billion market cap publicly traded cop contractor best known for making the Taser, had previously been partners, but in February, the two companies had a very public break up. Axon CEO Rick Smith said at the time that Flock was trying to lock customers into its products by making its software restrictive enough that it didn’t work as effectively with other vendors’ tools. Langley in response claimed it was Axon that had decided to be less collaborative, as evidenced by its decision to stop working with or recommending Flock. Langley told Forbes in an interview last week that he was hoping to challenge Axon’s “monopoly” by building a competitor that the market had been lacking. He claimed agencies he spoke with had become “frustrated with the monopolistic behavior that Axon has exhibited over the years and continues to exhibit, and I think that the beauty of capitalism is that it enables competition when properly enforced.” In response, Axon spokesperson Alex Engel said that Axon was a collaborative business with over 60 technology partners and integrations, which “underscores our commitment to customer choice, interoperability, and transparency.” “Axon's ecosystem is built on the belief that customers should always own and control their data,” Engel added, without mentioning Flock. Flock has been broadening its product offering for police to include drones, gunshot detection and a new software suite called Nova, which draws in information from police databases to make connections between suspects, properties or any other notable aspect of an investigation. That latter tool was built on technology Flock Safety quietly acquired in a previously unreported deal with Lucidus Tech last year. Lucidus was cofounded by former senior staff at Peregrine Technologies, a $2.5 billion startup that offers similar tech to Nova. Langley said that cops can now take information they find from Flock license plate readers and feed it into Nova to ask, for instance, if a car owner has a criminal history or any mental health conditions. For Flock, which raised $275 million earlier this year in a round led by Andreessen Horowitz, expansion also means far higher overheads. The latest update to add surveillance camera functionality could increase costs substantially when it comes to storing the video on its Amazon Web Services servers. “If it's heavily, heavily used, it will be quite expensive for us,” Langley said. “But we feel like if it helps us get to our North Star of solving every single crime that happens in America, then it's a cost worth bearing.”

Title: The FDA Launches Its Generative-AI Tool, Elsa, Ahead Of Schedule

Time Published: 2025-06-04T11:30:34Z

Generative artificial intelligence has found another home in the federal government. On Tuesday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced the early launch of its very own generative AI that it hopes will improve efficiency. The FDA’s toolânicknamed Elsaâis designed to assist employees with everything from scientific reviews to basic operations. Originally, the FDA planned to launch by June 30, so Elsa is well ahead of schedule and under budget, according to an FDA statement. It’s not clear what exact information Elsa was trained on, but the FDA says that it didn’t use any “data submitted by regulated industry” in order to protect sensitive research and information. Currently, Elsa houses its information in GovCloud, an Amazon Web Services product specifically intended for classified information. As a language model, Elsa can help employees with reading, writing, and summarizing. In addition, the FDA said that it can summarize adverse events, generate code for nonclinical applications, and more. Per the agency, Elsa is already being used to “accelerate clinical protocol reviews, shorten the time needed for scientific evaluations, and identify high-priority inspection targets.” In a May press release announcing the completion of the FDA’s first AI-assisted scientific review, Makary said he was “blown away” by Elsa’s capabilities, which “[hold] tremendous promise in accelerating the review time for new therapies”. He added, “We need to value our scientists’ time and reduce the amount of non-productive busywork that has historically consumed much of the review process.” According to one scientist, Jinzhong Liu, the FDA’s generative AI completed tasks in minutes that would otherwise take several days. In Tuesday’s announcement, FDA Chief AI Officer Jeremy Walsh said, “Today marks the dawn of the AI era at the FDA with the release of Elsa, AI is no longer a distant promise but a dynamic force enhancing and optimizing the performance and potential of every employee.” Generative AI can certainly be a useful tool, but every tool has its drawbacks. With AI specifically, there has been an uptick in stories about Â hallucinations which are outright false or misleading claims and statements. Although commonly associated with chatbots like ChatGPT, hallucinations can still pop up in federal AI models, where they can unleash even more chaos. Per IT Veterans, AI hallucinations typically stem from factors like biases in training data or a lack of fact-checking safeguards built into the model itself. Even with those in place, though, IT Veterans cautions that human oversight is “essential to mitigate the risks and ensure the reliability of AI-integrated federal data streams”. Ideally, the FDA has thoroughly considered and taken measures to prevent any mishaps with Elsa’s use. But the expansion of technology that really needs human oversight is always concerning when federal agencies are amidst mass layoffs. At the beginning of April, the FDA laid off 3,500 employees, including scientists and inspection staff (although some layoffs were later reversed). Time will reveal how Elsa ultimately performs. But eventually, the FDA plans to expand its use throughout the agency as it matures. This includes data processing and generative-AI functions to “further support the FDA’s mission.” Artificial intelligenceFDA Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Title: More or less

There are three viable strategies in the interplay between value and price: You see this pattern across all industries, in both consumer and business markets. More for more Cardigan by Miu Miu for â¬2,150 In clothing, for example, a cashmere sweater embodies More for moreâexpensive, but deliciously soft (enjoyment) and warm (functional). A high-end brand has a function beyond high-quality materials: Status is bestowed upon the owner, due to it being overpriced beyond its quality. Buyers are not budget-constrained, which enables high prices and correspondingly high profit margins, but customers also have their pick of options, where every other product on the planet is a competitor. The customer is in control. Hence the importance of being âthe bestâ according to some subset of the market. More for less Sweater by L.L. Bean for â¬92 More for less describes the practical decision-making that governs most purchases: Highly functional articles that will last for years, at one-fifth or even one-tenth the price of the same luxury item. Most people have a budget and therefore are seeking âThe best that I can afford.â Thus price is the primary constraint, inside which they prioritize features according to personal preference; they canât have everything, but they can prioritize everything. The productâs goal is not to be the best along every dimension, but rather to offer a set of trade-offs that enough customers prefer over other sets. Less for Less Hoodie by Tamu for â¬7 Fast-fashion vendors provide Less for less, where youâll find the article disintegrated in the washing machine by the end of the season, but hey, it was cheaper than lunch. Consumers arenât choosing between trade-offs, but rather between having a sweater, or having no sweater at all. All negatives are accepted, as there is no alternative. The vendor enjoys a massive market, but rock-bottom prices mandate extreme cost-efficiency, requiring almost non-existent marketing and sales costs, and even in the best case yields barely any profit even at scale. A competitor with a better cost structure can decimate the business. Donât worry about it. All three approaches are valid and, like all strategies, each drags along a set of consequences, some of which you despise, others you love. You must pick one approach, and accept its batch of consequences. If you donât incorporate those consequences into the rest of your strategy, youâll have a confusing market message, a Frankenstein product, and the wrong pricing model. Building âthe bestâ is wonderful for both profit and enjoyment of life. It feels good to have pride in your craft, to have customers who love what you do and agree with your superlative self-assessment. âThe bestâ commands a high price, which makes profit easier, even while self-funding further investment. This is a beautiful place to be, but it comes with consequences. âThe bestâ is not the average of a subset of things that already exist. The best is an outlier. The best is special. The best is different. Your ideas need to be substantially different from whatâs already available, or itâs definitionally not true that youâre the best. So, the first question is: The best at what? It could be anything, but it has to be specific, and customers have to agree itâs worth the higher price tag. It could be the best designâthe simplest, the most pleasant to use, the most beautiful. It could be qualityâthe peace of mind and enjoyment of a product always âjust worksâ. It could be a superior workflow, could be that it integrates with all the tools the customer uses, it could be personal tech support, and more. This article on âWillingness to payâ lists more ways of being âthe bestâ. Coupled with âbest at whatâ is âbest for whom?â There are billions of people on the planet who absolutely do not agree what âbestâ means in clothes, software, food, or articles about pricing strategy. This is where founders get fouled up; they think that just because they love it, and they âbuilt it for myselfâ and therefore âI am the customer,â and therefore other people will also to pay to solve that problem, in that way. They rarely do. The fallacies with that assumption (and some truths), are detailed here. Instead, use your initial spark of insight as the starting point, your motivation, knowing that half of it is indeed correct but half isnât, and so you go find potential customers to interview, and use a structured process to fix your hypotheses to morph your definition of âbestâ into alignment with what some specific ideal customer. Customers in this category care about something even more than they care about price. What kinds of things are like that? In business, an example is so-called âmission-criticalâ things, i.e. a failure or low quality causes outsized damage in internal cost, or far worse, damage to their reputation, in the worst case causing customers to leave.1 Something that is an urgent, top priority for them right now, whether due to emergency or strategic mandate.2 In the consumer world, it could be what Google calls a âtoothbrush productââsomething vital that is used at least twice a day, or ideally all day,3 or tied to personal identity.4 1 Our company WP Engine is an example, because we run websites like eCommerce (all of the customersâ revenue) or media (merely being slow means they lose traffic, which means they lose ad revenue) or corporate home pages (downtime costs lost leads and lower reputation). This can also be CYA, i.e. âno one ever got fired for buying ______â. 2 See this article for many examples of how this arises, and how to define your target customer and product to match. 3 Examples: to-do apps for busy people, email for people who spend more than an hour per day there, calendar apps for people whose calendars look like they only barely lost a game of Tetris, note-taking apps for people with 1000s of notes 4 Like luxury brands, where being âfar too expensiveâ is the point, like a ram with ridiculous horns. Being âthe bestâ isnât just about the product or the customer-fit; all other decisions must also be aligned with that positioning. Your marketing will focus on excellence and exclusivity rather than affordability. Your team will likely be smaller with higher-caliber individualsâpassionate artisans who take pride in creating excellence and celebrate perfectionism. When hiring, youâll focus on finding the top 1% of talent, often paying premium salaries. Your customer support isnât measured in hours but minutes, often with white-glove, personalized service and dedicated account representatives. Your product development cycles may be slower, emphasizing perfection before launch, developing features without cutting corners regardless of cost. Because the number of customers in the market is small and limited, market-share matters, and upgrading existing customers is vital for growth at scale.5 5 Many public enterprise software companies get the majority of their revenue growth from up-selling existing customers, rather than adding new ones. Fortunately, the high price tag means you can invest in these things. And if you pull it off, itâs the best for yourself because youâre fulfilled when youâre exercising your best qualities and youâre validated when others agree on Twitter and say it to your face. You can recruit great employees, because who doesnât want to work at a company whose customers actually love them? Most products are not âthe bestâ. But for those who can deliver it, it creates a virtuous cycle of excellence, satisfaction, and profitability thatâs hard to beat. Efficiency is beautiful. âMore for lessâ means receiving outsized value for a given cost. It is the right value proposition for most things in life, especially in business where you need to get a job done as cheaply as possible, but not cheaper. The global apparel industry exemplifies the claim that this is the most popular category. The âmore for lessâ category generates $1,200B of the industryâs total $1,600B annual revenue, with luxury at $250B and fast-fashion at $150B. With profit margins of 5%-15%,6 they are unsurprisingly more profitable than fast-fashion (under 5%)7 and less than luxury (20%-30%).8 âMore for lessâ software companies can have much better profit margins than apparel; coupled with reasonable prices and addressing the largest market segment, this is a great business model. 6 L.L. Bean, makers of the sweater above, is private and doesnât report profit, so this range is based on their 10% annual spend on bonuses and give-back activity and data from other retailers. 7 The outlier-most-profitable fast-fashion brand stands at 9%, but almost all are under 5%. 8 For example Prada, which makes the Miu Miu sweater above, generates 23% net profit. Which types of product benefit from high-efficiency, but doesnât require âthe best?â Perhaps almost anything. Back-end systems that operate the company but are invisible to customer are a good start, because no competitive advantage is conveyed to the company for getting âthe best.â Even more ideally, areas where downtime isnât terribly disruptive to their real-time operations; a reporting system can be down for an hour without hurting their business, but a customer support tool cannot. Or an area where itâs OK if not every desired feature is present, again like reporting software where the lack of exactly the right chart-type is not a deal-breaker, and wonât prevent them from seeing the data. Even better when the product just needs to âtick a boxâ to âsay that we have it,â because then requirements wonât be stringent. It might sound negative that your product isnât âcritical to their successâ, but being non-real-time, non-essential, also means you have far more leniency in quality or lack of features. This leniency in requirements is also why you will make 100x more sales than you expect, even though you still target the âperfectâ ideal customer with marketing and product features. For your ideal customer, you are in fact âthe best,â and they cannot believe theyâre getting the âMore for moreâ product for the âMore for lessâ price. That attitude defines them as the ideal customer; if you canât win them over from your home page, youâre not doing your job. But, for every one of those, thereâs a hundred others where youâre the right choice. You have most of what they want, you donât have any deal-breakers, and the price is right, so youâve made the sale. So, you gain the power of specificity, clarity, and emotional connection from talking to your ideal customer, while winning all the âMore for lessâ customers anyway. This article on ICPs explains this dynamic in detail, with examples. Although the main value here is economy, âsave moneyâ is weak positioning. Position by showing how much value youâre generating rather than how much money youâre saving as described in this article on positioning for value. Because, even if this is your pricing strategy, that doesnât mean itâs your marketing material. Your marketing position still needs to be as strong as possible, emphasizing that it really is more for less. As with the other pricing strategies, the rest of your decisions must be aligned. Marketing will make the customer feel like this is the âsmart choice,â neither wasting money on useless branding nor falling prey to the mistake of âIf you think this is expensive, wait until you see how expensive âcheapâ is.â Marketing must make the trade-offs clear, not try to claim itâs the best for everyone, which quietly alienates everyone; comparison charts shouldnât be a solid column of green checkmarks, but rather elucidate where you are strong, and where you are not the right solution. Product features must not be too difficult to maintain, as the price tag doesnât allow for special exceptions or for brittle integrations that only 5% of the customers use. Rather, build only those features used by at least 50% of customers, or where at least 15% of customers buy you specifically for that reason. Hire team members who excel at identifying and eliminating waste without sacrificing core value. Your whole business must reflect the âMore for lessâ mentality; your internal costs and decisions match your external promises. Pundits have long eschewed the âMore for lessâ strategy as a poor compromise between being either âthe bestâ or âthe cheapest.â As Michael Porter famously wrote in Competitive Strategy (1980), there are only three strategies: (a) Differentiated Best; (b) Low-Cost Leader; (c) Niche Leader. Later thinkers pointed out that (a) and (c) are the same, differing only in market-scope. This leaves the Porter model with what I am calling âMore for moreâ and âLess for less.â However, the customers have spoken, and in most consumer and business industries, it is in fact the âMore for lessâ category that wins most of the customers and most of the revenue and most of the profits. We must not fall prey to the incorrect attitude that this is âa balanceâ between value and cost; we should instead recognize that âMore for lessâ is a third, independent strategy, and leverage its strengths to the fullest. They say ânever compete on priceâ, but as the linked article demonstrates, that statement is incorrect. There are many wildly successful companies, from solo bootstrappers to some of the largest and most-profitable companies in the world,9 who became successful due to absolute rock-bottom prices, even though those products come with severe trade-offs that many consumers would not accept. Sometimes, âcheapestâ is âbestâ. It may seem like âless for lessâ couldnât be a good strategy, because neither employees nor consumers ought to be happy with âless,â and low prices means low revenue, which in turns means little money for marketing, sales, development, support, product, design, or fun company-culture stuff around the office.10 All that is true, and are among the consequences we accept when we adopt this strategy, but the hundreds of billions of dollars of profit (to say nothing of revenue) generated by the many âless for lessâ successes prove that these trade-offs are sometimes the right ones. 9 Examples: Amazon, Walmart, Vanguard, Costco, Dollar General, IKEA, Southwest Airlines, H&M, Zara, Xiaomi, ALDI 10 Or whatever virtual-office-substitute weâre pretending has the same effect as human beings being beings together. When something is surprisingly cheap, customers are not surprised that they have to compromise on most dimensions, such as quality, design, convenience, features, service, appearance, or longevity. Sure, itâs missing some obvious features. Sure, it doesnât integrate with Enterprise systems. Sure, customer service is going to be a set of knowledge-based articles. Sure, it sometimes crashes. What did you expect for $5 per month? There are billions of people who will buy $5 clothes that barely survive the season. If I pay $2/month for web hosting and I get email and a website, itâs okay if the email gets some spam and the website is not always fast or even always working. And I donât expect the clothing retailer to have customer service or accept returns, and I donât expect tech support from that web host to know anything beyond helping me reset my password. The fundamental reason a customer will accept a wide range of trade-offs is that the alternative is to not have the product at all. That is, the choice is between having any hoodie versus having no hoodie. The product is âbinaryâ in this senseâhaving versus not-havingâthanks to an accessible price tag. One does not quibble over âfeaturesâ or âqualityâ or âserviceâ when the alternative is ânothingâ. This is at once empoweringâsupplying goods to people who otherwise had no accessâand depressingâthat so many people cannot afford the comforts invented through modern ingenuity. And so we generate the worst versions of those items for most of the world to âenjoy.â Which viewpoint is correct? The answer can often be found in the mission and purpose behind the companyâthe real one, not the one written by the marketing department on the âAbout Usâ pageâwhere the fundamental driver of the company is either one of empowerment and impact, or one that exploits desperation. Regardless, the company should extol the positive aspects in branding and positioning: Emphasizing democratization, participation, simplicity, affordability, and accessibility. The hardest part of executing this strategy is being profitable, since thereâs so little revenue to be profitable with. The costs have to be extraordinarily, unconventionally low. Some of that can come with scale, either directly (e.g. bulk-purchases from suppliers) or structurally (e.g. tech support per customer is lower at 100,000 customers than at 100, simply because most of them donât have a question in any given month). Still, it takes a lot of $2/mo customers before you can afford to hire even a single tech support person. Or if winning a customer means winning $2/mo and maybe $50 across the entire lifetime of that customer, you canât afford to pay very much to acquire that customer, whether thatâs in direct advertising spend, or sharing revenue with an influencer,11 or indirect so-called âorganicâ marketing,12 and you certainly canât have a sales team. You must rely on word-of-mouth and reviews from customers; youâll need to encourage it. 11 Affiliates are paid only after you are paid, which means this is an affordable form of marketing from the start. 12 While harder to get customers at first, when pages arenât ranked in Google and social media accounts arenât followed by anyone, those assets do scale over time. Given that revenue will significantly lag costs, is it mandatory that such a company raise money? The company will certainly consume cash for a while, whether thatâs in the form of someoneâs savings, friends-and-family, a loan, or indeed raising money. Annual billing can help quite a bit. This is why pundits (including me) are always telling bootstrappers to âraise their pricesâ or, since you now know that prices are coupled with every other strategic decision in the company: âswitch from a âless for lessâ strategy to either âmore for lessâ or âmore for more.ââ If you donât want to raise money, donât build a business that burns money on purpose. However, itâs not true that such business need to raise an exorbitant amount of money. In fact, in the same article above, every one of the four case studies (which each grew to multiple-billion dollars in revenue) raised only a small amount of money. Those stories are detailed in the article. When the strategic decisions are fully aligned to a low-cost operation, you only need enough starter cash to get going. This is where VC-funded companies often get it wrong; they assume âwe can work the costs out later,â but when âlaterâ comes, they realize their processes, technology, and culture has solidified around whatever worked for acquiring customers, and change is either impossible or dramatically painful, like layoffs, rewriting the code that works, and trying to force unnatural marketing and sales motions. There are also examples of bootstrapped companies using this strategy who never raised money; they typically have some extreme cost advantage, such as being located in a country with extremely low costs, yet selling to the United States and Europe. Being physically located in a low-cost zone is a competitive advantage that companies in The West cannot match. As usual, what doesnât work is having a low price without the rest of the strategic decisions. This constantly happens with inexperienced founders who think: âMy product sucks, so Iâm not comfortable charging a lot.â Thatâs not a good reason, and you shouldnât just build crappy product. Instead, the question should be: How do I build a simple yet lovable product that some specific ideal customer would pay 10x more than Iâm currently charging, even though it doesnât have a lot of features, and sometimes doesnât even work? Thatâs exactly what I did with WP Engine. While the hardest intrinsic challenge is to be profitable, the hardest external challenge is that a competitor can beat you with lower prices alone. And this is all too easy, because thereâs so many reasons why a competitor might win: The antidote is to constantly increase your cost-efficiency, and possibly proactively lower prices. This is what Amazon did in retail and later did in the cloud.14 13 A particularly ironic example: Microsoft killed Netscape by putting over a thousand developers on Internet Explorer and releasing it for free; more than a decade later, Google killed Explorer by putting over a thousand developers on Chrome and releasing it for free. 14 Amazon knew from their âyour margin is my opportunityâ strategy in retail, they should proactively reduce prices as their cloud operations scaled, to prevent people from looking for alternatives. Later, when Microsoft and Google were established as the only two serious competitors, they all stopped lowering prices simultaneously. Surely a coincidence? âLess for lessâ is brutal, because of relentless competition and having no extra money to work with. But, it means accessing the largest number of potential customers, and in the best case, you are truly enriching the world by bringing goods and services to people who otherwise could not afford to enjoy them. All three pricing strategies are validâeach boasts wildly successful companies of all sizes, in every country. Ideally, one of these strategies jumps out at you as the smartest one, or at least the one youâd be the most excited and proud to implement. Another might jump out as being dumb, or at least too difficult, not worth the consequences, not where you want to spend your precious, irreplaceable time on this Earth. Listen to your gut. Because all are, in fact, smart strategies, you should pick the one that best matches your personal strengths and proclivities, because thatâs the one you will execute the best while being most fulfilled. This is another choice that increases your chance of success. The only wrong choice is to not choose at all, and thus be confusing to customers and misaligned with the rest of your strategy. Then you will make internally-inconsistent choices, working against yourself, and your customers wonât know how to think about your product, which means they wonât be comfortable buying it. And then your product is the right choice for no one. â

The best-paid CEO last year was not running a technology giant or a Wall Street firm — but the company that makes Tasers. Rick Smith, the CEO and cofounder of Axon Enterprise, which makes stun guns used by many police forces, took home almost $165 million last year. Although Smith's annual salary was $31,201, he was awarded stock options worth just over $164 million after meeting a series of targets over several years. He told The Wall Street Journal that the stock award came from a scheme open to all Axon employees that lets them convert salary into stock options, whose value depends on the share price performance. "It creates that startup kind of vibe," said Smith, who has been CEO of Axon since 1993. Axon stock is up more than a fifth over the past month after posting strong first-quarter results. The price has soared more than 700% over the past five years, leaving the company worth almost $60 billion. Smith's compensation exceeded the total for better-known S&P 500 businesses such as Starbucks or Apple, per data compiled by public company intelligence platform MyLogIQ. Second on its list was new Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol, who collected a $5 million bonus and stock awards worth about $90 million. Larry Culp, CEO of GE Aerospace, was third on $89 million, followed by Blackstone boss Steve Schwarzman on $84 million. Apple CEO Tim Cook collected nearly $75 million last year, including a salary of $3 million and a stock award worth $58 million, putting him in fifth place. Other names on MyLogIQ's top 20 include KKR co-CEOs Joe Bae and Scott Nuttall ($73 million and $64 million respectively); Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters (almost $62 million and $60 million); and Salesforce's Marc Benioff on $55 million. A study by Equilar and The Associated Press found that in 2023, the pay of CEOs in the S&P 500 rose by 12.6% year-on-year. Axon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Title: Pension Funds Have Had It With Tesla’s Board And Musk

ByAlan Ohnsman ByAlan Ohnsman, Forbes Staff. When Elon Musk appeared in the White House last week at a ceremony with President Donald Trump marking the end of his controversial role leading the federal job-slashing DOGE initiative, he sported a shiner on his right eye that he claimed came from toddler son X. That literal black eye will heal, but the figurative ones Tesla and Musk’s reputation have received from his political activities are likely to linger. Some of Tesla’s biggest shareholders — including unions like the American Federation of Teachers, whose 1.8 million members participate in pension funds with $4 trillion of assets under management, including $8.8 billion of Tesla shares — see one group as largely to blame: the EV company’s board. “People don't like Elon Musk,” AFT President Randi Weingarten told Forbes. “We've taken the position over the course of the last few months of: ‘Do your job board. Do your job financial industry. Do the job you're supposed to do, which is the governance of Tesla.’” “Make sure he’s there or get another CEO” Weingarten and the teacher’s union have been pushing fiduciary officers overseeing major state and city pension funds, as well as investment firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, Vanguard, T. Rowe Price and TIAA, to review their Tesla holdings and pressure the board to change its ways. “We don't want Tesla to fail because if Tesla fails that means a lot of retirees are going to lose a lot of money in terms of their portfolios,” Weingarten said. She added: “If you're going to have Musk there, then make sure he's there. Don't have him do these extracurricular activities. Make sure he’s there or get another CEO.” Nine state treasurers and comptrollers sent a letter to Tesla Chair Robyn Denholm in April raising concerns about risks to their economies if the company falters because of poor board governance. “No other publicly traded company CEO would've been allowed to neglect his day-to-day duties like Musk has. No exception,” said Illinois Treasurer Michael Frerichs, who signed the letter. “And if they had undertaken personal activities that hurt the reputation of a company or brand that badly, would they be treated like he has been?” CalPERS, the largest U.S. pension fund representing public workers in California, had no specific comment on Tesla and said its investments are “are index-oriented and optimized using systematic and quantitative investment strategies, not driven by any single period’s events.” However, it sold 4.5 million Tesla shares in the third quarter of 2024. The fund held about 9.4 million Tesla shares as of its last annual filing, a stake worth $3.2 billion as of June 3. Tesla fell 2.9% to $332.05 on Wednesday. The shares are down about 18% this year. Musk for years has divided his time as Tesla chief with leadership roles at SpaceX, X, The Boring Co., Neuralink and xAI, but his Trump administration job proved particularly harmful to the brand, spurring protests at Tesla stores and vandalism of its vehicles and facilities. A poll conducted by Washington-based GBAO last month found that Musk was viewed unfavorably by 55% of the 2,000 Americans it surveyed, while Tesla ranked as the least favored brand among poll participants who have or are considering getting an electric vehicle. Most importantly, 51% of survey respondents said they’d view Tesla more favorably if the world’s wealthiest human were replaced as CEO. “If you look at what’s happened to views toward Musk and the brand among people who are the target, it seems irreversible. His numbers are atrocious.” Musk has now said he’s stepped back from his DOGE duties and Tesla stock has rallied in the past few weeks, jumping more than 50% since April 21, as many investors appear hopeful he’ll be more engaged in leading the company, particularly as it prepares to launch a pilot robotaxi program in Austin this month. He’s even shown signs of breaking with Trump, labeling the the president’s so-called Big Beautiful budget bill a “disgusting abomination” on Tuesday because of how much it increases the federal deficit. GBAO GBAO Principal Margie Omero, who oversaw the Musk-Tesla survey, isn’t sure the billionaire’s latest moves will make a difference. “He may say he's stepping away but his involvement with Trump, both in helping to elect him and in helping enact Trump's wishes in government, all those things are not going to change. They’re not over,” she said. Pollster GBAO focuses mainly on progressive issues and notes that Tesla’s core customer base and EV buyers generally tend to identify as Democrats. “If you look at what’s happened to views toward Musk and the brand among people who are the target, it seems irreversible. His numbers are atrocious.” “Tesla's brand has suffered dramatically alongside Elon Musk's brand–in some ways they’re one and the same,” said Maryland Comptroller Brooke Lierman, also a signatory to the April letter to board chair Denholm. Maryland’s State Retirement Agency currently has about $175 million invested in Tesla through pooled accounts. “As somebody who keeps an eye on the returns of our retirement portfolio and our investments, I am always looking to make sure that our retirees and their hard-earned retirement dollars are invested wisely–and with companies governed by boards we can trust and who are engaged in responsible business practices,” Lierman said. GBAO Musk’s behavior and unrestrained comments on social issues have persisted for years, from his false claim in 2018 that he’d lined up funding to take Tesla private. The same year he called a critic “pedo guy” and had to go to court to defend his comments in a defamation trial because of it. During a 2020 earnings call meltdown, he decried emergency public health rules at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic as “fascist.” More recently, he gave what looked like a Nazi-style salute at a Trump victory rally, and in February wildly waved a chainsaw around onstage at a conservative political conference. Recent and detailed reports of his use of drugs including ketamine and Adderall haven’t helped. Denholm didn’t respond to a request for comment. Weingarten, Frerichs and Lierman said they’ve had no response from Tesla’s board from their letters. Weingarten said AFT is weighing potential legal action against Tesla’s board, though hasn’t made a final decision on the matter. Musk “has done huge damage to the Tesla brand and Tesla’s reputation,” she said. “If boards are not going to do their job, outside pension funds, including advocates of them, are going to try to force these boards to do their jobs.”

Title: How Did CrowdStrike Fare In Q1?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CHONGQING, CHINA - JUNE 01: In this photo illustration, the logo of CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. is ... More displayed on a smartphone screen, with the company's latest stock market chart visible in the background, reflecting recent trading activity and investor sentiment, on June 01, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo Illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) saw its stock fall about 7% in extended trading on Tuesday, June 3, despite reporting better-than-expected Q1 earnings. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.73 on sales of $1.10 billion, surpassing consensus estimates of $0.65 earnings per share on the same sales figure. CrowdStrike’s positive Q1 performance was overshadowed by a weaker-than-expected outlook for the current quarter. CrowdStrike anticipates Q2 earnings of $0.82 per share on revenue of around $1.14 billion. This forecast fell short of street expectations, which projected $0.81 in earnings per share but $1.16 billion in revenue. Additionally, while Q1 revenue increased nearly 20%, the company’s adjusted operating margin plunged 500 basis points year-over-year to 18%, amid increased costs for its professional services business and higher R&D spending. On a more positive note, CrowdStrike raised its full-year earnings guidance, now expecting $3.44 to $3.56 in adjusted earnings per share, which is above the consensus of $3.43. However, it maintained its sales outlook of $4.74 billion to $4.81 billion, aligning with the consensus of $4.77 billion. The company also announced a $1 billion share buyback program. Given the upbeat Q1 results, raised full-year earnings guidance, and the share buyback program, the stock’s decline might seem puzzling. However, investors appear to be reacting to more than just the minor Q2 revenue forecast miss. CrowdStrike’s stock has surged a remarkable 40% this year, significantly outperforming the broader S&P 500 index's 2% rise. Trading at lofty valuations, even a slight miss on the revenue forecast was enough to unsettle investors. Now, the critical question is if CRWD stock is a buy at levels of $460. We answer this question here – Is CRWD Stock Overvalued At $460? – based on a comparison of CRWD’s current valuation with its recent operating performance and current and historical financial condition. Remember, there always remains a meaningful risk when investing in a single stock or even a handful of stocks. Consider the 30-stock Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

(Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Yes, we think so. Trading at a whopping 122 times its adjusted trailing earnings, CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), a security software company, looks expensive. Sure, the company’s growth has remained impressive lately. But the important question is whether this valuation is justified. And we don’t think it is. Our conclusion is based on a comparison of CRWD’s current valuation with its recent operating performance and current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of CrowdStrike, across key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience, reveals a very strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below. Now, to reduce stock specific risk, consider taking a look at the Trefis High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. Also, see – How Did CrowdStrike Fare In Q1? CrowdStrike’s valuation appears significantly higher than the broader market, with its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio standing at 28.1 - well above the S&P 500’s 3.2. Our dashboard on CrowdStrike’s valuation ratios has more details. This high valuation comes despite the company demonstrating extremely strong top-line growth in recent years. Over the last three years, CrowdStrike’s revenue has expanded at an average rate of 40%, far exceeding the S&P 500’s 6.3%. Also, revenues grew 20% to $1.1 billion in the most recent quarter, outperforming the S&P 500’s growth rate. Regarding profitability, CrowdStrike’s reported operating income over the last twelve months was -$252 million, resulting in a negative operating margin of -6.1%, which is worse than most companies. However, on an adjusted basis, its operating margin was a healthy 20.3% for the same period. Adjusted operating income excludes stock-based compensation and certain one-time items such as acquisition-related expenses and other non-recurring costs. The company also shows strong cash generation, with an operating cash flow of $1.4 billion, leading to a high operating cash flow-to-sales ratio of 33.4%, significantly better than the S&P 500's 15.7%. CrowdStrike’s financial stability is very strong. With a debt of $785 million against a market capitalization of $122 billion, its debt-to-equity ratio is a very low 0.6%, indicating minimal reliance on debt compared to the S&P 500’s 19.0%. Furthermore, cash and cash equivalents of $4.6 billion make up 53% of its total assets, highlighting a robust cash-to-assets ratio compared to the S&P 500's 14.8%. Despite its strong growth and financial health, CRWD stock has shown weakness during market downturns. During the 2022 Inflation Shock, the stock fell 58.3%, a steeper decline than the S&P 500’s 25.4%. Similarly, during the 2020 Covid pandemic, it dropped 50.0% compared to the S&P 500’s 33.9%. While the stock fully recovered to its pre-crisis peaks in both instances, its greater volatility suggests weaker resilience during market crashes. In summary, CrowdStrike shows strong performance across key financial metrics, and its profitability is good on an adjusted basis. We believe this positive performance is already reflected in the current stock price of $460, given its very high valuation. The stock trades at 28 times its trailing revenues and a significant 122 times its trailing adjusted earnings of $3.73 per share, which is much higher than its three-year average price-to-earnings ratio of about 80x. Furthermore, there’s a risk of a broader market downturn, which historically has impacted CrowdStrike’s stock more severely than the general market. Also, the growth is slowing. The consensus estimates project average sales growth of 21% over the next couple of years, compared to 40% average growth seen in the last three years. Considering these factors, we do not think now is a good time to buy CRWD stock. Investors would likely benefit from waiting for a further price dip. Surely, we could be wrong. There’s a chance investors might continue to value CRWD highly if sales grow faster than expected. But, the risk at the current valuation appears high. In fact, the risk assessment framework is something we focus on while constructing the 30-stock Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: What's Happening With JPMorgan Stock?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. MANHATTAN, NEW YORK, UNITED STATES - 2025/05/15: Sign at the entrance to the JP Morgan Wealth ... More Management building in Midtown Manhattan. (Photo by Erik McGregor/LightRocket via Getty Images) JPMorgan stock (NYSE: JPM) has seen an increase of approximately 11% year-to-date, in comparison to the 1% rise in the S&P 500 index during the same timeframe. In contrast, JPMorgan's competitor Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) has risen by 6% over the same duration. So, what has contributed to the strong performance of JPMorgan stock? The banking giant exceeded Wall Street expectations in the first quarter of FY 2025. Revenue for the quarter climbed 8% to $46.01 billion, driven by stronger asset management and investment banking fees, along with solid trading outcomes. Trading revenue was especially remarkable, increasing 48% to $3.8 billion. Net income rose by 9% to $14.6 billion, or $5.07 a share. The bank's asset management division has also performed well because of heightened asset prices. Assets under management jumped 15% year-over-year to $4.1 trillion. Furthermore, if you're looking for upside with a steadier experience than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and achieved >91% returns since its inception. That being said, the bank has adopted a cautious stance regarding its outlook due to geopolitical factors, the U.S. imposition of tariffs on trading partners, and worries about inflation. These inflation concerns have led to an increase in treasury yields, with the 10-year yield standing at over 4.40%, up from 4.01% in early April, while the yield on the 30-year bond is just beneath 5%. This situation could have a mixed impact on JPMorgan. Increased rates and market volatility might negatively affect the investment banking sector, as they typically cause delays in IPO listings, mergers, and acquisition activities. However, from a lending perspective, higher yields expand the margin between what banks earn on loans and what they pay on deposits, which generally enhances net interest income and profitability, although there could be some effect on credit quality. Additionally, market volatility could partially be mitigated by the company’s strength in its trading operations. Currently, JPM stock is trading at approximately $265 per share, or about 2.6 times its tangible book value. Although this makes the bank appear expensive relative to its peers, this could be partially justified by its strong capital position, superior credit quality, and proactive risk management strategies, which may enable it to perform better in the current environment. JPM has also been intensifying its capital returns program. Over the last quarter, the bank repurchased $7 billion in common stock and announced a 12% increase in the common dividend. We estimate the value of JPM stock at around $240 per share, slightly beneath the current market price.

UAE Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan discusses the significance of President Donald Trump’s visit, trade deals and more on ‘Special Report.’ President Donald Trump’s recent visit to the UAE marked a pivotal moment for UAE-U.S. bilateral relations, shining a spotlight on a shared vision for the future. As the UAE and the "New Gulf" pivot from oil to cutting-edge technologies, our partnership with the U.S., rooted in decades of trust, has become a beacon of what’s possible when nations collaborate. This trust has paved the way for a bold new chapter: a strategic economic alliance poised to create tens of thousands of high-tech, energy and manufacturing jobs, driving prosperity in both of our countries. At the heart of this collaboration lies the new U.S.-UAE AI Acceleration Partnership. This initiative will advance cooperation in artificial intelligence and other transformative technologies while spurring investment flows between our nations. TRUMP REVERSES COURSE ON MIDDLE EAST TECH POLICY, BUT WILL IT BE ENOUGH TO COUNTER CHINA? A cornerstone of this effort is the establishment of a 10-square mile state-of-the-art AI campus in Abu Dhabi, the largest outside the U.S.. With five gigawatts of AI data center capacity, it will act as a vital hub for U.S. hyperscalers or large cloud service providers and large enterprises, serving partners and friends across the region and in the global south. President Donald Trump and UAE President Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan talk on Thursday, May 15. (AP/Alex Brandon) To support this vision, the UAE and U.S. governments have agreed on a pathway for the UAE to acquire advanced American AI semiconductors. A handful of U.S. voices have begun to raise concerns about the security of this technology. The fact is that we understand these concerns and fully agree that access to sensitive technologies comes with great responsibility. SILICON, STEEL AND MEGAWATTS: CAN AMERICA CREATE THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO WIN THE AI RACE? Importantly, this new partnership sets a global benchmark for securing advanced U.S. technology. Through the implementation of a "Regulated Technology Environment," approved UAE organizations acquiring regulated US technologies will adhere to extensive physical and cybersecurity protocols. These involve regular audits, third-party validations and active oversight by both nations’ governments. The direct involvement of leading U.S. companies further ensures that advanced AI chips and technologies are fully protected from diversion or unauthorized access. This is nothing new. These measures underscore our commitment to a long-term, trusted technology partnership with the U.S. that builds on decades of collaboration.

Title: The hidden time bomb in the tax code that's fueling mass tech layoffs
URL: https://qz.com/tech-layoffs-tax-code-trump-section-174-microsoft-meta-1851783502
Time Published: 2025-06-04T09:00:00Z
Full Content:
For the past two years, it’s been a ghost in the machine of American tech. Between 2022 and today, a little-noticed tweak to the U.S. tax code has quietly rewired the financial logic of how American companies invest in research and development. Outside of CFO and accounting circles, almost no one knew it existed. “I work on these tax write-offs and still hadn’t heard about this,” a chief operating officer at a private-equity-backed tech company told Quartz. “It’s just been so weirdly silent.” Still, the delayed change to a decades-old tax provision — buried deep in the 2017 tax law — has contributed to the loss of hundreds of thousands of high-paying, white-collar jobs. That’s the picture that emerges from a review of corporate filings, public financial data, analysis of timelines, and interviews with industry insiders. One accountant, working in-house at a tech company, described it as a “niche issue with broad impact,” echoing sentiments from venture capital investors also interviewed for this article. Some spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive political matters. Since the start of 2023, more than half-a-million tech workers have been laid off, according to industry tallies. Headlines have blamed over-hiring during the pandemic and, more recently, AI. But beneath the surface was a hidden accelerant: a change to what’s known as Section 174 that helped gut in-house software and product development teams everywhere from tech giants such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) to much smaller, private, direct-to-consumer and other internet-first companies. Now, as a bipartisan effort to repeal the Section 174 change moves through Congress, bigger questions are surfacing: How did a single line in the tax code help trigger a tsunami of mass layoffs? And why did no one see it coming? For almost 70 years, American companies could deduct 100% of qualified research and development spending in the year they incurred the costs. Salaries, software, contractor payments — if it contributed to creating or improving a product, it came off the top of a firm’s taxable income. The deduction was guaranteed by Section 174 of the IRS Code of 1954, and under the provision, R&D flourished in the U.S. Microsoft was founded in 1975. Apple (AAPL) launched its first computer in 1976. Google (GOOGL) incorporated in 1998. Facebook opened to the general public in 2006. All these companies, now among the most valuable in the world, developed their earliest products — programming tools, hardware, search engines — under a tax system that rewarded building now, not later. The subsequent rise of smartphones, cloud computing, and mobile apps also happened in an America where companies could immediately write off their investments in engineering, infrastructure, and experimentation. It was a baseline assumption — innovation and risk-taking subsidized by the tax code — that shaped how founders operated and how investors made decisions. In turn, tech companies largely built their products in the U.S. Microsoft’s operating systems were coded in Washington state. Apple’s early hardware and software teams were in California. Google’s search engine was born at Stanford and scaled from Mountain View. Facebook’s entire social architecture was developed in Menlo Park. The deduction directly incentivized keeping R&D close to home, rewarding companies for investing in American workers, engineers, and infrastructure. That’s what makes the politics of Section 174 so revealing. For all the rhetoric about bringing jobs back and making things in America, the first Trump administration’s major tax bill arguably helped accomplish the opposite. When Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), the signature legislative achievement of President Donald Trump’s first term, it slashed the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% — a massive revenue loss on paper for the federal government. To make the 2017 bill comply with Senate budget rules, lawmakers needed to offset the cost. So they added future tax hikes that wouldn’t kick in right away, wouldn’t provoke immediate backlash from businesses, and could, in theory, be quietly repealed later. The delayed change to Section 174 — from immediate expensing of R&D to mandatory amortization, meaning that companies must spread the deduction out in smaller chunks over five or even 15-year periods — was that kind of provision. It didn’t start affecting the budget until 2022, but it helped the TCJA appear “deficit neutral” over the 10-year window used for legislative scoring. The delay wasn’t a technical necessity. It was a political tactic. Such moves are common in tax legislation. Phase-ins and delayed provisions let lawmakers game how the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) — Congress’ nonpartisan analyst of how bills impact budgets and deficits — scores legislation, pushing costs or revenue losses outside official forecasting windows. And so, on schedule in 2022, the change to Section 174 went into effect. Companies filed their 2022 tax returns under the new rules in early 2023. And suddenly, R&D wasn’t a full, immediate write-off anymore. The tax benefits of salaries for engineers, product and project managers, data scientists, and even some user experience and marketing staff — all of which had previously reduced taxable income in year one — now had to be spread out over five- or 15-year periods. To understand the impact, imagine a personal tax code change that allowed you to deduct 100% of your biggest source of expenses, and that becoming a 20% deduction. For cash-strapped companies, especially those not yet profitable, the result was a painful tax bill just as venture funding dried up and interest rates soared. It’s no coincidence that Meta announced its “Year of Efficiency” immediately after the Section 174 change took effect. Ditto Microsoft laying off 10,000 employees in January 2023 despite strong earnings, or Google parent Alphabet cutting 12,000 jobs around the same time. Amazon (AMZN) also laid off almost 30,000 people, with cuts focused not just on logistics but on Alexa and internal cloud tools — precisely the kinds of projects that would have once qualified as immediately deductible R&D. Salesforce (CRM) eliminated 10% of its staff, or 8,000 people, including entire product teams. In public, companies blamed bloat and AI. But inside boardrooms, spreadsheets were telling a quieter story. And MD&A notes — management’s notes on the numbers — buried deep in 10-K filings recorded the change, too. R&D had become more expensive to carry. Headcount, the leading R&D expense across the tech industry, was the easiest thing to cut. In its 2023 annual report, Meta described salaries as its single biggest R&D expense. Between the first and second years that the Section 174 change began affecting tax returns, Meta cut its total workforce by almost 25%. Over the same period, Microsoft reduced its global headcount by about 7%, with cuts concentrated in product-facing, engineering-heavy roles. Smaller companies without the fortress-like balance sheets of Big Tech have arguably been hit even harder. Twilio (TWLO) slashed 22% of its workforce in 2023 alone. Shopify (SHOP) (headquartered in Canada but with much of its R&D teams in the U.S.) cut almost 30% of staff in 2022 and 2023. Coinbase (COIN) reduced headcount by 36% across a pair of brutal restructuring waves. Since going into effect, the provision has hit at the very heart of America’s economic growth engine: the tech sector. By market cap, tech giants dominate the S&P 500, with the “Magnificent 7” alone accounting for more than a third of the index’s total value. Workforce numbers tell a similar story, with tech employing millions of Americans directly and supporting the employment of tens of millions more. As measured by GDP, capital-T tech contributes about 10% of national output. It’s not just that tech layoffs were large, it’s that they were massively disproportionate. Across the broader U.S. economy, job cuts hovered around in low single digits across most sectors. But in tech, entire divisions vanished, with a whopping 60% jump in layoffs between 2022 and 2023. Some cuts reflected real inefficiencies — a response to over-hiring during the zero-interest rate boom. At the same time, many of the roles eliminated were in R&D, product, and engineering, precisely the kind of functions that had once benefitted from generous tax treatment under Section 174. Throughout the 2010s, a broad swath of startups, direct-to-consumer brands, and internet-first firms — basically every company you recognize from Instagram or Facebook ads — built their growth models around a kind of engineered break-even. The tax code allowed them to spend aggressively on product and engineering, then write it all off as R&D, keeping their taxable income close to zero by design. It worked because taxable income and actual cash flow were often not quite the same thing under what’s known as GAAP accounting practices. Basically, as long as spending counted as R&D, companies could report losses to investors while owing almost nothing to the IRS. But the Section 174 change broke that model. Once those same expenses had to be spread out, or amortized, over multiple years, the tax shield vanished. Companies that were still burning cash suddenly looked profitable on paper, triggering real tax bills on imaginary gains. The logic that once fueled a generation of digital-first growth collapsed overnight. So it wasn’t just tech experiencing effects. From 1954 until 2022, the U.S. tax code had encouraged businesses of all stripes to behave like tech companies. From retail to logistics, healthcare to media, if firms built internal tools, customized a software stack, or invested in business intelligence and data-driven product development, they could expense those costs. The write-off incentivized in-house builds and fast growth well outside the capital-T tech sector. This lines up with OECD research showing that immediate deductions foster innovation more than spread-out ones. And American companies ran with that logic. According to government data, U.S. businesses reported about $500 billion in R&D expenditures in 2019 alone, and almost half of that came from industries outside traditional tech. The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that this sector, the broader digital economy, accounts for another 10% of GDP. Add that to core tech’s contribution, and the Section 174 shift has likely touched at least 20% of the U.S. economy. The result? A tax policy aimed at raising short-term revenue effectively hid a time bomb inside the growth engines of thousands of companies. And when it detonated, it kneecapped the incentive for hiring American engineers or investing in American-made tech and digital products. It made building tech companies in America look irrational on a spreadsheet. A bipartisan group of lawmakers is pushing to repeal the Section 174 change, with business groups, CFOs, crypto executives, and venture capitalists lobbying hard for retroactive relief. But the politics are messy. Fixing 174 would mean handing a tax break to the same companies many voters in both parties see as symbols of corporate excess. Any repeal would also come too late for the hundreds of thousands of workers already laid off. And of course, the losses don’t stop at Meta’s or Google’s campus gates. They ripple out. When high-paid tech workers disappear, so do the lunch orders. The house tours. The contract gigs. The spending habits that sustain entire urban economies and thousands of other jobs. Sandwich artists. Rideshare drivers. Realtors. Personal trainers. House cleaners. In tech-heavy cities, the fallout runs deep — and it’s still unfolding. Washington is now poised to pass a second Trump tax bill — one packed with more obscure provisions, more delayed impacts, more quiet redistribution. And it comes as analysts are only just beginning to understand the real-world effects of the last round. The Section 174 change “significantly increased the tax burden on companies investing in innovation, potentially stifling economic growth and reducing the United States’ competitiveness on the global stage,” according to the tax consulting firm KBKG. Whether the U.S. will reverse course — or simply adapt to a new normal — remains to be seen. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Best crypto to buy as Truth Social files for a Spot Bitcoin ETF

In a surprising move that sent ripples through the crypto market, Donald Trump’s social media platform, Truth Social, has officially filed to launch a Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). The filing, submitted through the parent company Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), marks a notable pivot into digital assets, suggesting growing institutional interest in Bitcoin. The development has sparked renewed enthusiasm among retail investors and crypto enthusiasts alike, with meme coins like Bitcoin Pepe also riding the wave of attention and experiencing a surge in investor interest. According to documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), TMTG aims to capitalize on Bitcoin’s growing legitimacy and investor demand by offering a Spot Bitcoin ETF. Unlike futures-based ETFs, which track Bitcoin contracts, a spot ETF would directly hold Bitcoin, allowing investors exposure to real BTC prices without needing to manage a digital wallet. The move places Truth Social in the company of major asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity, who launched similar products earlier this year. However, TMTG’s entrance into the ETF space is particularly notable given its political backing and its predominantly conservative user base, potentially opening up Bitcoin exposure to a new demographic of retail investors. The filing is already leading to increased speculation in altcoins, especially high-potential meme coins such as Bitcoin Pepe, as traders look for ways to ride the momentum. While the ETF filing directly concerns Bitcoin, its ripple effect is being felt across the broader crypto market – especially in the meme coin segment. Historically, meme coins thrive during periods of heightened mainstream attention and speculation. The association of Donald Trump’s brand with a financial product tied to crypto reintroduces an entertainment and political angle that energizes retail participation. As capital flows into Bitcoin via ETFs, retail investors often seek cheaper, higher-upside alternatives – and meme coins like Bitcoin Pepe are prime candidates. The political spectacle, media buzz, and renewed focus on crypto could create the perfect storm for meme coin rallies in the coming months. In the sea of meme coins that have flooded the crypto market this year, Bitcoin Pepe is a standout since it has raised more than $13 million during the presale, indicating strong interest in its utter commitment to instant transactions and ultra-low fees. Plus, Bitcoin Pepe is now only 13 days away from a CEX listing that typically leads to a new wave of demand, which often results in significant price increase. With Bitcoin’s visibility rising due to Truth Social’s ETF ambitions, meme coins tied to Bitcoin’s branding – like Bitcoin Pepe – are also gaining traction. As a hybrid of two cultural forces in crypto (Bitcoin and the iconic Pepe meme), Bitcoin Pepe offers strong viral potential, particularly among Gen Z and meme-savvy traders.

More Info Texas has removed BlackRock from its list of oil and gas investment boycotters after the asset manager shrank its ESG footprint, ending a three-year quiet confrontation that saw Texas state investment vehicles pull billions out of BlackRock. “I am pleased to announce a significant decline in the number of investment funds that boycott the oil and gas industry, as well as the removal of BlackRock Inc. from the Comptroller's office list of companies that boycott energy companies,” Texas State Comptroller Glenn Hegar said in a statement. “Directly related to our listing process, BlackRock has stepped back from full participation in the Climate Action 100+ and completely exited the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative. It has dramatically reduced the number of fund offerings that prohibit investment in oil and gas, and it shifted away from blanket policies that ignore the critical need for fossil fuel-based energy generation now and long into the future,” Hager also said. The saga began back in 2022, when Texas passed legislation forbidding state agencies from investing in any of a number of companies that, the state’s government said, boycotted the oil and gas industry. The black list of such companies included many Wall Street heavyweights eager to get a piece of the energy transition business. BlacRock was among the most prominent entities featured on the list. The asset manager protested its inclusion in the list, saying it has investments in the oil and gas industry and no plans to quit these. The firm noted $120 billion in investments in Texas public energy companies, out of a total of $320 billion in energy investments globally. Nevertheless, the Texas Permanent School Fund withdrew some $8.5 billion in investments from the fund manager last year. BlackRock, by the way, is not the only one quitting various net-zero alliances, at least in part as a result of the pressure campaign of conservative U.S. state governments against the anti-oil and gas shift, but also in response to constantly tightening reporting and emission-tracking requirements originating within these alliances.

Title: Bitcoin Moves With Gold And M2 Money Supply – Next Rally Loading?

Bitcoin (BTC) is increasingly mirroring gold’s historic price performance and the trajectory of the global M2 money supply, prompting crypto analysts to forecast a potential major rally for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. In an X post shared earlier today, crypto analyst Jelle shared the following chart that reveals a recurring pattern – gold tends to lead Bitcoin, which subsequently “catches up” in price action. This relationship underscores the growing perception of BTC as digital gold. Historically, Bitcoin’s price movements have aligned with those of gold, driven by similar macroeconomic dynamics such as inflation, expansive monetary policy, and investor demand for scarce assets. As gold continues to rally amid rising global liquidity and geopolitical tensions, Bitcoin appears to be following suit. Bitcoin’s reputation as a store of value is also gaining traction among institutions. Robert Mitchnick, Head of Digital Assets at BlackRock, recently described BTC as a “superior alternative” to gold – a strong endorsement from the world’s largest asset manager. Meanwhile, another analyst, CryptoGoos, drew attention to BTC’s tendency to follow shifts in the global M2 money supply. He noted that Bitcoin often lags behind increases in M2 by roughly two months, suggesting that the cryptocurrency may soon witness another rally. For the uninitiated, the global M2 money supply refers to the total amount of money circulating in the economy, including cash, checking deposits, and other similar monetary instruments. An increase in M2 often signals monetary expansion, which can lead to inflation and push investors toward assets like gold and Bitcoin as hedges. From a technical perspective, BTC is also showing bullish signs. In an X post today, seasoned analyst Titan of Crypto pointed out that Bitcoin has formed a golden cross on the four-hour chart. This occurs when a short-term moving average (MA), typically the 50-day MA, crosses above a long-term average, such as the 200-day MA. The golden cross is widely regarded as a bullish indicator and may signal further upside. Various metrics suggest that the BTC rally is far from over yet. For instance, Titan of Crypto recently stated that BTC is following the Golden Ratio Multiplier, targeting $130,000. Similarly, crypto enthusiast KillaXBT predicted a BTC price of $120,000 by mid-June. However, there are some risks to monitor to avoid getting caught up in a price crash. Analysts caution that if Bitcoin falls below the critical support range of $97,000 – $99,000, it could trigger a sharper correction. At press time, BTC trades at $106,610, up 2.2% in the past 24 hours. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Wanted: Independent directors for PSU boards. But where is the approval?

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Mumbai: Over three-fourths of India’s listed public sector enterprises do not have the requisite number of independent directors, as these companies continue to wait for clearance from various government departments. As many as 62 out of 79 listed PSUs lack the mandated number of independent directors, according to data from Prime Database. Despite repeated regulatory reminders, these companies await clearances from their respective ministries, delaying crucial appointments and inviting penalties from stock exchanges. Government-owned firms, including Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd, Indian Oil Corp. Ltd, Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corp, State Bank of India, National Aluminium Company Ltd. and Steel Authority of India Ltd, did not have the minimum number of independent directors as of 2 June, according to Prime Database, a Mumbai-based market data tracking firm. The list of non-compliant PSUs includes banks, oil and gas companies, metals and mining firms, power utilities, telecommunications, railways, and engineering firms. According to the Securities and Exchange Board of India’s listing regulations, at least one-third of a listed entity's board members must comprise independent directors. Additionally, if the chairman is an executive director, at least half of the board must consist of independent directors. Also Read: HPCL gets new chief, four more large PSUs in queue Boardroom bottlenecksThere are more red flags when it comes to board committees: 64 PSUs lack an independent director as chairperson of their audit committee, and 68 companies do not have independent chairs for their nomination and remuneration panels. Additionally, 14 of the listed PSUs are yet to appoint a single woman director, despite gender diversity requirements, according to Prime Database. “It’s ironic that we are asking all private sector companies to comply with these requirements when government-owned companies themselves are non-compliant," said Pranav Haldea, managing director at Prime Database. With PSUs failing to comply with the market regulator’s rules, many have been fined by stock exchanges. Last week, National Aluminium Company Ltd (Nalco) was fined ₹33.32 lakh for having only three independent directors—two short of the required five—on its 10-member board. A spokesperson for Nalco said the company was continuously following up with the ministry of mines, its administrative ministry, for the appointment of the requisite number of independent directors. The bottleneck lies in the approval process across various ministries, according to proxy advisory firms. “The Prime Minister’s Office should send a strong message to all concerned ministries and PSU companies that they need to be compliant, as non-compliance by PSUs doesn't send the right message to investors," said Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director of InGovern Research Services, a proxy advisory firm. “For instance, when the government, as a major shareholder, is involved in abusive transactions or there is trouble with key management, independent directors are the custodians of minority shareholders’ interests," Subramanian said. Also Read: India's PSU banks outshine private peers in arresting bad loans Many of the largest money managers, including BlackRock and Vanguard, have voiced their concerns when these companies have sought shareholder approval for the appointment of directors, according to voting disclosures reviewed by Mint. In August last year, Hindustan Aeronautics sought shareholder approval for the appointment of former chairman C.B. Ananthakrishnan. Nearly a fourth of public institutions opposed the decision. “Nominee serves as chair of the board and bears responsibility for lack of independence. Nominee is an executive director on the audit committee," noted BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, with $11.6 trillion in assets under management. In the same month, Hindustan Petroleum Corp. sought shareholders’ approval for the appointment of Pankaj Kumar as a director, but 28.35% of public institutions, including Vanguard, opposed his re-appointment. "There has been an expectation that the exchanges or Sebi will act, more so given the repeat violations, but neither has been able to address this issue," said Amit Tandon, founder and managing director of Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IIAS), a Mumbai-based proxy advisory firm. "The solution may be to move these entities out of the control of the administrative ministry and into a direct fund that will focus on governance and value creation," he said Despite these lapses, investor interest in PSUs has surged. The BSE PSU Index, which comprises 63 companies, has outperformed the Sensex over the last five years. The index has gained 301% between 5 June 2020 and 3 June 2025, while the Sensex has risen by 135.5% during this period.

Title: Bitcoin ‘Going To Take Over’—Tesla CEO Elon Musk Backs Shock $40 Trillion U.S. Dollar Collapse Warning Amid Price Boom

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. 06/05 update below. This post was originally published on June 04 Bitcoin has surged over the last year, propelled higher by Wall Street’s embrace of crypto and U.S. president Donald Trump’s support (despite Google revealing a serious BlackRock bitcoin nightmare just got a lot worse). Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price set a new all-time high of $112,000 per bitcoin last month, surging 50% from its April low and helped by U.S. vice president JD Vance issuing a huge crypto prediction. Now, as the Covid-era meme stock craze turns to bitcoin, Tesla billionaire Elon Musk has restarted his campaign against out-of-control U.S. government spending, backing a warning that bitcoin could “take over” from the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Tesla chief executive Elon Musk has reposted a wild bitcoin prediction following the huge bitcoin ... More price rally. “If the electorate doesn’t hold Congress accountable to reducing the deficit, and start paying down the debt, bitcoin is going to take over as reserve currency,” Brian Armstrong, the chief executive of crypto exchange Coinbase, posted to X in comments reposted by Musk. “I love bitcoin, but a strong America is also super important for the world. We need to get our finances under control.” 06/05 update: Elon Musk’s endorsement of Armstrong’s warning comes at a time of increased pressure on the U.S. dollar, with analysts at Morgan Stanley predicting the U.S. dollar will fall to levels not see since the Covid pandemic this year, pushed down by Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and the rise of rival currencies. "We think rates and currency markets have embarked on sizeable trends that will be sustained — taking the US dollar much lower and yields curves much steeper — after two years of swing trading within wide ranges," the strategists wrote in a note seen by Business Insider, adding they expect the dollar to fall 9% over the next 12 months to a value of 91 on the dollar index. JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon has added to fears, predicting spiraling U.S. debt may create a "tough time" for the bond market as spreads widen. "If people decide that the U.S. dollar isn’t the place to be, you could see credit spreads gap out; that would be quite a problem," Dimon said during an interview with Fox Business. “It does feel like we’re entering into a more secular downturn for the dollar,” Peter Vassallo, a portfolio manager at BNP Paribas Asset Management who focuses on currencies, told MarketWatch. “The worst-case scenarios surrounding tariffs have been reduced. But the broad ideas around U.S. policy being more volatile and more hostile to foreign trade — that hasn’t gone away.” Musk, who last year embarked on a campaign against spiraling U.S. debt while supporting U.S. president Donald Trump’s second bid for the White House, has come out against Trump’s signature tax bill just days after leaving his role in Trump’s administration. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates Trump’s so-called “big, beautiful bill” will add $3.8 trillion to the U.S.’s $36 trillion in debt over the next decade, taking it to an eye-watering $40 trillion. "I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore," Musk, who set up and led the Doge department of government efficiency, posted to X. “This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination.” Musk wrote that those who voted for it “know you did wrong," and added in a follow up post that it “will massively increase the already gigantic budget deficit to $2.5 trillion and burden American citizens with crushingly unsustainable debt.” Huge government spending through Covid lockdowns turbo-charged U.S. debt, leading to warnings the Federal Reserve will have to step in to prop up bond markets, devaluing the dollar and potentially spiking inflation. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price rocketed to a fresh all-time high in May, soaring as fears swirl over the health ... More of the U.S. dollar. Bitcoin, a scarce digital asset that’s often compared to gold, has seen its price rocket higher as countries around the world, and led by the U.S., fuel their economic growth with debt. Companies are beginning to shift their corporate treasuries to bitcoin, a trend started by ailing software company MicroStrategy in 2020 that’s propelled it into the Nasdaq 100 and been copied by dozens of companies. “As the U.S. dollar continues to devalue, we’re going to see this shift happening more and more as investors scramble to protect their assets,” Nic Puckrin, bitcoin and crypto analyst, investor and founder of The Coin Bureau, said in emailed comments. “With bitcoin holding steady above $100,000 for 20 days and counting, it’s fast becoming the new safe haven.”

Title: IT Unionization

Time Published: 2025-06-04T00:00:10Z

Steve Jones, 2025-06-04 I've been reading an interesting book that looks at some of the ways that we can better build software in enterprises. One of the side notes in the book is that the tech companies have the funding and the ability to disrupt many other types of businesses, not just technology. Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and others have delved into other types of industries, potentially pushing others out. We see Amazon becoming as much a shipping and logistics company as they are a retailer. There was a unionization vote, which passed in 2022. Recently, another one failed. Amazon continues to fight these efforts, trying to prevent workers from collectively negotiating the terms of their employment. I've wondered in the past if tech workers would ever unionize. In general, we are paid well and have lots of options for work. There has often been no shortage of opportunities for talented workers, though this year is proving tough for our industry. There are lots of people out of work and struggling to find new jobs. While I'm sure some would prefer a union that might better protect them from layoffs, many tech workers are against the idea. There is a growing number of tech workers looking to unionize. Inside Google, there is a union for some workers, but not all. That's unusual, as often all workers in a category are part of a union at a company. To gain employment, you need to join the union. I don't know if I'd want to join a union. I've had lots of success and haven't seen the need, but I do know that I've also seen lots of other tech workers pressured and pushed to work long hours, to skip vacations, and other practices that are good for the employer, but not so good for the employee. I've seen many people not know how to negotiate with employers, and perhaps a union would benefit most people. Would you want to be part of a data professionals' union? It might give some security and more benefits for many, though not quite as much pay as you might otherwise receive. Maybe more than you get now, as it depends on where you sit in the salary scale at your company. Let me know what you think about unions today.

June 03, 2025 17:07 ET | Source: Robbins LLP Robbins LLP SAN DIEGO, June 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Robbins LLP reminds stockholders that a class action was filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DV) common stock between November 10, 2023 and February 27, 2025. DoubleVerify operates a software platform for digital media measurement and advertising optimization services. For more information, submit a form, email attorney Aaron Dumas, Jr., or give us a call at (800) 350-6003. The Allegations: Robbins LLP is Investigating Allegations that DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (DV) Misled Investors Regarding its Business Prospects According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants failed to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on its Activation Services was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; and (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities. The complaint alleges that the truth was revealed on February 27, 2025, when DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending and the suspension of DoubleVerify services by a large customer. Defendants also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify’s stock price dropped $7.83 per share, or 36%, from a closing price of $21.73 on February 27, 2025, to a closing price of $13.90 on February 28, 2025.

Title: The Best Gifts for an Amazing Host, According to a Party Girl With Taste

Time Published: 2025-06-03T20:46:45Z
Full Content:
Filed under: Whether you’ve been invited to a dinner party or to stay the week at a Joshua Tree compound, your host deserves a token of appreciation — and here are 39 impeccable ideas If you buy something from an Eater link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics policy. Dear guest of someone else’s home: I hope you didn’t show up empty-handed. Bringing a host or hostess gift isn’t just chic; it’s good manners! Now, different situations (and different hosts or hostesses) call for different gifts, from earnest to cheeky, casual to Very Special. A three-day weekend at someone’s recently renovated Joshua Tree compound merits something a little more premeditated than a $20 bottle of wine; for an intimate evening of takeout, couch rotting, and watching The Rehearsal finale, perhaps a box of Japanese incense matches will do the trick. Here’s the thing: Everyone wants to go to a party — well, maybe not those Gen Z professional bed-rotters on TikToks who just want to remain horizontal and scroll, but most of us — yet being a host can be burdensome. I speak from experience as someone who throws at least two relatively decadent gatherings a year; it’s expensive and exhausting, although I’d argue that it’s (almost) always worth it, even if a recycled glass Champagne flute or a stolen pint glass from The Commodore inevitably gets shattered on the floor every time… simply a sacrifice to the party gods. If you’ve been invited to a party, detach your eyeballs from the infinite scroll and go make some memories! Don’t just huff and puff about being late, missing all the mini lobster rolls, or having to stay longer than you’d like to avoid an exorbitant Uber fee; devote a little thought to how your lovely friend or family member put in an undoubtedly Herculean amount of effort (and likely quite a bit of money) to ensure that you, fabulous guest, have a damn good time or else. They built a dirty martini fountain; they made cucumber tea sandwiches; they wiped countertops and bought extra seltzer, all in the name of your amusement and pleasure. Maybe this person isn’t just hosting you in their home for a few hours, but as an overnight guest for a night or three (or longer — maybe you’re staying with someone for two months while your divorce proceedings get sorted, for instance). In these contexts, when you might unwind on their premises, disrupt their daily routine, and stroll their grounds (even if their “grounds” are just 400 square feet in Greenpoint), please take a minute to recognize: wow, what a lovely experience this friend has offered you! You not only evaded the gazillion dollars spent on a hotel or Airbnb, but you probably drank all of their fourth-wave coffee and used all their two-ply toilet paper. You’re enjoying their hospitality, and you should show some appreciation. What makes a great host or hostess gift? Something that feels a little luxe, but not enough to embarrass the recipient; think a lovely little indulgence that you feel like you’d need an excuse to buy for yourself. Price doesn’t always dictate value — such an object can be acquired for less than 10 bucks. It’s the thought that counts, and you want to be clever. It’s no secret that candles make great gifts. They smell good; they establish an elevated ambiance, like you’re in a luxury hotel lobby; and they let you build a very tiny little fire in your home. Fun! But as with any heavily fragranced product, tastes diverge and preferences differ as to what smells “great.” One relatively safe bet: the scent of hinoki, a Japanese cypress tree with a sophisticated, woody, calming aroma. While many hinoki-scented candles are out there, I’m personally a fan of Boy Smells’ Hinoki Fantôme. It’s a very sexy gender-agnostic scent that’s both mysterious and inviting, with notes of cardamom, pear, and oakmoss, like a quiet walk through a forest. Prices taken at time of publishing. While there’s a case to be made that cheap olives make the best dirty martinis, they do not make the best gifts. A $30 jar of Williams Sonoma olives may read “I stay at the Four Seasons,” but in terms of flavor and snackability, I’m partial to Filthy’s olives, these ones stuffed with creamy blue cheese. (FWIW, my friend bartends at an excellent cocktail bar in Hollywood and he says the brand’s brine makes the perfect dirty martinis.) Prices taken at time of publishing. Speaking of small, round things that are intended to be the finishing touch on a cocktail but which you will want to eat straight out of the jar, one absolutely must mention Luxardo cherries. You’ve probably seen them on the shelves of high-end cocktail bars, but if you’re unfamiliar, these are not just any old maraschino cherries, like the bright red ones that came in your childhood Shirley Temples; they’re made with marasca cherries and possess a romantic, sophisticated, almost marzipan-like flavor and a superior texture, and come swimming in a syrup made only of cherry juice and sugar — no weird chemicals or artificial colors. Luxardo is an Italian-run family company that’s been in business since 1821, and it takes its cherry products very seriously, specializing exclusively in maraschino liqueur and these fabulous cherries. Plus, the label is gorgeous. Prices taken at time of publishing. My uncle, who is an architect with excellent taste in restaurants and can quote every single film ever shown on Turner Classic Movies, turned me onto these when I was in my 20s, when I watched him frantically search for them at multiple gourmet food stores in Manhattan as he verbally emphasized that they are the only cocktail cherries that matter. In fact, while we’re on the topic of bettering a home bartending experience, I’d like to revive appreciation for the embroidered cocktail napkin — a staple of Mad Men times that has been unfortunately subjugated in popularity by stupid millennial graphic coasters. May I never receive a chevron-patterned foam coaster again, and let’s imagine the joy one would experience to instead be handed, along with their spritz, a soft linen napkin embroidered with an elegant crane or pelican. Prices taken at time of publishing. If you’re into thrifting, the designs of cocktail napkins from the 50s and 60s suggest that maybe people really were partying harder back then. Cocktail picks are the perfect gift for toting to a party, since they easily fit in a pocket or purse and can immediately be enjoyed with a garnished drink or to pick up and bite into one of those blue-cheese-stuffed olives. I love all of Joanna Buchanan’s cocktail picks (this $200 zodiac set is to die for, truly, though certainly not cheap), but to get out of dream world and back into reality, this $25 stainless steel set from West Elm is surprisingly sexy. Prices taken at time of publishing. Practical and wholesome, a great mug will become a kitchen-cabinet staple. When I remodeled my kitchen a few years back, my contractor gave me a Williams Sonoma mug with my initials on it as a gift once the project was completed. I now use it all the time, and when I do, I think of him and his thoughtfulness while I drink my milky Scottish breakfast tea. Of course, the number of great mugs out there is infinite, making it hard to decide which one your host deserves. For no particular reason at all other than it’s very cute and it’s big — and I love a big, cute mug — I’m infatuated with this Nicholas Mosse sheep mug from store-full-of-adorable-things The Six Bells. It kind of reminds me of that sheep sweater that Princess Diana infamously wore, is hand-painted in Ireland, and its price is in that perfect sweet spot under $50. Prices taken at time of publishing. Similar sentiment, slightly edgier feel: a cool ashtray remains highly useful for non-smokers, too, serving as a home for keys, matchbooks, or those really good sesame cashews from Trader Joe’s. In fact, bring a bag of your favorite nut mix when you present this bad boy. Prices taken at time of publishing. We caught a tip recently that chefs are going wild for Naomi, a new brand of high-end hand wash that is specifically formulated to help eliminate cooking odors. (As garlic-lovers, this promise definitely appeals.) Our shopping team recently took the bergamot- and black-pepper-scented After-Cooking Hand Scrub for a spin and it’s absolutely phenomenal, getting the job done in spades and leaving behind an appealing fragrance on par with the historical king of status hand soaps, Aesop. Plus, love the Yves Klein blue packaging. Prices taken at time of publishing. One of the problems with gifting a bottle of wine is that as soon as it’s opened, it needs to be consumed within a few days, and therefore will quickly be forgotten. But if you hand someone a bottle of flashy olive oil, it will live on their counter or in their pantry for months, reminding them over and over again of your considerate gesture and your good taste. Flamingo Estate, home to many gifts that are so nice you could confidently give them to Gwyneth Paltrow herself, makes our current favorite fancy-schmancy olive oil, announcing on the bottle itself that it’s produced with olives from 150-year-old trees. This is the kind of stuff that rich housewives in the Silverlake hills try to manifest in yoga class. Prices taken at time of publishing. While I haven’t tried it myself, I’ve also symbolically (and aesthetically — look at that tin) taken to this beautiful Palestinian-made olive oil, Ya Albi, after recently editing a piece about the region’s new generation of olive oil makers. Prices taken at time of publishing. Yes, we are currently in a renaissance of incredible glassware; I doubt that I need to tell you that, or to remind you that everyone could use another set of nice glasses to bring out when they have company. Last Christmas, I got my sister this set of geometric stemless cocktail glasses by the glass wizard Sophie Lou Jacobsen. They’re unfortunately sold out now, but in the same spirit, these Anthropologie stemless martini glasses are very similar and reasonably priced, and I’m also blown away by these Serax glasses with a rounded, bubbly foot. Prices taken at time of publishing. As far as wine glasses go, the Eater staff is currently obsessed with short, chonky glasses — they feel more comfortable to wave around while you tell a fascinating story, compared to the nerve-wracking thin-stemmed ones. I’d much rather sip out of one of these Gianfranco Frattini glasses than one that feels like I could shatter it with a quick squeeze. Prices taken at time of publishing. No need to buy a whole set — it’s a little oppressive to give someone who’s not a family member or romantic partner something that takes up a lot of cabinet space. Two will do! Three is awkward and four is too many. If you choose it wisely, gifting a coffee table book makes you look so artistically astute that it will reinforce that you’re a fascinating person who deserves to be invited to future dinner parties. Anything from TASCHEN is a pretty safe bet (see: this book about menu design in America), but for a little more humor and cross-cultural appeal, A24’s 2024 cookbook-coffee-table-book Scrounging is a collection of recipes from cult-fave films — some more useful than others— that promises to spark intrigue and conversation, from Phantom Thread’s omelet to Napoleon Dynamite’s nachos. Prices taken at time of publishing. You could also get them a proper cookbook from which they will actually want to cook. Fair enough! In that instance, I’d recommend perusing our guide to the best cookbooks of spring 2025 and picking the most fitting option for your friend. If you are my friend, please get me Salt Sugar MSG. I was over at a fellow food writer’s house about six months ago and he made me try one of these. It was one of those things where he said, “You’ve got to taste these peppercorns. They are way different from any pepper you’ve ever had, I promise,” and frankly, I took one out of sheer politeness but didn’t believe his claims. That is, until I tasted one of these crunchy little guys for myself; I can confirm that honestly, they’re downright psychedelic in their depth of flavor and unique aroma. What makes The Reluctant Trading Experiment’s Tellicherry peppercorns so mind-blowing? Sourced from India and mainly sourced to high-end restaurants, they’re somehow intoxicating and dimensional, extra-hot and extra-peppery, yet citrusy and floral and shockingly complex. A grinder full of them would be a culinary gift from the heavens. Prices taken at time of publishing. I mean… just look at it. A real conversation piece. The tomato one is nice, too. Prices taken at time of publishing. Not all of us live within close proximity of a proper Jewish deli that can offer a revelatory doughy, cinnamony babka experience. Who wouldn’t (besides the gluten-free among us) be delighted to receive a sweet, decadent duo of babkas — one classic, one chocolaty — from famed New York deli Russ & Daughters? Prices taken at time of publishing. Pro tip: Order this gift set from Goldbelly ahead of time and schedule the delivery date to align with your arrival or the day of the party. That way you can not only arrive hands-free, but hopefully be offered a slice yourself. Two birds, one stone. In the great tradition of things we all want to have around but are sometimes too cheap to buy for ourselves, let us consider fancy salt. A box (or bucket) of Maldon is always appreciated, of course, but showing up with Jacobsen Salt’s aesthetic, transportable set of infused salts just feels a little more gift-y. Prices taken at time of publishing. Our editorial director Lesley Suter makes a strong case that serving spoons are the ultimate host gift, and it just makes you think: When you set down a beautifully assembled Caprese salad or tray of tater tot casserole, isn’t it nice to have some diva’d out utensils with which to serve it? Her picks in this persuasive piece are all top-tier, but right now I’m really into the short-handled (or even handle-free) claw-like ones, like this wood set from Williams Sonoma or the kind-of-nutso stoneware set below that’s probably quite heavy but sure looks swish. Still, they’re easier to maneuver than two long-handled spoons and a bit easier to store, too. Prices taken at time of publishing. If your event is, like, tomorrow, this surprisingly attractive set of salad tongs is available in three colors, can be overnighted via Amazon, and is expensive-looking given its attainable $30 price tag. Prices taken at time of publishing. It’s unrealistic to buy a host or hostess an entire cookware set, no matter how fabulous their party or home is. But you know what makes a surprisingly clever gift? A small skillet for when you’re in the mood for a cheeky fried egg or two, or you want to quickly put together a little Béarnaise sauce for your steak. We’re partial — naturally — to the one from our collab with Heritage Steel. It’s American-made with 5-ply stainless steel and is easy to clean and care for. Sometimes littler is better! Prices taken at time of publishing. You know when you take a stick of butter out of the fridge, hoping to spread it all over your beautiful slice of Out of Thin Air sesame gochujang sourdough, and instead it’s hard and it’s going to tear up the surface of your bread and you’re SAD? No longer a problem once you get your hands on one of these cleverly designed butter spreader knives, which you can glide over the top of your butter hunk to achieve a spreadable consistency instantly. Prices taken at time of publishing. Sure, it’s a bit of a stocking-stuffer type gadget, but it’s currently June, and we still think everyone should have one. Design-forward butter dishes are also having a major moment right now — more on that here. Cutting boards are, again, one of those things you could always use more of, especially from a chef-fave brand like Boos. We’ve gone on and on about how Boos blocks are the Bentleys of cutting boards, thanks to their high-quality wood and durable construction. Prices taken at time of publishing. Don’t ask me how I stumbled across this discovery, because it’s a very long and convoluted story, but it has come to my attention that the French designer Christian Lacroix — in addition to producing beautiful and theatrical clothing — has also made some really exquisite tableware and, more specifically, plates. Prices vary wildly on secondhand sites such as eBay, but if you look strategically, you can get a trompe l’oeil plate with his signature embellished cross on it for under $50 — with the original box, might I add. The butterfly collection is nice, too. Prices taken at time of publishing. Matches come in handy for many reasons; lighting candles, of course; sparking up a slim, cheeky joint; or keeping in your bathroom for houseguests in search of discretion about their activities. Yes, you could grab a matchbox for free at your favorite dive bar, but having a box of illustrated Diptyque matches sitting next to your soap dish is just a quiet flex. I was devastated to find out that all of Diptyque’s scented matches are currently sold out, but thankfully, Hibi’s beloved Japanese incense matches are currently in stock a few different places online. An eight-pack (below) will probably do the trick for a casual dinner party gift, but a 30-pack will keep your host’s home in a state of zen for weeks or months. Prices taken at time of publishing. I also genuinely love the gold-foiled, retro-hippie-chic look of classic Incense Matches, and I find the paper incense from Optatum to be so stylish and decorous, it looks like it belongs next to the sink of a bathroom in Versailles. Prices taken at time of publishing. Diptyque, while foolish not to immediately restock its scented matches, also makes a basil-scented odor-removing candle. Yes, it is $75, but according to the brand, it’s “based on a technology that targets and eliminates the molecules responsible for unpleasant odors. It replaces them with green and aromatic combinations of basil, mint, and tomato leaf.” There’s a somewhat convincing case here that it could quickly become a high-end kitchen essential. Prices taken at time of publishing. Eater has accurately referred to Levain as New York City’s most popular bakery, although it now has locations in multiple cities, all of which are very busy. I’m going to be totally honest with you: I do not love the cookies from Levain. I’m a flat, chewy, doughy cookie girl and I don’t like nuts in my cookies, and Levain’s cookies are tall, thick, gooey, and very nut-positive. But I can tell you this with confidence: People go absolutely feral for these cookies. The bakery’s closest location to me, in LA’s Larchmont neighborhood, is inundated with cookie-seekers at all hours of the day, with lines snaking down the block. I seem to be the only person in the world that simply doesn’t vibe that hard with Levain’s cookie style, so I can still advise that they will make a well-loved, quickly devoured gift. And honestly, this photo is borderline pornographic and makes me “get it.” Prices taken at time of publishing. Perhaps thanks to the modern ubiquity of the Aperol spritz, aperitifs and digestifs have never been more on-the-radar for the home-bar-cart crowd. As a Bay Area native, I came of indie-sleaze age drinking a lot of Fernet-Branca, the face-contorting bitter of choice for San Francisco bartenders. But, thanks to their sweetness, amaros are a little more user-friendly and giftable, and many of them feature beautiful bottles and offer an air like you went and fetched them directly from Italy. While there are dozens, if not hundreds, of superb amaros out there — I love the smoky honey flavor of Amaro Dell’Erborista and the fanciful bottle design of Amaro Nonino — I’d argue that the best bang for your buck is Amaro Meletti. Butterscotchy and cola-like (but not cloying) with notes of chocolate, anise, and saffron, it’s well-balanced, cheerful, and equally enjoyable neat, on the rocks, or with seltzer. It doesn’t hurt that at $26, its price is incredibly reasonable. Prices taken at time of publishing. Step it up by bringing a bottle of really good tequila. Eater’s guide to the best tequila is comprehensive and might just leave you even less decisive, since they all sound amazing, so I’ll narrow it down to two options for you. If you’re looking to spend less than $100, go with Siembra Valles reposado. “But I don’t like reposado,” you might say, traumatized by long, barely recallable nights with Mr. Cuervo in college. Fear not — this is a totally different experience. Made by maestro tequilero Don Salvador Rosales Briseño, this tequila has an almost vanilla-like flavor, and is aged in proprietary Missouri white oak barrels. It’s also paler than many reposado tequilas you’ll see on shelves, because it’s only aged for three months, giving it a more blanco-like taste with hints of mint and citrus fruit. Prices taken at time of publishing. If you are blessed with ample expendable income and/or are hoping to impress the unimpressible, show up with a bottle of Rey Sol Extra Añejo. It’s lauded as one of the finest tequilas available — for real! — falling into a special category reserved for those spirits aged a minimum of five years in carefully constructed oak barrels. Its aroma is known for offering rich notes of vanilla, caramel, and wood, and is on par with the most storied, world-famous whiskies in terms of quality and smoothness. Plus, that bottle — you’ll definitely want to keep it long after you’ve taken the last sip. Prices taken at time of publishing. You can trust me, wholeheartedly, on all of the ideas above, and I’ll trust that you won’t break another one of my Champagne glasses.

Major U.S. equities indexes finished higher after data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed an unexpected uptick in job openings in April, although several economists cautioned that tariffs could weigh on jobs growth as the year advances. The S&P 500 ended Tuesday's session 0.6% higher. The Dow added 0.5%. Strength among semiconductor firms and the rest of the tech sector helped lift the Nasdaq 0.8%. Read Investopedia's full daily markets roundup here. Dollar General (DG) shares surged 16%, chalking up the S&P 500's top daily performance after the discount retailer topped quarterly sales and profit estimates and boosted its full-year outlook. The company anticipated that it should be able to mitigate most tariff-related cost pressure but expressed uncertainty around the possible impact on consumer spending trends. Analysts have said that dollar stores could be poised to benefit as consumers trade down in the current environment. Shares of Dollar Tree (DLTR), set to report its own results Wednesday morning, were up 6%. Shares of ON Semiconductor (ON) jumped 11% after the company's top executive discussed expectations for a recovery in demand. In a presentation at the Bank of America Technology Conference, Onsemi CEO Hassane El-Khoury pointed to signs of recovery in the company's industrials market, its second largest, as well as indications that the automotive market could see a bottom in the second quarter. First Solar (FSLR) stock bounced 6.5% higher on Tuesday, reversing losses posted in the prior session. Shares of companies in the renewable energy space have come under pressure since the House passed a reconciliation bill that calls for the elimination of numerous clean energy initiatives and the Department of Energy cancelled an array of related grants. Mizuho analysts boosted their price target on the stock. Crude oil futures prices extended their recent string of gains, bolstered by increasing geopolitical tensions, including an escalation of the war in Ukraine and an uncertain outlook for a U.S.-Iran nuclear deal. The price uptick helped lift oil and gas stocks, with shares of exploration and production firm APA Corp. (APA) gaining 5.4%. Shares of Kenvue (KVUE), the consumer health company that spun off from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) in 2023, dropped 6.2%, the furthest of any S&P 500 stock. Kenvue CEO Thibaut Mongon suggested that a lagging transition from spring into winter had contributed to soft seasonal demand for allergy and sun protection products. FactSet Research Systems (FDS) shares sank 4.8% after the financial data and software provider announced that Sanoke Viswanathan, formerly an executive at JPMorgan Chase (JPM), would take the reins as CEO starting in September. Current CEO Phil Snow is set to retire and exit his position on FactSet's board of directors at that time.

Title: Builder.ai collapses after revelation that its 'AI' was hundreds of engineers
URL: https://www.techspot.com/news/108173-builderai-collapses-after-revelation-ai-hundreds-engineers.html
Time Published: 2025-06-03T20:33:00Z

Cutting corners: Builder.ai promised to revolutionize software development with artificial intelligence – and convinced deep-pocketed investors it had. Backed by Microsoft and valued at $1.5 billion, the startup masked manual labor as machine learning until the facade crumbled, leaving behind lawsuits, layoffs, and one of the industry's most embarrassing collapses. Builder.ai has collapsed under the weight of several deceptions, ending the rise of a British startup once heralded as a pioneer in democratizing software development. Valued at $1.5 billion in 2023 with backing from Microsoft and Qatar's sovereign wealth fund, the company filed for bankruptcy protection this week after revelations that its "AI-powered" platform relied on hundreds of engineers in India while executives allegedly orchestrated a years-long financial deception. For eight years, Builder.ai marketed its "Natasha" AI system as a fully autonomous tool that could build software "as easily as ordering pizza." However, internal documents and employee accounts reviewed by Bloomberg paint a sharply different picture. Engineers in Noida and Bangalore manually coded client projects while being instructed to mimic AI-generated responses. "We were told to never mention our location or use Indian English phrases," said a former Bangalore engineer. The team timed updates to UK business hours to maintain the illusion of automation. The company's downfall accelerated in April 2025 when Bloomberg exposed a round-tripping scheme with Indian social media firm VerSe Innovation. From 2021 to 2024, the two companies exchanged nearly identical invoices totaling millions of dollars for services never rendered, artificially inflating Builder.ai's revenue by up to 300 percent. Audits later revealed 2024 revenues totaled just $55 million – a fraction of the $220 million projected to investors. VerSe co-founder Umang Bedi denied the allegations, calling them "absolutely baseless." Microsoft's $455 million investment in 2023, including plans to integrate Builder.ai's technology with Azure, now stands as a cautionary tale. The partnership fell apart when creditor Viola Credit seized $37 million from Builder.ai's accounts after uncovering inflated financials, leaving only $5 million in restricted funds. The startup also owes $85 million to Amazon and $30 million to Microsoft for cloud services. The US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York has subpoenaed financial records and customer lists as part of a widening probe into potential securities fraud. Separately, the SEC is investigating whether Builder.ai misrepresented its technological capabilities to investors. Internal Slack messages show executives directing staff to "minimize visibility" of human labor in investor materials. "Positioning must focus on our proprietary AI – human labor isn't part of the story," a 2022 internal memo stated. Founder Sachin Dev Duggal, who styled himself Chief Wizard, resigned as CEO in February 2025 amid mounting losses and relocated to Dubai. His replacement, Manpreet Ratia, disclosed that the company laid off approximately 80 percent of its global workforce – about 1,000 employees. The insolvency marks the most significant AI startup failure to occur since ChatGPT's breakthrough debut in 2022, underscoring growing scrutiny of "AI washing" across the tech sector.

Title: 6 Best Growth Stocks To Buy For June 2025
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/best-growth-stocks-buy-now-june-2025/
Time Published: 2025-06-03T19:05:24Z

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. The best growth stocks are well-run companies that innovate to create value for their customers. Many growth stocks lost value in the heat of the whiplash tariff announcements in early April. As a group, they’re crawling their way back towards positive for the year, at least according to the Russell 1000 Growth index. The current window for capturing good prices on growth stocks may be closing. If you prefer not to wait for the next round of selloffs and you're ready for some investing inspiration, take a look at the six promising growth stocks below. These six best growth stocks have strong recent and projected sales and earnings per share (EPS) growth, plus conservative debt-to-equity (DTE) ratios. They are also more than 50% owned by institutional investors, such as hedge funds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, insurance companies and other large money managers. These are folks with access to sophisticated research teams and tools. When this crowd loves a stock, it signals confidence in that company’s growth prospects. Here are the exact screening metrics used to identify these growth stocks: The table below introduces the six best stocks to buy now, according to the above parameters. A more detailed review of each stock follows. For more investing ideas, see best stocks for 2025 and long-term growth stocks. Nvidia designs and sells semiconductors and related hardware. The company also maintains a suite of software development tools. Customers include automotive OEMs, device manufacturers, cloud providers, internet companies and distributors. Nvidia has a dominant market share in AI-capable chips used in data centers. The company's products also have automotive, gaming, robotics and telecommunications applications. It’s commonplace to see Nvidia in a list of top growth stocks. The magnitude of the company's growth trajectory almost demands it. Since early 2023, Nvidia has increased annual sales from $26 billion to $130 billion, while its market cap has ballooned from $500 billion to $3.3 trillion. That happened after the company had raised annual sales by about 25% on average in the previous five years. AI adoption fueled this recent growth phase, but Nvidia has a long history of vision, innovation and execution—the trifecta of success factors in technology. While the biggest gains are already on the books, Nvidia isn’t likely to stop growing. The company has $53.7 billion of cash on its balance sheet, plus a savvy founder/CEO to keep competition at bay. For the first quarter 2026, Nvidia reported quarter-over-quarter sales growth of 69% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 27%. The results included a $4.5 billion charge resulting from changes in the U.S. government’s policy on chip sales to China. Analysts expect Nvidia to deliver 56% revenue growth and 50.7% EPS growth in fiscal 2026. Tradeweb builds and maintains investment trading marketplaces for stocks, bonds, credit, derivatives and other asset classes. The technology focus is on faster trades and data transparency. Clients are institutional investors and wealth managers. Tradeweb values its total addressable market at $8.9 trillion. With annual sales of $1.8 billion, the company owns only a sliver of the market. The largest opportunities are in ETFs and credit, where Tradeweb has 6% and 17% market share, respectively. The growth plan involves acquisitions and customer-driven technology innovation, particularly in rules-based trading. Tradeweb has expertise in automation. It launched its flagship Automated Intelligent Execution (AiEX) tool for U.S. Treasuries in 2012. As rules-based trading has become more popular, so has AiEX. The company is also incorporating AI to provide customers with advanced analytics before and after trades. For the first quarter 2025, Tradeweb reported quarter-over-quarter sales growth of 24.7% and diluted EPS growth of 16.9%. For the full year 2025, analysts expect sales and EPS increases of 23.3% and 51.6%, respectively. Monday.com builds and maintains software that business teams use to manage projects, collaborate, track sales leads and organize software development workflows. Customers include businesses, educational institutions and governments. Monday.com solutions fit in between overbuilt, expensive enterprise applications and off-the-shelf software that can’t fully address a team's unique workflows. The company's Work Operating System is a modular, customizable system clients can use to build the tools they need, without the expense and extended implementation timeline—two hallmarks of enterprise software. The functional, but robust product offering has propelled the company’s sales from $161 million in 2020 to $972 million last year. In that time, Monday.com has made strong progress moving up-market to a higher-dollar customer base, which is a key element of the growth strategy. While earnings just turned positive in 2024, Monday.com’s free cash flow in both 2023 and 2024 exceeded $200 million. As of March 31, 2025, the company had $1.5 billion in cash on its balance sheet, an ample source of growth funding. In its first quarter 2025 earnings release, Monday.com reported 30% quarter-over-quarter sales growth, 38% more customers worth $50,000-plus in annual sales and a non-GAAP operating margin of 14%. Analysts expect Monday.com to produce 28% sales growth and 523% EPS growth in 2025. Nova provides equipment, technology and solutions to help semiconductor manufacturers produce chips faster and more efficiently. The company specializes in dimensional metrology solutions, which provide precision size and shape measurements. Nova solutions address multiple stages of the semiconductor manufacturing lifecycle. Customers include leading integrated circuit manufacturers in Asia, Europe and North America. Semiconductor manufacturing is a thriving industry. According to a recent Deloitte report, 2024 semiconductor sales grew 19% to $627 billion. Expected 2025 sales are $697 billion, placing the industry on an easy pace to reach $1 trillion in sales by 2030 and $2 trillion by 2040. Nova’s role in helping manufacturers improve efficiency and output is critical to that growth. The company has an interesting mix of advantages: innovative technologies, a high-margin business model and ample growth opportunity. With that foundation, the leadership team is targeting $1 billion in sales by 2027. The 2027 outlook also includes a gross margin of 57% to 60%, R&D spend of 15% to 17% of sales and EPS close to $10—a 75% increase from the 2024 EPS of $5.75. For the first quarter, Nova reported 50% sales growth and 77% GAAP diluted EPS growth vs. the prior-year period. Analysts expect Nova to deliver sales growth of 30% and EPS growth of 49% in 2025. Krystal Biotech develops and sells genetic therapies treating rare diseases. In 2023, the company received FDA approval for Vyjuvek, the first treatment for the skin disorder dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB). Vyjuvek is now available in the U.S. and expanding globally. Krystal Biotech additionally has five active clinical programs addressing cystic fibrosis, solid tumors and another skin disorder, lamellar ichthyosis. Krystal Biotech focuses on identifying therapies for conditions with high unmet needs. As an example, before the U.S. launch of Vyjuvek, there was no treatment for DEB despite the severity of the disease. DEB is associated with recurring and chronic wounds that are costly to treat, as well as increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma. The company is also developing a treatment for Apha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD), a disorder that precedes progressive lung disease. More than 250,000 patients worldwide have AATD. There is no cure and treatment options are limited. KRYS additionally has scalable, in-house manufacturing capacity to support Vyjuvek’s global expansion and other growth opportunities. Krystal Biotech began generating revenue in 2023. 2024 sales eclipsed $290 million, and EPS totaled $3 per share. Analysts expect 48.7% revenue growth and 104.3% EPS growth this year. Liquidity Services sells its clients' surplus assets on the world's largest B2B ecommerce network, via self-serve and fully managed auction offerings. Operating in more than 100 countries, the company has 5.7 million registered buyers and facilitates 1 million transactions annually. Liquidity Services adds value on three levels. Clients have an easy solution for liquidating unneeded assets, buyers have access to assets at liquidation pricing and landfills have less waste to process. The company also has an enviable client list spanning multiple industries and regions. Chevron, Shell, Sony, Volvo, P&G, Walmart and Amazon are among the names that LQDT services. The company values its addressable market at over $130 billion, which it breaks down into five sectors: Liquidity Services has regularly increased its gross merchandise volume and revenue since fiscal 2021. In its most recent quarter, LQDT reported sales growth of 27% and GAAP diluted EPS growth of 22%. Analysts expect a 35% revenue increase and a 99% increase in EPS in fiscal 2025. Bottom Line Growth stocks can move fast, up and down. Opt for well-run companies that innovate to create value for their customers. Those qualities help growth players thrive in good times and survive in bad ones.

Title: SpaceX Seizes on 'Careless Errors' to Delay AST SpaceMobile's Giant Satellite

Could SpaceX derail a rival's next-generation satellite project because of paperwork issues? On Monday, the company urged the Federal Communications Commission to dismiss an application from AST SpaceMobile because of "careless errors" and "inconsistencies" in the documentation. "While AST extolls the titanic capabilities of its satellite in its application, it simultaneously seeks to hide the risks of its operations,” SpaceX says in a filing. Texas-based AST has been trying to secure FCC experimental authorization to operate a prototype satellite called FM1, which is scheduled to launch in July. The huge satellite, which is designed to offer internet to mobile phones, spans 223 square meters, or about three times larger than the company’s first-generation BlueBird satellites. AST first filed its regulatory request for FM1 in March. But since then, it has faced an ongoing back-and-forth with the FCC over errors and incomplete data. "Wilde is in Argentina, not Australia. Please correct this repeated error in the API,” the FCC told the company last Friday, while raising five other issues.

Could SpaceX derail a rival's next-generation satellite project because of paperwork issues? On Monday, the company urged the Federal Communications Commission to dismiss an application from AST SpaceMobile because of "careless errors" and "inconsistencies" in the documentation. "While AST extolls the titanic capabilities of its satellite in its application, it simultaneously seeks to hide the risks of its operations,” SpaceX says in a filing. Texas-based AST has been trying to secure FCC experimental authorization to operate a prototype satellite called FM1, which is scheduled to launch in July. The huge satellite, which is designed to offer internet to mobile phones, spans 223 square meters, or about three times larger than the company’s first-generation BlueBird satellites. AST first filed its regulatory request for FM1 in March. But since then, it has faced an ongoing back-and-forth with the FCC over errors and incomplete data. "Wilde is in Argentina, not Australia. Please correct this repeated error in the API,” the FCC told the company last Friday, while raising five other issues. In total, the FCC has sent AST five emails about submitting additional details and correcting the application. On Monday, SpaceX seized on the paperwork problems, alleging that AST’s orbit safety plans for the satellites have been "hastily revised." "Unfortunately, AST's experimental license application and supplemental submissions fail to demonstrate substantial completeness or compliance with the Commission’s rules, or that authorizing these high-risk test operations would serve the public interest,” SpaceX says.

Title: Who do Cooper Flagg, Dylan Harper compare to? NBA player comps for 2025's top 6 draft prospects

If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Comparison is the death of joy … but you have to wonder if Mark Twain would stick to that tune if the NBA Draft were around back then. For draft fans, player comps can in fact be the root of joy. While no comp is ever perfect, it provides a context for fans to quickly familiarize themselves with prospects in a fun way. Don't kid yourself -- real NBA decision-makers also participate in such activities. Again, it's about context but also precedence. If you're projecting a prospect to the next level and trying to figure out what role they'll be able to play, it's only natural to ask yourself if similar players have had success in that role. So, with the 2025 NBA Draft now little more than three weeks away and with six prospects most commonly being mocked in the top half of the lottery, here are the player comps to help prepare you for draft night and shed some light on what front offices may be contemplating. Kirilenko was my comp for Flagg coming into the season. A game-changing defender off-ball, with versatility on the ball at 6-foot-9, he approached nearly 5 stocks (steals + blocks) per game in his prime and had a rare ability to stuff all columns of the stat sheet. Offensively, he could impact winning without needing to the be the focal point, but was capable of being a very good secondary threat, if not a consistent shooter. While the validity of this comp still holds on the defensive end, Flagg has outgrown AK-47's offensive correlation. Coming into the year at Duke, we had two questions about Flagg: the consistency of the shooting (both from an accuracy and mechanical standpoint) and the self-creation. He addressed those by continuing to elevate his game and making glaring progress throughout the season, to the point where he shot over 40% from behind the arc in ACC play. He still tends to have two different releases -- a set shot when spotting up and a true jump shot when shooting on the move or off the dribble -- so there are some lingering questions, but not nearly to the same extent. There's also much more optimism that he can be a primary scoring option in the NBA, and yet his game -- specifically his passing and natural unselfishness -- is ideal to complement another alpha scorer. This is where the Pippen comp comes in. He looks like he can headline an offense, but whether that's the offense of an NBA championship caliber team is still to be determined. Harper is a big lead guard, measuring in at just under 6-foot-6 with shoes on and a massive wingspan that eclipses 6-foot-10. He has terrific natural instincts and feel for the game that manifest itself with floor vision, timing, and creative footwork. All of that helps him compensate for the fact that he is neither a totally knockdown three-point shooter, nor a dynamic vertical athlete. He came into college viewed as a combo-guard, capable of playing on or off the ball. While that versatility will translate to the next level as well, he was the full-time point guard at Rutgers and now is most natural as a primary initiator, which makes a potential fit for guard-stocked San Antonio at No. 2 overall questionable. Our description of Harper is reminiscent of Cunningham, who was just a bit bigger, but from a very similar archetype when he came into the league. He's made strides with his shooting, as Harper should be capable of doing, while simultaneously maintaining his ability to make plays for himself and others with his instincts and mental acuity for the game. Many believe that Harper has a similarly bright future, but durability will be a key variable, as it has been for Cunningham. This past season was the first time in his four-year career that he's played 70 games and he responded with his first All-NBA season. In late December of his senior year, Bailey's McEachern High School team traveled to New Jersey to play in an event at Rutgers' Jersey Mikes Arena. The future Scarlet Knight delivered a 40-point 21-rebound performance that was one for the ages, and was streamed directly by the NBA. It was on that night that Tracy McGrady comparisons were born. While those may be mocked now, to see it in person was to see the validity. The 6-foot-9 wing soared for numerous incredible dunks and simultaneously put on a tough shot-making show. This year at Rutgers there were more undeniable highs (39 points at Indiana, 37 at Northwestern), but not the overall consistency to perpetuate comps to one of the NBA's all-time great wing scorers. So his comp drops several rungs. Nonetheless, Bailey still has a combination of wing size, athleticism, and shot-making that gives him undeniable upside. His assist-to-turnover numbers are concerning and his inability to put more pressure on the rim in the halfcourt is somewhat surprising given his athletic tools. Porter had that same overlap of size, shooting and athleticism, along with similar measurables, and even some of the same concerns such as assist-to-turnover ratio and lack of blow-by in the halfcourt. Bailey's range of outcomes is perhaps wider than any other player in the top 6, but Porter's path provides a clear template that could lead to long-term success and impacting winning. Victor Oladipo was once known as an undersized wing who compensated for a lack of skill and positional size with extreme length, athleticism, and the high-motor. Edgecombe too was much more of a wing than true guard in high school and known for his extreme athleticism and two-way competitiveness. We saw him make notable strides with his guard skills during the course of his season at Baylor, but that process is one that will need to be on-going. He measured in at 6-foot-4 without shoes with a 6-foot-7 wingspan. By comparison, he's a little bigger than Oladipo, but not quite as long. The athletic similarities aren't just based on their high-flying athleticism, but the sheer force and explosiveness they can utilize in to cover the court and explode downhill. Edgecombe, like Oladipo, not only has to keep polishing and expanding his ball-skills and ability to make reads, but he has a chance to weaponize his physical gifts on the defensive end of the floor. He's not yet quite as far along as advertised on that end, particularly off the ball, but the potential is there, both from a physical and mental perspective. Johnson is a potent scorer and tough shot-maker. He's been that since high school. There was little doubt he was going to be given an opportunity to put up numbers this year at Texas, but the big question centered around his efficiency and ability to impact winning in the process. There was a very similar narrative for Thomas when he arrived at LSU in 2019. He went on to put up 23 points on 17 shots per game for a team that went 19-10. Since then, his scoring prowess has continued to ascend in the NBA, but questions persist about whether his spurt bucket-getting can drive winning. Conversely, Johnson put up 20 points this year on 16 shots per game, but exceeded expectations when it came to his overall efficiency. His 43/40/87 shooting splits were more than respectable, especially for a freshman that was the top priority for opposing defenses on a nightly basis. He also made clear gains with his passing this year. It was the combination of that unexpected efficiency, albeit amidst steady volume, along with the gains in his processing that has helped him surge up draft boards. There is optimism Johnson can be an instant-offense type scorer like Thomas, but if the growth we saw this season continues, there may be a path for him to be even more than that. Knueppel may not be the 6-foot-8 that Duke listed him at this year. In reality, he's 6-foot-5 without shoes on with a wingspan just over 6-foot-6. In short (no pun intended), he's not very long or athletic, but is still one heck of a basketball player. Knueppel is skilled and smart. He's a shooter and floor-spacer who thrived as a floor-spacer secondary playmaker for Duke this year and even may have had more primary playmaking potential than he got to show running alongside Flagg all year. All of that is on par with what we've seen from Austin Reaves in recent years, as he took on a bigger role than expected right away for the Lakers and has seen his output grow with each passing year because of his ability to both play off more dynamic individual talents, but then have spurts where he can carry a second-unit. © 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.

Title: Nvidia Added to Jefferies 'Franchise Picks'

Jefferies has added Nvidia (NVDA) to its roster of “Franchise Picks,” a group its analysts describe as “our highest-conviction, Buy-rated stocks.” In Nvidia’s case, the reason for conviction is the chipmaker’s position as the “dominant supplier of AI accelerators” to data centers, facilities that house the advanced computers used to develop and train artificial intelligence models. Jefferies came away from Nvidia’s quarterly results impressed with the chipmaker’s revenue projections—which largely mirrored what analysts expected despite a larger-than-expected impact from U.S. export curbs. Nvidia said it expects to take an $8 billion hit this quarter due to lost revenue from sales of H20 chips, which the Trump administration barred from being sold in China. The analysts pointed to the “massive step up” in AI commitments from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates as a reason for revenue optimism. Last month, Nvidia agreed to supply chips to Saudi AI startup Humain, while the U.S. and UAE reached a deal allowing the Middle Eastern nation to import American-made AI chips. Nvidia, grappling with Microsoft (MSFT) for the title of the most valuable company in the world by market capitalization at more than $3.4 trillion, traded 2% higher shortly after the opening bell Tuesday. The stock has gained roughly 5% so far in 2025.

Title: What’s Going On With The Part Of The Disney Co. Folks Forget About, Disney Publishing
URL: https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/97865-what-comes-next-for-a-changed-disney-publishing.html
Time Published: 2025-06-03T14:01:00Z
Full Content:
The Walt Disney Company’s book operations have undergone a series of changes over the years as the company has morphed into a media and entertainment colossus. Disney Publishing’s most recent big pivot came in 2020, when it sold 1,110 children’s titles to Hachette Book Group and made the decision to focus on acquiring global content that it can leverage across multiple platforms and media. In recent months, the group has made a number of significant changes, but company executives said their mission remains the same. “We remain focused on acquiring and developing global content that could be leveraged across multiple platforms and media,” Tonya Agurto, SVP and publisher of new IP and global business development, Disney Publishing, wrote in an email to PW. While its objectives remains unchanged, Disney has made a number of tweaks to its publishing division in order to fulfill that mission. Over the last six months, two high-ranking children’s publishing executives have left the company, which also made a number of layoffs in marketing and other departments earlier this year. In April, it announced several promotions at Hyperion Avenue, the adult imprint Disney founded in 2021, eight years after it sold the majority of its adult titles to HBG. Earlier this month, Disney announced it had reached a new, broad licensing agreement with Penguin Random House, a move that had been rumored for weeks. Under the agreement, PRH is licensing content from the 20th Century Studios, Disney, Marvel, National Geographic, Pixar, and Star Wars units. The agreement includes children’s books; middle grade, young adult, and adult novels; manga; and reference books across print, e-book, and audio formats. PRH has licensed Disney properties for over 20 years, and both parties called the deal an expansion of their relationship. The agreement also deepens Disney’s ties to PRH, which took over distribution for Disney’s adult and children’s print books from HBG in 2023. In her email, Agurto noted that Disney Publishing has a presence in more than 100 countries and products available in more than 40 languages, adding that “as our business evolves, we continue to explore new licensing agreements that bring books to fans of all ages.” After finalizing the agreement, Random House Children’s Books hired about a dozen editors and other employees who had worked at Disney Publishing on the National Geographic Kids imprint. Among the new PRH employees is Vivian Suchman, who was named editorial director of National Geographic Kids after serving as managing editor for that imprint while it was at Disney. The announcement of the PRH licensing agreement came a few weeks after Monique Diman-Riley was promoted from director of sales in North America for Disney Publishing Group to VP of sales and retail strategy for Disney Publishing. In that role, Disney said, Diman-Riley will “expand her scope to work with licensing partners to drive promotional branded opportunities at retail for the larger Disney publishing portfolio.” Among the executives who have recently departed Disney are Kieran Viola and Sylvie Frank. Viola joined Disney in 2021 to oversee Disney Hyperion, with a mandate to find new bestselling children’s authors, and is now an executive editor at Scholastic. Frank had served as editorial director of Disney Hyperion, overseeing acquisitions across all young reader formats, as well as the Freedom Fire and Disney Planet Possible imprints; she is now senior executive editor at Flamingo Books, an imprint of Penguin Young Readers. Following the moves, Jennifer Levesque now heads up all children’s and adult imprints at Disney. This spring, Levesque was promoted from director of editorial for Hyperion Avenue to deputy publisher for Disney Publishing Group, where she also oversees both Hyperion Kids and National Geographic Adult. A Whole New World In email responses to PW, Agurto repeatedly referred to Disney as the number one children’s publishing brand. Still, as far as original trade publishing goes, the company appears to be slipping. Disney doesn’t disclose financial information on publishing, but a look at PW bestseller lists indicates that the company has had a diminishing presence on the children’s side. In 2023, Disney had 14 titles reach PW’s children’s frontlist fiction list, keeping the company on the charts for 68 weeks; last year, that number fell to seven titles across 57 weeks last year. In 2019, Disney stayed on the same list for 81 weeks, with 19 books. Disney's most reliably bestselling author to date is Rick Riordan, through his Percy Jackson series and Rick Riordan Presents imprint. Riordan's two frontlist Jackson titles in 2024 sold approximately 450,000 print copies combined, according to Circana BookScan. But backlist sales across the company have softened in recent years—no doubt due in part to the 1,100 children’s titles it sold to HBG in 2020. The future of several Disney children’s imprints also appears uncertain. In October 2023, the company announced the launch of Kugali Ink, a collaboration with pan-African entertainment company Kugali designed to celebrate African voices. Its first two graphic novels, Akanni and Runeless, are due out this year, but neither title has yet been listed on Amazon, and PW has not received galleys for review. In a previous release announcing a number of promotions, Disney said that Rachel Stark had been promoted to senior editor at Hyperion, and that they would serve as lead editor for Kugali Ink. In Stark’s own note in the announcement, they stressed that they acquire and edit middle grade and young adult novels and graphic novels, quipping that this wasn’t a new role and observing that “agents often seem to believe I only acquire graphic novels.” A Disney spokesperson declined to comment on Kugali, adding that the company had no additional information to share about the status of its Melissa de la Cruz Studio and Freedom Fire imprints. On the adult side, however, things seem a bit more stable. With Levesque’s promotion, Adam Wilson, previously executive editor for Hyperion Avenue, was named editorial director, and now oversees the acquisition of adult fiction and nonfiction as well as the creation of original adult IP. Among his focuses, per Disney’s promotion announcement, are the oversight of nonfiction projects by individuals with a connection to other Disney projects and collaborations with a number of other Disney-owned groups—including ABC, ESPN, FX, Hulu, and Marvel—on both fiction and nonfiction book initiatives. In her email to PW, Agurto doubled down on Disney’s commitment to adult nonfiction publishing. “We continue to support nonfiction through both our vertical and licensees,” she wrote, pointing to the nonfiction published under Andscape, Hyperion, and National Geographic Adult. Forthcoming titles from those imprints include memoirs from actor and sports broadcaster Jayne Kennedy and the late film producer Jon Landau (Avatar; Titanic). Since its 2021 launch, Hyperion Avenue has also added the Marvel Crime line, which publishes books by bestselling crime and mystery authors featuring Marvel’s characters; the imprint’s first title, Breaking the Dark: A Jessica Jones Marvel Crime Novel, hit shelves last year. Overall, Hyperion Avenue saw two titles—A Confident Cook and Tangled Up in You—hit the PW adult bestseller lists in 2024, each staying for one week. For years, especially when synergy was the business-world strategy of the moment, top executives at Disney took different approaches on how to best fit book publishing into the corporation. But Disney is now a $91 billion conglomerate, with interests that range from cruise ships to streaming services to ESPN to theme parks. Given the scope of its businesses and the scale of recent changes, many industry insiders have been left wondering what, exactly, the current plan for books is inside the Magic Kingdom. Loading...

Title: Sodium azide mutagenesis induces a unique pattern of mutations
URL: https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1011634
Time Published: 2025-06-03T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
The nature and effect of mutations are of fundamental importance to the evolutionary process. The generation of mutations with mutagens has also played important roles in genetics. Applications of mutagens include dissecting the genetic basis of trait variation, inducing desirable traits in crops, and understanding the nature of genetic load. Previous studies of sodium azide-induced mutations have reported single nucleotide variants (SNVs) found in individual genes. To characterize the nature of mutations induced by sodium azide, we analyze whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 11 barley lines derived from sodium azide mutagenesis, where all lines were selected for diminution of plant fitness owing to induced mutations. We contrast observed mutagen-induced variants with those found in standing variation in WGS of 13 barley landraces. Here, we report indels that are two orders of magnitude more abundant than expected based on nominal mutation rates. We found induced SNVs are very specific, with C → T changes occurring in a context followed by another C on the same strand (or the reverse complement). The codons most affected by the mutagen include the sodium azide-specific CC motif (or the reverse complement), resulting in a handful of amino acid changes and few stop codons. The specific nature of induced mutations suggests that mutagens could be chosen based on experimental goals. Sodium azide would not be ideal for gene knockouts but will create many missense mutations with more subtle effects on protein function. Sodium azide is frequently used as a mutagen for experimental studies in plants. It induces primarily C → T changes. We find that these most often occur when a cytosine (C) is followed by another cytosine. In coding sequence, this results in a limited yet distinct set of amino acid alterations that differ from natural variants in barley. Notably, harmful mutations prevalent in sodium azide-treated samples include glycine to aspartic acid and proline to serine, while untreated landraces exhibit distinct sets of putatively harmful changes. The mutated lines demonstrate an average yield reduction of 37.7% due to induced single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions/deletions (indels), which disrupt numerous coding variants. Although detecting putative deleterious mutations is straightforward, discerning the individual impact of these variants remains complex. However, advancements in understanding the context of these mutations may facilitate the training of machine-learning models to predict and rank their effects, ultimately benefiting plant and animal breeding and research on complex human diseases. The findings suggest that the occurrence of specific mutations induced by chemical mutagens can be anticipated, enhancing our comprehension of mutagen-induced genetic diversity and its phenotypic implications.

Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. Mutagens can quickly generate novel, heritable genetic variation for identifying gene function when naturally occurring variation will not suffice. Sodium azide (NaN3), ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), and fast neutron (FN) radiation have been the most commonly used mutagens in plants. Sodium azide and EMS are chemical mutagens expected to cause point mutations [1]. FN is known for generating many large structural variants and small indels (especially deletions) that generate frameshifts that disrupt gene function [2,3]. Mutagenizing agents have been used in many species to create knockouts or knockdowns of individual genes to understand gene function [4]. Despite decades of active use [5,6] and growing interest in the applications of mutagenesis [7,8], the characterization of the nature of the mutations generated has been limited [9]. More generally, the number of studies examining the effects of mutagens at the nucleotide sequence level is limited [1,3,10,11]. The nature and context in which mutations occur are essential determinants of their likely functional impact [12,13]. Recently reported efforts to employ sodium azide mutagenesis on a massive scale (500,000 mutated lines) clarify the need for an improved understanding of the number and types of mutations likely to be generated [7]. We can characterize induced mutations by comparing newly generated (de novo) mutations to variants occurring naturally in untreated lines. However, there are essential considerations to minimize false positives when distinguishing between induced mutations and existing variants. One challenge with identifying induced de novo changes is that the mutations are always a mixture of induced de novo and spontaneously occurring mutations [13]. The experimental design necessary to study induced mutations in plant populations requires multiple generations of seed bulking before the mutagenesis treatment and several generations in which new mutations are made homozygous in inbred lines; thus, multiple generations in which new spontaneous variants can arise [3]. Mutagenesis experiments often use multiple generations of self-fertilization to ensure that mutations are meiotically heritable [14]. Mutagen dosage also affects the nature of observable mutations, with an effective dosage of mutagens defined by the LD50, or lethal dose for 50% of the treated sample, which results in the death of half the individuals. Of course, this creates significant attrition due to lethal mutations, resulting in some mutations or combinations that cannot be observed directly. Observable mutations are less damaging, allowing the plant to survive and reproduce. New mutations, whether induced or naturally occurring, are more likely to be harmful than segregating variants subject to generations of natural (purifying) selection. More potentially harmful changes are observed among newer mutations in very deep resequencing panels [15] and induced mutations [3]. Newer mutations tend to include more changes of large effect, including nonsynonymous variants, changes in start and stop codons, intron splicing variants, and frameshifts [16,17]. Comparative approaches using phylogenetic constraint have been used for decades to predict which mutations are more likely to harm the organism [18,19]. More recent studies of induced mutations in Arabidopsis thaliana suggest that these approaches accurately identify phenotype-changing variants and are more likely to have a major effect on organismal fitness [20]. Thus, predicting the harmfulness of mutations has the potential to identify the nature of variants most likely to impact organismal fitness or yield in crops [21–23]. In barley, sodium azide primarily generates cytosine-to-thymine changes [24]. More recent studies have determined that mutagens create unique suites of mutations and that these mutations typically occur in a specific, immediate nucleotide context [1,13]. This observation is important because the nature of mutations, particularly when they occur predominantly in the presence of flanking motifs, can determine their relative effect. For example, C → T transitions, particularly in specific local sequence contexts, may limit the potential for mutagens to generate premature stop codons, even when the reverse complement of a mutation motif is considered. [24] identified sodium azide mutations in the barley Ant18 gene, finding that A.T → G.C base-pair transitions were most frequently generated. However, resequencing this single barley gene does not capture the effects of sodium azide at the whole-genome scale. In the present study, we examine sodium azide-induced mutations in 11 mutagenized lines of Morex, the barley variety used as the primary reference genome [25]. We also generated whole-genome sequence for a sample of the Morex seed stock used for mutagenesis. In addition to single nucleotide changes, we find evidence of sequence insertions and deletions (indels) private to each mutagenized line. Mutations identified in sodium azide-treated lines were compared to variants in 13 barley landrace samples subject to whole-genome sequencing. To understand the nature of mutations induced by sodium azide, we address the following questions: 1) What is the nature of the variants induced by the mutagen? More specifically, does sodium azide tend to generate SNPs, indels, or other types of structural variants? 2) What is the observed mutation rate in sodium azide-treated samples in barley? 3) Do induced variants differ in type or predicted effect from variants occurring in untreated individuals? and 4) Is a greater number of harmful mutations associated with a reduction in yield in barley? Data collected and analyzed in the present study includes three distinct datasets. First, we used multiple resequencing datasets to identify differences in our Morex samples and the Morex reference genome. This included new Illumina paired-end data with 10X Genomics linked reads, as well as both new and previously published Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and published Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) sequence [25] (Tables 1 and S1). A second data set included lines treated with sodium azide that were resequenced with Illumina paired-end data; for a subset of these lines also generated linked reads and ONT DNA sequencing data (S1 Table). We used this data to identify single nucleotide and structural variant differences between our Morex line published Morex_v3 reference genome [25]. We then identified mutations in lines subject to mutagenesis. For contrast between variants in mutagen-treated lines and naturally occurring variants, we used Illumina paired-end data to identify spontaneous variants in 13 barley landraces. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011634.g001 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011634.t001 A major challenge in isolating de novo variants induced by the mutagen treatment is the need to distinguish between variants present in the mutagenized seed stock (i.e., Morex) and those that arise during mutagenesis. Heterogeneity, genetic variation within an inbred cultivar or variety, can contribute large numbers of variants [26] that are not due to the mutagen. Experimental contamination through unintended hybridization [3,27] can also contribute to large numbers of variants (S1 Fig). Mutagen-induced variants are expected to be relatively rare, requiring filtering of the variants that account for: (1) differences between the parental line used for mutagenesis and the reference genome, (2) uncallable regions (see Materials & Methods) that include genomic regions with unknown nucleotide state in the reference, or the regions where sequence reads do not align uniquely, and (3) heterogeneity among lines (S2 and S3 Figs). We identified callable portions of the genome that were 820 Mb and 817 Mb (the latter excludes low complexity sequence) relative to the 4.2 Gb genome size for Morex_v3 [25]. Callable regions capture 88% of high-confidence (HC) genes (31,625 HC genes out of 35,827 total HC genes) in the Morex_v3 reference genome. No individuals in our experiment show an excess of variants, runs of variants, or high heterozygosity consistent with recent hybridization [27]. Differences between the Morex_v3 reference genome and our Morex sample are mutations that have arisen in individual seed stocks, errors in the reference assembly, or errors in variant calling. To address these issues, we generated 10X Genomics-based resequencing with 46x and an ONT data set with 5x average mapped read coverage (S1 Table). We identified 52,596 SNPs, 8,203 1-bp indels (insertions and deletions), 3,182 indels ranging in size from 2-204 bp, and 53 deletions ranging from 41 bp - 60 Kbp that survived rigorous filtering (S2 and S3 Figs). Filtered ONT variant calls include 68 insertions and 42 deletions. Using published ONT (at 85x coverage) and PacBio data (at 27x coverage) sampled from 100 seedlings [25] (Table 1) that were incorporated in the Morex_v3 assembly, we detected an additional 178 insertions and 93 deletions that were excluded from callable regions. Reference-based read mapping, variant calling in GATK [17,28,29], and filtering of the 11 M5 mutagenized lines identified 23,339 SNVs (Single Nucleotide Variants) with an observed transition to transversion ratio (Ts/Tv) = 5.24. This compares to a ratio of Ts/Tv = 1.7 previously reported based on resequencing of naturally occurring variants in barley [17]. Among mutagenized lines, we also identified 5,376 smaller indels ranging in size from 1 - 296 bp for 28,715 variants potentially induced by the mutagen (Fig 1A). Here, we use SNV (Single Nucleotide Variants) to identify variants generated during mutagenesis and SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) to identify variants segregating in the non-mutagenized population. Each variant is private to a mutagenized plant (i.e., occurs in only a single individual). There was an average of 2,122 SNVs and 489 indels per mutated sample, with more indels identified in 10X Genomics samples utilizing linked reads (Fig 1B and Table 2). Those numbers are much higher (17x and 139x) than estimates of the average number of mutations that would spontaneously arise in the absence of a single-generation of sodium azide treatment. Those estimates were calculated as below (see Materials & Methods). Using the mean nucleotide substitution rate estimate of 6.5 x 10-9 base substitutions per site per generation from [30] and accounting for our experimental design, we expect ~124 SNVs per individual in the 4.2 Gbp genome. For indels, we expect ~3.5 indels per individual to arise without the mutagen treatment based on an average indel mutation rate of 0.45 x 10-9 for 1–3 bp indels and 0.5 x 10-9 for >3 bp indels [30]. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011634.t002 The ONT sequence and 10X Genomics linked reads of the same three mutagenized lines improved the detection of larger structural variants (SVs). No inversions passed the filtering criteria, and a set of high-quality duplications could not be identified; thus, structural variant calling focused on insertions and deletions. The SVs detected in the 10X Genomics data set included 52 deletions ranging from 41 bp to 60 Kbp (S4 Fig). ONT reads for three samples (S1 Table) were generated to validate the larger structural variants identified in the 10X Genomics data. The average ONT mapped read coverage was 3.4x (S1 Table). A total of 86 insertions (36–4,786 bp) and 26 deletions (36–300 bp) were called by Sniffles2; 8 insertions (21–172 bp) and 6 deletions (16–116 bp) were called by cuteSV (S4 and S5 Figs). These ONT calls provided direct sequence read-based confirmation of two larger deletion calls that were also called based on the 10X Genomics data set. For comparison, we generated whole-genome resequencing of 13 barley landraces [31]. Average coverage ranged from 41 - 93x (S1 Table), and after variant calling and quality filtering, we identified a total of 6.7 million SNPs with Ts/Tv = 1.74 and 849,618 indels ranging in size from 1 - 388 bp. Out of the 6,746,637 SNPs, 2,277,853 SNPs were categorized as rare (i.e., non-reference allele count of two or less, the allele was identified in one or two genotypes) with Ts/Tv = 1.71 and 4,468,784 were common (i.e., non-reference allele count of three or higher) with Ts/Tv = 1.76 (Fig 1A). Rare variants were compared to de novo variants in the treated lines because they have experienced fewer generations of selection, and their mutational spectrum is likely more similar to that in treated lines. SNPs in untreated samples are primarily transitions, particularly C → T* (Fig 2), where the notation C → T* includes the reverse complement G → A. Partitioning variants in the untreated samples into “rare” or “common” had a limited effect on the proportion of variants among each class, with a slight skew of rare variants to more C → T* transitions and fewer A → G*. Variants in sodium azide-treated lines were dominated by C → T* transitions, which comprised 79.1% of all SNVs in the mutagenized lines (Fig 2). Each bin includes the reverse complement. For example, the C → T* bin also includes G → A changes. Each bin includes the reverse complement. For example, the C → T* bin also includes G → A changes. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011634.g002 Single base pair changes dominate insertion and deletion variants, particularly in sodium-azide treated lines, constituting 28.3% of insertions and 36.4% of deletions (Fig 3). The pattern of indels in treated lines is similar to that in rare and common variants in standing variation. Notable differences include more 1- and 2-bp deletions and 1-bp insertions in treated lines (Fig 3). The 53 larger deletions (41 bp - 60 Kbp) called in the 10X Genomics data set represent roughly 1.7% of all 3,135 deletions in the mutated lines. Linked and long read sequencing was not possible for the landrace lines, precluding a direct comparison. Insertions are shown as positive values and deletions are shown as negative values. Only variants with lengths <20 bp are shown here. Insertions are shown as positive values and deletions are shown as negative values. Only variants with lengths <20 bp are shown here. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011634.g003 In mutated samples, 9.7% of SNVs and 8.9% of indels occur in genic regions (S6 Fig). The percentage of variants in genic regions is lower in untreated lines for rare and common variants. Rare variants had 6.5% SNPs and 1.7% indels occurring in genic regions and are more directly comparable with mutated sample SNVs and indels. Variant Effect Predictor (VeP) [32] identified most sodium azide-induced variants as occurring in intergenic regions or genomic regions up or downstream of genes. A larger proportion of variants were found in intergenic regions among induced variants than in untreated lines. Fewer sodium azide-induced SNVs and indels were adjacent to genes (S7 and S8 Figs). Sodium azide-treated lines have a slightly higher proportion of missense variants (3.86%) than untreated lines (2.19% Rare, 2.32% Common), but this effect is small. Slight increases in the proportion of start-stop-related changes (0.2% Mutated, 0.09% Rare, and 0.07% Common) and splice donor and acceptor sites are also observed (0.09% Mutated, 0.01% Rare, and 0.01% Common). However, these variants are considered the most potentially damaging based on VeP categorization (S7 and S8 Figs). Larger deletion variants (41 bp - 60 Kbp) detected among the three lines with linked reads disrupt a genic region in 11.3% of cases (6 out of 53 total). On average, sodium azide-treated lines include 78.6 nonsynonymous SNVs per sample, with 865 nonsynonymous SNVs identified among the 11 mutated lines (S9 Fig). Estimates of putative variant effects based on phylogenetic constraints [20] were used to identify potentially damaging nonsynonymous variants among primary transcripts in the barley genome. This analysis includes missense variants (a change in amino acid), start lost, stop gained, and stop lost variants based on the Sequence Ontology definition of nonsynonymous changes [33]. For the 11 mutated lines, 611 nonsynonymous mutations in primary transcripts were tested for phylogenetic constraint relative to 72 other angiosperms to identify potentially universally harmful mutations. Among the successfully annotated mutations, 155 (35.9%) were annotated as “harmful” (i.e., putatively deleterious), while the remaining 277 (64.1%) were identified as “tolerated.” This value compares to 9,716 “rare” nonsynonymous variants tested in 13 barley landraces, where 1,633 (13.2%) are identified as “harmful” and 10,693 (86.8%) as tolerated. For “common nonsynonymous variants, 14,537 were tested, where 23,506 (7%) are “harmful,” and 311,121 (93%) are tolerated. An average of 14.1 (± 6.46) deleterious SNVs were identified per mutagenized sample (S10 Fig). Given that these changes at conserved coding positions are frequently phenotype-changing [20], this suggests roughly 14 disrupted SNVs per individual treated line. The ratio of nonsynonymous SNVs (nSNV) to synonymous SNVs (sSNV) in mutated lines is 1.8:1. In comparison, the ratio of nSNVs:sSNVs in rare and common SNP categories is 1.36:1 and 1.22:1, respectively. The proportion of nSNVs inferred to be deleterious was 17.9% in treated lines versus nSNPs at 3.2% in rare and 4.1% in common categories. To standardize results among samples, we identified the number of harmful mutations per codon in 10 Mbp windows. The proportion of dSNPs per codon was lower near the centromeres for rare and common SNPs in the landraces (S11-S13 Figs). Biochemical interactions between mutagenic compounds and DNA produce SNVs in specific nucleotide contexts [13]. We used the program Mutation Motif [9] for all SNVs to examine this effect in sodium azide-treated barley lines. The predominant mutation types in both treated and untreated lines are C → T* changes. In sodium azide-treated lines, the cytosine that changes to thymine is frequently followed by another cytosine, creating a CC context of mutation on the forward strand (Fig 4). To our knowledge, there have not been previous studies on the preferential context of sodium azide mutations. There are highly significant differences between sodium azide-induced variants and variants spontaneously originating in the genome (S2 Table). In untreated lines, the mutated cytosine is generally followed by guanine at the + 1 or +2 site (downstream) from the C, thus resulting in a CG or potentially CGG context in which mutations occur. In the complete 4.2 Gb Morex_v3 genome assembly, the CC, CG (the two bp motif for CpG changes), and CGG motifs occur ~228 million, ~ 154 million, and ~40 million times, respectively. In the 820 Mb region in which unique single nucleotide variants could be called, CC occurs ~48 million times, CG occurs ~35 million times, and CGG motifs occur ~9 million times. This suggests that, on average, a single generation of sodium azide treatment resulted in the mutation of 0.013% of CC sites at which unique mutations could be detected. The CC and CG motifs constitute 5.8% and 4.3% of all two nucleotide combinations in the 820 Mb callable regions, and the CGG motif constitutes 1.1% of three nucleotide combinations. In contrast, AA and TT motifs are the most frequent two nucleotide motifs, making up 8.1%. Position 0 indices where the C → T change occurred. The relative height of the letters indicates their relative entropy (RE), with a higher RE indicating a position has a greater influence on the mutation. Upright letters indicate overrepresented bases, whereas upside-down letters indicate underrepresented bases at positions neighboring position 0. The null expectation (RE of zero) is based on randomly sampling a nearby location with the same starting base (e.g., for a C → T mutation, a random choice of a position with a C is selected. Position 0 indices where the C → T change occurred. The relative height of the letters indicates their relative entropy (RE), with a higher RE indicating a position has a greater influence on the mutation. Upright letters indicate overrepresented bases, whereas upside-down letters indicate underrepresented bases at positions neighboring position 0. The null expectation (RE of zero) is based on randomly sampling a nearby location with the same starting base (e.g., for a C → T mutation, a random choice of a position with a C is selected. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011634.g004 Amino acid changes identified in sodium azide-treated lines are dominated by those that include the CC or (reverse complement) GG motif (S14 Fig). Glycine to aspartic acid, proline to serine, and alanine to threonine are the three most abundant amino acid changes in SNVs identified as harmful (i.e., deleterious) (Table 3 and S15 Fig). The top four changes in tolerated SNVs (tSNVs) in mutagenized samples are similar to those annotated as harmful; tolerated amino acid changes include alanine to threonine, alanine to valine, glycine to aspartic acid, and proline to serine (Table 3). This contrasts with amino acid changes induced by rare and common variants in standing variation, where transitions associated with CpG are more abundant. For rare and common dSNPs, alanine-to-threonine and alanine-to-valine changes appear at the highest frequencies. The arginine-to-cysteine amino acid change had the third highest frequency in the common dSNPs class and frequently annotates as deleterious. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011634.t003 A total of 25 mutagenized barley lines self-fertilized for five to seven generations (M5:7) were used for yield testing at one location in the first year (St. Paul, MN) and three locations in Minnesota (Crookston, Lamberton, and St. Paul) in years 2 and 3. Yield testing was performed in the presence of 5–8 check lines (see Materials and Methods) and the original Morex line untreated with the mutagen. Data for heading days after planting (DAP) and plant height were also collected. After spatial adjustment for variation across plots, the average yield for each line was calculated for all years combined. As expected, most mutagenized lines had lower grain yields than the Morex W2017 parental line, with six mutagenized lines yielding roughly the same or slightly higher than the parental line (Fig 5). M29 is among the three lowest-yielding lines and is the only mutagenized line with a visibly distinct phenotype, described as onion-like, short-stature, and very compact (S16 Fig). Mutagenized lines tend to have diminished yield relative to Morex, though some line-by-year combinations slightly exceeded the yield in Morex and some checks (S17 Fig). The average diminution in yield across years and lines for the mutagenized lines was 32.8% relative to the Morex W2017 parent. The heading DAP in mutagenized lines increased by 6.2%, and height was reduced by 15% compared to the Morex W2017 parent line. To determine if observed damaging mutations impacted yield, we compared the relative order of yield to the number of damaging mutations per line. We found a slightly negative but nonsignificant correlation of -0.28 (P = 0.4) between the number of harmful variants and yield (S3 Table). Most mutagenized lines had lower variance across replicates than the check lines. This is likely due to the experimental design with seeds originating from plants that can be traced through single-seed descent following the mutagen treatment, whereas check lines derive from more heterogeneous seed stocks.

It has been frequently used for inducing variants in barley [24,34], including recent reports of extremely large-scale experiments involving the characterization of hundreds of thousands of individual plants [7]. Other mutagens used historically have included X-rays, neutrons, ethylene imine, sulfonates, other chemical mutagens, and various combinations of mutagens [detailed in 35]. However, most studies have focused on the phenotypic effects of mutagenesis [4,36,37] or changes induced at individual genes [24]. The genome-level effects of the mutagen have rarely been examined. Consistent with a prior single gene resequencing study, we find that C → T* transitions dominate induced mutations [7,24,38] (Fig 2). A similar pattern of nucleotide change has been found for ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) induced mutation [10,39]. N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) induced mutations in mice produce primarily A → G* or A → T* mutations [13]. In contrast, C → T* transitions predominate among the variants observed after fast neutron treatment, but with less enrichment relative to other SNVs [3,10]. Sodium azide appears to generate single nucleotide variants primarily. We identify an average of 2,122 SNVs per mutagenized line. This is an ~ 88-fold increase in SNVs compared to expectations in the absence of a single-generation sodium azide treatment (see Materials and Methods for equations 1–6). Induced indels of all sizes are less abundant (Figs 1 and 3) but occur at ~130–140 fold higher rate than nominal mutation rates. The observation of higher indel rates derives from the comparison of data from multiple sequencing platforms, including linked-reads and long-read sequencing, with an average of 489 indels per line in mutagenized M5 lines. The mutations present in M5 lines are necessarily a mixture of induced mutations and mutations that arose spontaneously during line maintenance [13]. However, based on mutation accumulation resequencing studies in Arabidopsis thaliana, the 1–3 bp mutation rate was estimated as an average of 0.45 x 10-9 indels per site per generation, and the large deletions (>3 bp) mutation rate was estimated as 0.5 x 10-9 [30]. In the 820 Mb portion of the barley genome, where variants can be called unambiguously, we expect ~3.5 indels per individual to arise naturally without mutagenesis treatment over the course of the experiment (see Methods for equations 1–6). In the 4.2 Gbp barley genome, we would expect ~18 indels per individual (Fig 1B). This is a ~ 130–140-fold increase in the indel mutation rate of treated lines to an average of 5.13 x 10-7 indels per site per generation. Most sodium azide-induced mutations occur in a specific nucleotide sequence context, as C → T* changes in a CC mutation motif (Fig 4) or the reverse complement. This results in a relatively small number of amino acid changes that predominate among induced mutations. [10] describe similar results for mutations found after EMS or EMS/ENU treatment, where the most common changes within codons produce only a fraction of all possible amino acid changes. In a similar manner, sodium azide-induced amino acid changes are very distinct from most amino acid changes segregating in barley. The amino acid changes that annotate as harmful and predominate in the mutagenized samples are glycine to aspartic acid, proline to serine, and alanine to threonine. In comparison, the top three amino acid changes annotated as harmful and segregating in the untreated barley landraces include alanine to threonine, alanine to valine, and arginine to cysteine. For projects seeking to induce novel changes, for example, in disease resistance genes or genes associated with stress tolerance, sodium azide will induce many coding changes that are rarely observed among standing variation. Resequencing of individual genes identified many sodium azide-induced SNVs in barley [24]. Induced indels and SVs were not previously reported but would be difficult to identify with Sanger sequencing. Indeed, sequencing technology continues to present a limitation. Many of the SVs identified here were identified by linked reads (in two cases verified by ONT long reads) but could not be identified by Illumina paired-end reads alone. Regarding relative effect, indels and SVs identified with linked reads and verified with ONT result in six disruptive mutations that either induce a frameshift or eliminate a portion of a coding gene. This results in an average of two structural disruptions of genes per individual instead of an average of 33.4 per individual due to 1–3 bp nucleotide sequence-level changes. Our mutated lines average a 37.7% reduction in yield relative to their non-mutated parental Morex line. This reduction in yield can be attributed to an average of 14.1 induced SNVs and 37.3 indels per line. The typical line has an average of 249.1 disruptions of coding variants, including SNVs and indels (S6 Fig). The approach used in this study identified a finite number of deleterious (i.e., harmful) mutations induced by sodium azide. It was successful at creating lines that had lower yield than the untreated Morex parent line in the experiment. The reduction in fitness (using yield as a proxy for fitness) following the mutagen treatment was expected, given that most new amino-acid-changing mutations that impact fitness will be deleterious [16,40]. In practical applications, deleterious variants are relatively easy to detect, which makes it possible to select against them or eliminate them via targeted replacement of individual variants [22,23,41,42]. However, it is still challenging to identify the effects of individual deleterious variants. With lines that have reduced yield and a better understanding of the nature of changes generated by sodium azide and the sequence contexts in which they occur, there is the possibility of training machine-learning models to predict which variants contribute to harmful phenotypic change [43,44]. Then, quantify the effect size of each harmful variant into a ranked list and combine the predictions with existing genomic prediction approaches to benefit plant and animal breeding programs [45] and the study of complex human diseases. All of these applications require a means to identify the most harmful variants. Barley from a Morex seed stock was treated with sodium azide following the protocol in [46]. Morex is a 6-row malting barley variety used as the primary reference genome [25]. Morex was chosen for these experiments to facilitate the identification and isolation of de novo variants because the reference makes it easier to distinguish between variants that are different between our parent sample and the reference genome versus variants that arose from the mutagen. The Morex line in this experiment traces back to the parent seed stock used to generate the Steptoe x Morex doubled haploid barley mapping population [47]. To generate sufficient Morex seeds for sodium azide mutagenesis, 120 seeds were planted from a single Morex plant (S1 Fig). Next, 200 seeds from the resulting bulk of seeds were planted; this was repeated one more time. A portion of the seeds was treated with sodium azide (1 mM NaN3) following the [46] protocol; the remaining portion of untreated Morex seeds was planted for another round of seed bulking and then planted to collect leaf tissue for sequencing (S1 Fig). After mutagenesis, the resulting mutagenized seeds were grown to maturity and harvested, forming the M1 generation. These individuals then underwent single-seed descent until M5. Estimates for the expected number of spontaneous mutations occurring without mutagen treatment were calculated using the experimental design for seven generations of self-fertilization (S1 Fig) and rate estimates from [30]. The mutation rates used for SNPs was and for 1–3 bp indels was . For the 820 Mbp (820,594,305 bp) callable regions, a diploid genome size of 1,641,188,610 bp was used. For estimates of the 4.2 Gbp (4,225,605,719 bp) genome size [25], a diploid genome size of 8,451,211,438 bp was used. Each generation, new mutations appear in the heterozygous state, and the number of new heterozygous mutations (Nhet) is given by The experimental design involved multiple generations of selfing, meaning de novo mutations from previous generations are being lost or fixed over time. In each generation, heterozygous mutations are inherited (Ihet) and are represented by where x is the current generation. Similarly, each generation homozygous mutations are inherited (Ihom) and are represented by The number of heterozygous and homozygous spontaneous mutations accumulated by generation seven in our experimental design is given by and is used as our estimated number of spontaneous mutations that would have been present without mutagen treatment. Twenty-five M5:7 mutated lines and F1:2 W2017 Morex parent line were evaluated in yield trials with two replicates at one location (St. Paul, MN) in 2020 and three locations in Minnesota (Crookston, Lamberton, and St. Paul) in 2021 and 2022. Lines were grown in a randomized complete block design. Phenotypic data on grain yield, heading days after planting (DAP), height, and lodging were collected. Check varieties were used to adjust for spatial variation across trial plots for traits with a continuous scale (yield, heading DAP, and height). Spatial adjustments were performed using the R package mvngGrAd [48]. Check lines were chosen because of well-qualified field performance and included Conlon, FEG141–20, Lacey, ND20448, ND26104, ND_Genesis, Pinnacle, and Rasmusson. We generated whole-genome sequencing in 25 barley (Hordeum vulgare ssp. vulgare) accessions: the parent of the mutagenized lines (W2017 Morex), 11 mutagenized lines, and 13 barley landraces [31] for comparative analyses (Tables 1 and S1). High molecular weight genomic DNA was extracted from 4-6 week-old leaf tissue collected on ice using the Cytiva Nucleon PhytoPure kit for the mutagenized lines. We sequenced three of the 11 M5 mutagenized lines (M01, M20, and M29) and the W2017 Morex line using the 10X Genomics linked read library preparation followed by Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing with 150-bp paired-end technology to a target depth of 40x. For the remaining eight M5 mutagenized lines (M02, M11, M14, M28, M35, M36, M39, and M41), libraries were prepared using the Illumina DNA Prep followed by Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing with 150-bp paired-end technology to a target depth of 16x. Sequences for the 13 landraces were generated using the Illumina TruSeq DNA Nano Prep followed by Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing with 150-bp paired-end technology to a target depth of 40x. We used Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) to sequence W2017 Morex and three of the 11 M5 mutagenized lines (M01, M20, and M29, see Tables 1 and S1). This data was collected to provide read-level confirmation of SVs indicated by the Illumina short-read resequencing. For sample M01, following the ONT protocol, a high molecular weight gDNA extraction was performed using the Qiagen Genomic-tip kit (10262) with Carlson Lysis buffer (10450002–1). High molecular weight gDNA extractions for samples M20 and M29 were generated using the NucleoBond HMW DNA kit (740160.20) from Takara Bio USA. Size selection was performed using Circulomics SRE buffer, and DNA was quantified using the Qubit assay. The libraries were prepared with 400 ng of gDNA using the Rapid Sequencing Kit (SQK-RAD004) following the protocol version RSE_9046_v1_revT_14Aug2019. The library was primed using the flow cell priming kit (EXP-FLP002), then 400 ng of the library was loaded onto an R9.4.1 flow cell (FLO-MIN106D). M01 was run for 72 hours on a MinION Mk1C (MIN-101C). We found the flow cells were no longer collecting new data after 24 hours and modified the run for the remaining two samples. For M20 and M29, 400 ng of the library was loaded onto an R9.4.1 flow cell, run for 12 hours, and then paused. At this point, the pores were cleared using the flow cell wash kit (EXP-WSH004), then 400 ng of additional library was loaded and run for another 12 hours before the run was paused. Again, pores were cleared with the flow cell wash kit, then 400 ng of an additional library was loaded. The flow cell was run for an additional 24–30 hours. Three reactions were run for a single flow cell; a single sample with two washes ran for a total of 48–56 hours. This approach produced the highest data output for our samples. This process was repeated until each mutagenized line was sequenced to a target depth of 2-3x (S1 Table). Basecalling was performed using Guppy v5.0.12 + eb1a981 (for all runs except one) and Guppy v5.0.17 + 99baa5b (for one M01 run #3) using the default setting on the MinION Mk1C. Read alignment and variant calling for the eight mutagenized and 13 landrace WGS lines were processed using the sequence_handling workflow (https://github.com/MorrellLAB/sequence_handling), which integrates publicly available software into a series of bash scripts [49]. The configuration files, which identify software versions and parameters, and scripts are available in the GitHub repositories https://github.com/MorrellLAB/hybrid_barley and https://github.com/MorrellLAB/Barley_Mutated. Reads were aligned against the third version of the barley Morex reference genome (Morex_v3) [25] with parameters adjusted to account for the level of nucleotide diversity in barley. Variants were called as part of a larger set of samples and followed the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) best practices recommendations [28,29]. SNPs underwent GATK VariantRecalibrator with the following as input: filtered variants and SNPs from genotyping assays, which include 2,975 BOPA SNPs [50], 7,541 9K SNPs [51], and 41,813 50K SNPs [52]. Only polymorphic and biallelic SNPs were included. Additional SNP filtering criteria include allele balance [53,54] deviation of 0.1, proportion heterozygous genotypes at a site > 0.1, per sample minimum DP < 5, per sample maximum DP > 158, proportion missing genotypes at a site > 0.30, QUAL < 30, and GQ < 9. SNPs identified in a barley Sanger resequencing dataset [55,56] were used for validation. Indels were filtered following GATK’s Best Practices Guidelines for hard filtering since we did not have enough truth and training datasets to run indels through VariantRecalibrator. All filtering criteria are detailed in the scripts available in the GitHub repository https://github.com/MorrellLAB/Barley_Mutated. For the four 10X Genomics samples (W2017 Morex and three mutagenized lines, see S1 Table), reads were aligned to the Morex v3 reference genome, and variants were called with the 10X Genomics software, Long Ranger v2.2.2. The Long Ranger pipeline processes the Chromium-prepared sequencing samples. Variants were filtered based on filters generated by Long Ranger, which include: 10X_QUAL_FILTER, 10X_ALLELE_FRACTION_FILTER, 10X_PHASING_INCONSISTENT, 10X_HOMOPOLYMER_UNPHASED_INSERTION, 10X_RESCUED_MOLECULE_HIGH_DIVERSITY, and LOWQ. SNPs and 1-bp indels were filtered to sites with per sample DP between 5 and 78 and an allele balance deviation of +/- 0.2 (from the expected 0.5) for heterozygous genotypes. For the ONT data of W2017 Morex, M01, M20, and M29, read quality and summary statistics were generated with NanoPlot v1.38.1 and pycoQC [57]. Adapters were trimmed with Porechop v0.2.4 [58]. Reads were then aligned to the barley Morex v3 reference genome using Minimap2 v2.17 [59] with parameters recommended for ONT sequence reads. The resulting SAM files were then realigned using a modified version of the Vulcan pipeline [60] (customized version, https://gitlab.com/ChaochihL/vulcan), which utilizes NGMLR [61] for read realignment, converted to BAM format, and sorted using Samtools v1.9 [62]. Structural variants were then called using Sniffles v2.0.3 [61,63]. We also used a publicly available Morex individual sequenced with PacBio CCS reads (BioProject PRJEB40587, ERR numbers ERR4659245-ERR4659249) [25]. We used HiFiAdapterFilt [64] to filter adapters. Reads were aligned using Minimap2 v2.17 [59] using parameters recommended for PacBio sequence reads. Similar to the ONT data, the resulting SAM files were realigned using a modified version of the Vulcan pipeline [60] (customized version, https://gitlab.com/ChaochihL/vulcan), converted to BAM format, and sorted using Samtools v1.9 [62]. Structural variants were called used Sniffles v2.0.3 [61,63]. For all datasets in this study, mapped coverage was estimated using Mosdepth v0.3.1 [65]. All mapping parameters and filtering criteria are detailed in scripts available in the GitHub repository (https://github.com/MorrellLAB/Barley_Mutated). To identify de novo variants induced by the mutagen, we generated a list of regions where variants were called in Morex-sample2 (W2017 Morex); these are differences between the Morex parent in this study and the Morex reference genome. Variants called in the [25] Morex ONT and PacBio data were also counted as differences from the reference; these are potentially due to heterogeneity (variation among individuals in the Morex variety). To minimize spurious SV calls in difficult-to-call regions for the 10X Genomics, ONT, and PacBio data, we filtered out variants that overlap with uncallable regions, which includes annotated repeats, stretches of N’s in the reference genome sequence, and “high copy” regions (i.e., regions where plastids, rDNA repeats, and centromere repeats align). For the ONT and 10X Genomics data, SVs that overlap low complexity regions (defined as regions containing low-copy sequence) were also filtered out because they can be non-biological artifactual sequences that result in unmapped sequences or sequences mapped to multiple locations. Low complexity regions were generated using BBMask from BBTools (BBMap – Bushnell B. – sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/) with entropy set at 0.7, which was determined through data exploration to capture a majority of low complexity sequences (scripts available at https://github.com/MorrellLAB/morex_reference/tree/master/morex_v3). For the ONT and PacBio data, SVs were filtered out if they had less than five supporting reads. For Morex-sample2, SNPs in 100 bp windows with >2% diversity were filtered out. Such high diversity windows are unlikely when aligning Morex-sample2 to the Morex reference genome. SVs were then visually inspected in IGV or scored in SV-plaudit (in the case of the 10X Genomics larger deletions), and filtering criteria were tuned if necessary (summarized in S2 Fig). The filtered SVs form a high confidence set of places where de novo variants shouldn’t be called due to regions that are difficult to align or are heterogeneous among Morex individuals. For the 10X Genomics and ONT sequenced mutagenized lines (M01, M20, M29), SVs that overlap uncallable regions or low complexity regions were filtered out (S3 Fig). To benefit from using the strengths of distinct SV callers for ONT data, we utilize Sniffles2 [60] and cuteSV [66]. SVs called by cuteSV and Sniffles2 in the ONT data were filtered similarly, except in the Sniffles2 calls, we required at least five supporting reads. For all sequenced mutagenized lines (10X Genomics, ONT, and Illumina WGS), variants that overlap the “differences from reference” regions were filtered out (summarized in S2 Fig). SNPs identified in the mutagenized samples that also appear in the BOPA (Barley Oligo Pooled Assay 1 and 2) on the Illumina Golden Gate genotyping platform [50], Barley 9K Illumina Infinium iSelect Custom Genotyping BeadChip [67], and Barley 50K iSelect SNP array [52] panels were also excluded. Variants were filtered to those private to individual mutagenized samples, meaning the variant only exists in one of the mutagenized samples at a genomic position. This is based on the expectation that variants induced by the mutagen are new (arose after the mutagen treatment was applied) and unique to each individual. So, variants identified in the mutagenized lines that also exist in the Morex samples are likely due to heterogeneity in Morex and were not generated by the mutagen treatment. Again, variants were visually inspected in IGV [68] or igv-reports (https://github.com/igvteam/igv-reports), and filtering criteria were tuned if necessary. An image scoring approach was used to verify the larger deletions in the 10X Genomics three mutagenized samples. Images of the SVs were created with the SamPlot software [69]. Following the pipeline implemented in SV-Plaudit [70], the SV images were stored in the Amazon Web Services cloud storage and scored by multiple investigators through the PlotCritic website (https://github.com/jbelyeu/PlotCritic) based on the following criteria: coverage, insert size, and linked/split read evidence. This produced a set of scored deletions where a majority of scorers confirmed read evidence for the variant. This confirmed variant set was then verified using the ONT-sequenced samples (M01, M20, and M29). Mutation Motif [9] was used to identify the most frequent sequence motifs that affect SNPs in the mutated, rare, and common variant classes. This program performs comparative statistical analyses of neighborhoods (5 bp windows) centered around each SNP to identify the frequency of sequence motifs and the influence of neighboring bases for each SNP. The neighborhood of each SNP (e.g., C → T mutation) is compared to the neighborhood of a reference occurrence of the same nucleotide (e.g., C) randomly sampled from within +/- 100 bp of the mutation. Comparing the motifs associated with mutated, rare, and common classes of SNPs allowed us to identify specific motifs that sodium azide may preferentially target. The number of 2- and 3- bp motifs in the 4.2 Gb reference genome and 820 Mb callable regions was calculated using the EMBOSS [71] compseq tool. Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VeP) [32] was used to determine the predicted effect of each variant in the filtered VCF file, which includes SNPs, insertions, and deletions. Identification of nonsynonymous variants (includes missense, start lost, stop gained, and stop lost variants) used gene models provided by [25]. Nonsynonymous variants for the mutated samples and landraces were extracted from the VeP reports and assessed using BAD_Mutations [17,20], which includes a likelihood ratio test [72] that compares codon conservation across Angiosperm species to determine if a base substitution is likely to be deleterious. We ran the BAD_Mutations pipeline with a set of 72 Angiosperm species genome sequences that are available through Phytozome v13 (https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/, last accessed November 29, 2021) and Ensembl Plants (http://plants.ensembl.org/, last accessed November 29, 2021). We ran BAD_Mutations using 35,827 primary transcripts. A SNP was annotated as deleterious if the P-value for the test was < 0.05 with a multiple tests correction based on the number of tested codons, minimum of 10 sequences, maximum constraint of 1, and if the alternate or reference allele was not seen in any of the other species. Our thresholds for the three data groups were 8.1E-5 (611 codons tested) for the mutated samples, 5.1E-6 (9,716 codons tested) for the rare variants, and 3.4E-6 (14,537 codons tested) for the common variants. SNPs that failed this set of criteria were annotated as tolerated. Gx is the generation used for spontaneous mutation estimates (see Methods). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011634.s001 (TIFF) These are regions where induced mutations should not be called as they are more likely to be variation among Morex individuals. Example screenshots from IGV are shown, from top to bottom: 1) A deletion called in ONT data in a region where the reference is missing - can’t be confirmed as a deletion, 2) Regions with excessively high diversity based on the expectations in the most diverse barley genes are excluded, these are more likely due to alignment issues rather than real variation, and 3) Read support for 10X Genomics called deletion with the same variant called in the ONT data providing additional support for the call. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011634.s002 (TIFF) Larger SVs were visually evaluated with a similar approach as in part 1 of the filtering (S2 Fig). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011634.s003 (TIFF) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011634.s004 (TIFF) Larger insertions were not called in the 10X Genomics dataset. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011634.s005 (TIFF) A) A summary of the percentage and number of SNPs and indels in genic regions that can potentially disrupt genes for sodium azide-treated samples and rare vs. common categories.

More smartphone in Suqian, Jiangsu province, China on March 9, 2025. (Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images) Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is scheduled to report its earnings on Thursday, June 5, 2025. Historically, AVGO stock has often seen a positive reaction to its earnings announcements. Over the past five years, the stock has posted positive one-day returns in a strong 80% of instances, with a median gain of 2.9% and a maximum one-day jump of 24.4%. While actual results will heavily influence stock performance, understanding these historical patterns can give event-driven traders an edge. Here are two main approaches: Analysts project Broadcom to report earnings of $1.57 per share on sales of $14.97 billion. This marks a significant improvement from the prior year’s quarter, which saw earnings of $1.10 per share on sales of $12.49 billion. This anticipated growth is expected to be fueled by the continued expansion of Broadcom’s AI-related custom chips and Ethernet products. Investors will also be closely watching trends in custom ASIC sales. From a fundamental standpoint, Broadcom currently boasts a market capitalization of $1.1 trillion. Over the last twelve months, the company generated $55 billion in revenue and was operationally profitable, with $19 billion in operating profits and a net income of $10 billion. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – Merck Stock’s Ticking Keytruda Time Bomb.See earnings reaction history of all stocks Some observations on one-day (1D) post-earnings returns: Additional data for observed 5-Day (5D), and 21-Day (21D) returns post earnings are summarized along with the statistics in the table below. AVGO 1D, 5D, and 21D Post Earnings Return A relatively less risky strategy (though not useful if the correlation is low) is to understand the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns post earnings, find a pair that has the highest correlation, and execute the appropriate trade. For example, if 1D and 5D show the highest correlation, a trader can position themselves "long" for the next 5 days if 1D post-earnings return is positive. Here is some correlation data based on 5-year and 3-year (more recent) history. Note that the correlation 1D_5D refers to the correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns. AVGO Correlation Between 1D, 5D and 21D Historical Returns Sometimes, peer performance can have influence on post-earnings stock reaction. In fact, the pricing-in might begin before the earnings are announced. Here is some historical data on the past post-earnings performance of Broadcom stock compared with the stock performance of peers that reported earnings just before Broadcom. For fair comparison, peer stock returns also represent post-earnings one-day (1D) returns. AVGO Correlation With Peer Earnings Learn more about Trefis RV strategy that has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of all 3, the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000), to produce strong returns for investors. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock like Broadcom, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception.

Title: 3 Cheap CEFs With Yields Up To 12%

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Buy on the dip, purchase stock when price drop, trader signal to invest, make profit from market ... More collapse concept, smart businessman investor buy stock with down arrow graph. We’ve got a rare “delayed reaction” income play on our hands right now. Thanks to the April stock-market plunge, we can now pick up 12%+ dividends at attractive discounts. But I don’t expect this cheap CEF opportunity to last very long. I know early April feels like a while ago, but it created our opportunity, and the chance to buy is still available today. It lies in closed-end funds (CEFs). (I’ll show you three that pay those outsized 12%+ yields in just a second.) In a nutshell, these three funds trade at discounts to their portfolio values—known as “net asset value,” or NAV, in CEF-speak. And many of those discounts still haven’t recovered from the April “tariff terror.” When we buy a CEF at, say, a 10% discount to NAV, we’re essentially paying 90 cents on the dollar. As that gap narrows, we essentially profit twice: once from the fund’s high yield and again from the closing discount. Here’s the important part: These discounts are on the road to recovery. And their “discount momentum” positions us for gains, in addition to these three funds’ double-digit payouts. You simply won’t find such a profitable situation in the S&P 500. While the benchmark index has clawed its way back to around breakeven for 2025, the three funds we’ll get into next are still lagging, and that’s a gift for income investors like us. Let’s get into them. Our first fund is the Nuveen Floating Rate Income Fund (JFR), with a 12.5% yield and a still-cheap valuation that’s unlikely to stay that way for long. JFR Discount NAV As you can see above, JFR’s discount plunged to within a hair of 12% when President Trump’s tariffs were unveiled. That deal has since been cut nearly in half, to 6.7%. That might make you think it’s too late to buy. Not at all—JFR’s discount hasn’t fully snapped back to where it was at the start of the year, so there’s still upside here. And the discount will likely fade, because JFR has had a great run. With a 31% total return in the last three years, JFR is bound to attract more investor attention, putting those who front run that crowd now in a strong position to gain. JFR mainly invests in senior loans, as well as corporate bonds that are below investment grade, with a focus on floating-rate credit. You do need skilled management to navigate these waters, but Chicago-based Nuveen, which traces its roots back to 1898, is among the best in the business. Moreover, senior loans are repaid ahead of all other obligations in the event of a bankruptcy, which helps offset their risk. But that’s not really an issue now, since corporate defaults are below their long-term average, despite the heavy markdown corporate bonds suffered in 2022, when investors thought they would see huge defaults. Since floating-rate loans (whose rates, as the name says, are linked to interest rates) still haven’t fully recovered from that selloff, they’re particularly compelling now, while default rates remain low. In all, JFR gives us a well-designed bond portfolio to diversify our holdings. The income and discount make the deal even sweeter. For something a bit more familiar, consider another Nuveen CEF: the Nuveen Multi-Asset Income Fund (NMAI). NMAI mixes investments in well-known stocks, like Microsoft (MSFT), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Apple (AAPL), with loans and bonds, resulting in a well-diversified portfolio that helps management cover the fund’s 13.6% dividend. Again, this diversification has been attracting investors, causing NMAI’s discount to dwindle. But we’re still getting a generous 9% markdown here. Investors who buy NMAI’s diversified portfolio get a big yield at a hefty markdown to the fund’s actual value; this is partly why the fund’s discount has been disappearing. This narrowing of the discount will likely continue, and good economic news could accelerate it, as we saw happen in June 2024 (the peak in the chart above). Let’s wrap with a “pure” stock fund packing a powerful 12.8% dividend: the abrdn Total Dynamic Dividend Fund (AOD). Like the two CEFs above, AOD is attracting more investment, which we can see happening in real time through its shrinking discount: AOD Discount NAV Still, AOD trades for far less than NAV, with a 9.7% discount that makes little sense given the fund’s huge yield and large cap holdings, like Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tencent Holdings (TNCT). It also makes little sense for an investor to be able to get these stocks at such a big discount, which explains why that deal has been eroding. The bottom line here is that these 12%+ yielders are still catching up in the wake of April’s panic, making them worth a look for those with extra cash to put to work. But their shrinking discounts show the crowd is catching on, so you’ll need to act fast. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Buy on the dip, purchase stock when price drop, trader signal to invest, make profit from market ... More collapse concept, smart businessman investor buy stock with down arrow graph. We’ve got a rare “delayed reaction” income play on our hands right now. Thanks to the April stock-market plunge, we can now pick up 12%+ dividends at attractive discounts. But I don’t expect this cheap CEF opportunity to last very long. I know early April feels like a while ago, but it created our opportunity, and the chance to buy is still available today. It lies in closed-end funds (CEFs). (I’ll show you three that pay those outsized 12%+ yields in just a second.) In a nutshell, these three funds trade at discounts to their portfolio values—known as “net asset value,” or NAV, in CEF-speak. And many of those discounts still haven’t recovered from the April “tariff terror.” When we buy a CEF at, say, a 10% discount to NAV, we’re essentially paying 90 cents on the dollar. As that gap narrows, we essentially profit twice: once from the fund’s high yield and again from the closing discount. Here’s the important part: These discounts are on the road to recovery. And their “discount momentum” positions us for gains, in addition to these three funds’ double-digit payouts. You simply won’t find such a profitable situation in the S&P 500. While the benchmark index has clawed its way back to around breakeven for 2025, the three funds we’ll get into next are still lagging, and that’s a gift for income investors like us. Let’s get into them. Our first fund is the Nuveen Floating Rate Income Fund (JFR), with a 12.5% yield and a still-cheap valuation that’s unlikely to stay that way for long. JFR Discount NAV As you can see above, JFR’s discount plunged to within a hair of 12% when President Trump’s tariffs were unveiled. That deal has since been cut nearly in half, to 6.7%. That might make you think it’s too late to buy. Not at all—JFR’s discount hasn’t fully snapped back to where it was at the start of the year, so there’s still upside here. And the discount will likely fade, because JFR has had a great run. With a 31% total return in the last three years, JFR is bound to attract more investor attention, putting those who front run that crowd now in a strong position to gain. JFR mainly invests in senior loans, as well as corporate bonds that are below investment grade, with a focus on floating-rate credit. You do need skilled management to navigate these waters, but Chicago-based Nuveen, which traces its roots back to 1898, is among the best in the business. Moreover, senior loans are repaid ahead of all other obligations in the event of a bankruptcy, which helps offset their risk. But that’s not really an issue now, since corporate defaults are below their long-term average, despite the heavy markdown corporate bonds suffered in 2022, when investors thought they would see huge defaults. Since floating-rate loans (whose rates, as the name says, are linked to interest rates) still haven’t fully recovered from that selloff, they’re particularly compelling now, while default rates remain low. In all, JFR gives us a well-designed bond portfolio to diversify our holdings. The income and discount make the deal even sweeter. For something a bit more familiar, consider another Nuveen CEF: the Nuveen Multi-Asset Income Fund (NMAI). NMAI mixes investments in well-known stocks, like Microsoft (MSFT), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Apple (AAPL), with loans and bonds, resulting in a well-diversified portfolio that helps management cover the fund’s 13.6% dividend. Again, this diversification has been attracting investors, causing NMAI’s discount to dwindle. But we’re still getting a generous 9% markdown here. Investors who buy NMAI’s diversified portfolio get a big yield at a hefty markdown to the fund’s actual value; this is partly why the fund’s discount has been disappearing. This narrowing of the discount will likely continue, and good economic news could accelerate it, as we saw happen in June 2024 (the peak in the chart above). Let’s wrap with a “pure” stock fund packing a powerful 12.8% dividend: the abrdn Total Dynamic Dividend Fund (AOD). Like the two CEFs above, AOD is attracting more investment, which we can see happening in real time through its shrinking discount: AOD Discount NAV Still, AOD trades for far less than NAV, with a 9.7% discount that makes little sense given the fund’s huge yield and large cap holdings, like Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tencent Holdings (TNCT). It also makes little sense for an investor to be able to get these stocks at such a big discount, which explains why that deal has been eroding. The bottom line here is that these 12%+ yielders are still catching up in the wake of April’s panic, making them worth a look for those with extra cash to put to work. But their shrinking discounts show the crowd is catching on, so you’ll need to act fast. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Waymo To Separate From Google?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA - APRIL 11: A Waymo autonomous vehicle drives along Masonic Avenue on ... More April 11, 2022 in San Francisco, California. San Francisco is serving as testing grounds for autonomous vehicles with Waymo, a Google subsidiary and Cruise, a subsidiary of General Motors, logging millions of test miles throughout San Francisco in 2021. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Alphabet’s self-driving business, Waymo, has built up considerable momentum over the last few years. The company recently said that it was delivering about 250,000 autonomous rides per week, up from less than 10,000 rides per week less than two years ago. Unlike many robo-taxi upstarts that have faded or shifted focus, Waymo is actually scaling. With the company set to scale up operations in multiple new cities and mainstream acceptance of robotaxis picking up, Waymo might be on its way to becoming a key contender in shaping the future of urban transportation. That said, there are risks due to the startup’s uncertain unit economics and the ongoing antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet. Waymo is losing money - a lot of money. Waymo’s cash burn makes any forced separation of Waymo from Google - a question of Waymo’s survival. As such, we look into the cash burn first. Separately, see – RGTI Stock: What’s Next After An 1,100% Rally? Also, is it Time To Buy Amazon Stock? Now, almost seven years since its launch, Waymo remains unprofitable. While Google does not break down Waymo’s financials, its Other Bets segment, which includes the robotaxi startup, posted a $4.4 billion loss over the last fiscal year. The cost base is high. Waymo owns the vehicles it operates, a contrast to ride hailing players such as Uber. Then, there are the costs tied to vehicle retrofitting, mapping, and fleet management. This means that Waymo has yet to demonstrate a path to profitability, even at the relatively large scale it is currently operating at. Waymo still loses money on every ride it delivers. This has meant that Waymo is burning through cash and remains dependent on external funding. Check out how Alphabet’s Operating Cash Flows compare to peers. Waymo has raised over $10 billion in the unit since its inception, with its most recent $5.6 billion Series C coming last year, led by Alphabet, along with marquee investors such as a16z, Silver Lake, Tiger Global, and T. Rowe Price. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and clocked >91% returns since inception. As Waymo’s growth accelerates, a new challenge could be looming in the form of the U.S. Department of Justice’s ongoing antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet, which might result in the DOJ ordering a breakup of Alphabet’s sprawling portfolio. Granted, the DOJ’s antitrust lawsuit primarily targets Google’s dominant position in the search and advertising space. But on a core level, the department might be focusing on how Alphabet’s current organizational structure helps it cement its overall dominance. See how Google’s Revenues have been trending. That puts units like Waymo directly in regulators’ sights, given that it is a loss-making business that benefits from Google’s capital, shared intelligence and analytics, and Google’s deep trove of data. There are ways that Waymo drives Google’s long-term strategy as well - think real data collection, AI advancement. The money-losing rides might also be seen as costly R&D spending that generates valuable real-world data. This is why Google continues to fund the company despite mixed economics. Waymo depends on Alphabet not just for funding but for technical resources, cloud computing, AI talent, and mapping data. Without Alphabet’s backing and ecosystem support, Waymo could face pressure to cut costs. The timing couldn’t be worse. EV and self-driving behemoth Tesla is set to ramp up deployments of its own robo-taxis shortly. Tesla has a massive installed base of vehicles on the road already, and it plans to allow owners of full-self-driving (FSD) Teslas to rent out their vehicles, when they aren’t being used, to its robo-taxi fleet. See - Buy or Sell Tesla stock. This could translate into better unit economics versus Waymo. If Waymo is forced to separate from Google as its business continues to gain commercial traction, it risks losing out on its hard-won lead. Alphabet stock has declined by about 10% year-to-date, due to concerns about the economy, doubts about the growth of the company’s search business in the AI era, and the ongoing antitrust issues. See how Alphabet's valuation ratios compare against historical levels and also versus peers.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo (Corrects paragraph 14 to remove reference to Google and Amazon declining to comment. This line also appeared in an earlier version of this story.) By Anna Tong and Krystal Hu SAN FRANCISCO :Two years after the launch of ChatGPT, return on investment in generative AI has been elusive, but one area stands out: software development. So-called code generation or “code-gen” startups are commanding sky-high valuations as corporate boardrooms look to use AI to aid, and sometimes to replace, expensive human software engineers.

By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive news updates and promotional material from Mediacorp and Mediacorp’s partners. Loading Cursor, a code generation startup based in San Francisco that can suggest and complete lines of code and write whole sections of code autonomously, raised $900 million at a $10 billion valuation in May from a who’s who list of tech investors, including Thrive Capital, Andreessen Horowitz and Accel. Windsurf, a Mountain View-based startup behind the popular AI coding tool Codeium, attracted the attention of ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which is now in talks to acquire the company for $3 billion, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Its tool is known for translating plain English commands into code, sometimes called “vibe coding,” which allows people with no knowledge of computer languages to write software. OpenAI and Windsurf declined to comment on the acquisition.“AI has automated all the repetitive, tedious work,” said Scott Wu, CEO of code gen startup Cognition. “The software engineer’s role has already changed dramatically. It’s not about memorizing esoteric syntax anymore.”Founders of code-gen startups and their investors believe they are in a land grab situation, with a shrinking window to gain a critical mass of users and establish their AI coding tool as the industry standard. But because most are built on AI foundation models developed elsewhere, such as OpenAI, Anthropic, or DeepSeek, their costs per query are also growing, and none are yet profitable. They’re also at risk of being disrupted by Google, Microsoft and OpenAI, which all announced new code-gen products in May, and Anthropic is also working on one as well, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.The rapid growth of these startups is coming despite competing on big tech's home turf. Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot, launched in 2021 and considered code-gen’s dominant player, grew to over $500 million in revenue last year, according to a source familiar with the matter. Microsoft declined to comment on GitHub Copilot’s revenue. On Microsoft’s earnings call in April, the company said the product has over 15 million users.LEARN TO CODE?As AI revolutionizes the industry, many jobs - particularly entry-level coding positions that are more basic and involve repetition - may be eliminated. Signalfire, a VC firm that tracks tech hiring, found that new hires with less than a year of experience fell 24 per cent in 2024, a drop it attributes to tasks once assigned to entry-level software engineers are now being fulfilled in part with AI.Google’s CEO also said in April that “well over 30 per cent” of Google’s code is now AI-generated, and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said last year the company had saved “the equivalent of 4,500 developer-years” by using AI.In May, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said at a conference that approximately 20 to 30 per cent of their code is now AI-generated. The same month, the company announced layoffs of 6,000 workers globally, with over 40 per cent of those being software developers in Microsoft’s home state, Washington.“We’re focused on creating AI that empowers developers to be more productive, creative, and save time,” a Microsoft spokesperson said. “This means some roles will change with the revolution of AI, but human intelligence remains at the center of the software development life cycle.”MOUNTING LOSSESSome “vibe-coding” platforms already boast substantial annualized revenues.Cursor, with just 60 employees, went from zero to $100 million in recurring revenue by January 2025, less than two years since its launch. Windsurf, founded in 2021, launched its code generation product in November 2024 and is already bringing in $50 million in annualized revenue, according to a source familiar with the company. But both startups operate with negative gross margins, meaning they spend more than they make, according to four investor sources familiar with their operations. “The prices people are paying for coding assistants are going to get more expensive,” Quinn Slack, CEO at coding startup Sourcegraph, told Reuters. Both Cursor and Windsurf are led by recent MIT graduates in their twenties, and exemplify the gold rush era of the AI startup scene. “I haven’t seen people working this hard since the first Internet boom,” said Martin Casado, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, an investor in Anysphere, the company behind Cursor. What’s less clear is whether the dozen or so code-gen companies will be able to hang on to their customers as big tech moves in. “In many cases, it's less about who's got the best technology - it’s about who is going to make the best use of that technology, and who's going to be able to sell their products better than others,” said Scott Raney, managing director at Redpoint Ventures, whose firm invested in Sourcegraph and Poolside, a software development startup that’s building its own AI foundation model.CUSTOM AI MODELSMost of the AI coding startups currently rely on the Claude AI model from Anthropic, which crossed $3 billion in annualized revenue in May in part due to fees paid by code-gen companies. But some startups are attempting to build their own models. In May, Windsurf announced its first in-house AI models that are optimized for software engineering in a bid to control the user experience. Cursor has also hired a team of researchers to pre-train its own large frontier-level models, which could enable the company to not have to pay foundation model companies so much money, according to two sources familiar with the matter.Startups looking to train their own AI coding models face an uphill battle as it could easily cost millions to buy or rent the computing capacity needed to train a large language model.Replit earlier dropped plans to train its own model. Poolside, which has raised more than $600 million to make a coding-specific model, has announced a partnership with Amazon Web Services and is testing with customers, but hasn’t made any product generally available yet.Another code gen startup Magic Dev, which raised nearly $500 million since 2023, told investors a frontier-level coding model was coming in summer 2024 but hasn’t yet launched a product. Poolside declined to comment. Magic Dev did not respond to a request for comment.

Title: Coinbase delayed revealing data breach that may cost up to $400M, drops third-party vendor

Legal battles loom for Coinbase over delayed breach disclosure and insider hacks. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Secret knowledge, sudden split: the crypto exchange faces mounting legal and regulatory heat for a four-month silence over a breach affecting at least 69,000 customers. Coinbase was alerted as early as January 2025 that hackers had siphoned tens of thousands of customer records from one of its overseas support vendors, but the exchange waited until 14 May to notify regulators and users, according to internal emails reviewed by Reuters and interviews with three people briefed on the incident. The revelation comes as Coinbase abruptly terminated its relationship with TaskUs, the Texas-based outsourcing firm whose India call centre staff were allegedly bribed to leak screenshots and KYC files. At least 69,461 customers’ names, addresses, partial Social Security numbers, and ticket histories were exposed. Coinbase has warned investors that the breach could cost $180 million to $400 million in remediation and potential claims. Coinbase said it discovered evidence of contractor misconduct, moved quickly to cut access, and is enhancing controls across all third-party vendors. TaskUs confirmed it fired more than 200 employees in Indore after Coinbase raised alarms in January, but it insisted it “immediately escalated” the issue to its client. A TaskUs spokesperson said the company is “cooperating with law enforcement agencies in India and the United States.” Under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s new cyber-incident rule, publicly traded companies must file an 8-K within four business days of determining an incident is material. Coinbase’s May filing noted “prior months” of unauthorised activity but did not specify the January alert. Such inaction could be considered to be a textbook case of material non-compliance. The SEC may ask for confirmation as to why the clock didn’t start in January. A securities-fraud class action filed Monday in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania alleges Coinbase “withheld adverse information” that would have moved its share price. A separate negligence suit targets TaskUs in Manhattan federal court on behalf of affected users. Court filings describe a small criminal ring that paid support agents to photograph Coinbase’s screens with personal identifiers visible. By March, the scheme had widened, with stolen credentials sold on Telegram channels tied to “pig-butchering” crypto scams. On 11 May, the hackers, emboldened by their haul, emailed Coinbase demanding $20 million in exchange for deleting the data. Coinbase refused, instead offering a $20 million bounty for information leading to arrests. TaskUs, founded in 2008 and now valued at around $1.5 billion, counts Meta and DoorDash among its clients. Crypto exchanges like Coinbase have leaned on the firm to provide 24/7 customer support at a lower cost than U.S. hires through its 61,400 full-time staff. Security consultants warn that offshoring sensitive identity documents to low-wage environments creates the perfect storm for insider bribery. Human-layer attacks are increasingly outpacing technical exploits, as buying an underpaid agent is far cheaper than breaking robust encryption. The breach occurs as Coinbase and other crypto stakeholders wage a public campaign for lighter U.S. crypto rules. Rival exchanges Kraken and Gemini, who also use business-process outsourcing shops, will now rush to audit their own vendor controls, according to people familiar with those reviews. Meanwhile, affected Coinbase customers report continued phishing attempts and SIM-swap attacks. The company has offered two years of identity-theft monitoring but has not committed to reimbursing any downstream crypto losses. For Coinbase, the incident threatens balance-sheet costs and its narrative as the most compliant brand in crypto. Trust is the only hard currency an exchange has. Losing it, even for four months, can be fatal. Also known as "Akiba," Liam Wright is a reporter, podcast producer, and Editor-in-Chief at CryptoSlate.

Title: The mounting anxiety over tech jobs is turning ugly

The social network Blind had real juice when I wrote about it in June 2022. It gave 5 million tech workers a place to anonymously talk smack about their employers. Identified only by their workplaces, Blinders traded office gossip, swapped tips on acing technical interviews at places like Apple and Google, and voluntarily shared their Total Compensation — "TC," in the site's argot. Blind served as a giant, freewheeling water cooler for Silicon Valley. Back then, the tech industry was on the verge of what would be a catastrophic downturn in hiring. But Blinders didn't seem worried. They were too busy trying to figure out how to live like kings. How could they boost their TC to stratospheric levels? What were the secrets to climbing the ranks of a FAANG company, or starting a unicorn? Which employers offered the most lavish perks and the best work-life balance? Here and there, I noticed that a few Blinders were starting to wonder if they should get out of tech before all the jobs disappeared. But the overall vibe was: What's the best way to get ahead and live the good life? Three years later, tech employment is in free fall. Since its peak in late 2022, the industry has shed 175,000 jobs. Artificial intelligence is threatening to make the work of coders obsolete, and companies like Meta and Google are slashing perks, gutting middle management, ordering everyone back to the office, and putting employees on performance improvement plans designed to weed out low performers. Tech's role in our lives has never been more ascendant, but as far as the actual business goes, what seemed like a cyclical downturn back in 2022 has become a full-scale apocalypse. So it seemed like a good time to head back to Blind and see how people are feeling. What are workers in the tech industry saying, in the place where they have no fears about speaking their mind? How are Blinders handling the seismic shift taking place in Silicon Valley? The short answer is: not well. Gone is the single-minded focus on fat salaries and work-life balance. Today the site is suffused with a palpable, sour anxiety. Blinders grouse about being ghosted by job recruiters. They rail against the performance plans being implemented by their employers. Even worse, they accuse one another of lying and cheating. In the old days, Blinders treated each other with respect. The platform felt like something unheard of in the age of Twitter trolling: a true community. But now, not unlike much of the internet, Blind is infused with caustic racism and misogyny. Nobody trusts anyone, and everyone is very tired. Blind used to be a friendly and supportive place for the Lords of Tech to celebrate their ascendancy. Now it's devolved into "Lord of the Flies." Everyone on Blind still hopes they're gonna make it big someday. It just seems less likely now. Many Blinders are out of work and scrambling to find a job. They argue about the value of sites like LeetCode, which offers coding education tailored to FAANG interviews. They worry about spending a year studying for their big Amazon interview and then blowing it. And those who do have a job are either looking for a new one, or fretting about how little they make. "Does anyone here feel like dying because of their low TC?" asked one poster. After four years on the job, they said, their total compensation is stalled at $81,000. "Been feeling this lately," replied a Blinder who works at SoFi. There's often a weird sense of entitlement when Blinders talk about their compensation. Even with an AI earthquake sending shockwaves up and down Silicon Valley, they still make way more than most Americans — and they kvetch about it anyway. The person at SoFi who feels like dying over their measly pay? "I'm not even at $500k yet," they complained. "TC $415k." (For context, median income in America is under $50,000. In computer and information technology, it's around $106,000.) Compensation envy on Blind was common back in 2022. But now, when Blinders share their TC, they're often attacked as liars or trolls. Sometimes people are even accused of inventing entire jobs. "Job market is so fucked right now, all those multi-offer postings are by maga supporters," one Blinder posted, dismissing anyone claiming that they'd received multiple job offers at once as a right-wing propagandist. In the current struggle for survival, trust has effectively evaporated. It's every coder for themself — and if you claim to have a great job or a high TC, you must be making it up. One of the biggest anxieties on Blind right now involves performance improvement plans. Nobody enjoys being watched closely by their boss, but Blinders seem to feel that PIPs are more than just an evaluation tool. Some see them as a form of tyranny — something inept middle managers use to meet metrics for firing people, not a test of pure coding skill. Others see any opposition to PIPs as a betrayal of the grindcore mindset — if you're scared of a PIP, maybe the low performer is you, bro! "I moved from Amazon to Microsoft because the PIP culture at Amazon completely burned me out," one Blinder wrote. "The whole thing really messed with me mentally, and I promised myself I'd never go through something like that again. Fast forward to today and Microsoft is now rolling out PIP." The poster despaired of ever being free of the constant scrutiny. "Do you need to go to a fucking startup or something??" they wrote. The pile-on began. Some accused the Blinder of being a subpar coder who was too inflexible to take criticism. Others then accused those Blinders of being managers who were too insecure to acknowledge that PIPs are destroying the spirit of teamwork that attracted so many workers to the tech industry. It felt like every other social media platform: a toxic stew of mistrust and recrimination. One thing almost everyone seemed to agree on? That morale is especially terrible at Meta right now. "We are all hired mercenaries chasing high TC," one Meta employee lamented. Others complained about grueling hours and what they see as a culture of backstabbing. "I'm at Meta," another Blinder wrote. "God I wish I wasn't. And yes I'm interviewing to make that change happen asap. When I started a year ago I thought, 'Blind suffers from selection bias, etc., it will be just fine and like any big tech company.' Nah dawg. It be bad." The point here isn't whether the Blinders are right. It's that in the wake of massive layoffs, many tech workers have sunk into a deep pit of paranoia, finger-pointing — and worse. Back in 2022, I didn't see much racism and misogyny on the platform. Now it's everywhere. Blind recently boasted that it had 12 million registered users, primarily because of its expansion into South Korea and India. Blinders might be turning up the racism dial in response to the newbies. But it's also true that tech in general is suffering from an outbreak of toxic bro-ism. As a team of sociologists wrote of the tech sector in 2023, "The most striking workplace development in recent years may well be the surfacing of a culture of gloves-off sexism and racism at some firms." The field has long been dominated by young white men; more recently, women and people of color have begun to make gains. A lot of the guys on Blind are quick to blame their woes on DEI. One Blinder — a self-described "Indian American born in the USA" — uncorked a truly vile tirade against "Indian women managers." it ranged from stereotyping about people who are "fresh off the boat" to derogatory speculation about their love lives to outright calling them "overweight and ugly." In another post, a Blinder from Adobe asked a workplace etiquette question. "Co-worker brings Indian food to desk and whole aisle smells like food," they wrote. "How to be respectful and say no to this habit?" A Blinder from Pinterest tried to step in. "I'm going to assume that this question was asked in good faith," they wrote. "But next time rather than pointing out the cuisine specifically, just say that they brought 'ethnic food' to the office and the smell is particularly strong." Their heart was in the right place — or at least near it. But the next exchange obliterated any goodwill: Apple: Bring big fat beef steak , and make sure to eat in front of him loudly … He will stop eating at desk afterwards. Instacart: Stop overreacting you pos. You can eat fish, beef and all the crap that stinks but it's only Indian food that bothers you. Prick. Corum: You are the one overreacting. The OP asked the question respectfully. Indian food is really pungent compared to a ham sandwich. In a sense, 'twas ever thus. Silicon Valley has long struggled with racism and misogyny. As those sociologists wrote, modern tech was founded in part on "an exploitative guest worker program that prioritized entry for East and South Asian engineers starting in the 1960s." But the Blind I remembered didn't indulge in X-style hyperpolarization. Today, the shrapnel explodes in all directions. Men on Blind accuse each other of lying about how much they exercise, and how many women they have sex with. Men who claim to be of Indian descent ask other Indian men how to deal with their white American wives who want to have jobs. Blind's recent growth has also come from more women joining the network — and for them, this nonsense is exhausting. "If you choose a career you are a feminist," a worker from Amazon posted in a channel called Women in Core Tech. "If you don't have a career you are a gold digger. If you have an opinion you are argumentative, if you don't have one you are boring. It's like they were expecting pets and don't know how to deal with an entire other gender of humans." A few men replied sympathetically — sorry you're dealing with this, it sucks, etc. They got called simps. A Googler responded with a chart from the Financial Times showing a global divergence in politics between men (who are growing more conservative) and women (who are growing more liberal). The Googler cited it as evidence that women have taken up "woke moral purity as a substitute for religion." The going has gotten tough in tech. Things are falling apart. Today, the open, communal vibe I encountered on Blind back in 2022 seems like a relic of some long-forgetten age. A spokesperson for the network tells me that, according to their data, the percentage of posts that use discriminatory language has actually decreased slightly since 2022. But the overall volume of posts has grown, so "the absolute number of problematic posts may rise." Whatever the math, I was heartbroken to see that Blind, too, has gone feral. In the boom days of tech, the platform's homepage used to have a running ticker in the upper right corner cycling through a list of current job openings, many of which offered remarkably high levels of compensation. It seemed like both goal and enticement, a mutually agreed-upon brass ring for those who had decided to make a career in tech. Now the ticker, along with many of the jobs it used to list, is gone. For Blinders, all that's left is a dystopian cesspool of snark — most of it directed not at the external forces reshaping their livelihoods, but at one another. For millions of beleaguered, burned-out users, it's one more indignity to bear as they struggle to hang on to what little hope they have left.

Business Insider is cutting 21 percent of its workforce across all departments as part of a restructuring strategy focused on efficiency and long-term sustainability. CEO Barbara Peng said the company is "going all-in on AI," with tools like generative AI search, an AI-powered paywall and broader automation integrated into operations. BI is narrowing its editorial scope to areas like business, tech and innovation, shutting down most of its e-commerce operations and expanding its BI Live events division. The Insider Union condemned the layoffs, calling them a continuation of Axel Springer's "pivot away from journalism toward greed" and criticized the use of AI as a justification for job cuts. The layoffs are effective immediately, also impacting the U.K. division, with HR directly notifying affected employees. This marks the third major layoff at BI in three years.

The layoffs are effective immediately, also impacting the U.K. division, with HR directly notifying affected employees. This marks the third major layoff at BI in three years. Business InsiderÂ (BI) is laying off more than one-fifth (21 percent) of its staff as it pivots toward AI-powered content production, streamlined operations and a narrower editorial focus. The cuts, announced by CEO Barbara Peng in a memo to employees on May 29, affect employees across all departments. Peng described the cuts as part of a "leaner, more focused" strategy centered on AI adoption, live events and targeted coverage areas like business, tech and innovation. "We are reducing the size of our organization, a move that will impact about 21 percent of our colleagues and touch every department. This will be a difficult day, and our first priority is to provide clarity and support to those colleagues whose roles are being eliminated," Peng wrote in the memo. Peng indicated in the memo that the media outletÂ will shut down most of its e-commerce operations due to their reliance on search traffic, though a few high-performing verticals will be retained. At the same time, the company plans to expand its BI Live events business â a growing revenue stream that Peng says allows the company to "showcase our journalism, connect directly with our audience and build a strong portfolio of experiences." (Related: Job cuts in mainstream media outlets could lead to AI TAKEOVER of news industry.) Moreover, Peng revealed that BI is "going all-in on AI," citing the rollout of multiple AI-powered tools, including generative AI site search and an AI-driven paywall system. She also teased new AI products on the horizon and suggested that automation will be used across business operations to improve efficiency. Peng also disclosed that BI is narrowing its editorial focus on areas that attract the publication's "most loyal readers," although she did not elaborate on which verticals those are. She noted that 70 percent of the company's business is subject to fluctuations in web traffic and that the organization must be "structured to endure extreme traffic drops outside of our control." The layoffs are effective immediately, with impacted employees receiving direct communication from HR. BI's United Kingdom division is also affected, with a separate downsizing process underway. Insider Union criticizes Business Insider for laying off employees over AI The announcement has drawn strong backlash from the Insider Union, which is affiliated with the NewsGuild of New York. In a scathing statement, the union called the move "another example of Axel Springer's brazen pivot away from journalism toward greed." "We were notified that Business Insider management intends to lay off about 20 percent of our members as part of their ongoing âstrategy' to 'build toward something new,'" the union said. "Let's be clear: This is far from anything new. This is the third round of layoffs in as many years and it is unacceptable that union members and other talented coworkers are again paying the price for the strategic failures of Business Insider's leadership." The union also took sharp aim at the company's AI push, calling Peng's emphasis on automation "tone-deaf" in the context of mass layoffs. "To say this was tone-deaf to include in an email on layoffs would be an understatement," the statement read. "Our position as a union is that no Al tool or technology should or can take the place of human beings." Visit FutureTech.newsÂ for more stories like this.

Title: Ad Tech Briefing: MNTN is ad tech’s canary in the coal mine for future public listings

This Ad Tech Briefing covers the latest in ad tech and platforms for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Friday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → MNTN’s initial public offering has revived hopes for ad tech companies eyeing public markets, debuting at $16 per share and quickly rising to $28, with a valuation of $1.2 billion. Backed by Morgan Stanley and linked to Hollywood star Ryan Reynolds (albeit tangentially), the company benefits from a high profile. However, how long will it take for the shine to come off, especially in a year when one of its most readily comparable peers on Wall Street has experienced a significant hit on its stock price? The outfit went public on May 22, 2025, pricing its stock at $16 per share, with the price increasing more than 60% from its IPO price since, a performance suggesting that Wall Street favors it. Still, it faces skepticism over past controversies and limited scale, with $225 million in 2024 revenue equating to a $32.9 million net loss.Meanwhile, observers of the space will recall that MNTN — an outfit known initially, after its founding in 2009, as Steelhouse — has been no stranger to criticism. Those interested further need only look up its (now resolved) legal disputes with Criteo as an example. MNTN’s stockholders will be relieved to hear that several equity analysts told Digiday that investors focus on revenue or profitability impacts, not just allegations. However, success demands flawless execution amid macroeconomic uncertainty, and action on said allegations could soon prove a drag on its price. “Fraud allegations are common in the space and usually don’t have a sustained impact on the stock price,” noted one. Mark Zgutowicz, a managing director at The Benchmark Company who analyzes stocks such as Criteo, LiveRamp, and The Trade Desk, noted that ongoing concerns around tariffs and their impact on consumer incomes are “the elephant in the room” for such companies’ stock prices. It is in this context that such companies, as well as MNTN, must continue to show the robust nature of their business. Zgutowicz said The Trade Desk’s Q4 miss was minor and the stock overreacted, and that Benchmark was upgrading it to a neutral position for its earlier sales rating. “With Criteo, I think the expectations were set too high for them, and they’re owning up to that,” he added. “LiveRamp, I think, is managing through the macro[environment] better because their expectations were set more appropriately.” Karsten Weide, founder of W Media Research, noted how ad tech IPOs are tougher now than in the mid-2010s or early 2020s, primarily because the ‘growth at all costs’ era has eroded. “Today, in 2025, Wall Street wants to see profitability and transparency, skeptical of ad tech’s complexity,” he noted. “AI’s impact and competition from giants like Google make it harder for companies like MNTN to succeed and stand out.” “Amazon realizes it has missed the boat on display advertising, so it is concentrating on using Fire TV and Prime Video as a Trojan Horse,” noted one source when commenting on Amazon’s fresh attempts to overhaul its market share in the DSP sector. — An anonymous agency source The winners and losers of Google’s AI Mode The Sellout Erich Wasserman, former MediaMath sales chief, Dominic Joseph, former CEO of Capitfy and Myles Younger, now of U. of Digital discuss their creative pasts with Paul Knegten, formerly the CMO of Beeswax and Outbrain, in a weekly mini-series that debuts on June 4. Google judge mulls softer remedies in US search antitrust case U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta heard closing arguments on May 30 at a trial on proposals to address Google’s search monopoly, suggesting he is considering making Alphabet’s Google take less aggressive measures to restore competition in online search than the 10-year regime proposed by antitrust enforcers. What’s On The Agenda For Michael Komasinski, Criteo’s New Chief? AdExchanger talks with Criteo chief Michael Komasinski after he took the hot seat in the first half of 2025, noting how even with Google Chrome’s U-turn on third-party cookies, that, “We see the potential future of agentic shopping as a big opportunity for Criteo.” A Guide to Smarter Advertising and Sustainable Growth in Connected TelevisionID5 notes how addressability is a major challenge for CTV advertising. Agencies and SSPs are pairing up for partnership deals, driven by demand for premium inventory and greater transparency. Will Doherty, svp of inventory development, teases launch at IAB Tech Lab Summit, claiming 90% of Deal IDs are ‘effectively failed’. The move was likely a cost-savings effort, which would mean that Publicis most likely offered to secure lower rates for the entertainment company’s marketing efforts.

Title: Some game developers are trying to justify $80 games
URL: https://www.xda-developers.com/game-developers-justify-expensive-games/
Time Published: 2025-06-03T01:00:19Z
Full Content:
Gaming as a hobby is appearing to get more expensive. With the rise in prices for hardware and other aspects of video games, everyone is going to have to shell out more to engage with their favorite pastime. However, while the price of home game consoles and PC gaming has increased over time, one aspect of video games that's attracting a lot of debate is the price of individual releases. Not that long ago, it felt like $60 would be enough to buy most new releases that would come out at retail. But now it seems some developers are aiming to reach an $80 price point for their newest releases. And most players are not happy about it. Much of this has to do with the changing economic times of the world, but most of what affects video games comes from within the industry itself. And as people struggle with the reality of games costing more, some developers are trying to be as honest as possible about why their games will garner a higher price tag. Change is coming in a very real way, and it's going to affect how everyone engages with video games as a hobby. But what are the legitimate reasons why games will cost more money? Here's how developers are trying to justify why games costing $80 moving forward are the right move for everyone. Nintendo making Mario Kart World cost $80 received a ton of backlash, but they can justify it if the game has enough content now and in the future Making a video game and releasing it to the public costs a lot of money. Most AAA game releases that we see on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X will cost millions of dollars to put together and be ready for release on specific platforms. But when you add the necessity of getting the attention of potential customers, the numbers get even higher. So before you know it, one game could have a budget of hundreds of millions of dollars, all before anybody knows whether it will be a success. But what's scarier is that the overall cost of all this is getting even higher than before, affecting nearly every game developer. This is why new games like Mario Kart World for the Nintendo Switch 2 are going to cost $80 on release. A lot of effects of the increasing cost of making games are being seen in the frequent layoffs and turnover within the gaming industry itself. Some companies just don't have the resources to sustain groups of people during or after the completion of a project, and in some of the worst cases, cancellations. One way to help offset this is to have games cost more at retail, putting much of the burden on customers to help solve the problem. In theory, this could work, but there are many factors that could affect why this may or may not be the best course of action. Regardless, this is where many in the industry are leaning. Releasing a game doesn't just mean doing so within the country it's developed in anymore. The majority of games that are made end up having releases in multiple regions, sometimes a simultaneous worldwide release for bigger games. This can help reach more players/customers in other territories and hopefully increase the revenue generated, but one small problem has been growing recently. Changes in policy between countries, such as the amount of money used to pay tariffs on goods. This affects many companies, especially bigger game companies that make consoles, and forces them to find solutions to compensate for the extra billing. Many have pointed to the release of the Nintendo Switch 2, which has been reported to have some issues stemming from the incoming tariffs in the United States. Microsoft recently increased the prices of all its Xbox hardware releases, as well as the prices of games for its Xbox consoles. While the company did not explicitly say tariffs were the reason, many believe it to be because other companies are taking similar actions with their own products. Reports online cited Amazon's Jeff Bezos when he discussed showing the cost of tariffs on certain items sold through Amazon in North America. If it costs more to release products in different parts of the world, that money will come from somewhere, which will most likely be from the customers making the purchase. Microsoft joins in on increasing prices for hardware and software. Get ready to pay more... There's another aspect of this that has been in practice already for some time. Games that have come out at the $60 price point have not always contained the full amount of content developed for them, with publishers opting to have season passes with additional downloadable content available. These expansions end up boosting the price of new releases above the $60 price tag and sometimes into the $100 range to get the full experience and complete amount of content. Instead of having a partial $60 release, the option of having an $80 or more version with everything in there seems like a premium deal. This practice has grown in recent years because studios are trying to find ways around the rising cost of development. And while some studios with big releases have been able to make this work, others have not found the same level of success, but rather harsh criticism from players. Most gamers who are eagerly awaiting Grand Theft Auto VI are going to be open to paying $80 or more for the game, mostly due to the notoriety of the series and anticipation of the new release. However, not every studio has a brand or name that garners that same level of power from players, yet more companies will see this happen and use the same tactics. To some, it comes off more as locking away content that could otherwise be added to the standard release, for the sake of profit. Although it's a smart business move that any studio would find viable, it affects the trust of players who would buy games. Whether everyone wants to admit it or not, change is coming to how we buy video games. Unfortunately, there is no way to stop the rising cost of games in stores or digital storefronts, especially when the price of releasing video games to the public continues to go up. Studios are going to continue to find alternatives to how they can balance out the cost and profit of game releases, even if the emotional reaction from players is not always favorable. As sad as it might make us all, change is coming to the price of games, and we're all going to have to deal with it. The Nintendo Switch 2 is almost here. But is it less than what it really needed to be for everyone? We want to hear from you! Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Your comment has not been saved Yes, all of these motivations for rising prices are correct, but the market is also much larger than it was a decade or two ago, so the development cost should be split between more customers. The bottom line is most big publishers are making bigger profits than ever before. They're not running out of money. Another angle is what the market will bear. Most people already wait for Ubisoft games to go on sale for $30, for instance, that's not going to change if the MSRP goes up and median income doesn't. Here are the ten games that define the NES. Here are some SNES games that will likely never come to Nintendo Switch Online. Before steam, there was MS-DOS, which ran a bevy of "new-age" games. These games would go on to become some of the most important in the medium. Feed your PC more RAM, as a little treat. A spare PCIe network card was a neat little investment for my daily driver I just don't see the point in paying for a NAS-centric operating system

June 02, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, June 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Compass Diversified (NYSE:CODI), Digimarc Corporation (NASDAQ:DMRC), Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV), and Iovance Biotherapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:IOVA). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Compass Diversified (NYSE:CODI) Class Period: May 1, 2024 - May 7, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 8, 2025 According to the lawsuit, during the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the Company's subsidiary, Lugano Holdings, Inc., maintained unrecorded financing arrangements and irregularities in its sales, cost of sales, inventory, and accounts receivable; (2) the irregularities and undisclosed details in Lugano Holdings, Inc.'s financial statements rendered the financial statements of the Company as a whole unreliable, and would require restatement; (3) the Company failed to maintain adequate internal controls related to its financial statements; and (4) as a result, defendants' public statements were materially false and/or misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. For more information on the Compass Diversified class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/CODI Digimarc Corporation (NASDAQ:DMRC) Class Period: May 3, 2024 - February 26, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 7, 2025 According to the Complaint, the Company made false and misleading statements to the market. A large commercial partner of Digimarc would not renew its contract on the same terms. As a result, the Company would renegotiate the large commercial contract. Based on this renegotiation, the Company’s subscription revenue and annual recurring revenue would be adversely affected. Based on these facts, the Company’s public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period. When the market learned the truth about Digimarc, investors suffered damages. For more information on the Digimarc class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/DMRC Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV) Class Period: April 18, 2024, and October 16, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 11, 2025 According to the lawsuit, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that, with the Medicaid redetermination process nearly complete, defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the risk and cost profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid programs. While defendants acknowledged that Medicaid expenses were rising, they repeatedly assured investors that this was adequately reflected in Elevance’s guidance for the year. These representations were materially false or misleading. In truth, the redeterminations were causing the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members to rise significantly, as the members being removed from Medicaid programs were, on average, healthier than those who remained eligible for the programs. This shift was occurring to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations with the states or in its financial guidance for 2024. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. For more information on the Elevance class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ELV Iovance Biotherapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:IOVA) Class Period: May 9, 2024 - May 8, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 14, 2025 According to the complaint, throughout the class period, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Iovance's growth potential; notably, that it was not equipped to generate and drive demand or was otherwise ill equipped to capitalize upon the purported existing demand for its treatments through its network of approved treatment centers. On July 25, 2024, Iovance announced its financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and reduced its revenue guidance for the full fiscal year 2024. The Company attributed its results and lowered guidance on 1) "the iCTC completed annual scheduled maintenance in December" and "capacity was reduced by more than half for about 1 month," 2) "[l]ower Proleukin sales" than the company expected, and 3) "the variable pace at which ATCs began treatment patients." Following this news, the price of Iovance's common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $3.17 per share on May 8, 2025, Iovance's stock price fell to $1.75 per share on May 9, 2025, a decline of about 44.795% in the span of just a single day.

Title: Microsoft and CrowdStrike collaborate on shared threat actor mapping system
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/06/02/microsoft-crowdstrike-collaborate-shared-threat-actor-mapping-system/
Time Published: 2025-06-02T22:37:01Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 18:37 EDT / JUNE 02 2025 by Duncan Riley CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. and Microsoft Corp. today announced a strategic collaboration aimed at resolving the longstanding confusion in how cyberthreat actors are identified and tracked across security platforms. The partnership establishes a shared mapping system that aligns adversary attribution across both companies’ threat intelligence ecosystems, eliminating ambiguity caused by inconsistent naming. The problem that both companies are trying to solve is one encountered commonly in cybersecurity news: various companies applying their own name to threat actors, making it sometimes difficult for observers to know what threat actor and ransomware group one report to another is talking about. For example, the well-known Cozy Bear hacking group is also known as Midnight Blizzard, depending on which company is writing the report, which doesn’t exactly make intelligence tracking easy when different names are used. To their credit, CrowdStrike and Microsoft can see the problem and have developed a “Rosetta Stone” for cyber threat intelligence, one that links adversary identifiers across vendor ecosystems without mandating a single naming standard. The idea is that by reducing ambiguity in how adversaries are labeled, the mapping enables defenders to make faster, more confident decisions, correlate threat intelligence across sources and better disrupt threat actor activity before it causes harm. “This is a watershed moment for cybersecurity. Adversaries hide behind both technology and the confusion created by inconsistent naming,” Adam Meyers, head of Counter Adversary Operations at CrowdStrike, said in a media release. “As defenders, it’s our job to stay ahead and to give security teams clarity on who is targeting them and how to respond.” The collaboration will start with a shared analyst-led effort to harmonize adversary naming between CrowdStrike and Microsoft’s threat research teams. Although only announced today, the companies have already “deconflicted” more than 80 adversaries, including validating threat actors like Microsoft’s Volt Typhoon and CrowdStrike’s VANGUARD PANDA are allegedly Chinese state-sponsored threat actors and that Secret Blizzard and VENOMOUS BEAR refer to the same Russia-nexus adversary. Moving forward, CrowdStrike and Microsoft plan to continue working together to expand this effort, inviting other partners to contribute to and maintain a shared threat actor mapping resource for the global cybersecurity community. “Cybersecurity is a defining challenge of our time, especially in today’s AI-driven era,” said Vasu Jakkal, corporate vice president of Microsoft Security. “Microsoft and CrowdStrike are in ideal positions to help our customers and the wider defender community accelerate the benefits of actionable threat intelligence. Security is a team sport and when defenders can share and react to information faster it makes a difference in how we protect the world.” THANK YOU Workday launches AI agent developer toolset with third-party connector and custom widgets Ciroos.AI raises $21M for multi-agent site reliability engineering platform Snowflake platform enhancements focus on performance, governance and interoperability Snowflake expands AI tools to streamline enterprise data workflows and speed machine learning Broadcom introduces Tomahawk 6 networking chip for large-scale AI clusters Projectworks raises $12M to expand its project automation platform Workday launches AI agent developer toolset with third-party connector and custom widgets AI - BY KYT DOTSON . 8 MINS AGO Ciroos.AI raises $21M for multi-agent site reliability engineering platform AI - BY PAUL GILLIN . 23 MINS AGO Snowflake platform enhancements focus on performance, governance and interoperability BIG DATA - BY PAUL GILLIN . 23 MINS AGO Snowflake expands AI tools to streamline enterprise data workflows and speed machine learning BIG DATA - BY PAUL GILLIN . 23 MINS AGO Broadcom introduces Tomahawk 6 networking chip for large-scale AI clusters INFRA - BY MARIA DEUTSCHER . 23 MINS AGO Projectworks raises $12M to expand its project automation platform CLOUD - BY DUNCAN RILEY . 1 HOUR AGO

Major U.S. equity indices edged higher as June trading kicked off. The modest gains came despite reheating trade tensions between the world's largest economies as Chinese trade officials rejected President Donald Trump's claims that the Asian nation had violated a trade agreement announced last month. After wavering for much of Monday's session, the S&P 500 rallied in the afternoon to close with a gain of 0.4%. The Nasdaq was up 0.7%, while the Dow eked out an uptick of 0.1%. Shares of several U.S. steelmakers surged after President Trump announced a plan that would double steel tariffs to 50%. The president said the higher duties on steel imports would protect U.S. workers in the industry and encourage more companies to source the material from U.S. steelmakers. Steel Dynamics (STLD) shares soared 10.3%, marking Monday's top performance in the S&P 500, while Nucor (NUE) shares surged 10.1%. Gold futures prices jumped more than 2% on Monday, boosted by heightening geopolitical tensions and a weakening U.S. dollar. The uptick in the price of the precious metal helped lift gold-related stocks, including shares of Newmont (NEM), the world's largest gold producer, which added 5.4% on Monday. According to a Wall Street Journal report, Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms (META) intends to launch a service by the end of next year that will allow advertisers to create and target campaigns entirely through artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Meta shares gained 3.6%. Renewable energy stocks remained under pressure following last week's announcement that the Department of Energy would terminate more than $3.7 billion in grants for clean energy and climate-related projects. The funding cuts exacerbated concerns about the proposed elimination of some renewable energy incentives under the House's reconciliation bill. First Solar (FSLR) stock tumbled 5.3%, declining the most of any S&P 500 stock on Monday. Shares of defense technology specialist Leidos Holdings (LDOS) dropped 4.6%. Last week, Leidos announced that it had acquired Kudu Dynamics, a firm known for developing offensive cyber capabilities enabled by artificial intelligence (AI), in line with a new company strategy that pegs cyber as a key growth area. However, Baird analysts downgraded Leidos stock last week to "neutral" from "outperform," citing a challenging booking environment and an uncertain outlook for government contracting. Shares of U.S. automakers lost ground following Trump's comments on steel tariffs. Higher import taxes threaten to raise vehicle manufacturing costs. Both General Motors (GM) and Ford Motor (F) saw their share prices drop 3.9%, while shares of Chrysler and Jeep parent Stellantis (STLA) lost 3.6%.

Title: The Trump administration is delaying a 25% tariff on Chinese-made graphics cards

Graphics cards and motherboards assembled in China are avoiding President Donald Trump’s import taxes, for now. In a three-page notice published Saturday in the Federal Register, the Office of the Trade Representative said it was “appropriate” to extend a moratorium that won’t subject vendors of electronics equipment to tariffs on graphics cards and graphics processing units. The measure stems from a long-running Section 301 investigation into Chinese economic policies and whether they are harming American companies. That federal probe started under the first Trump administration, and it would apply a 25% tariff if officials conclude that Chinese companies had an unfair advantage. The 25% tariff has been inactive due to a string of reprieves from both the Biden and Trump administrations. China remains the world’s largest electronics manufacturer, according to the International Trade Centre; the nation is still subject to a minimum 30% import tax by the Trump administration, barring some exemptions. Major tech companies including Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) were spared the brunt of Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs in April. A federal court battle is now brewing over the fate of those tariffs. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Shares of Applied Digital (APLD) rose nearly 50% Monday after announcing a deal to lease data center space to AI darling CoreWeave (CRWV).

The deal is expected to generate $7 billion in total revenue over the decade-and-a-half span; the company reported about $53 million in revenue in its most recently completed quarter. Both Applied Digital and CoreWeave are backed by Nvidia (NVDA), the second-most valuable company in the world and the chipmaking giant most associated with the rise of artificial intelligence. Nvidia held roughly 7.7 million shares of Applied Digital and 24.2 million shares of CoreWeave as of March 31, according to a regulatory filing. CoreWeave provides its clients with access to data centers, which are used to develop artificial intelligence models. The company’s data centers are equipped with Nvidia chips. Shares of CoreWeave rose about 8% on Monday.

Title: Apple CEO Tim Cook No.4 on list of Highest Paid CEOs

Update font size. Reset A new analysis from The Wall Street Journal revealed which CEOs heading up S&P 500 companies had the biggest pay packages in 2024. Apple CEO Tim Cook place 4th on the list. Aislinn Murphy for FOX Business: ‎ The Journal said its analysis looked at MyLogIQ data to rank a total of more than 400 CEOs who had been at the helm of S&P 500 companies for a year or longer. 1. Rick Smith – Axon Enterprises: Axon Enterprise CEO Rick Smith’s $164.53 million pay package was the only one of the S&P 500 companies last year in which the package was six figures, according to The Journal. Stock awards linked to company performance accounted for the bulk of his 2024 compensation. Axon, which makes Tasers and other products, had a market capitalization of over $58 billion as of Monday. 2. Lawrence Culp Jr. – GE Aerospace: Larry Culp is the CEO of GE Aerospace. The analysis pegged his 2024 compensation at $88.95 million, earning him the No. 2 spot. 3. Stephen Schwarzman – Blackstone: Blackstone compensated CEO Stephen Schwarzman about $84.03 million in 2024, The Journal reported. The private equity firm had nearly $1.2 trillion in assets under management as of the end of March. He co-founded Blackstone in the 1980s along with Peter Peterson. 4. Tim Cook – Apple: Apple CEO Tim Cook’s $74.61 million pay package included cash, equity, and other compensation, according to the Journal. ‎ MacDailyNews Take: Can’t see what’s coming except for fat checks and endless stock awards. $74.61 million. While Cook is hemming and hawing when faced with shareholders (virtually, of course, never again in person for as long as Cook remains), Apple is currently in scramble mode trying to catch up to rivals — including the world’s most valuable company, Microsoft — in generative AI, a technology the company seems to have completely missed while focusing instead on the not-ready-for-primetime Apple Vision Pro, visionOS, its now-canceled decade-long multi-billion-dollar electric vehicle boondoggle, replacing leather in iPhone cases and Apple Watch bands with overpriced junk in a quest to “save the planet,” forcing employees to endure a constant barrage of time-wasting zero-productivity DEI sessions, and myriad other various and sundry “initiatives” which Cook deems of import. – MacDailyNews, February 28, 2024 ‎ Please help support MacDailyNews — and enjoy subscriber-only articles, comments, chat, and more — by subscribing to our Substack: macdailynews.substack.com.

Title: Meta Shareholders Vote To Shut Down Bitcoin Treasury Proposal in Near-Unanimous Decision

Full Content:
Shareholders at Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta have decided to shoot down a proposed Bitcoin (BTC) treasury for the tech giant. According to an 8-K Filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from last week, the vast majority of Meta shareholders voted against a BTC treasury proposal as a hedge against inflation. “On May 28, 2025, Meta Platforms, Inc. (the “Company”) held its annual meeting of shareholders via live audio webcast… At the Annual Meeting, the Company’s shareholders voted on fourteen proposals, each of which is described in more detail in the Company’s definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 17, 2025… At the beginning of the Annual Meeting, there were 1,769,720,699 shares of Class A common stock and 342,865,499 shares of Class B common stock present or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting, which represented 92.61% of the combined voting power of the shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting (voting together as a single class), and which constituted a quorum for the transaction of business.” According to the filing, 3.9 million shares voted for the proposed treasury, while 4.9 billion shares voted it down. Since founder Mark Zuckerberg controls approximately 60% of the shares, it can be reasonably assumed that Zuckerberg voted against the measure. Despite the BTC Treasury vote, Meta is still reportedly eyeing a venture into stablecoins amid growing interest and demand for digital assets.

Title: The Magnificent Seven Stocks Staged a Blistering May Rally. What's Next?

The Magnificent Seven had a strong May, but the group remains in the red for 2025. What's next? Taken together, the seven big tech stocks—names like Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Meta Platforms (META) and more—outperformed dozens of other assets tracked by Deutsche Bank analyst Henry Allen last month. The group saw their stocks rise more than 13% in aggregate in May, their biggest monthly gain in 2 years, according to Allen. Nonetheless, the group remains one of the few corners of global markets lower since the start of the year. Of 32 different sets of investments tracked by Allen—including global equity indexes, government and corporate bonds, foreign exchange indexes, and commodities—only one other asset, crude oil, is negative for the year. Whether the Mag Seven can climb into positive territory this month could depend on what Wall Street thinks of a few upcoming corporate events. Apple (AAPL) will host its Worldwide Developers Conference on June 9. The iPhone maker is expected to unveil a software development kit that helps outside developers build features with Apple Intelligence’s underlying large language models. That would effectively let Apple outsource some of the work of building AI products for its devices, which could help close the perceived gap in AI capabilities between it and major peers. And around the middle of the month, Tesla (TSLA) is expected to roll out its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in what could be a major test of the company’s autonomous vehicle ambitions. Apple and Tesla are the worst-performing stocks in the Mag Seven so far this year, with their shares down about 20% and 16%, respectively. Investor enthusiasm about the companies' progress in some emerging areas seen as vital could help lift their shares. Bank of America analysts on Monday upgraded the information technology sector—home to Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia, and Broadcom (AVGO), the latter a non-Magnificent stock—to neutral from underweight, and downgraded communications services—including Alphabet (GOOG) and Meta—to underweight from neutral. They cited active funds’ historically low exposure to IT and high exposure to communications, as well as the communications and media industry’s comparatively unpredictable revenue streams. Perceived recession risks have decreased in the last month thanks to easing tensions between the U.S. and China. Lately, though each side has accused the other in recent days of violating the terms of their agreement, demonstrating the fragility of their detente. The Mag Seven’s communications companies, Alphabet and Meta, likely have the most recession-proof ad businesses on the internet thanks to the sheer size of their audiences. Yet the tech giants face another risk, according to BofA analysts: Tech companies, they say, addressed elevated interest rates in 2023 by effectively “shortening duration”—they cut costs, reduced capital expenditures, and increased their cash returns. Today, Alphabet and Meta are locked in an all-out AI arms race, spending tens of billions of dollars a year on AI infrastructure. That spending could tie the companies’ hands in the event of a slowdown. Another risk for tech stocks is their price tag, according to BofA. Valuations have declined from their recent highs, but the stocks are still expensive—the Mag Seven's P/E ratio of 33.1 is well above the S&P 500's long-term average—and earnings expectations remain elevated.

(“Meta” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: META). Such investors are advised to contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980, ext. 7980. The investigation concerns whether Meta and certain of its officers and/or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices. [Click here for information about joining the class action] On May 15, 2025, the Wall Street Journal published an article entitled “Meta Is Delaying the Rollout of Its Flagship AI Model.” Citing “people familiar with the matter”, the article reported, in relevant part, that “[c]ompany engineers are struggling to significantly improve the capabilities of its “Behemoth” large-language model, leading to staff questions about whether the improvements over prior versions are significant enough to justify public release[.]” The article further reported that while originally “Behemoth was internally slated for an April release”, Meta subsequently “pushed an internal target for . . . Behemoth’s release to June” before “delay[ing] . . . to fall or later.” On this news, Meta’s stock price fell $19.02 per share, or 2.88%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $640.34 per share on May 16, 2025. Pomerantz LLP, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Paris, and Tel Aviv, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.

Title: How to uplift Canadian game makers? We asked them
URL: https://mobilesyrup.com/2025/06/02/canadian-gaming-industry-lack-of-recognition-greater-support/
Time Published: 2025-06-02T16:28:59Z
Full Content:
Over a year ago, I wrote a column titled “The Canadian video game industry deserves more recognition.” Despite being a relatively small country, Canada has a multi-billion-dollar gaming sector that’s among the biggest in the entire world, responsible for such globally beloved giants as Mass Effect, Dead by Daylight and Warframe, and indie darlings like Cuphead, Balatro and 1000xResist. And yet, few people seem to know about any of that. Much in the same way that Toronto’s Matt Johnson, the co-writer and director of 2023’s fantastic BlackBerry film, has talked about Canada getting little credit “on the world stage” for effectively inventing the smartphone, our national game creators don’t get much recognition for their significant contributions to pop culture. This was the impetus for my January 2024 column, although I wasn’t expecting it to strike such a chord. Before long, I had received hundreds of likes, comments and messages across social media, especially LinkedIn, with many Canadian game makers echoing my sentiment. Clearly, there was more to explore here. And explore that I did. Over the course of the past year and change, I’ve asked dozens of Canadian developers, actors, lobbyists and the like about how we can address this lack of recognition for our massive gaming industry. Some, admittedly, didn’t really have an answer, and that’s completely understandable. Others, meanwhile, presented all kinds of solutions, offering a great starting point for deeper conversations. And throughout all of this, U.S. government started launching vile and unwarranted attacks against Canadian sovereignty, which has only made these conversations about better supporting each other all the more important. In other words, how can we help Canada’s massive gaming industry get the recognition and support it deserves? Jayson Hilchie (former president and CEO of the Entertainment Software Association of Canada): We need people to understand how big the video game industry is in Canada that have nothing to do with the video game industry. When you live in a town and you have General Motors, or you have Ford and someone works there — when you say, “I work at Ford,” everybody knows what that means. But even to this day, with [about 34,000 people contributing $5.1 billion] to the Canadian economy, when you tell someone you work in the video game industry, they always still go, “Oh, really? That’s interesting.” But they don’t know what that means. For me, at least, how do we get working in the video game industry to be almost normalized and respected in a way where people are either not surprised or curious? It’d be great if we got to a spot where you could say, “Yeah, I work at Ubisoft, I work on Assassin’s Creed.” And people go, “Cool! And they know what that is.” But we’re not there. And it is still surprising to me, given how many people work in the industry, and also how ubiquitous video games have become, that we still have those types of responses. And I really think that until we get to that point [of] the average person understanding the impact of the industry that we’re going to have a depreciated level of respect across the country. Paul Fogolin (current president and CEO of the Entertainment Software Association of Canada): I’ve worked really hard over the last five or six years to help promote [the industry] to government officials [as the ESAC’s former vice president of policy and government affairs], but there’s just more work to do. It’s not just the MPs in Ottawa, it’s MPPs and MLAs across the country. It’s even councillors and mayors. The City of Toronto actually formed an esports working group, and we were invited to be a part of it, and I’d like to see more of those sorts of things. Interactive Ontario was there. We were there. The tourism people, the esports [people], academics [were there]. So we could do more to speak to player audiences and more to decision makers. The more that we get out there and we tell our story, the more people will start to realize. Remy Siu (founder of Vancouver’s Sunset Visitor, creative director of 1000xResist): I think maybe it’s time for the broader public and media in Canada to realize that Canadian indie games are one of the biggest cultural exports in the country, in the sense of new IP. People around the world may not know Canadian TV shows, for example, but I’m pretty sure they’ve played a Canadian indie game before. Have they played Celeste? Inscryption? Balatro? There’s always talk of how it’s a struggle (and it is) to get Canadian content made and distributed, but indie games are making Canadian content and being distributed to a wide global audience, and also being celebrated on the international stage for their work. Perhaps it’s time to look at these Canadian-made homegrown indie games, with the same sense of some beloved Canadian literature and content, and find a way to catalogue and celebrate them into the future. Vancouver-based Sunset Visitor’s 1000xResist won numerous awards last year, including a prestigious Peabody. (Image credit: Sunset Visitor) Navid Khavari (Ubisoft Toronto narrative director, Star Wars Outlaws): We have a wonderful team — a lot of the [Outlaws] story team is based in Ubisoft Toronto, and we’ve been developing this with our partners at [lead developer] Massive [Entertainment] in Sweden for years. We have a lot of great animators as well within [Toronto] studio, and folks from Ubisoft Montreal that have been contributing. All of the cinematics that we’ve shot have been in studios within Ubisoft Toronto and Ubisoft Montreal. So there’s absolutely just a huge wellspring of talent from Canada that’s been contributing to the game and giving some of that Canadian spirit and flavour, I think, to it. And it’s a beautiful thing with Ubisoft as well that we’re able to do that — that we’re able to work together across an entire ocean and it still feels cohesive. And I think it’s to the studio’s credit, to the talent we have across Canada, to be honest, that I think we’re able to hit the quality of bringing a Star Wars open-world game to life. Marc-Alexis Côté (Ubisoft’s vice president and executive producer of the Assassin’s Creed franchise): I think we should be proud of what we can accomplish in Canada. It’s one of the things I was telling the team recently. We have a talent to be able to build those games that’s very rare in the world — to be able to work together in such a way. There’s over 500 people in Quebec City who worked on [Assassin’s Creed Shadows]. We’ve got people in Montreal. We’ve got a few people in Toronto as well. But it’s like one big family coming together to be able to build those games. And I think it’s exciting. And I think it’s something we should promote more: our craft. Because we are very creative people, and I think we should be proud of that as a country and not hesitate to show it to the world. I think we should promote video games as art more globally — not just within Canada, but like globally. And be proud of it. When you look at the games that we build now, the investment, the talent, the passion that it requires, I can only hope that one day, video games are recognized with the same exposure as movies or music. But I think with the younger generations, for them, gaming is an extension of their life, so I think it’s going to take more and more players, and we just need to keep showing to the world the beautiful games that we can create. And I think our games need to speak for themselves more than us speak about our games in a way. So the more fun they will be, the more people they will draw in, and the more naturally people will look at us to see what the next big thing is. Carl-Edwin Michel (creator of the Canadian Game Awards): This community needs to be celebrated. It’s just an unfortunate situation. [Canada is] the third largest creator of video games in the world, and we don’t have our own celebration. That doesn’t make sense. The UK has one with the BAFTAs. Obviously, [there’s] The Game Awards [in the U.S.]. There’s so many different ones — D.I.C.E. [in Las Vegas], etc. There’s so many game awards, but there’s no real celebration of our industry […] The video game industry is covered in tech publications or in finance publications when it comes to, “This studio has millions of dollars of investment,” or “This studio is closing or they have layoffs.” That’s usually how the video game industry is covered […] I’m watching Breakfast Television in the morning and they have an entertainment segment and they talk about movies, they talk about TVs, they talk about music. Why don’t they talk about video games? It’s an entertainment medium that’s bigger than the movie and TV business combined. So why don’t we cover this industry as art, as a medium that’s consumed by millions and millions of people? Ubisoft Quebec’s Assassin’s Creed Shadows. (Image credit: Ubisoft) Jennifer Hale (Canadian-American actress in Mass Effect, Metal Gear, The Long Dark and more): That’s a piece of the Canadian culture: you don’t brag on yourself. You just don’t. A little [more] celebration might be in order! Leslie Quinton (Ubisoft’s vice president of communications, North America): We kind of punch above our weight, Canada, if you think about our population, in terms of our involvement in those kinds of high-level entertainment things. So the idea is that we definitely have this capacity in Canada. Maybe we’re too “Canadian modest.” We’re too humble! Prakash Amarasooriya (founder and CEO of Toronto-based pop-culture concert company Kashamara Productions): I think a lot of times, Canada hasn’t been seen as globally for its identity in the arts, which is really unfortunate, because we have actually quite a lot of talent. I think it’s just a reputation of being so close to the [U.S.] that we’re so often overlooked. A lot of our biggest stars are in the States, just because of the bigger market. And a lot of times, the Canadian identity also follows suit. And so we don’t get to hone that here. And I’ll be honest, I think Canada can do a lot better job of highlighting a lot of what we have to offer and showcase, “This is what the Canadian identity is about.” I think there’s a lot of opportunity here because of the fact that our Canadian identity is so diverse. And that’s why you have a South Asian man running a company that puts on Japanese projects, as well as other international projects, in a space that’s predominantly European. And I think that just speaks to what Canada is all about — that that can make sense here and also can be successful here. Scott Christian (Toronto’s Hilltop Studios co-founder, creative director, writer and composer on Lil’ Guardsman): I think the issue is how much does a game being made in Canada matter to gamers? There’s obviously a massive push right now to support Canadian-made, but the challenge for developers and publishers is how small relative to the American and international markets the Canadian market is. That being said, the work done by our small but mighty Canadian games media has an impact. I think there’s an opportunity for publishers of Canadian games to create sales, bundles, and events that take advantage of this moment for Canadian creators. But like I said, it’s a tough business case with our relatively small population. […] It would be wonderful to see a Canadian politician give the kind of recognition that France’s president recently lavished on Clair Obscur: Expedition 33’s developers in the wake of its success. [Editor’s note: the last time we saw something on this scale was former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeting about Cuphead‘s The Game Awards wins in 2017.] BioWare Edmonton’s Mass Effect series is one of the most beloved in the entire medium. (Image credit: BioWare) Lucie Lalumière (president and CEO of Interactive Ontario): We’ve seen growing awareness of Canada’s world-class video game industry, thanks in large part to journalists and influencers like you, as well as to a wave of grassroots, institutional, and business-led initiatives across the country. A standout example is that in 2025, the City of Toronto declared June as Video Game Month, the first time a Canadian city has made such a bold and public commitment to celebrate our sector. With over 30 events (and counting) planned across June and July, including Toronto Games Week and Giant Video Games, the public will experience the depth and diversity of our video game ecosystem. Funké Joseph (co-founder of Toronto-based Play Underground Games, winner of the Ubisoft Indie Series 2024): A lot of the [local] devs are super welcoming to us […] It clicked for me that Ontario is the spot — Toronto feels so good for making games. And I used to feel like we were so removed from the whole process with things being so L.A.-based and American or just global events. I was like, “It’s not even happening close to home.” But to see how warm and welcoming everyone is? It’s great […] It’s helpful to talk to people and just see all the people, especially at Ubisoft, that went through that experience with us. Jayson Hilchie: Back in 2019, we humanized the people who make video games and interviewed them in their studios [for a video series]. And they talked to us about what they did, where they were from, and how they got into the industry. I’ve been speaking about this since — how do we humanize the people who make games? And any way that we can, we can do that, whether it’s through videos, or whether it’s through interviews, or whether it’s through documentaries — all those things are going to help […] [But] we’re not hitting the average person with those videos. I doubt that they’re getting hit with [documentaries], either. [Electric Playground creator] Victor Lucas has said this numerous times — we’re just not getting the respect on TV. There’s no video game shows on TV. There’s video game shows on YouTube, the video game shows on the web, but there’s no video game shows on TV anymore. When you come home after school, you’re not seeing a show about video games. That used to be normal. And the video game industry has kind of inversely outpaced the TV focus on our industry. Like, we got a lot of focus in the ’90s when we weren’t that big. And now, we’re massive, and there’s nothing. So how do we increase mainstream media exposure of our industry when we’re massive, but there’s just no interest? I agree with Vic on that, it’s a little perplexing. Vancouver-based The Coalition’s Gears 5. (Image credit: Xbox) Rod Fergusson (Blizzard Entertainment’s general manager of Diablo, former longtime producer on Gears of War): I think it’s just trying to represent [Canadian developers] more. I tried to do that when I was in Vancouver at The Coalition. That’s my relationship with Victor [Lucas], and why [I was at Fan Expo] — the notion of being able to try to support the Canadian industry and try to have a little bit more representation. But we never really talked about [how] Gears 4 and Gears 5 were Canadian-made games. But you’re right. When you look at Vancouver and the BioWare stuff and all of the Ubisoft stuff in Montreal, there’s a lot of games here, but we don’t really trumpet it out that “There’s our Canadian games.” So I think it’s more about how we build recognition. But again, it goes down to people. Because I am Canadian, and I tended to be the face of Gears, I tried to be a little bit more out there. But when you think about the two founders of BioWare who retired, the doctors [Ray Muzyka and Greg Zeschuk, who co-founded the studio alongside Augustine Yip]… There isn’t really a face of Ubisoft in Montreal. Who’s the personality? And so I think that’s something that’s missing — we don’t have the “movie director face” in the Canadian industry. Who’s the “Vancouver person?” Now that I’m not there, who’s the face of The Coalition right now? They don’t really have one. Who’s the face of all the other stuff? There’s a very great thriving industry in Vancouver, but there aren’t a lot of faces. So I think if we could get more personalities to pop, then we can bring more attention to it. Megan Everett (director of community and live ops at London, Ontario’s Digital Extremes, Warframe): I didn’t even know DE existed and I’ve lived [in London] my entire life. I had no idea it existed. And for obvious reasons, we keep it a little more secret for safety reasons. But we’ve been trying more and more to kind of go that “Canadian grassroots” route [in DE’s popular community videos.] [Creative director] Rebb [Ford] has recently been saying a lot that we’re very “Wayne’s World” in our approach to how we appear and goof off and do that with our players. So I think we’re trying to leverage the more “Canadian-isms” that we have. Leslie Quinton: We had an event [in 2022] where we brought fans in and it was amazing. They were taking pictures of computers that were turned off saying, ‘This is where Rainbow Six is made!” And they were so excited. So we want to show that openness, because there’s not at all a hidden agenda. And also, we need more people in tech. There are simply not enough people — not just in video games, but technology in general. So showing people all the interesting sides to it is obviously in our interest and the interest of the industry. So part of it is making sure we continue to be very visible — these university competitions we do [like the Ubisoft Game Lab Competition] have great visibility and are extremely appealing. Matthieu Dupont (Gameloft Montreal studio head, Disney Dreamlight Valley): I feel putting forward the people who are making the game, so not only the studio heads and the execs, but also the Canadian developers, the Quebecois developers, the Ontarian developers that are working on the game, doing the code, the graphics, the design, [letting] them speak at events, gather them into cross-studio industry events… And hopefully, people start to notice. We have a lot of success, but if you ask players, they don’t necessarily know where the game has been made. Sometimes they don’t care as well; they just want to enjoy the game. But even industry-wise, I think we can do better of giving the mic to developers and let them speak for themselves. Jennifer Hale: One of the things I want to do is reach out to indie devs in Canada, especially. I want to work with Canadian indie devs. I want to support them. It’s not even about me having a role in the game. What I want to focus on is, “How can I support you? How can we all connect?” I have witnessed — quite directly, unfortunately — a disconnect between the Canadian actors union in B.C. and indie developers. I experienced some quite antagonistic stuff that shocked me, honestly, and made me want to reach very directly out to devs to see what I can do to support them. Humberly González giving a rare performance-capture demonstration at Ubisoft Toronto for Star Wars Outlaws. Humberly González (Venezuelan-Canadian actress, Star Wars Outlaws, Ginny & Georgia): I really believe in Canadian talent — there are incredible artists there that maybe sometimes get overlooked because we’re on the other side of the border. But the reality is that they come to us and they cast locally because there is talent. Sometimes the odd one makes it out and they go, “Oh, my goodness,” or when I meet fans and I tell them that I’m based out of Toronto and that we shot the show here, or the movie here, or the game here, and they go, “Really?” And I go, “Yeah! A lot of our cast is actually Canadian.” There are a lot of opportunities [in Canada]. There’s people who are such creators, especially in Toronto — there’s a very creative indie scene, and there’s people who go to school there and stay there and live there. And I think it is such a melting pot of so many different cultures and languages and food. I love Toronto, I love living [here]. Amanda Farough (Canadian game writer, producer, consultant and analyst, Strange Scaffold): We need to be loud, we need to be proud, and we need to keep moving that mission forward — that Canadian games are some of the best games in the world. 1000xResist wouldn’t exist if not for government funding, and, quite frankly, other Canadians taking a chance on a brand-new studio […] We need more of that: more Canadian stories, more stories that celebrate the mosaic of our culture, not the homogeny of our culture, because it’s not homogenous. That is the thing that makes Canada so strong and so beautiful: we are telling distinctly Canadian stories through places like through stories like Venba. That is a distinctly Canadian story, but you wouldn’t know that unless you’re Canadian, unless you, too, grew up in your own diaspora, or you, too, grew up alongside a diaspora. I’m just a white girl from Kamloops, but my friends growing up, a good chunk of them [and] their families, were from all over the globe, and I grew up eating foods that other white kids weren’t eating, and it was such a beautiful education for the kind of life I wanted to live and the kind of life I wanted for my future children. And I love the mosaic of our culture, and we need more stories, more studios, more funding, and louder people to advocate for how amazing the Canadian mosaic is. And it doesn’t have to be stereotypical. Our stories are quiet. That’s what makes our stories so impactful, is that they’re quiet. They’re unassuming. But as Canadians and as Canadian developers, we have to be a lot louder! Venba from Toronto-based Visai Games was one of 2023’s most acclaimed games, winning praise for its strong narrative about an Indo-Canadian family. (Image credit: Visai Games) Jeff Mundee (University of New Brunswick professor, co-founder of Fredericton’s Reframe Games, Noxia Somnia): The thing in New Brunswick is that there’s a lot of communities spread out, and so it’s hard to get people to group and do something more. There’s a lot of hidden game development talent and a lot of game development projects that are hiding out. And I believe that we are stronger together. I want to really push for bringing the groups together and making a go of New Brunswick of being more than just a supplier of talents [and] making more games here. Remy Siu: I think it’s important [to talk about funding] because I really do like thinking about logistics, constraints, and context, and how all those things may affect an artwork. In my previous artistic life, I would watch documentaries about big-name visual artists, working at huge scales, intersecting huge sites, and it would always be awe inspiring, but sometimes I wish they showed how the whole thing was funded — the mundane side of it — how was it produced? I want to see artists in meetings talking to stakeholders and institutions. How did they convince people to do it? To fund it? Maybe that might seem boring to the general watching audience, but I’m sometimes worried that the general populace may think an artist has an idea and then just kind of waves their hand and makes it happen. Whereas, in my experience, most artists are working within tight constraints, and how they deal with those constraints have as much to do with the art as anything. Manda Farough: There are so many studios out there that are dying because there is no money, and the money that is out there is from really questionable places sometimes. I’m not saying universally, but in the United States, which is where I live now, there’s no grants. There’s no funding down here. We don’t have the Canada Media Fund down here. We don’t have Ontario Creates. We don’t have B.C. arts funds. Sasha Boersma (co-founder of Toronto’s Sticky Brain Studios, Rooster): [Our point-and-click Chinese culture and community game Rooster] is heavy on art and animation and wanting it to look right and feel right, so it’s all that finessing. We’ve made 12 minigames with very, very, very simple mechanics. But it’s the magic around it. That’s really what’s taxing on the dev team, and so we just put our decisions in a different place. And we can do that thanks to the Canada Media Fund and Ontario Creates — we’re not beholden to what a publisher says we can give. We can try something different, which is why CMF calls it “envelope innovation.” We’re innovating in a way that no publisher would ever give us funding to be able to try. Funké Joseph: If you’re from Canada, there’s a lot of opportunities to get funding — to prototype, to make something bigger that you want to get commercial — in so many different places in our country. Because not many other places have those opportunities. So I think especially if you’re in Canada, look into those different grants and funding options, and apply. Sometimes, people are like, “I don’t know if I should apply.” Apply! They want people to apply to these things because otherwise, they’re not going to be giving out money. They just want creative projects, a lot of these funders. So if you have that fire, there’s people that can help fund you for “X amount of time” to make that into whatever you want with that idea. So I just want people to know what’s possible and look it up. Lil’ Guardsman is the debut title from Toronto’s Hilltop Studios and has garnered significant acclaim. (Image credit: Hilltop Studios) Lucie Lalumière: Canada has the techno-creative talent. We have the entrepreneurial drive. But we’re not yet seizing the full market opportunity in front of us. The global video game industry now generates more revenue than the film and music industries combined, a clear signal of its cultural influence and economic weight. Take Ontario as an example. While it produces globally successful games across all genres and platforms; develops top-tier techno-creative talent; and represents roughly 40 per cent of Canada’s population; it holds only about 20 per cent of the country’s video game jobs. To bridge that gap and truly compete on a global scale, we need to: cut red tape around existing business incentives; remove barriers to interprovincial collaboration, take bold action to attract and encourage investment and support inbound and outbound international business development. Scott Christian: In so many ways, gaming is borderless. I would love a robust domestic publishing scene, but I don’t think that would have as much impact as increased investment and support for CMF and Ontario Creates grant funding. I think this is what would seed more Canadian and Ontario teams and projects and would have the biggest positive impact. Lil’ Guardsman was supported by a traditional publisher model, which is less and less the norm these days it seems. With Hilltop’s latest project, we applied for these grants, and were successful with one. It’s a lifeline for Canadian developers, and coupled with the OIDMTC (Ontario Interactive Digital Media Tax Credit), these programs make it possible for small teams like ours to thrive. These programs work to guarantee that games jobs aren’t leaving the country (or the province with Ontario Creates), which I think is important. Lucie Lalumière: Ontario’s video game ecosystem stands out for its highly skilled and innovative techno-creative talent, diverse and globally minded workforce, entrepreneurial spirit, and economic development incentives, including the new Ontario Creates IP Development Fund and the Ontario Interactive Digital Media Tax Credit. However, many studios are currently experiencing significant delays in the processing of the tax credit. These delays slow investment in talent and IP development, undermining the credit’s effectiveness and limiting Ontario’s ability to fully capitalize on growing global opportunities. At a time when the video game sector can meaningfully contribute to Ontario’s economy and innovation agenda, this bottleneck is especially concerning. The Ontario government has acknowledged the issue and pledged to address it. The industry is hopeful that a timely solution will help restore this key incentive’s full effectiveness in supporting the growth of Ontario’s video game ecosystem. Mathieu Côté (Montreal’s Behaviour Interactive — game director and head of partnerships on Dead by Daylight): Most of those big companies [in Canada] are not Canadian. Ubisoft is right next door here — they’re French, for the most part. You have Warner Bros., that’s set up not very far away, but they’re American. You’ve got Electronic Arts that has an office, Amazon Games is literally across the street. We have NetEase right there. There’s more and more of those gigantic studios from around the world, which is amazing because it yields a lot of really cool talent, and it makes people grow and it gives people jobs here. But it’s really, really cool to be part of one of the rare Canadian Quebec companies that is still, to this day, very much a Canadian company. Behaviour Interactive, the developer of the massively popular Dead by Daylight, is one of the few major Canadian-owned developers. (Image credit: Behaviour Interactive) Miriam Verburg (CEO and executive producer, Toronto’s Bloom Digital Media, Disney Villains Cursed Cafe): I’ve long supported the idea of developing a publishing fund in Canada […] We could access support for publishing by banding together to create cooperatives to publish together — creating marketing resources that we can share so that we can go out to the wider world with a little bit more ease. And localized games. There is no way to get support for game localization in Canada — like nothing — unless you get a publisher. So if you have a game that’s in English and you want to localize it, you’re just footing the bill yourself and taking that out of revenue, unless you get a publisher, and there are no Canadian publishers. So then if you want to localize your game, you’re going to a publisher in a different country to get your game localized, to get it published, and then that publisher is taking between 50 to 70 per cent of your launch day profits. How can we grow the industry, then? How could we get attention to Canadian games, if we are unwilling to fund anything to do with their sale of marketing? If all we do is go, ‘Okay, let’s, let’s fund production, let’s figure out how to get things made, and then it’s up to the game producers.’ Manda Farough: Let’s be real. What is our publishing landscape at home? It doesn’t really exist [And] what generally tends to go into the back half of putting a game together is you need things like release management — publishing services can do that. You need help with PR, help with marketing, help with working with influencers, localization, quality assurance, localization quality assurance. So I feel like putting together shared resources among developers that have already learned these lessons gives everybody access to knowledge, even if they don’t have access to the services themselves […] Because I think that for the most part, publishing is going to continue to be sparse. There aren’t a ton of independent developers left in the major cities in Canada — all over the place, we’re not even just looking at Ontario or even Quebec. In my home province [B.C.], there were a lot of independent studios once upon a time. It’s too expensive. It’s too expensive to be a developer in Canada a lot of the time, and to scale that, you need equity and you need investment. And that’s also another thing that’s really difficult, private investment, and that’s very difficult to come by in Canada […] Being able to pool those resources is a way to make sure that we’re elevating Canadian developers, and not necessarily putting them at risk, which is nice. Remy Siu: I think we have to figure out a way for banks to bridge-fund indie games at reasonable interest rates, especially based on the milestone systems that most of these funding bodies work on. Both in film and in indie games, the funding bodies expect some level of bridge funding and that can be difficult to get, or expensive […] I’m also not sure why there aren’t more publishers in Canada. I wonder if the digital media tax credits can be extended to those types of entities, for their labour spend (if they don’t already). I will say in Canada, I think we have a lot of self-publishing indie stars! Venba, Slay the Princess, Celeste, and more. Perhaps the culture and environment here does foster the self-publishing indie spirit. Lucie Laumière: Even if more Canadian publishers were to emerge, independent video game studios would still choose partners based not on geography, but on fit. Does the publisher understand the genre? Do they have the right platform relationships? Can they effectively reach the players and influencers in their target markets? Publishing is a global business, and most publishers, Canadian or otherwise, select games based on their market potential, not national origin, unless incentivized to do otherwise. The greater challenge for indie studios isn’t the absence of large-scale Canadian publishers, but the need for more robust support for IP development and commercialization. Today, most publishers expect some level of market validation before committing to a title. That means indie studios must invest early in iterative, market-tested prototyping, marketing and community building to demonstrate a game’s potential. So why not self-publish? Many studios now assume they will, knowing that strong market traction can help attract publishers or investors down the line, and give them greater leverage to negotiate favourable terms if they choose to pursue those partnerships. To keep pace with these industry dynamics, Canada must strengthen its strategic investment in programs like those offered by the Canada Media Fund, particularly to expand support for video game prototyping, marketing and community building. These investments play a critical role in helping Canadian studios bring original IP to market, scale their businesses, and compete in a fast-moving global industry. Carl-Edwin Michel: I actually had that discussion with one of the studios that is coming on board [the CGAs] and they were saying to me that [business-to-business], for them, was the most important thing. Because that’s where they get investors and the support to get their game created. And they were really like, ‘Yeah, the consumer is always going to be there. People are going to buy games. We have the community, it’s fine. And also, we’re a smaller country when you compare us to the U.S. So a PAX or some of those big events, they go to where they think there’ll be a lot of people coming in, and also that they can generate a lot of revenue. I wasn’t in the books of [EGLX], but it was the last big consumer event that we had right in the country. We don’t have to go crazy. We can do something that is decent size and go from there. For me, the Eh! Game Expo [a free public exhibition of demos in Toronto] is a start, and I have a plan to make this thing grow. But I want to grow it organically, and I’m not going to fake it and put investment money to it, and just go to [Scotiabank Arena] or whatever and do something crazy. Strand is the first game from the small new Montreal developer Exnilo Studio. (Image credit: Exnilo) Allie Wilde (PR and marketing lead at Montreal’s Studio Exnilo, Strand): Events like the Eh! Expo are huge for indie devs, especially in Canada, where we don’t have many consumer-facing opportunities like this. Conferences can be really expensive, and like other indie teams, we can’t just dig up loot buried in our backyard to fund every event. So when something like the Eh! Expo comes along, giving us a chance to showcase our game to real players without breaking the bank, it’s massively valuable. Getting direct access to our community and sharing the game hands-on is one of the most important assets we have. As a small team working from home, that can be tough. Seeing players experience Strand in person, watching their reactions, and hearing real-time feedback is crazy valuable. It helps us refine the experience and makes all the difference in shaping the game into something truly special. Beyond just our game, though, there is so much Canadian talent out there. So many emerging studios, all creating amazing work, and we’re all incredibly keen to lift each other up. More events like this wouldn’t just help individual studios, they’d strengthen the entire Canadian gaming scene. We believe “more is more” when it comes to these kinds of opportunities, and we’d love to see even more public-facing gaming events in Canada in the future. Scott Christian: The return of the Canadian Game Awards this year had an impact, and I dream (and scheme) about a “Canadian Indie Games festival” and awards event with a specific focus on Canada’s robust indie game scene. Lucie Lalumière: We’re beginning to see a welcome resurgence of [business to consumer] video game expos in Canada, most notably Game Con Canada in Alberta and the newly announced Video Game Live Expo (VGLX) in Ontario. There are also an increasing number of opportunities for players to engage with games in development, such as The G.R.I.D., a new playtesting-focused event in Toronto […] The province also showcases unique initiatives such as Level Up Showcase, the largest exhibition of student-made games in Canada [and Digital Extremes’] TennoCon, the country’s largest fan event organized by a studio, drawing thousands from around the world to London each year [for Warframe]… On the [business to business] front, Interactive Ontario and our peers at the Canadian Interactive Alliance/l’Alliance Interactive Canadienne (CIAIC) are actively working with XP Gaming Inc. and the Government of Canada to bring international publishers to Canada. Our goal is to create cost-effective, high-impact business opportunities for developers at flagship events like XP Game Summit. Programs like Ontario Creates’ Global Market Development are also essential in supporting international business development, and would benefit from enhanced investment to meet growing demand. That said, the way games are promoted and discovered is evolving. Large-scale in-person/online hybrid showcases like Summer Game Fest; fully digital showcases like Wholesome Games; and global digital storefront campaigns, such as a potential Canada-focused Steam Sale, are becoming vital tools for reaching players, influencers, and industry partners worldwide. That’s why we’re also excited to see new hybrid initiatives emerging in Canada, such as Pixel Power Play in Toronto, which blends public-facing engagement with digital amplification, connecting fans, creators, and influencers, while showcasing Canada’s creative excellence to the world. Thousands of TennoCon attendees wait for a live presentation about the future of Warframe at TennoCon 2024. Megan Everett: Having [our Warframe fan event TennoCon] in London does feel special, because this is where DE has always been. And it gives back to the community, a little bit. It boosts London for hotels, and travel, and people just learn about London. And we try, as we’re doing TennoCon, to let people know best restaurants to go to, bars to go to, libraries to go to. So we’re trying to give back to London as they’ve kind of given us this space. So it’s special to us. And it also is really nice for the employees here being able to bring their family and their friends to it, because most of us are local. So we’re able to have like one big celebration, and you just can’t beat being at home. It’s very comfortable. And logistically, it just makes sense. Dan Vader (game director at Toronto’s Capybara Games, Battle Vision Network): What I love about [something like] Day of the Devs [a non-profit promoting indies] is it puts faces to who makes your games — it shows you the real human beings that are making these things that you love, where they’re from, and I think that’s a great way to demystify the process of making games. It’s just a bunch of people who are inspired to make cool things. There are so many Canadian developers making so many games big and small, and I often get surprised when I find out that this game I’m playing is actually not just from a Canadian dev, but a Toronto dev. I even get surprised by that, and I’m in the industry. And I think if more Canadians, especially young Canadians, knew how big it was, how many opportunities there might be, it might steer the course of their lives. Because when I grew up, I didn’t think video games were made in Canada, I thought they were made somewhere very far off — it was not possible to get into them. And the truth is that there are multitudes of games being made in Canada. These responses have been slightly edited for clarity and length.

Title: How Corporate Events Are Changing To Fit Business Needs

ByMegan Poinski ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff. In this uncertain time for business, a recent PwC survey found that more executives now have confidence in the effectiveness of their boards. That’s good news—until you look at the percentage. Only 35% rate their boards’ overall effectiveness as excellent or good, up from 30% in last year’s study. And that’s actually still more of an improvement: 29% gave that rating in 2021 and 2022. In its survey, PwC spoke with 500 executives in different positions, ranging from CEO to chief legal officer and COO. CEOs had the best view of their boards, with 94% saying they were excellent or good. CFOs also viewed them favorably, with 72% ranking them in good esteem. PwC said this may reflect boards getting better in some ways—with members chosen to provide oversight and financial guidance. And the executives that interact the most with boards do tend to rank them the highest. Board members still may be missing some critical expertise, however. Nearly four in five CIOs ranked their boards as fair or poor, which may reflect a lack of knowledge about technology, cybersecurity and AI among members. About 43% of executives said they wanted AI expertise added to their boards this year, but only 10% of board members expected that to happen. Executives and board members both felt that AI is a top priority for boards in the next 12 months. Regardless, the majority of executives believe their boards can come through when needed. Seven in 10 said they believe their board can guide the company through a crisis, while 88% feel their boards can effectively engage with shareholders. And when changes are needed, six in 10 execs are confident that boards can assess their own performance and make needed shifts. Whether that faith in the boards is merited remains to be seen. As the year progresses into the unknown, the strengths of these boards—and executives’ confidence in them—are likely to be put to the test. Even though the shutdowns of the Covid-19 pandemic era are in the rearview mirror, corporate events and trade shows are becoming increasingly important to businesses. I spoke with Janet Dell, CEO of events company Freeman, about how events are changing to reflect today’s workforce—both in attendees and goals. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. President Donald Trump displays a signed executive order imposing tariffs on imported goods at the “Liberation Day” press conference. The majority of President Donald Trump’s new tariffs were struck down in two federal court cases last week, although it’s certainly not the end of the issue. A three-judge panel at the Court of International Trade ruled that the so-called reciprocal tariffs announced as part of Trump’s “Liberation Day” press conference should be “set aside.” The panel ruled that Trump did not have the authority to impose unlimited tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which gives presidents the power to impose sanctions during national emergencies. In a second lawsuit brought by a group of companies, Washington, D.C. District Judge Rudolph Contreras also found the tariffs to be illegal. But for now, the tariffs—or threat thereof—are still on. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit paused the order halting the tariffs while those judges rule on an appeal. In the meantime, there is still action with new tariffs and existing negotiations. Trump announced a 50% tariff on imported steel and aluminum last week, which goes into effect this week, at an event at U.S. Steel. And negotiations continued last week with China, although progress remains unclear. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last Thursday that talks have stalled. Friday morning, Trump wrote on Truth Social that China “HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US.” Monday morning, Chinese authorities shot back, accusing the U.S. of breaching the agreement that both countries came to last month, saying the U.S. introduced “discriminatory restrictive measures against China” after the talks, including expanded export controls on AI chips and other chip-building technologies. Regardless of the broader tariff fight, companies are now starting to reflect the impacts—or projected impacts—in their earnings reports. Forbes senior contributor Shelley E. Kohan analyzed how the nation’s five largest retailers—Walmart, Amazon, Costco, Kroger and Home Depot—are handling tariffs. Companies with significant non-grocery sales have pulled forward inventory purchases before tariffs took effect, trying to stay ahead of the impacts on price. Home Depot executives said they can maintain competitive prices and don’t expect broad increases, while Walmart executives indicated that they will not be able to completely mitigate tariff-related increases. Costco, Kroger and Walmart are all trying to keep their food prices down, especially since consumers have been paying more over the last several years—though popular products, including bananas, coffee, avocados and flowers, are almost always imported. Meanwhile, many of the companies are changing their supply strategies, not relying on any one country for goods or manufacturing. Many businesses continued to lower their outlooks for the rest of the year, given tariff uncertainty. Last week, Best Buy, Macy’s and Abercrombie & Fitch all reduced their sales and earnings projections for the year. President Donald Trump walks with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell in 2017. Last week was another bumpy ride for the stock market, with ups and downs related to tariffs, government financial reports and Big Tech. April’s inflation figures remained relatively mild, not yet showing the impact of President Donald Trump’s tariff policies. Personal consumption expenditures increased 2.1% above April 2024, the lowest PCE inflation rate since last September, and getting close to the Federal Reserve’s sweet spot of 2% inflation. However, economists at Bank of America and Goldman Sachs both forecast a jump in tariff-related inflation to 3.6% by December—though they say it is not expected to be as sharp of a jolt in price as the post-pandemic inflation of 2021 and 2022. The lower inflation rate, however, doesn’t mean that interest rate cuts are set to happen anytime soon. Minutes from the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee’s early May meeting were released last week, and they indicated that the Fed is planning to continue to watch the impacts of Trump’s planned policies—which to date have been sudden, jarring and unpredictable—before making any moves, writes Forbes senior contributor Charles Lloyd Bovaird II. Forbes senior contributor Erik Sherman writes it’s unlikely there will be any changes to interest rates before the end of the year. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell met with Trump last week, and Powell reaffirmed that the Fed would continue to make policy decisions “based solely on careful, objective, and non-political analysis.” Regardless of the indicators last week, small businesses are feeling decidedly less optimistic, writes Forbes’ Brandon Kochkodin. The April Small Business Optimism Index, published monthly by the National Federation of Independent Business, showed optimism down to 95.8, below the 51-year average of 98, and down 1.6% from March. Retail business owners had the lowest scores, with optimism of 93.7. More than three-quarters said supply chain issues were impacting their business, and 14% said their inventories were too low. But negative feelings are running high across all sectors; the most confident sector in April was construction, and that was down nearly 4 points from January. getty As federal government attitudes on diversity, equity and inclusion push the issue to the back of corporate priorities, companies are talking about it a whole lot less. According to an analysis by Gravity Research, references to DEI and associated terminology in Fortune 100 company reports dropped 72% between 2024 and 2025. The acronym DEI saw the largest drop in mentions—down 98%—while more neutral terms about diversifying, such as “inclusion” and “belonging” were down by more than a third. The only place where mentions of DEI increased was on earnings calls, where the term came up 390% more often—but usually because of more shareholder questions about it. Gravity Research Vice President of Thought Leadership Joanna Piacenza said the report “speaks volumes to the current political environment,” which has made diversity initiatives a polarizing issue—as well as a legal one. Freeman CEO Janet Dell. Events have retained their popularity through the pandemic, but are changing based on attendees and preferences. I talked to Janet Dell, CEO of global event company Freeman, about why events are still so successful and vital for business. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. During the pandemic and soon afterwards, many Baby Boomers retired, and the workforce now has many more Millennials and Gen Zers. How have events changed to reflect the age of the attendees? Dell: Each of the demographics has a different preference in general. The younger demographics—Gens Z and Alpha and Millennials—want that face-to-face engagement. They’re looking for ways to get more professional development opportunities, connect with buyers, learn about what’s cutting edge in their industry in particular, because there’s a lot more hybrid working arrangements. Events are turning into “bleisure” events, where you’re going out for the event and staying a few days after. [Event organizers] are looking at ways to make it easier [to engage with audiences that are] digital native versus digital hybrid. We’re helping support events, partnering with AI tools that can help [exhibitors] match-make. Or [the AI] can help you understand [attendee] dwell times and engagement when you go through booth[s]. So our exhibitors know: Is this impactful content? Am I optimally set up? [We also make] sure there’s more time in the events for people to talk to one another. I would say one of the bigger changes pre- and post- pandemic is not overscheduling, and trying to give people more time to engage and immerse, and not just going back-to-back-to-back on things, straight into a happy hour, then a dinner, et cetera. There’s more of a consumer slant versus B2B, where they’re really thinking about the customized individual experience versus a blanket use-the-same-formulas-as-they-did-before. We’ve got a lot of new, fresh ideas, married with a lot of long-tenured people that have been in events, experience and exhibits for a long time. Looking at some of the recent research Freeman has done, people place a huge amount of trust in what they see, learn and experience at events. Has it always been that way? It’s always been the most powerful medium for building trust is face-to-face. You can’t beat bringing someone together, having a conversation, reading the verbal and the nonverbal cues, and then interacting live. That’s what people missed in the pandemic, and why there was this incredible pent up demand. We saw virtual events be adopted. They have a place, and it’s much more inclusive. But then when people came back,[there was] just incredible demand, and it held up. Ninety-four percent say this is the biggest trust-building medium. It allows you to grow your interpersonal skills. You can gain professional confidence, and you stay on cutting edge in the industry. It also helps close business, in terms of commerce and retain clients because you’re showing them all the benefits of what you’re doing. Once you leave that event, 87% of the people that have attended are more likely to go to your website. You’ve got that 365-day connection, which is what you want to see with your clients to make sure that they stay loyal to your brand. What do executives need to know about events? They need to be clear on what their objective is. We do thousands of events a year and we bring in 400,000 to 500,000 exhibitors. [Executives] have to be clear on what their objective is for the event. Why would you be attending? You can get matched up with the right event to be able to take advantage of that. If you can do that, then you can start planning out how you're going to take advantage of it, whether it’s through sessions, keynote speakers, the trade show floor, experiences or one-to-one special events like hosted-buyer-type scenarios. All those things can have a more personalized experience and therefore a better return on it.

June 02, 2025 12:07 ET | Source: Pomerantz LLP Pomerantz LLP NEW YORK, June 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV). Such investors are advised to contact Danielle Peyton at newaction@pomlaw.com or 646-581-9980, (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 7980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. The class action concerns whether Elevance and certain of its officers and/or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices. You have until July 11, 2025 to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class if you purchased or otherwise acquired Elevance securities during the Class Period. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. [Click here for information about joining the class action] On July 17, 2024, Elevance hosted a conference call to discuss its financial results for the second quarter of 2024. During the call, Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Gail Boudreaux revealed that “[a]s a result of redeterminations, our Medicaid membership mix has shifted, resulting in increased acuity,” and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) Mark Kaye stated that Elevance was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.” Kaye elaborated that the Company was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population, including in outpatient home health, radiology, durable medical equipment, as well as some elective procedures.” On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $32.21 per share, or 5.8%, to close at $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance hosted a conference call to discuss its financial results for the third quarter of 2024. During the call, CEO Boudreaux revealed that the Company’s “third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share were $8.37, which was below our expectations, primarily due to elevated medical costs in our Medicaid business.” Boudreaux further revealed that Elevance had reduced its full-year outlook for adjusted diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) from $37.20 to “approximately $33”—despite the fact that the Company had reiterated its EPS guidance just three months earlier. When questioned about the sudden change in Medicaid cost trends, CFO Kaye explained that “we experienced accelerated cost trends in Medicaid throughout the third quarter” and “saw unfavorable prior-period development related to the current year, specifically in our Medicaid business.” On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $52.61 per share, or 10.6%, to close at $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

June 02, 2025 12:00 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, June 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming July 21, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (“DoubleVerify” or the “Company”) (NYSE: DV) common stock between November 10, 2023 and February 27, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR DOUBLEVERIFY INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On May 7, 2024, DoubleVerify released its first quarter 2024 financial results and reduced its 2024 revenue guidance, disclosing that there had been a pullback in customer spending on advertising. On this news, DoubleVerify’s stock price fell $11.79, or 38.6%, to close at $18.78 per share on May 8, 2024, thereby injuring investors. Then, on February 27, 2025, DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending. The Company also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was having a negative impact on the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify’s stock price fell $7.83, or 36%, to close at $13.90 per share on February 28, 2025. Then, on March 28, 2025, Adalytics Research, LLC published a report alleging, among other things, that DoubleVerify’s web advertisement verification and fraud protection services were ineffective and that its customers were regularly billed for ad impressions served to bots. The same day, The Wall Street Journal reported that DoubleVerify regularly missed detection of nonhuman traffic despite the Company’s claims that it helps brands avoid serving ads to nonhuman bot accounts. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (2) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on its Activation Services was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (3) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (4) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (5) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (6) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (7) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired DoubleVerify securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than July 21, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

With seven senior Diamond Comics staffers now at Alliance Entertainment or AENT. Alliance Entertainment is, of course, the company that successful won the auction to buy Diamond Comic Distributors as part of their Chapter 11 bankruptcy process, saw Diamond reject that deal, only for the bankruptcy courts to reinstate it, and then for AENT to pull out again, alleging fraud over the way the Wizard Of The Coasts contracts were presented. And is now suing Diamond over these allegations. So, yes, Alliance Entertainment, AENT, the company that is suing Diamond for millions after having tried very hard to acquire the distributor, has just hired five of Diamond's longest-standing staff members, and given them senior positions within the company. AENT boss Bruce Ogilvie is looking smarter by the day. Just as long as he doesn't go on any podcasts to talk about it all.

Title: Meta is going all-in on AI advertising

Meta (META) believes that the source of 97% of its revenue can be fully automated by AI: its ads. By the end of 2026, Mark Zuckerberg’s company will employ AI to work with brands to create their own advertising — imagery, video and text — and then target them to specific users on Meta platforms, according to The Wall Street Journal. The ads could even be made specific to geolocation and time, reflecting local scenery or weather conditions in the imagery. Along with potentially making design departments obsolete, it could disrupt video production as well. Major advertising companies such as Omnicom Group saw their stock prices drop following the news. On an earnings call for Meta’s Q1 2025 report in April, Zuckerberg said, “AI has already made us better at targeting and finding the audiences that will be interested in [businesses’] products. I think that this is really redefining what advertising is — into an AI agent that delivers measurable business results at scale.” Meta’s first-quarter revenue was up 16% year-over-year, to $42.31 billion. Ad impressions were up 5%; the average ad price increased 10% year-over-year. Use of AI tools in creating ads increased by 30% that quarter. “If we deliver on this vision, then over the coming years, I think that the increased productivity from AI will make advertising a meaningfully larger share of global GDP than it is today,” Zuckerberg said then. The company is putting its money where Zuckerberg’s mouth is, investing $65 billion in AI infrastructure in 2025. Last month, Zuckerberg was touting the idea of AI friends and chatbot therapists as a solution to the loneliness epidemic.

June 02, 2025 08:47 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, June 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024.

Title: Luxury Brands Sweat Consumer Discounting After Price Hikes

Brands that cater to the uber wealthy saw a dip in sales for the first quarter of 2025, continuing a slowdown that started last year. Crystal Kim Guest Contributor to The Daily Upside Everything is not so “gucci” in the world of luxury goods. Brands that cater to the uber-wealthy, including LVMH’s Christian Dior, Kering’s Gucci, and Chanel, saw a dip in sales for the first quarter of 2025, continuing a slowdown that started last year. While CEOs of luxury goods retailers are chalking up the challenging environment to macroeconomic turbulence, market analysis suggests the industry’s excesses of the past few years could be contributing to weakness. While luxury goods companies have largely been immune to the state of economies, the decline that started last year could accelerate into 2025, Morgan Stanley analysts Eduoard Aubin and Arunima Sinha said last week during a state-of-the-market discussion at the firm’s luxury conference in Paris. Chinese nationals and Americans, the two cohorts expected to drive more than 50% of total spending in the next three to five years, are traveling less. Fewer Americans are heading to Europe, and fewer Chinese people are flying to Japan, which could translate to weaker sales in the second quarter than in the first, according to the analysts. Waning business optimism about China and weakness in US consumer spending also do not bode well for the industry. Chanel, which usually raises prices a couple of times a year, is in wait-and-see mode on potential hikes, global CFO Philippe Blondiaux said in a recent interview with Vogue Business. Some luxury retailers are chugging along, with Hermès and Cartier parent Richemont reporting sales growth in the first quarter of 2025 from the year prior. The price of the smallest Birkin bag rose to $12,700 in May, per Sotheby’s. Luxury brand companies’ best years coincided with the largest increases in US households’ net worth. Profits nearly tripled between 2019 and 2024, with the four biggest luxury companies — LVMH, Hermès, Richemont, and Kering — taking the lion’s share, per a McKinsey report published in January. Price hikes, some of which were as high as 100% on certain goods, accounted for approximately 80% of industry growth during that period, the report stated. Demand for leather handbags, branded jewelry, and watches reached a fever pitch as US households’ net worth rose by $51 trillion between 2020 and 2024. Much of that went to the top 20%, or households earning more than $160,000, which were supported by a rise in financial wealth (Read: stock markets going up): Yes for Less: Recruiting might be difficult. Value-conscious shoppers’ behavior lately shows regular folks are prioritizing function over fashion. James Conroy, chief of Ross Stores, said in an earnings call in May: “In terms of customer behavior, perhaps you could say there’s a little bit of a shift towards more functional items versus discretionary items.” Does the deficit crunch mean the US has won the first big battle of the trade war? Well, that’s a complicated question The surprising news comes just ahead of an all-important jobs report from the Labor Department due out Friday. As China tightens its grip on rare earths exports, one of its most crucial bargaining chips, the global supply chain is showing cracks. Snacks now make up around half of the historic soup company’s sales, up from less than a third a decade ago. 2025 is projected to be an unusually terrible year for the US travel industry — and only the US travel industry. At less than three years old and with just ten products, Rhode is a rocket ship with $212 million in net sales last year. The Fed was already walking a tightrope over a bottomless pit of stagflation before waves of tariffs came to rattle the line. You can’t bounce back without first getting low. And, in April, consumer confidence according to the Conference Board got real low. While the company didn’t mention the threat of tariffs, Nike is heavily exposed in China, home to roughly 24% of its suppliers. After the auction, the yield on the 20-year note rose to 5.125%, the highest level since back in November 2023. Soft US inflation numbers released last week and a de-escalation of global trade tensions are likely contributing to bitcoin’s rebound. CATL — blacklisted by the US Department of Defense in January for alleged ties to the Chinese military — pulled off the best IPO of the year. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: ‘Freedom Cities’ and Our Tech Overlords’ Visions for the Future
URL: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2025/06/freedom-cities-and-our-tech-overlords-visions-for-the-future.html
Time Published: 2025-06-02T10:00:38Z
Full Content:
Hierarchical tech weasels made a splash in early May with their vision for Guantanamo Bay. The Charter Cities Institute (CCI), a front group for billionaire Silicon Valley interests, wants to turn the home of US torture chambers into a high-tech charter city, which will double as a “proving ground” for migrants seeking to enter the US. Those lucky enough to make it to the imperial heartland might find themselves in Guantanamos anyways. That’s because so-called “freedom cities” might be coming to the 50 states as well. What Are the “Freedom” Cities? Elon Musk recently got his company town in Starbase, Texas, which could be viewed as a first step toward a US where these billionaires create laws in their own jurisdictions that fit their personal needs. To bring about Starbase, in December 2024, more than 70 county residents (believed to be SpaceX employees) petitioned for an election to make Starbase its own municipality. In May it passed overwhelmingly. Starbase can now raise funds through taxes, acquire property through eminent domain—which it is already doing— and create its own zoning rules. It has its own mayor and two commissioners—all SpaceX employees. “Because this is a project that is closely affiliated with SpaceX, you can imagine that the goals for the municipality are probably in pretty close alignment with the needs of SpaceX,” Alan Bojorquez, an attorney who specializes in city governance, told Texas Tribune. Indeed, one of the biggest benefits for SpaceX of the incorporation may be the ability to avoid environmental red tape. In July 2024, conservation groups filed a lawsuit against the Federal Aviation Administration, alleging that it rushed SpaceX’s Starship permitting process without adequate environmental review or mitigation requirements. SpaceX is also facing fines of almost $150,000 from the Environmental Protection Agency for allegedly illegally dumping pollutants into a Texas waterway without a permit. Starbase will almost certainly pass its own more permissive rules, and the Texas government is already voting to give Starbase more authority over the closure of a popular beach on weekdays for launches. Along with Starbase, other tech giants are planning their own build outs in cities where they already run the show, dominating real estate and local government. Google is planning a massive neighbourhood around its headquarters in Mountain View, California, Meta is doing the same thing with “Zucktown” in Menlo Park, and Musk wants a Tesla town, too. Many write-ups on Starbase and the freedom cities compare them to the company towns of old where one business owned and controlled everything, surveilled the population, paid workers in“scrip”, and led to startling rates of suicide and addiction among citizens. That very well may be the future for some— if not most — of these freedom cities, but there’s another darker layer to this current push, which makes these new-age company towns more problematic. While some of the freedom cities may be partially or wholly devoted to quasi-slave labor and human lab rat tests there also exists the possibility of population engineering to them, as well as to the rest of the country they would be leaving behind. From Urban Geography: Freedom Cities are thus, not merely land development schemes; Freedom Cities are where deserving elements of the population are promised perks and subsidies that favor family formation and will build out the favored community as a replay of a mythologized past… As a political maneuver, the Freedom Cities plan’s core purpose is precisely to conjure new cities in a distinctly fascist mold and generate a shared desire across the Trumpian movement not just to carry out a clean break with present-day cities but to turn their backs on the latter. In the imagined new city of his movement, prosperity and safety abound, while elements that have been cast as undesirable, abject, and anti-American are forcibly kept out through intensive policing and state protection. The Charter Cities Institute (CCI) and others are lobbying the Trump administration for more than just the creation of company towns theoretically under the jurisdiction of the state. They essentially want their own statelets within the US. The argument is that exemption from some federal laws replaced by oversight by a tech baron would drive innovation and prosperity. Here’s more from The New Republic: More controversially, CCI proposes to do something very akin to what the Emiratis are best known for doing—erecting a labor economy that more readily resembles modern-day slavery. The big selling point for its GITMO haven suggests that the hypothetical city could house migrants who wish to move to the U.S., keeping them under surveillance for a “probationary period” while “evaluating their contributions to the local economy and society.” “High performers become prime candidates for U.S. residence, while those who disrupt public order can be repatriated quickly—no labyrinthine state courts involved,” the authors write. Frontier Foundation, a 501c4 organization, as well as the Housing Center at the American Enterprise Institute and the Foundation for American Innovation, are also on board. In April, the groups issued a joint letter to the Trump administration that begins: We, the undersigned founders, investors, builders, and scholars write to express our strong support for Homesteading 2.0, consisting of the Home Sweet Home and Freedom Cities initiatives designed to add 3 million new homes and drive American economic and technological dynamism. It goes on to argue that the Bureau of Land Management should sell of 600 square miles of land for Freedom Cities. The Frontier Foundation has its eye specifically on BLM outside cities like Boise, Idaho; Grand Junction, Colorado; and Redmond, Oregon. The details of how the cities will actually function and who will own and run them are sketchy but appear similar to Starbase with perhaps even more “freedom.” Here is more from the letter (caution: high levels of dynamism incoming): The newly established urban districts, with streamlined governance and targeted regulatory relief, hold tremendous promise for accelerating American innovation, strengthening our industrial base, and addressing the most pressing economic and technological challenges facing the United States. Paired with new urban development, Freedom Cities can offer a dynamic regulatory framework for re-shoring critical industries, expanding housing affordability, and facilitating rapid progress in emerging fields such as biotechnology, aeronautics, and energy. By removing red tape, Freedom Cities can create jobs, improve global competitiveness, and push the technological frontier. Much of their argument includes the promise that these freedom zones will have affordable housing. And in case it wasn’t clear from the letter, the Frontier Foundation’s policy memo also includes the following: Regulatory Opt-Out Mechanisms: Grant the Secretary-level heads of agencies, such as the Health and Human Services (HHS), Department of Transportation Secretary (DOT), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) rules, discretion to waive or expedite certain regulations within Freedom Cities. Streamlined Environmental and Building Approval: Mandate expedited National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) reviews and simplified building codes, ensuring that infrastructure, housing, and industrial projects can break ground within months rather than years. Who Is Behind the Freedom City Push? Much of the money flowing into the likes of the Frontier Foundation, CCI and the Foundation for American Innovation are shrouded in secrecy due to their status as 501c3 non-profit organizations that have been granted tax-exempt status by the IRS. But the Foundation for American Innovation, as an example, identifies numerous billionaire laundering services as “major supporters” including the Miles Foundation, the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, the Diana Davis Spencer Foundation, the Walton Family Foundation, the Sarah Scaife Foundation, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the Beth and Ravenel Curry Foundation, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, and the Searle Freedom Trust. Two major players behind the movement, which is being driven by the likes of Marc Andreesen and Peter Thiel who back the venture capital firm Pronomos Capital, which has funded a charter city in Roatán, Honduras and several city projects in Africa, including one in Nigeria called Itana. [1] Trey Goff, the chief of staff of Próspera, tells WIRED that he and other Próspera representatives working under an advocacy group called the Freedom Cities Coalition have been meeting with the Trump administration, which is unsurprisingly receptive. During his 2024 campaign Trump came out in full support of the freedom cities: Reportedly the administration is so enthusiastic that the plan has grown in scope from creating ten such cities to as many “as the market can handle.” Why Do Tech Overlords Want Them? The official line is a collection of all the usual BS out of Silicon Valley. We can look to the rantings of Marc Andreesen for evidence. Andreessen, the billionaire who co-founded the venture capital firm a16z and, before that, played a role in the invention of the modern web browser. He is also one of the major backers of the freedom cities, as well as a major player in the Trump administration and a driving force behind the Signal groups that began during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, and which fueled the new alliance of tech and the US right. Andreessen is considered some sort of wise sage by the hierarchical tech crowd. Take the word of Minicircle cofounder Mac Davis who is also working with the Frontier Foundation. Minicircle is a longevity biotech company focused on developing gene therapies to extend human lifespans. It’s backed by Thiel and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and it currently has offices in both Austin, Texas, and Próspera. According to WIRED, Davis says that Minicircle’s gene therapy clinical trial on the protein follistatin—which he claims increases muscle mass without side effects, and also has life-extending benefits in mice—was only possible in Próspera, but noted he’d like to see that change. And it will, he believes, when freedom cities bring “American Dynamism” a reference to writings from Andreesen screeds, which argue that tech companies under the leadership of their wise billionaire leaders will save us from our failing government institutions and the pratfalls of democracy. Let’s take a brief look. Here’s Andreesen’s “The Techno-Optimist Manifesto” going beat poet on us with his societal visions: There are only three sources of growth: population growth, natural resource utilization, and technology. Developed societies are depopulating all over the world, across cultures – the total human population may already be shrinking. Natural resource utilization has sharp limits, both real and political. And so the only perpetual source of growth is technology… Productivity growth, powered by technology, is the main driver of economic growth, wage growth, and the creation of new industries and new jobs, as people and capital are continuously freed to do more important, valuable things than in the past… We believe this is why our descendents will live in the stars. We believe that there is no material problem – whether created by nature or by technology – that cannot be solved with more technology… We have a problem of poverty, so we invent technology to create abundance. Give us a real world problem, and we can invent technology that will solve it. We believe free markets are the most effective way to organize a technological economy. …Profits are the incentive for producing supply that fulfills demand…. We believe any deceleration of AI will cost lives. Deaths that were preventable by the AI that was prevented from existing is a form of murder… We believe there is no inherent conflict between the techno-capital machine and the natural environment… We believe we should place intelligence and energy in a positive feedback loop, and drive them both to infinity. We believe we should use the feedback loop of intelligence and energy to make everything we want and need abundant. We believe the measure of abundance is falling prices. Every time a price falls, the universe of people who buy it get a raise in buying power, which is the same as a raise in income. If a lot of goods and services drop in price, the result is an upward explosion of buying power, real income, and quality of life. Note Andreesen’s emphasis on abundance, which Democrats are now embracing to slash the red tape and let the vultures feast in an effort to get back in the good graces of money men like Andreesen. And notably, Jeffrey Mason, the head of policy at the Charter Cities Institute, tells WIRED the freedom cities lobbying groups are also having conversations with Democratic members of Congress. So this reimagining of the US as a federation of billionaire-run emirates will have staying power beyond Trump. But back to Andreesen and the ideology he represents. His whole spiel is that anyone or anything standing in their way is preventing the creation of this utopia: A world in which human wages crash from AI — logically, necessarily — is a world in which productivity growth goes through the roof, and prices for goods and services crash to near zero. Consumer cornucopia. Everything you need and want for pennies. — Marc Andreessen 🇺🇸 (@pmarca) January 25, 2025 It is of course all complete nonsense. What Andreesen and his like are after is more money and power of which company towns or freedom cities are a major part. Here’s Brian Merchant summing up their true motivations at Blood in the Machine: These notions—AI can replace workers, the government should function like a startup—are not meant to describe reality; they are meant to create a permission structure for those in power to obtain more of it. Here, AI will either allow Trump and Musk to install more loyalists, hollow out the administrative state, or degrade the quality of services once provided; all outcomes that favor Trumpism, and, I guess, Muskism. The startup mentality, meanwhile, seeks to give license to break laws, in the name of progress, of disruption, of building the future. Same as it ever was: Way back in the early days of the Industrial Revolution, early factory owners deployed automation to deskill workers, to justify employing precarious and child laborers, and as a means of circumventing long-held laws—all to produce more products at lower quality, and to concentrate profits, and power, in fewer hands. That helps explain why despite Andreesen’s promises that earthly paradise is nigh, he and his fellow weasels spend so much time and money worrying about building a police state. Andreeseen is focused on his primary home of Las Vegas while other tech billionaires have their own pet projects. That makes sense if you subscribe to the teachings of monarchist pundit Curtis Yarvin who was reportedly lionized in the Andreessen-led Signal chats. Here’s Quinn Slobodian on Yarvin’s vision for the future—much of which is playing out in real time: Right-wing accelerationists imagine existing sovereignty shattering into what Yarvin, writing under the pen name Mencius Moldbug, calls a “patchwork” of private entities, ideally governed by what one might call technomonarchies. Existing autocratic polities like Dubai serve as rough prototypes for how nations could be dismantled into “a global spiderweb of tens, even hundreds, of thousands of sovereign and independent mini-countries, each governed by its own joint-stock corporation without regard to the residents’ opinions.” These would be decentralized archipelagoes: fortified nodes in a circuitry still linked by finance, trade, and communication. Think of the year 1000 in Middle Europe but with vertical take-off and landing taxis and Starlink internet. Yarvin expressed the essence of the worldview recently when he enthused over Trump’s proposal to ethnically cleanse the Gaza Strip and rebuild it as a US-backed colony securitized as an asset and sold to investors—as he called it, “the first charter city backed by US legitimacy: Gaza, Inc. Stock symbol: GAZA.” One wonders what type of Gaza they have in mind for their American freedom cities. This? Or this: Or perhaps the first is a freedom city and the latter is one of the left-behind zones? How Soon Could We Find Out? Here are the options under consideration to breathe life into stateside freedom cities according to WIRED: According to Goff, Freedom Cities Coalition has briefed White House officials on three options for creating freedom cities. One is through “interstate compacts.” In this scenario, two or more states could set aside territories with shared tax and regulation policies, with some state-specific carve-outs. Under existing law, these compacts can’t be revoked, though they can be dissolved under certain circumstances. If an interstate compact is approved by Congress, it becomes valid under federal law. Goff says the coalition is considering Congressional legislation that would give “advanced consent” to any freedom city compacts. That way, Congress wouldn’t need to approve each individual city. Two other options are creating federal enclaves with special economic and jurisdictional zones, or having Trump issue executive orders to create each new freedom city. The freedom city lobbying groups are urging that sites would ideally be announced by July 4, 2026. So mark your calendar! One concern with such cities is that they would hollow out the rest of country since they would be free from regulation from the likes of Food and Drug Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. (A bunch of nuclear reactors in freedom zones powering AI data centers free of any oversight from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission—what could go wrong?) That “freedom” from oversight would draw investment and jobs away from the rest of the country choking on its last morsels of democracy. But perhaps DOGE and other Trump administration destruction of the state are an attempt to do the hollowing out before the building of the “freedom” cities. By starving all but the Pentagon and and Homeland Security of funds and intentionally blowing up the ability of the state to function, the administration helps make the case for freedom cities. Naomi Klein and Astra Taylor argue in The Guardian that we are in the midst of “end times fascism”, which they claim is even worse than the mid-20th century version. While that might be a bit hyperbolic, perhaps we’ll get there at this rate. Regardless there’s no doubt that the Silicon Valley illuminati have designs to take us to—or leave us behind in— a dystopia of their making, and they have a government ready to accommodate them: Inspired by a warped reading of the political philosopher Albert Hirschman, figures including Goff, Thiel and the investor and writer Balaji Srinivasan have been championing what they call “exit” – the principle that those with means have the right to walk away from the obligations of citizenship, especially taxes and burdensome regulation. Retooling and rebranding the old ambitions and privileges of empires, they dream of splintering governments and carving up the world into hyper-capitalist, democracy-free havens under the sole control of the supremely wealthy, protected by private mercenaries, serviced by AI robots and financed by cryptocurrencies. Personally, I’d be inclined to let ‘em have at it—if those living in their little fiefdoms are there of their own volition, the creation of their statelets didn’t involve the destruction of ours, and their actions weren’t destroying our shared earthly habitat. It doesn’t appear any of those three conditions will be met, however, which leaves me with just one question: What’s the progress report on Musk’s dream of colonizing Mars? That sounds like an ideal solution for all—except the red planet. Musk, Andreesen, Thiel, and friends could bring all their AI, crypto, and court jesters there and be completely free there to pursue their utopia. Notes 1. The Honduran Congress passed a law in 2022 repealing the allowance of SEZs. Próspera then sued the Honduran government. The lawsuit is ongoing and, as of now, Prospera remains operational. Another example of a “Freedom City” is Disney World, where Florida cut a deal to give the corporation exclusive rights to develop the land as they saw fit, and a carve out from any state or local law enforcement. When Disney went “woke”, the governor tried to rescind some of the legislation but I don’t think it was eliminated. Disney also did this with an experimental city they built called “Celebration”, which actually exists. And people flock to see the Mouse by the millions. Been a while since I’ve seen the Matrix (while Keanu Reeves is a stand up human being from what I can tell, he is a terrible actor! – can’t stomach his movies), but if I recall correctly, a generation ago the movie wondered whether given the choice, people would prefer physical reality or a computer generated fantasy world, all watched over by machines of loving grace. A quarter century later, with people moving about staring into their phones immersed in tiktok videos and AI-generated crapola, I think we have our answer. The problem with the current iteration of Freedom Cities is that the machines watching over us are neither loving nor graceful. to paraphrase great art critic Robert Hughes re. cities/urbanity and the 5000-year, quixotic quest for the perfect city: “it seems that much like plants, we need the $h…it of others to survive…” from his “Shock of the New” book/tv series re. urban planning….a TV series I sorely hope that AI will be able to clean/upscale to 4K in the near future even bill gates-backed city is in the desert. hey, I hate winter too…but the Arizona desert in July? (when there are practically infinite large tracts of “Sim City”-like land near the Great Plains interstates or just look at all the vacant lots of detroit/buffalo…Tech bros really hate snow, lol Catherine Austin Fitts on the Danny Jones show. Musk and the creation of the control grid. utube, 8+ minutes. Trump’s “Control Grid”: 3 Steps He’s Using to Enslave Americans | Catherine Fitts https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJqayjnlBjk Or perhaps the first is a freedom city and the latter is one of the left-behind zones? It goes deeper. Andresson’s “sources of growth” leaves out another possibility. Growth by stealing resources from other people. The “left-behind” zones are not left out or apart from the supertech system. They are the fundamental resource being extracted to pay for the high tech cities. The misery is the point. No matter how hard those in deprived zones work, no matter how much value they create, their surplus value will simply be siphoned off to pay for the lifestyle of others. The only limiting factor to this system is the additional resources which must be allocated to pay for the oppression and subjugation of such territories or social classes. As the inequality deepens, only massive investments in oppression technology will be able to make the project scale. But simultaneously the availability of technology enables more effective dissent and resistance among oppressed populations. The likes of Andresson will see a lot of money to be made in this dynamic. Sucked out from the downwardly mobile middle class mostly. Just a reminder that the Solano County based “California Forever” project wasn’t gone away and the most recent pivots include proposing a ship building project and annexation by two cash strapped local cities to get around county regulation. A slow grind by investors with deep pockets and a huge land bank. https://californiaforever.com/ https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/28/california-forever-tech-boats https://www.thereporter.com/2025/05/12/suisun-city-gives-california-forever-update/ Not sure the opposition is up to the task https://www.solanotogether.org/about “Personally, I’d be inclined to let ‘em have at it—if those living in their little fiefdoms are there of their own volition, the creation of their statelets didn’t involve the destruction of ours, and their actions weren’t destroying our shared earthly habitat.” Remember: it’s a heist. And they are like the ultimate culture vultures. Not creators. Any competition has to be destroyed to keep people in those dystopias…not out. If those freedoms are responsible for their own security and enforcement of laws, go for it. When they are subject to assault by other entities I w8sh them well. Unless there is no alternative (TINA), they can’t sustain their dystopia. Bet there is a part 2 that hasn’t been revealed for their “freedom cities” that shows plans for “Greater Freedom Cities”. “When they are subject to assault by other entities I w8sh them well.” The global spread of something like neo-liberal economic ideology should be looked at as the “hegemony”. Bringing it back down to earth: rich influencers flock together like birds of a feather. Is there a material difference between freedom cities and abundance cities? From my perspective there isn’t any. no. two sides of the same 5,000 year-old technocrats’ dream: (healthy) cities are chaotic, choked w/ traffic, inefficient, full of micro-triggers; but I, Raymond Cocteau, can solve all the problems and bring more joy if only everything was made per my diktats Personally I welcome the incoming oligarchic paradigm these cities represent if only because it’s so delightfully cyberpunk. I dream of pacing down a rainy dystopia-city street, smacking myself beside the head to mute the google adsense brainchip feeding me information about cosmetic products on my way to my 17 hour shift in the anthro-ambulatory energy center (definitely not a series of giant hamster wheels for humans). Top 10% generators each month get an extra box of reduced-plastic content nutripellets! One person’s cautionary tale is another person’s operations manual. This whole thing is coming off like a real-life version of OCP in the original Robocop movie. Unfortunately, a lot of Robocop’s predictions are coming true, right down to the idiotic ads in everything. It’s time to dust off Snowcrash, Bioshock, and all the other fiction which addressed the ludicrous contradictions of isolationism and power in planned capitalist enclaves. Heck, take a trip to Tuscany, where the great towers of the great families were seized and torn down by competing fiefdoms. Any broligarch archipelago willing to bro Galt against civilization as a concept via “networked” freedom cities —a broligarchipelago?— will discover in short order there shall be no network, instead thousands of cities laying violent siege to one another. Meet the new medieval, same as the old medieval. Additionally, there are other 80s sci-fi threads weaving through society. Watched Running Man lately? (Appropriately based on a story from Stephen King – which puts this mess squarely in the HORROR sci-fi genre where it belongs). Looks like gated communities are not enough and now they want to go for gated cities. And those sea-based communities have never gotten started. I can make a few predictions though based on past performance. Any of these cities will demand billions of dollars from the Federal government for infrastructure but will also demand that the Federal government have no say in how their cities are run. Each city will have a poverty-stricken town nearby from where workers will be bused in daily to perform the menial work that needs to be done in that city. Going in the opposite direction will be garbage and waste materiel to that town for “processing”. Each city will tap any underground water and proceed to suck it dry as it leads to less water to farmlands near that city. Each city will demand goods, services from the State government or else they will move that city away. Unsurprisingly, State governments will believe them. The inhabitants will be monitored and surveilled to a massive degree and they may even have to tolerate a camera up the wazoo. All the collected data will then be monetized and sold on. Finally, these cities will on the whole be not really safe for women who will have no recourse through the private police. Those sort of boats will not be allowed to be rocked. Not in a libertarian tech-bro culture it won’t. Also, seat belts and motor-cycle helmets will be illegal. This will only work when the menial tasks are automated, so robotic cleaners and gardeners. But who grows stuff and who repairs and installs stuff? The elite tend not to have practical skills beyond one narrow discipline. These cities aren’t arcologies, and are completely dependent on the outside for resources just like Masada. The Gulf States seem to have no problem with this proto-neofeudalism. In all Gulf States subcontinent Indians = big minority; in a couple,a majority of the population. all fine when there is plenty of money….when times are lean (and those workers can’tor won’tgo home)? Perhaps the denizens of the nearby poverty towns will have the mordant humor to rename them ” Poortowns”. And then start referring to the Freedom Cities as “Freedom Johannesburgs” and the Poortowns as ” Freedom Sowetos”. And then figure out how to move disease germs into the Freedom Johannesburgs. Perhaps the Freedom Soweto Resistance will figure out how to create time-delay binary poisons. And then figure out how to dose every Freedom Citizen of the Freedom Cities with one of the two binary poison ingredients, cumulative, non-removable from the body. But entirely innocuous until the second ingredient is added to find the first ingredient in every Freedom Body and combine with it to produce the lethal poison with lethal effect . . . when the Zero Hour Time comes. Fordlandia; https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fordl%C3%A2ndia Wonderful piece. A reminder that the internet made a bunch of incel gamers billionaires. This is all just End Times rationing and hoarding. It’s ironic that they can’t see that just like Gaza (and Mars), their land is available because it doesn’t have reliable water or decent conditions for raising crops or livestock. They will never be self-sufficient. They’re think that they can turn their backs on us, but we can and will turn the tables on them. “Careful what you say. The assassin drones have ears.” You have to assume the Freedom Cities will try every highest techest method to detect or anticipate, and then exterminate, every such attempt at turning the tables. The would-be table turners will have to work out ways to survive all of that in order to live long enough to get those tables turned. “Freedom Cities” or any of the charter city startups have yet to demonstrate successful implementation of even a small housing development. I’m not sure if Starbase qualifies. It’s a small number of employees living at the launch site. It’s hardly a “Freedom City” or “Charter City” as envisioned by the libertarian utopians. For a more dramatic description of what might come, one could read Margaret Attwood’s MaddAdam trilogy. Didn’t think it was possible I could loathe Yarvin more than I already did but then I read his opinions about Gaza and had to step away from the computer for several minutes to bring my blood pressure down. This post and Conor’s book review post today reminds me strongly of a book I read a couple of years ago about the Southwest Desert here in the US, The Water Knife. A science fiction book about a potential near future… with lots of science backing it up. Nice little Freedom City you got here. Be a shame if a semi full of attack drones had to pull over somewhere nearby, amiright? This threw me for a loop. Apparently, for some Americans, the idea of freedom is to seek permission from the relevant governmental authorities to start a municipality, so as to create by-laws, rules and regulations, and so as to start taxing the residents. As opposed to finding an unincorporated area, keeping it unincorporated so there are no rules, bylaws and regulations, no local taxes, and you can do whatever you please. Anybody remember Jack London’s The Iron Heel? The Iron Heel, novel by Jack London, published in 1908, describing the fall of the United States to the cruel fascist dictatorship of the Iron Heel, a group of monopoly capitalists. Fearing the popularity of socialism, the plutocrats of the Iron Heel conspire to eliminate democracy and, with their secret police and military, terrorize the citizenry. They instigate a German attack on Hawaii on … BTW, there are two remaining Defendants being sued for price fixing by the Forever California crowd. And so the 2nd and 3rd generation looks around at the “less free” cities and towns and says “bull pippy” and starts a revolution in these freedom cities. Oh, but that’s right, the tech monarchists always knows best and will “correct” the revolutionaries. 40 years ago there was Rajneeshpuram in Oregon: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajneeshpuram what goes around comes around. Thanks for this excellent article Conor. I’ll add a couple of details. Pronomos Capital which you mention as a leader in the emergence of “freedom cities” is the baby of Neo-Reactionary poster boy Patri Friedman. Formerly, Friedman ran the (Thiel-funded) Sea-Stedding Institute. Thiel and Friedman were the two main writers in the legendary/infamous 2009 Cato Unbound issue which one could argue marks the beginning of 1. nRx thought 2. Post-democratic libertarianism. Friedman’s article Thiel’s article If one can wade through the sophomoric logic, both articles are illuminating regarding the current libertarian onslaught. Also I see other posters referencing Snow Crash and I’ll point out that it gets cited regularly in Thielverse circles and apparently changed (Thiel sidekick/LinkedIn founder) Reid Hoffman’s life Finally I’ll repeat the recommendation to read Max Chavkin’s biography of Thiel “The Contrarian” which covers a lot of this ground. It has just occurred to me that this movement among the tech overlords is just another version of a deep but rather thin American impulse to an ideal communal existence. The Mormons are an outgrowth of such impulse. The Shakers and hippie communes ultimately failed. New Age spiritual communes basically failed although there are remnants. There are countless cults ongoing at any one time. Attempts at ashrams on the Indian model come and go. Most involve charismatic leaders, big donors and a desire to escape from whatever by the followers. This just seems the cyberpunk version. The same old problem still exists….how do all these brilliant, high IQ, hyperindividual lights get along? Same as it everywhere was. Your email address will not be published.

Title: Fear Martin Marietta At $550?

Full Content:
ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. UKRAINE - 2021/05/24: In this photo illustration, Martin Marietta logo is seen displayed on a ... More smartphone and pc screen. (Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Martin Marietta Materials Inc (NYSE: MLM) stock fell 27% from its all-time high of approximately $620 in November 2024, decreasing to $453 in April 2025. It then rebounded by about 22% to current levels around $550. Thus, the stock is down roughly 11% since November, despite the company reporting an operating margin exceeding 42% in 2024. In comparison, Meta reported operating margins of 42% in 2024 and has still seen an increase of 9% from early November to now! However, there’s an important point to consider: Martin Marietta trades at 32 times earnings. Reversing that gives a meager 3% earnings yield. For reference, Meta—which owns Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Reality Labs—trades at a significantly lower earnings multiple of 23 times and is growing revenue almost twice as quickly. Meta's revenue has grown by 13% over the last three years, while MLM experienced revenue growth of 6.7% during the same period. So yes, Martin Marietta benefits from consistent infrastructure demand which ensures stable cash flows and strong returns. But at $550 per share, this represents a premium valuation pursuing a growth narrative that simply isn't keeping up. And what happens when the growth fails to meet expectations? That’s when reality sets in. See Buy or Sell MLM stock? MLM is frequently regarded as a long-term asset that will gain from sustained urbanization, infrastructure enhancements, and population growth, but history paints a different picture. During the 2008 global financial crisis, its shares plummeted nearly 64%. At the beginning of the Covid pandemic in 2020, they dropped by 49%. Moreover, in 2022, amidst rising inflation and consumer pressure, Martin Marietta faced another setback with a 33% decrease. Not exactly resilient—yet currently, the stock trades at a premium valuation. MLM benefits from stable demand propelled by infrastructure expenditures, particularly owing to government initiatives like the U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). Projects involving highways, bridges, and public works necessitate substantial volumes of aggregates — MLM's core product. Furthermore, MLM stands as one of the largest providers of construction aggregates in the U.S., which affords it pricing power and economies of scale. Its size and vertical integration enhance operational efficiency. MLM consistently showcases strong earnings, significant free cash flow, and high returns on invested capital. Yet the broader context is less exciting. As of the first quarter of 2025, Martin Marietta has encountered a notable rise in its debt levels, mainly due to strategic acquisitions and capital investments aimed at expanding its operations. Debt was reported at $5.41 billion as of March 31, 2025, marking a significant increase from $3.95 billion at the conclusion of 2024. The company disclosed a debt to EBITDA of 4.06 for the quarter ending March 2025, which surpasses the industry median. The company reported solid performance for the first quarter of 2025. Revenues totaled $1.35 billion, reflecting an 8% year-over-year increase. In FY26, the company has projected revenues between $6.83 billion and $7.23 billion, indicating a growth of 5 to 10%. Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated to increase by around 9%. That’s hardly significant growth for a company valued like a hyper-growth tech stock. Adding to the difficulties are weather-related risks. Operations can be disrupted by hurricanes, storms, or other extreme weather events, which have historically caused production delays and impacted revenue. Despite valuation pressures and macroeconomic risks, MLM's scale provides it with considerable advantages. The company is well-positioned to capitalize on the IIJA, which allocates $1.2 trillion for infrastructure projects over five years. As of early 2025, roughly 66% of highway and bridge funding is yet to be utilized, suggesting a substantial pipeline of projects extending through 2026 and beyond. In Q1 2025, Martin Marietta reported a 6.8% increase in the average selling price of aggregates to $23.77 per ton, driven by organic price/cost improvements and margin-accretive acquisitions. This pricing momentum is likely to persist, bolstering revenue growth. Investing in a single stock carries inherent risks. Conversely, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has demonstrated a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the past 4 years. Why is that? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded better returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index, exhibiting less volatility as illustrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Media Buying Briefing: What does WPP Media’s course change actually mean for advertisers?

Time Published: 2025-06-02T04:01:00Z
Full Content:
This Media Buying Briefing covers the latest in agency news and media buying for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Monday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → GroupM’s rechristening as WPP Media last week was intended to answer questions posed by clients, staffers and industry critics about the future of what was once the industry’s largest media investment house. But beyond the sizzle reel, question marks remain over what’s actually changed — and whether this is the end of WPP’s long-running quest to turn the ship around, or just the latest chapter. In particular, there are queries around the company’s AI ambitions; how close they are to becoming reality; what that reality means for its own employees; and how they help it put clear blue water between itself and rival heavyweight media holdcos Publicis Groupe and Omnicom (soon to include IPG). GroupM is gone, and WPP Media has been set up in its place. Going forward under its new captain Brian Lesser (who is also its old captain), the network will operate with a single P&L model in each country, while the global CEO positions of its constituent agencies have been abolished. Former Wavemaker CEO Toby Jenner has been instead named global chief business officer, while Mindshare’s Adam Gerhart has taken on a brief as chief client officer, for example. “Advertisers don’t like disruption. They don’t like not knowing what’s going to happen with their team. They don’t like when they start spending more time thinking about their own business than their clients,” said Tom Denford, CEO and co-founder of media consultancy ID Comms. This isn’t just about tidying up the org chart, but a significant shakeup in the engine room of WPP. Execs are keen to push the benefits of the bespoke cross-disciplinary teams it’s built for clients like Amazon, Unilever and Coca-Cola. In each case, the custom units combine media, creative and data capabilities, and are built with WPP’s data businesses Choreograph and Infosum (acquired just two months ago) as connective tissue. Lauren Wetzel, CEO of InfoSum, referred to this approach as “showing up as one company.” WPP Media’s leaders believe more clients want the white glove treatment – and a simplified organization structure makes those teams easier to assemble and easier to run. “Clients want us to come together and have an integrated offering,” said Wetzel. Behind the scenes, the changes have already led to significant job cuts at the network, though a WPP spokesperson declined to say exactly how many of its 40,000 staffers were made redundant. Layoffs will continue until at least June, per Ad Age. Incumbent clients, however, are keen to be reassured their own account teams remain in place. They want both continuity of service, and to be reassured they won’t be forgotten when WPP Media goes hunting for new custom in its fresh costume. Perhaps that explains why, despite retiring the 20-year old GroupM moniker (originally intended to manage WPP’s sprawling media agency domains, rather than a market vehicle in its own right) the Mindshare, Wavemaker, and EssenceMediacom agency brands remain intact. Digiday understands that the agency brands will aid WPP Media in navigating potential client conflicts, while also pitching for new work in their own right. According to Jay Pattisall, vp and senior agency analyst at Forrester, the remaining firewalls, combined with the addition of Infosum, will also help reassure clients that other advertisers won’t have access to their data. The new structure will “wall off their clients’ first-party data from any losses in data fidelity, or security or privacy concerns,” said Pattisall. WPP Media’s leadership aren’t using the “a” word to describe the new entity. Not that one, anyway. No longer a network of media agencies, WPP Media will instead function as an “AI-driven media company”, per the spiel of a B2B ad campaign it’s launched to float the rebrand. In plain English, that refers to the way its teams use WPP Open, the company’s AI operating system, as well as other AI tools and automation. According to Evan Hanlon, global CEO at WPP data business Choreograph, every team within the business is already using Open to plan and invest media on behalf of clients. This will supposedly free them from the “drudgery” of manual media planning and enable them to pursue more creative solutions. “It’s something that our people are not only in every day, but that our clients are seeing and experiencing and having work delivered for them,” said Hanlon. Even if clients choose only to work with EssenceMediacom or Wavemaker, rather than the cross-border packages WPP Media is prioritizing, they’ll still be customers of teams using Open. “Every client that we onboard now is being onboarded into that end-to-end, AI-powered ecosystem,” said Hanlon. “Through the end of the year, we’re looking to bring 100% of WPP Media onto that workflow as well.” Teams aren’t limited to using WPP’s proprietary toolbox, but can integrate tech that clients have built in-house as well. “We are not putting our clients in a position in which they have to lock into a fixed, inflexible, closed system,” he said. WPP Media isn’t the only media network to have switched to a single P&L, or to remodel its interior around a data business. And it’s far from the only way advertisers can access AI tech. However, Hanlon said WPP Media’s approach to audience data would be the element that helps it stand out from the crowd. Rather than sell access to audience datasets it owns – and compete directly with Meta or Google – WPP Media aims, through InfoSum’s clean room tech, to help clients leverage the first part data they do have, and provide probabilistic audience targeting. It’s a solution clients can’t easily build in-house or get from the tech giants, and one that should keep advertisers above the water line on privacy compliance. “Every one of our competitors is pursuing a strategy that is focused around owning large-scale audience datasets as the focal point for how they extract more value from the marketplace,” said Hanlon. Deterministic approaches, he said, are just “one of many” ways to target media. “We think that is one place that we are fundamentally different to our competitors.” If its leaders can articulate that offer in the pitch room, it could be compelling for clients, according to Sam Tomlinson, chief client officer at media consultancy MediaSense. “WPP Media will need to work through this integration quickly so they can then focus on a clear articulation of the benefits of their data strategy, building on InfoSum and explaining how it is different to their competitors,” he said. Ultimately, Forrester’s Pattisall believes WPP Media as described has a strong chance to improve its fortunes, regardless of whether it keeps any clients that might be in play (such as Mars, which is currently in review and which WPP CEO Mark Read acknowledged is in play back at the end of April). “They’ve made massive acquisitions, they’ve consolidated their operations and they’re providing end-to-end services rather than point solutions,” said Pattisall. “It’s certainly working for Publicis Media, it’s working for Omnicom Media Group … I think it would work for WPP Media as well.” — Michael Bürgi contributed to this report. As influencers and creators capture more attention (and ad dollars) from marketers and agencies looking to break through with prospective customers, Advertiser Perceptions looked into how they’re being used and evaluated, as well as how dollars are being allocated. Some highlights from the study, which surveyed 305 marketing and agency folk: “I would not at all be surprised that sooner than later, influencer [as a] channel will be much bigger than television. I don’t know if it will be in three years or five years, but that’s something which is going to happen.” Agencies and SSPs are pairing up for partnership deals, driven by demand for premium inventory and greater transparency. Will Doherty, svp of inventory development, teases launch at IAB Tech Lab Summit, claiming 90% of Deal IDs are ‘effectively failed’. The move was likely a cost-savings effort, which would mean that Publicis most likely offered to secure lower rates for the entertainment company’s marketing efforts.

Title: “Something wicked this way comes,” Ray Bradbury (1962)

It was a great and horrifying story about two young boys and the arrival of the Cooger and Dark Carnival in Green Town, Illinois. If you entered the carnival grounds late at night, you might be drawn to its iconic ride, Cooger & Dark’s Pandemonium Shadow Show. It’s a story about the ways in which evil can be a powerful temptation to even the best of people. Some of the lines are maddeningly good. A stranger is shot in the street, you hardly move to help. But if, half an hour before, you spent just ten minutes with the fellow and knew a little about him and his family, you might just jump in front of his killer and try to stop it. Really knowing is good. Not knowing, or refusing to know is bad, or amoral, at least. You can’t act if you don’t know. Others half-haunt me. Oh, what strange wonderful clocks women are. They nest in Time. They make the flesh that holds fast and binds eternity. They live inside the gift, know power, accept, and need not mention it. Why speak of time when you are Time, and shape the universal moments, as they pass, into warmth and action? How men envy and often hate these warm clocks, these wives, who know they will live forever. Bradbury declared it his most “delicious” story. The title is also an homage to the witches of Macbeth (Act 4, Scene 1, following “boil and trouble”): 2nd Witch: By the pricking of my thumbs, Something wicked this way comes. [Knocking] Open locks, Whoever knocks! [Enter Macbeth] I admit to having been thinking of dark circuses and evil clowns rather a lot lately. They make it hard to pick up the newspaper most mornings. Chief Justice Warren got it, too: “I always turn to the sports section first. The sports section records man’s accomplishments; the front page has nothing but man’s failures” (Sports Illustrated, July 22, 1968). For readers of the Mutual Fund Observer, two coming circuses will be particularly pressing. Single-stock exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and leveraged single-stock ETFs are relatively new and complex investment products that have garnered significant attention from both investors and researchers. I was struck by the utter flood of new fund registrations in the first weeks of May, which might signal a July or August. Launch. In the middle of 2024, there were about 100 such funds globally. The first in the US seems to have been AXS Tesla and AXS NVIDIA, both launched in 2022. Trading volume and AUM data are scant. Morningstar did report a doubling in the pool’s AUM in the first quarter of 2024. What do they do? In general, they do not own the single stock in question. They own derivatives tied to the performance of the stock, but they are generally tied to one day’s performance: if Tesla drops 25% tomorrow, an inverse-leveraged TSLA ETF will drop by 25%, or 50%, or 75% in a day. The extent of the drop depends on the extent of the leverage provided. The same is true in the other direction. Two ugly realities: In general, these are toys for speculators. They are not investment products. Sadly, investors fall for marketing and overestimate their own abilities. They think they’ll track that 3X DraftKings ETF and move like a ballerina. Or, frankly, more likely, like Dumbo. In general, academic and professional research reach the same conclusion. If you’re a professional with vast tracking resources and a holding period of one day or less, these are fine tools. If you aren’t a professional and don’t intend to monitor hour-by-hour for the rest of your adult life, run away. Morningstar’s take: Single-stock ETFs can meet the needs of a few. High-conviction traders with a single-day or shorter holding period may find them useful vehicles to express their views. After all, it’s hard for everyday investors to use leverage or construct their own covered calls. But the fact is that these products are rarely sensible for everyday investors. They are flawed, costly, and liable to take more from investors than they give. (Ryan Jackson, “For Most Investors, Single-Stock ETFs Are Best Left Alone,” Morningstar.com, 4/9/2024) Which, of course, means that we’re being flooded with them. Here’s a sampling of the 485A prospectus filings that MFO came across during just two weeks in May 2025: More specialized new games include: On May 28, 2025, Mr. Trump’s Department of Labor rescinded a 2022 policy urging “extreme caution” about including cryptocurrency in retirement plans. The official announcement read: The U.S. Department of Labor’s Employee Benefits Security Administration has rescinded a 2022 compliance release that previously discouraged fiduciaries from including cryptocurrency options in 401(k) retirement plans. The 2022 guidance directed plan fiduciaries to exercise “extreme care” before adding cryptocurrency to investment menus. This language deviated from the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and marked a departure from the department’s historically neutral, principled-based approach to fiduciary investment decisions. “The Biden administration’s department of labor made a choice to put their thumb on the scale,” said U.S. Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer. “We’re rolling back this overreach and making it clear that investment decisions should be made by fiduciaries, not D.C. bureaucrats.” One might pause at the breathtaking hypocrisy disguised as policy guidance. If we’re talking about crypto, beloved by Elon & co., the rule is “investment decisions should be made by fiduciaries, not D.C. bureaucrats.” If we’re talking about the option of socially-responsible investments in the same accounts, the rule reverses, and the government must surely make financial decisions rather than trusting fiduciaries. It’s a policy that marries the mendacious with the disastrous, a rare accomplishment. The proposed inclusion of cryptocurrencies in employer retirement plan options raises significant concerns about investor protection, particularly given the extreme volatility and risk characteristics these digital assets exhibit. The cryptocurrency market has experienced substantial growth in trading activity, with the top exchanges processing trillions in volume annually. According to current market data, there are literally millions of cryptocurrencies in circulation (really, you could make your own this afternoon since there are no regulations and no barriers to entry). The total cryptocurrency market capitalization fell 18.6% in Q1 2025 to close at $2.8 trillion, after briefly touching $3.8 trillion in January. This dramatic swing within a single quarter exemplifies the type of volatility that could devastate retirement portfolios, particularly for investors nearing or in retirement who have limited time to recover from significant losses. Consider, for example, the drawdown periods for the oldest and most liquid coin, Bitcoin. Source: LazyPortfolioETF, using Highcharts graphing. Remember, this is just the downside. There are lunatic price spikes the rest of the time. The point here is to help you get a big picture of how deep the knife plunges (the red drawdowns) and how long the wound lasts (the gray “ramps” shows months to recovery). Below are the five-year risk-return metrics for the two largest cryptocurrencies, which we assume are the two most likely to infiltrate a retirement plan. Sources: Lazy Portfolio ETF (for Bitcoin), Portfolio Labs ETH-USD, and S&P Ethereum Index The data reveals several alarming characteristics that underscore the inappropriateness of these investments for retirement accounts. Bitcoin, despite being the most established cryptocurrency, has experienced maximum drawdowns exceeding 70%, meaning investors could lose more than 70% of their investment. The recovery period for Bitcoin’s maximum drawdown required 19 months, during which retirement investors would face sustained and severe portfolio losses. Ethereum presents even more extreme risk characteristics, with a maximum five-year drawdown of nearly 79% (and a near-complete meltdown in 2018) The current Ethereum drawdown stands at 45.29%, that is, at the end of May 2025, an Ether is worth 45% less than it was at its November 2021 peak. For retirement investors, such sustained periods of substantial losses could prove financially catastrophic, particularly for those requiring portfolio withdrawals during retirement. The smaller cryptocurrencies are worse. Retirement investors require stable, predictable growth that preserves capital while generating reasonable returns over long time horizons. The documented maximum drawdowns approaching 95-96% for major cryptocurrencies represent existential threats to the retirement security of elderly investors. The extreme volatility documented in this analysis represents not an investment opportunity but rather a fundamental threat to retirement system stability and individual financial security. These decisions, government and corporate, continue to move the markets in the direction of a casino. Investors’ conviction that “patience is for losers” just makes them losers. Buy quality stocks from experienced managers. Diversify away from assets that depend on Washington acting like adults. Find managers who manage volatility thoughtfully. We list them! What’s an investor to do? Learn from the experience of others. When you suspect something wicked is around, do not go alone into the basement with a flickering light. When you suspect something wicked this way comes, do not wander off on your own – away from the security of friends – “to see what made that noise.” “Acting without knowing takes you right off the cliff.” ― Ray Bradbury, Something Wicked This Way Comes (1962) David Snowball, PhD (Massachusetts). Cofounder, lead writer. David is a Professor of Communication Studies at Augustana College, Rock Island, Illinois, a nationally-recognized college of the liberal arts and sciences, founded in 1860. For a quarter century, David competed in academic debate and coached college debate teams to over 1500 individual victories and 50 tournament championships. When he retired from that research-intensive endeavor, his interest turned to researching fund investing and fund communication strategies. He served as the closing moderator of Brill’s Mutual Funds Interactive (a Forbes “Best of the Web” site), was the Senior Fund Analyst at FundAlarm and author of over 120 fund profiles. David lives in Davenport, Iowa, and spends an amazing amount of time ferrying his son, Will, to baseball tryouts, baseball lessons, baseball practices, baseball games … and social gatherings with young ladies who seem unnervingly interested in him.

The recovery period for Bitcoin’s maximum drawdown required 19 months, during which retirement investors would face sustained and severe portfolio losses. Ethereum presents even more extreme risk characteristics, with a maximum five-year drawdown of nearly 79% (and a near-complete meltdown in 2018) The current Ethereum drawdown stands at 45.29%, that is, at the end of May 2025, an Ether is worth 45% less than it was at its November 2021 peak.

It was a great and horrifying story about two young boys and the arrival of the Cooger and Dark Carnival in Green Town, Illinois. If you entered the carnival grounds late at night, you might be drawn to its iconic ride, Cooger & Dark’s Pandemonium Shadow Show. It’s a story about the ways in which evil can be a powerful temptation to even the best of people. Some of the lines are maddeningly good. A stranger is shot in the street, you hardly move to help. But if, half an hour before, you spent just ten minutes with the fellow and knew a little about him and his family, you might just jump in front of his killer and try to stop it. Really knowing is good. Not knowing, or refusing to know is bad, or amoral, at least. You can’t act if you don’t know. Others half-haunt me. Oh, what strange wonderful clocks women are. They nest in Time. They make the flesh that holds fast and binds eternity. They live inside the gift, know power, accept, and need not mention it. Why speak of time when you are Time, and shape the universal moments, as they pass, into warmth and action? How men envy and often hate these warm clocks, these wives, who know they will live forever. Bradbury declared it his most “delicious” story. The title is also an homage to the witches of Macbeth (Act 4, Scene 1, following “boil and trouble”): 2nd Witch: By the pricking of my thumbs, Something wicked this way comes. [Knocking] Open locks, Whoever knocks! [Enter Macbeth] I admit to having been thinking of dark circuses and evil clowns rather a lot lately. They make it hard to pick up the newspaper most mornings. Chief Justice Warren got it, too: “I always turn to the sports section first. The sports section records man’s accomplishments; the front page has nothing but man’s failures” (Sports Illustrated, July 22, 1968). For readers of the Mutual Fund Observer, two coming circuses will be particularly pressing. Single-stock exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and leveraged single-stock ETFs are relatively new and complex investment products that have garnered significant attention from both investors and researchers. I was struck by the utter flood of new fund registrations in the first weeks of May, which might signal a July or August. Launch. In the middle of 2024, there were about 100 such funds globally. The first in the US seems to have been AXS Tesla and AXS NVIDIA, both launched in 2022. Trading volume and AUM data are scant. Morningstar did report a doubling in the pool’s AUM in the first quarter of 2024. What do they do? In general, they do not own the single stock in question. They own derivatives tied to the performance of the stock, but they are generally tied to one day’s performance: if Tesla drops 25% tomorrow, an inverse-leveraged TSLA ETF will drop by 25%, or 50%, or 75% in a day. The extent of the drop depends on the extent of the leverage provided. The same is true in the other direction. Two ugly realities: In general, these are toys for speculators. They are not investment products. Sadly, investors fall for marketing and overestimate their own abilities. They think they’ll track that 3X DraftKings ETF and move like a ballerina. Or, frankly, more likely, like Dumbo. In general, academic and professional research reach the same conclusion. If you’re a professional with vast tracking resources and a holding period of one day or less, these are fine tools. If you aren’t a professional and don’t intend to monitor hour-by-hour for the rest of your adult life, run away. Morningstar’s take: Single-stock ETFs can meet the needs of a few. High-conviction traders with a single-day or shorter holding period may find them useful vehicles to express their views. After all, it’s hard for everyday investors to use leverage or construct their own covered calls. But the fact is that these products are rarely sensible for everyday investors. They are flawed, costly, and liable to take more from investors than they give. (Ryan Jackson, “For Most Investors, Single-Stock ETFs Are Best Left Alone,” Morningstar.com, 4/9/2024) Which, of course, means that we’re being flooded with them. Here’s a sampling of the 485A prospectus filings that MFO came across during just two weeks in May 2025: More specialized new games include: On May 28, 2025, Mr. Trump’s Department of Labor rescinded a 2022 policy urging “extreme caution” about including cryptocurrency in retirement plans. The official announcement read: The U.S. Department of Labor’s Employee Benefits Security Administration has rescinded a 2022 compliance release that previously discouraged fiduciaries from including cryptocurrency options in 401(k) retirement plans. The 2022 guidance directed plan fiduciaries to exercise “extreme care” before adding cryptocurrency to investment menus. This language deviated from the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and marked a departure from the department’s historically neutral, principled-based approach to fiduciary investment decisions. “The Biden administration’s department of labor made a choice to put their thumb on the scale,” said U.S. Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer. “We’re rolling back this overreach and making it clear that investment decisions should be made by fiduciaries, not D.C. bureaucrats.” One might pause at the breathtaking hypocrisy disguised as policy guidance. If we’re talking about crypto, beloved by Elon & co., the rule is “investment decisions should be made by fiduciaries, not D.C. bureaucrats.” If we’re talking about the option of socially-responsible investments in the same accounts, the rule reverses, and the government must surely make financial decisions rather than trusting fiduciaries. It’s a policy that marries the mendacious with the disastrous, a rare accomplishment. The proposed inclusion of cryptocurrencies in employer retirement plan options raises significant concerns about investor protection, particularly given the extreme volatility and risk characteristics these digital assets exhibit. The cryptocurrency market has experienced substantial growth in trading activity, with the top exchanges processing trillions in volume annually.

June 01, 2025 14:25 ET | Source: Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP SAN DIEGO, June 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP announces that purchasers or acquirers of DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DV) common stock between November 10, 2023 and February 27, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), have until July 21, 2025 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff of the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit. Captioned Electrical Workers Pension Fund, Local 103, I.B.E.W. v. DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc., No. 25-cv-04332 (S.D.N.Y.), the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit charges DoubleVerify as well as certain of DoubleVerify’s top executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit, please provide your information here: https://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-doubleverify-holdings-inc-class-action-lawsuit-dv.html You can also contact attorneys J.C. Sanchez or Jennifer N. Caringal of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at info@rgrdlaw.com. CASE ALLEGATIONS: DoubleVerify provides media effectiveness platforms. The DoubleVerify class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where DoubleVerify’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (ii) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on its Activation Services was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (iii) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (iv) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted DoubleVerify’s profits; (v) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; and (vi) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities. The DoubleVerify class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 28, 2024, DoubleVerify issued lower revenue growth expectations for the first quarter of 2024 due to “a slow start by brand advertisers and a slow ramp by recently signed” customers. On this news, the price of DoubleVerify stock fell more than 21%, according to the complaint. Then, on May 7, 2024, as the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit alleges, DoubleVerify cut its full-year 2024 revenue outlook due to customers that were pulling back on their ad spending. On this news, the price of DoubleVerify stock fell nearly 39%, according to the complaint. The DoubleVerify class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 27, 2025, DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending, and defendants further disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting DoubleVerify. On this news, the price of DoubleVerify stock fell more than 36%, according to the complaint. THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired DoubleVerify common stock during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff of the DoubleVerify class action lawsuit.

Title: Book Review: Stephen Witt’s Take On Nvidia, ‘The Thinking Machine’

ByJohn Tamny ByJohn Tamny, Contributor. SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 18: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivers a keynote address during the ... More Nvidia GTC Artificial Intelligence Conference at SAP Center on March 18, 2024 in San Jose, California. The developer conference is expected to highlight new chip, software, and AI processor technology. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) The world becomes more amazing by the day. The surest evidence of the previous assertion is that wealth inequality continues to soar. Yes, you read that right. Inequality is a wonderful thing opposite the apologetic tone about it taken by left and right. Members of the left plainly disdain it, while members of the right claim it doesn’t exist in the way the left imagines, that thanks to transfer payments (yes, wealth redistribution by government) inequality isn’t that “bad.” Except that it’s not bad. It’s great. How could remarkable achievements that power wealth creation be bad? If someone comes up with a cure for paralysis, will readers demand that the cure never reach the marketplace lest the creator grow rich? The beautiful, freedom-infused meaning of wealth inequality came to mind while reading Stephen Witt’s new book, The Thinking Machine: Jensen Huang, Nvidia, and the World’s Most Coveted Microchip. Nvidia co-founder Huang was already billionaire bracket rich when Nvidia was largely a company popular with gamers, but it’s been Nvidia’s central role in the rise of AI that will increasingly do and think for us in ways that will propel billions into amazing work they can’t not do, that has resulted in Huang achieving centi-billionaire status. Thank goodness for inequality. It signals stupendous, life-enhancing improvement. Huang was already a relentless worker, but it was in 2014 when employee Bryan Catanzaro truly opened Huang’s eyes to the possibilities of AI, and Nvidia’s potential to lead it. After that, and in the words of Witt, “there was only work” for Huang. “There was only AI.” As Huang saw it, AI was “O.I.A.L.O.,” a once in a lifetime opportunity. Huang had the best talent, and he would use it to usher in a future where machines yet again think in addition to doing. Per Witt, the new software “can speak like a human, write a college essay, solve a tricky math problem, provide an expert medical diagnosis, and cohost a podcast.” And that’s just the early stuff. To read Witt is to find out that the known with AI has pedestrian qualities relative to what remains unknown, and even better, what’s not yet been discovered. Markets are a look into the future, equity prices in particular, and Witt quotes Nvidia employee Bas Aarts as saying about what’s known only to those in the proverbial arena, that it’s of the “Wow, I cannot believe this is possible in this age” variety, that “people are oblivious about what is already going on. People have no clue” about the amazing leaps on the way. There’s your inequality. It’s once again born of making the world so much better. The bet here is that AI will unearth human achievement that will render the poorest parts of Africa prosperous, all the while unearthing human flourishing globally that will make the abundant, incredibly prosperous, and – yes – beautifully unequal present appear Bangladesh poor and relatively wealth equal by comparison. Which requires a pause. Just as everyone reads a different book, everyone reviews the same book differently. The review you’re about to read is being written by someone who hasn’t a faint clue about how to “back up” a computer, “upload” a medical form, or even connect a laptop to a printer. This is a way of saying in advance that while Witt’s book is heavy on technical jargon of the CPU, GPU, and CUDA variety, this review will largely focus on the presumed meaning of Nvidia’s ascent to one of the world’s most valuable and most important corporations. Some will ask what’s the point of reading a review of a book about the man and corporation behind a remarkable technological leap since the writer is a technical dolt. It’s a fair point, but one that arguably misses the point. That’s because it doesn’t take someone technologically proficient to grasp the brilliance of work divided across as many hands, machines, and mechanical minds as possible. Even better, it’s not unreasonable to suggest that the mechanized technological genius that’s here and that’s on the way will render the technological illiterates of today the technologists of tomorrow exactly because so much formerly done by humans will be handled by machines. Time will tell. For now, it’s best to start with gratitude for the opposite thinkers. Huang is clearly one of them. Witt writes in the book’s introduction that he’s setting out to tell “the story of a stubborn entrepreneur who pushed his radical vision for computing for thirty years.” As is frequently stated here, there’s no “majoring” in entrepreneurialism simply because no one chooses to be an entrepreneur. Entrepreneurialism is a state of mind, it’s a path certain individuals can’t not take. It’s not planned because it’s not obvious. Furthermore, if it were obvious it wouldn’t be entrepreneurial, and it wouldn’t be entrepreneurial simply because what’s obvious is already being done. To show how outlandish Nvidia’s path was, just look at its valuation along with Huang’s net worth. Oh wow did they ever discover something amazing. Wealth inequality is the measure of this happy truth. Huang as most know is of Taiwanese descent, though his parents (his father was a chemical engineer) sent him and a brother to a boarding school in Kentucky until they arrived. Not a fancy school (though it’s fancier now thanks to Huang), it’s believed Huang’s parents didn’t really know. They perhaps just guessed it was a school full of somebodys instead of one full of misfits. Which on its own is a story. What’s important is that where Huang went to school wasn’t going to matter, nor did it. To his parents, and ultimately him, the U.S. was the goal. Good athletes in the capable sense just need to get here. That's the hard part, while the rest is elevation. When he went off to college, it was Oregon State, not Stanford. In Huang’s words, “I just followed my best friend.” Really, what could school teach him? Genius can’t be taught, which is no insight. Genius was Huang’s parents getting his talents to the United States. The rest was his own invention. How to major in AI since AI wasn’t a thing, or at the very least wasn’t an operable thing when Huang was making his way up. Gaming was primitive. No need. Entrepreneurs create. They invent. Huang and the remarkable talent he cultivated would invent the future, not be told how to do it by some academic. The individual in Bryan Catanzaro whose passion helped spark Huang’s own passion for AI was a humanities major. Hopefully conservatives convinced colleges and universities should pay the federal government back when their graduates don’t thrive read Witt’s book. One’s major is immaterial, particularly in an economy as dynamic as ours. Work that can be taught is, by definition, old news. Out of Oregon State in 1984 Huang secured a job with Advanced Micro Devices. The pay was $28,700/year. Following AMD, Huang went to work for LSI Logic. He rose quickly, and was running a $250 million division when he, along with Sun Microsystems employees Curtis Priem and Chris Malachowsky, decided to pursue what became Nvidia. Even though they were told that the market for PC video gaming hardware was “crowded,” entrepreneurs have evangelical qualities about what they’re doing. Huang clearly did. The bullet-riddled Denny’s where they started making plans for Nvidia is open to this day, and is located at 2484 Berryessa Road in San Jose. Apparently Huang still goes there, and tips in the thousands after ordering all manner of menu items (including chicken fried steak – good taste!) that he eats part of. Huang had even once worked at a Denny’s. Anecdote sucks, but Huang plainly had the immigrant desire to assimilate himself. Of course he did. Conservatives who should know better claim “we” can’t properly assimilate immigrants, but there would never be a need even if there were a real “we” beyond the rhetorical one. Implied in immigration is a desire to assimilate simply because immigration is an expression of a rich-person desire within some of the world’s poorest to increase the value of their labor. Sequoia Ventures, arguably the world’s greatest VC, was along with Sutter Hill the early source of Nvidia’s funds. No less than Don Valentine (Cisco Systems, among others) told Huang after his subpar pitch that “Wilf Corrigan says I have to fund you, so you’re in business.” Corrigan was the head of LSI. He saw up close that Huang was going places. Notable about Nvidia is that it started strong. It’s NV1 chip for video gamers sold in the 100,000 range, and as sales grew so did Nvidia. The problem was that the chips soon enough stopped selling, and their prices were lowered. In Huang’s words about Nvidia’s beginnings, “Every single decision we made was wrong.” Which is an economics lesson on its own. Nvidia’s “recession” was the recovery, or would-be recovery from an NV1 error seen as “catastrophic.” When governments fight recessions they dampen the recovery. That’s the truth about the Great Depression that still eludes 99.99999% of economists. So bad were things from 1993-96 at Nvidia that Valley graphics expert David Kirk made his contract employment there contingent on receiving a paper check every week. Stock options were not an option. Amid all this, including another failed chip, the sign went up at headquarters about how “our company is thirty days from going out of business.” Recessions signal recovery since recessions are when errors are fixed. Huang and Nvidia’s troubled times of old are useful as a way of exposing some of the many fallacies that inform “economics.” For one, there’s a view that won’t die among economics types that the Fed funds rate is the cost of credit. Oh please. There wasn’t a number high enough in the mid-1990s to properly compensate a lender to Nvidia. Except that it wasn’t just that the loan market was shut to Nvidia. Equity finance was a non-starter too as evidenced by Kirk’s demand for actual paper checks over stock options. It all asks readers to contemplate again why Huang is so rich today. It’s so easy to say that he’s that way because he’s a co-founder of Nvidia, but that’s the point. It’s too easy. The better explanation is that few initially wanted Nvidia’s shares. There’s quite simply no such thing as “easy money,” but since there isn’t, Huang almost certainly has more shares than he otherwise would. But that only tells part of the story. In January of 1999 Nvidia went public, but consider the year: 1999. When did you, the reader, first hear of Nvidia? If you own shares, when did you buy them? It’s worth asking mainly because of those who owned Nvidia shares in 1999, it’s no wild speculation that most don’t own those same shares today. It would have been too gut-wrenching for the average bear. Witt reports between the summer of 2001 and the fall of 2002, Nvidia shares lost 90 percent of their value. While Nvidia became part of the S&P 500 after replacing Enron in 2001, and while Huang was briefly a billionaire that same year, Witt notes that Nvidia’s shares didn’t just decline 90%, but that “It would fourteen years before he [Huang] saw that much money again.” To have kept faith in Nvidia on the way to enjoying enormous upside, the typical shareholder would have held on through some rough times, including 2006 when Nvidia’s shares dropped 90 percent once again. Witt quotes one tech pundit as writing amid the 2006 collapse that “For a long time, we have wondered when Nvidia’s abject stupidity would have a price.” Stop and think about that. Or re-read it while thinking more about why Huang is so rich. He believed deeply when few did. It's a reminder that with extraordinary wealth that spurs so much inequality handwringing, it’s perhaps better to think about the unseen. This is particularly useful with Nvidia since Huang, though known to have a “terrifying” temper, was also loathe to fire employees. He yelled them into line with his “cathartic” rants that he was very public about. Ok, but how many left after a tirade, or another dip in Nvidia shares, or because a “better” company like Intel offered them a job. How many individuals walked away from billion-dollar fortunes? One long-time Nvidia employee, Dwight Dierks, sold some shares right after the float in 1999 to buy his father a car. When he describes it as a “billion-dollar-Cadillac” in joking fashion, there’s serious reality underlying the joke. Since going public in 1999, Nvidia shares are up 300,000%. Which is the point, but perhaps not the expected point. It’s so easy to say how foolish it was for early Nvidia employees to leave, or for co-founder Curtis Priem to sell all of his founders shares for hundreds of millions from 2004-2006 when they would be worth $100 billion+ today, but as evidenced by how much departed employees and founders like Priem could have made, Huang pulled off the miracle of miracles. There’s no other way to explain the would have, could have been fortunes. Naturally individuals sold, quit, left, came back, left again, and all sorts of actions unrelated to amassing shares that, by virtue of their miraculous climb, were never supposed to climb this high. In Huang’s case, and amid the occasional costly stumble rooted in his relentless investment “in speculative technologies that would either revolutionize computing or flop,” the future was far from certain. Exactly because any successful chip was immediately a target for imitation, Huang had to keep seeing ahead. In his own words, “If we don’t reinvent computer graphics, if we don’t reinvent ourselves, and we don’t open the canvas for the things we can do,” we “will be commoditized out of business.” Imagine the pressure of having to constantly see around the proverbial corner, while knowing full well the brutal market reaction that awaits after the inevitable mistake. It all speaks to the entrepreneurial mind. And this includes people like Elizabeth Holmes who tragically sit in jail for believing so deeply in her vision. Never asked by Holmes’s myriad critics is why, assuming she knew she was committing fraud, she never sold any of her shares. There was a huge and very liquid market for private shares, yet Holmes held on to hers. It’s that state of mind thing again. It’s why the unequal are unequal. Huang held on, and did so through incredibly difficult stretches that included him fighting to keep his job. The unequal believe in themselves, and they don’t lose faith as others are expressing their lack of faith through share sales. Again, much more interesting than the billionaires minted by Nvidia would be those that weren’t because they sold, exited, or both too soon. Which was once again logical. Witt is clear that earnings represented to Huang the chance to try something new. Rather than pivot toward the obvious, Huang was routinely searching for the “zero-billion-dollar market,” as in the market that’s not yet there. Is it any wonder that truly entrepreneurial visions are rejected by nearly everyone, and most notably the existing commercial successes? Writing about Huang, Witt indicates that he seemed to find comfort in markets “that only he would participate in – one that only he would even see.” Huang indicates to this day that Intel isn’t nor was it ever a competitor. Nvidia was yet again in search of the "zero-billion-dollar” markets that Intel wasn’t interested in, but that Huang was. And is. He saw things and sees things. Very interesting in consideration of Nvidia’s wild ride was the talent that Huang lured into the fold. Keep in mind that this is Silicon Valley, which means the most ferocious battle of all is the ongoing one for talent. Yet despite Nvidia’s scary ups and downs on the way to arguably the world’s most important company, “Nvidia employees were unabashedly elitist.” It was a known that Nvidia was full of talent, which says so much about Huang. With sharks all around him trying to poach the most crucial capital of all, Huang managed to maintain a very deep bench. Terrifying as he could be, Witt notes that almost all of existing and former Nvidia employees interviewed by him “had a tender story about Huang to relate.” What fun it would be to follow him around for a day, or days. And not just Huang. A company this dynamic is logically dense with characters. There’s Bill Dally, who dropped out of high school given an aversion to sitting through history class, became an auto mechanic, but ultimately got a BA at Virginia Tech, a Masters from Stanford, and a PhD from MIT. Dally had options, including Intel, and was told he was “crazy” for not taking an Intel job that surely more than a few Nvidians (?) did. There was John Nickolls who always yelled instead of talking. Witt notes that Nickolls “had no interest in video games at all,” but was passionate about proving Moore’s Law wrong. He did. Nvidia did. Cancer ultimately took Nickolls way too early, but to read about him was to want to ask him (or others in the Nvidia orbit) if he felt the mechanization of knowledge and thought might eventually save him from the cancer that existing medicine couldn’t. Alex Krizhevsky didn’t work for Nvidia, but he trained neural nets to see and think. By his actions, this soft-spoken Ukrainian immigrant conveyed to all manner of academics that (per Witt) “they had so far wasted their careers” on beliefs that Krizhevsky discredited with a week’s worth of “training,” and enormous amounts of electricity used in the training. Krizshevsky oversaw a giant leap, one indicating that “if you could teach computers to see, you could teach them everything.” Of course, in writing what was just written it’s almost certain that all sorts of things were mangled in the telling. But that’s surely the point. And it’s why the AI advances elicit so much optimism in your reviewer. AI isn’t a threat to humanity, rather it will elevate humankind in ways too grand to describe. Is there a way to say how it will reveal its genius? Certainly not. If there was a way to know what’s ahead, then those who know would be billionaires for knowing. All we know, or should know, is that it will be brilliant. Think of the pin factory Adam Smith entered in the 18th century. One man working alone could maybe produce one pin per day, but several men working together could produce tens of thousands. Multiply the latter hundreds of thousands of times over with AI as technology thinks and does as though thousands and millions of brilliantly skilled individuals are at work. Oh, to be born today. Or fifty years from now. Surprisingly, Witt expresses fear throughout the book that AI could have evil qualities, but in the words of Huang, “In order to be a creature, you have to be conscious.” AI will lift humans to the best versions of themselves precisely because it will enable specialization that will have more and more of us working all the time not because we have to, but because we want to. In a very real sense, the AI that has been authored by the remarkable chips created by Nvidia will turn the world’s workers into Nvidia’s workers. Which will be a beautiful sight to see. Impossibly rich as Nvidia employees are, they’re still coming to work. They can’t not. They work all the time because they love what they’re doing, and they’re in love with discovery. It cannot be stressed enough that progress in life is defined not by what we’re doing and learning, but by what we no longer need to do and learn. That’s why Huang is so right that AI “can only lead to good.” It’s so true. About halfway through The Thinking Machine, Witt quotes AI visionary (and oddly enough, skeptic) Geoffrey Hinton talking about “the uncontainable thrill of sneak previewing embargoed AI technology that would shock the world once unveiled.” Yes! Once again, to be young. There’s no limit to human advance, particularly as production is spread across a soaring number of hands, machines, and thought that’s mechanized. Read Stephen Witt’s book to get a sense of what’s ahead as wealth inequality soars thanks to human flourishing going skyward, but almost as fun, sit back and watch. We haven’t seen this movie before, but it will make all that we’ve seen before seem incredibly bland by comparison.

Title: These 5 Special Dividends Are More Than Meets The Eye

ByBrett Owens ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Young businessman working on laptop at home. Most mainstream financial websites are not “smart enough” to include special dividends. The yields they display reflect plain ol’ quarterly or monthly payouts. For most stocks this does not matter. But for a select few “special payers” this is a costly oversight. One that we can capitalize on as thoughtful contrarians. In a moment we’ll discuss five special dividends. The vanilla screens say they pay as little as 3.2% but in reality they dish up to 13.8%! What exactly is a special dividend payment? It is a one-time cash payout, often the result of a massive cash influx from, say, selling off part of the company or having an unusually profitable year. Usually it is a one-shot deal. But it can be a regular thing. Let’s consider chicken producer Pilgrim’s Pride (PPC), which recently paid a $6.30 per share special dividend. This is a tremendous 12.7% yield. That’s amazing for people who held PPC at the time, but given the company’s dividend history, it’s likely this is it: PPC Dividend PPC is a classic example of a one-time payer. We are looking for exceptions—the one-time payment that happens every year! These are “regular” special dividends, sometimes called “supplemental dividends,” that the company pairs with a regular dividend they know they can afford. Example: ABC Inc. pays 25 cents per share quarterly, but at the end of the year, it pays out 50% of its free cash flow as a supplemental dividend. That dividend still might vary—say, $1 in 2023, $1.50 in 2024, and $1.25 in 2025—but it’s extra yield on top of what it can afford to pay on the regular. In some cases, these special dividend payers can be quite generous. Let’s take these 3.2%-11.3% yielders that actually pay out 9.0%-13.8% once we include their special distributions: Buckle (BKE)Stated Dividend Yield: 3.2%Actual Dividend Yield (With Specials): 9.0% Buckle (BKE) is a mid- to high-end fashion retailer that’s primarily known for its jeans, but it also sells all sorts of apparel, activewear, swimwear and accessories. Fashion stocks have always been fickle, but post-COVID, they’ve been downright counterintuitive. Numerous “mall retail” stocks found themselves slowly declining in the years preceding the pandemic, only to find new life despite COVID broadly knocking brick-and-mortar retail on its tail. That includes the Buckle, whose top and bottom lines have dipped from their post-COVID highs but are still far better than what the store delivered for years prior to the pandemic. Looking at its regular dividend over the past decade or so, the difference is hard to notice—a couple of small raises in 2021, but that’s it. However, that’s because Buckle’s dividend has long been unlike its fashion retail brethren. The company prefers to pay a modest regular quarterly dividend, then top it up each year with sometimes spectacular special dividends that boost BKE’s yield by double, triple, sometimes even more. Naturally, the rub is that, by virtue of offering massive special dividends, the amount of income we collect from Buckle has the potential to shift enormously from one year to the next—even if the specials have been fairly consistent of late, and even if operational results are largely expected to remain steady over the next couple of years. Even the potential for income volatility isn’t great for retirement planners, but for more adventurous investors, it’s a secret store of upside that most people will typically overlook. Amerisafe (AMSF)Stated Dividend Yield: 3.3%Actual Dividend Yield (With Specials): 9.7% Amerisafe (AMSF) is a relatively unusual insurer that deals in workers’ compensation. The company operates in 27 states and deals in “high-hazard” industries such as construction, trucking and agriculture. Anyone who wants to invest in an industry with consistent profits should sprint away from the insurance space. AMSF is actually relatively stable compared to, say, P&C insurance, where even good operators may occasionally suffer annual losses. But even then, Amerisafe’s bottom line is a moving target. Which makes a regular-and-specials program an extremely responsible way to manage the dividend. AMSF pays a modest (but growing!) quarterly dividend that typically yields around 3%. Then every year, usually in December, it will pay a special dividend with whatever profits it can spare. Like with Buckle, this payout usually doubles or triples the amount of income its shareholders collect in a given year. Again, retirees can’t plan their budgets around dividends like Amerisafe’s. But consider this: AMSF’s 2024 special dividend was the company’s lowest in roughly a decade, and it still boosted the stock’s total yield to nearly 10%. With that level of dividend, we don’t need much positive price action to have a great annual return. I’d keep an eye on that bottom line, though. AMSF’s profits, which have already slid for a couple years now, are projected to thin this year and next, too. One area of the market that’s rife with “regular” special dividends is the business development company (BDC) community. These companies share a lot in common with real estate investment trusts (REITs): they were both created by Congress, they both exist to allow regular investors to invest in an otherwise difficult-to-reach asset, and they both are required to pay out at least 90% of their taxable income in the form of dividends. But BDCs invest in dozens if not hundreds of small businesses: not exactly a hotbed of stability and reliability. So in the BDC space, we’ll frequently see fairly generous regular dividends complemented with specials that take already good yields and make them downright great. Gladstone Investment Corp. (GAIN)Stated Dividend Yield: 6.4%Actual Dividend Yield (With Specials): 14.3% Gladstone Investment Corp. (GAIN) is part of my favorite Wall Street family: the Gladstones! This group of businesses also includes another publicly traded BDC, Gladstone Capital Corp. (GLAD), as well as a pair of publicly traded REITs: Gladstone Land Corp. (LAND) and Gladstone Commercial Corp. (GOOD). GAIN’s target portfolio company will generate $4 million to $15 million in annual EBITDA, have a proven business model, stable cash flows and minimal market or technology risk. As far as BDCs go, GAIN has a narrower portfolio than most, at just 25 companies—mostly manufacturing, business services and consumer services firms, but a few consumer product specialists, too. What sticks out most about Gladstone Investment Corp., however, is its willingness to deal in equity. Most BDCs will typically only have 5% to 10% exposure to equity, but GAIN’s target mix is 25% equity/75% debt. This is essential to GAIN’s “buyout” strategy. Gladstone Investment typically provides most (if not all) of the debt capital along with a majority of the equity capital. Its debt investments allow it to pay out a still-high regular dividend, but then it also pays out (extremely variable) supplemental payouts when they realize gains on equity investments. To wit, GAIN’s regular monthly dividend accounts for 6% worth of yield, but a 54-cent special dividend to be paid in June and a 70-cent distribution last October work out to an additional 8.3% in yield! That said, Gladstone’s specials are all over the place. The company paid three in 2022 and five in 2023, but just one in 2024 and (so far) just one in 2025. Nuveen Churchill Direct Lending Corp. (NCDL)Stated Dividend Yield: 11.3%Actual Dividend Yield (With Specials): 13.8% Nuveen Churchill Direct Lending Corp. (NCDL) is among a handful of other BDCs, such as Goldman Sachs BDC (GSBD) and Carlyle Secured Lending (CGBD), that’s connected from a big-name asset manager with a sterling reputation. In this case, NCDL is tied to both fund manager Nuveen, as well as its parent TIAA. The fund’s external manager—Churchill, a Nuveen affiliate—invests the BDC in senior secured loans to private equity-owned middle market companies in the U.S. The $2.1 billion portfolio is 210 companies strong right now. The vast majority of holdings (91%) are first lien loans, though Nuveen Churchill Direct Lending also deals in second lien debt, subordinated loans and equity co-investment. This is a relatively young BDC that has only been in existence since 2018, and it just went public in 2024. I wrote plenty about the company in a September column, but here, I want to focus on the payout. Nuveen Churchill Direct Lending has come out of the gate with a regular-and-specials format. The regular quarterly dividend has been set at 45 cents per share, and it has so far paid an additional 10-cent special in every quarter since its IPO. That’s a strong double-digit yield base with, at least for now, a meaningful 2.5 percentage points in special sweeteners. The special distributions were declared in connection with the IPO, and April’s 10-cent payout was the final dividend in that tranche. Indeed, NCDL’s streak might stop this summer—based on its previous activity, any special dividends to be paid in July likely would have been announced in April. If nothing else, investors should keep their eye on NCDL over the next few quarters to see whether these specials were a one-off event or something the BDC will come back to following strong financial results. Also, NCDL is young, so it’s difficult to tell where its “normal” valuation range will lie, but for now, the BDC is trading at an 11% discount to NAV. Barings BDC (BBDC)Stated Dividend Yield: 11.3%Actual Dividend Yield (With Specials): 12.9% Barings BDC (BBDC) is the cheapest of these three BDCs, trading at an 18% discount to NAV right now. The Barings name might not mean much to some readers, but longtime BDC investors will surely remember the name “Triangle Capital.” That’s what the company was known as until August 2018, when the company rebranded following years of writing off bad investments and hacking away at its dividend. But it wasn’t just a rebrand—it was a new lease on life. Global financial services firm Barings became an external advisor and overhauled BBDC’s portfolio. Today, Barings primarily invests in senior secured private debt investments in “well-established” middle-market companies across numerous industries. Target companies for its sponsor-backed investments (issuers owned by private equity firms), the largest part of its business at 75%-85% exposure generally, generate between $15 million and $75 million in EBITDA annually. It also has smaller exposure to non-PE-owned businesses, as well as a pair of middle market first lien loan originators, Eclipse Business Capital and Rocade Capital. Meanwhile, about 70% of its investments are first lien loans, though it also has exposure to second lien, mezzanine, equity, structured, and joint venture investments. We’ve booked gains in BBDC twice through our Dividend Swing Trader service, so I frequently have my eye on this one for short- and long-term opportunities alike. So I was pleased to see when Barings made a splash in Q1. After a few years of dividend growth, the company’s quarterly dividend had been stuck at 26 cents per share since mid-2023. However, in February, Barings announced it would pay 5-cent special dividends across the first three quarters of 2025 “based on these strong results, our confidence in our portfolio, and the momentum we have seen so far in 2025.” While I’d prefer growth in the “stickier” regular dividend, this is a welcome development. The company hasn’t made “top-up” specials since 2014 and 2015. If BBDC makes this a lasting habit, its already stellar dividend will become even tastier. I’ll be keeping a close eye on the stock over the next couple of quarters to see if it extends this line of specials into the end of 2025 and into 2026.

More Service seen displayed on a smartphone with the Moodys logo in the background. (Photo Illustration by Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) This latest US debt downgrade is a buying opportunity for us contrarians. I say that because we had the same (profitable) setup the last three times the ratings agencies took Uncle Sam’s credit rating down a peg. You might find that last sentence surprising. Three times? Indeed, the US government has seen its debt downgraded on three different occasions: 2011, 2023 and most recently a couple of weeks ago. You can be forgiven for not remembering all of these: In some cases (2023 comes to mind), they didn’t really make headlines. In others, they set up a small dip in stocks (and stock-focused closed-end funds yielding 8%+) that was well worth buying. Let’s go through all three occasions and see what they can tell us. We’ll also look at how they affected the performance of the Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX), a holding in my CEF Insider service. ADX pays a roughly 9% dividend as I write this and sports a discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio) of around 8%. The fund holds some of the biggest (and most credit-worthy!) US stocks, like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Visa (V), not to mention top-quality lenders like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM). Let’s start in August 2011, when debt-ceiling wrangling in Congress prompted Standard & Poor’s to downgrade US government debt. At the time, this move was historic: No agency had ever downgraded the US government’s credit, which was considered incredibly safe. What happened next? US long-term Treasuries (in blue below) surged some 20% from the day of the downgrade through the end of 2011. The S&P 500 (in orange) also had a good run, returning nearly 6% over those few months. ADX (in purple) trailed behind, but as we’ll see next, this lag made it the best opportunity of the three. ADX 2011 Buying the S&P 500 was clearly a smart move here. But playing the contrarian and buying bonds after the downgrade delivered even faster returns. Over the long run, however, it was ADX (in purple below) that won out, with dividends reinvested: ADX Total Returns Now let’s look at the next downgrade, in August 2023. This time it was Fitch that cut Uncle Sam to the agency’s second-highest rating. ADX 2023 ADX (in purple above) has returned about 44% since then, as of this writing, well ahead of the S&P 500’s 30% gain (in orange). Meantime, Treasuries (in blue) are in the red. Why the difference in government-bond action between this downgrade and the first one? That’s another article on its own, but suffice it to say, it had more to do with slower-than-expected Fed rate cuts than the downgrade. The most recent downgrade, just a couple weeks ago, did cause a dip in stocks, ADX and bonds, however—though ADX has fallen the least as I write this. These declines are likely the result of tariff uncertainty, which has caused more anxiety than we saw in late 2023, when stocks were recovering from the 2022 pullback. ADX 2025 As you can see above, all three stayed flat until falling a little on May 20, then falling sharply the next day, when Walmart warned about price increases (and therefore lower consumer spending), and Target reported disappointing sales. The smart money did not sell when the news was first released on the 16th, but we are probably seeing more selling pressure as the retailers’ warnings have added anxiety. In the coming days, we could see stocks go flat or slightly negative if the sour attitude sticks around. But that would be a buying opportunity—especially for equity CEFs like ADX—similar to the openings we saw in 2023 and 2011. Another important point: the downgrade doesn’t impact all US assets. In its announcement, Moody’s makes clear that the downgrade impacts America’s “long-term issuer and senior unsecured” debt, but “the US long-term local- and foreign-currency country ceilings remain at Aaa.” In other words, the downgrade applies to US Treasuries greater than one year in duration (government bonds, basically, up to and including 30-year issues). Those bonds now have the second-highest rating from all three ratings agencies. At the same time, non-government debt issuers in the US can still have the top rating—including American companies. In fact, Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) still have the Aaa rating from Moody’s. (Note that ADX holds Apple and Microsoft, so it’s a good pick if you’re still concerned about credit quality.) Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

(Photo Illustration by Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) This latest US debt downgrade is a buying opportunity for us contrarians. I say that because we had the same (profitable) setup the last three times the ratings agencies took Uncle Sam’s credit rating down a peg. You might find that last sentence surprising. Three times? Indeed, the US government has seen its debt downgraded on three different occasions: 2011, 2023 and most recently a couple of weeks ago. You can be forgiven for not remembering all of these: In some cases (2023 comes to mind), they didn’t really make headlines. In others, they set up a small dip in stocks (and stock-focused closed-end funds yielding 8%+) that was well worth buying. Let’s go through all three occasions and see what they can tell us. We’ll also look at how they affected the performance of the Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX), a holding in my CEF Insider service. ADX pays a roughly 9% dividend as I write this and sports a discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio) of around 8%. The fund holds some of the biggest (and most credit-worthy!) US stocks, like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Visa (V), not to mention top-quality lenders like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM).

Title: Market Implications Of Tariff Litigation And AI Spending

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. Despite what could be a lengthy legal battle, tariffs are unlikely to be removed completely. The ... More sectoral tariffs were not challenged and President Trump added additional steel tariffs on Friday. The tariff dispute does have some crucial implications for future trade deals and the tax bill. US economic data releases, which generally raised estimates of second-quarter economic growth, combined with strong earnings from Nvidia (NVDA), helped send stocks higher for the week. Additionally, improvement in consumer confidence helped raise optimism that the tariff overhang doesn’t need to sink the economy. A portion of the tariffs implemented by the Trump administration was briefly overturned, though it was reinstated pending appeal. After the rally last week, the S&P 500 sits only 3.8% below its mid-February high. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has fared worse, and the group is 5.5% below its mid-December summit despite outperforming last week. Market Performance The betting odds of a recession in 2025 have continued to decline. This improvement aligns with the supportive economic data released last week, which increased the estimates of US second-quarter GDP growth. Furthermore, the Conference Board’s survey of consumer confidence rose after plummeting in the wake of President Trump’s tariff announcements on Liberation Day. Betting Odds Of US Recession In 2025 Notably, stocks hit their April low when betting odds of recession were at their highest. As one should expect, the S&P 500 index has risen as the odds of a recession have declined. Stocks & Recession Odds Nvidia did not disappoint investors with better-than-expected quarterly earnings and robust guidance for second-quarter revenue growth of 50% year-over-year. Some worries that the spending on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure had weighed on the mega-cap technology companies, as represented by the Magnificent 7. In early April, the group was 30% below their mid-December peak. Most of this decline has reversed due to lower odds of recession. Additionally, the first-quarter earnings season provided evidence of both continued spending on AI infrastructure and, more importantly, proof that companies were successfully monetizing these AI investments into tangible earnings growth. Magnificent 7: Q1 Estimated Earnings Growth Last week, the Court of International Trade (CIT) struck down the majority of the tariffs implemented by the Trump administration. The sectoral tariffs, for example, those on autos and steel, were not impacted by this ruling. The tariffs removed include the 10% universal tariff, the reciprocal tariffs, and the specific tariffs targeting China, Canada, and Mexico. According to Strategas, this would remove about $220 billion in tariffs, leaving just $40 billion of those implemented since the start of the year. Within less than 24 hours after the ruling, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit granted a stay. Therefore, the tariffs will remain in place, and the US will not yet need to refund the tariff revenue collected to date. This litigation could be a lengthy process, but even if the tariffs are struck down at the end of the litigation, President Trump has the legal authority to reimpose tariffs via alternative methods. However, these methods come with some additional limitations. According to Strategas, Sections 338 and 122 of the Tariff Act of 1930 can be utilized quickly to reinstate many of the tariffs that are currently at risk. Section 338 allows for tariffs of up to 50% that take effect 30 days after announcement, with no time limit on their duration. Section 122 gives the president the authority to impose tariffs of up to 15% with immediate effect, but these tariffs can only remain in place for 150 days without congressional approval. Furthermore, Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 permits the imposition of tariffs following an investigation by the United States Trade Representative (USTR). It is doubtful that tariffs will go away unless President Trump decides that they are, but the utilization of other methods is more laborious, time-consuming, and comes with more limitations. Even though tariffs seem likely to remain a part of the investment landscape, regardless of the outcome of the litigation, there are some crucial implications of the additional uncertainty. On the margin, the possibility that the courts could remove the tariffs leaves the Trump administration with less leverage to negotiate trade deals with other countries. Countries may choose to stall and see what happens with the litigation. The G-7 meeting in June could provide some insight into whether any new deals are forthcoming. The tax bill passed by the US House of Representatives was debt-neutral if the revenue from the tariffs was included in the scoring. The risk to the tariff revenue may further complicate the Senate’s deliberations in passing a version of the bill. Markets will remain on the tariffs, with markets watching for any changes in US policy and the progress of the legal challenge. Further, retaliation from or trade deals with other countries will be notable. The economic calendar has the critical monthly jobs report on Friday. Expectations are for nonfarm payroll job growth to slow to 125,000 from 177,000 in April. The unemployment rate is expected to remain steady at 4.2%. These forecasts are consistent with the weekly initial filings for unemployment benefits, which remain low and don’t indicate a collapse in the labor market. Initial Jobless Claims Ongoing claims for unemployment benefits are rising, indicating that it is taking longer for those losing their jobs to find new employment. The labor market is showing signs of bending but not yet breaking. Continuing Claims Regardless of the outcome of the tariff litigation, tariffs are unlikely to be banished completely. To that point, President Trump imposed a 50% steel tariff late last Friday, and these sectoral tariffs are not part of the current legal challenge. Recent hard economic data, along with some soft data, such as consumer confidence, have raised optimism that US economic growth remains resilient. Furthermore, technology spending related to artificial intelligence continues, with the sector producing robust earnings growth. This week’s jobs report will be another key indicator of the US economy’s health.

Title: Walmart, Amazon, Costco, And Home Depot Tackle The Tariff Whiplash

ByShelley E. Kohan ByShelley E. Kohan, Senior Contributor. Coscto is focused on member pricing and plans to try and mitigate as much of the impact from tariffs ... More as it can for its customers. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) The five largest retailers in the U.S -- Walmart, Amazon, Costco, Kroger, and Home Depot-- have all reported their financial earnings for the first part of 2025. The combined force of these retailers equates to nearly 20% of total retail sales in the United States. The big five retailers all agree that it is difficult to predict the future impact of tariffs, however, each retailer has been working on mitigating the impact of tariffs on pricing and product availability for its consumers. The impact of tariffs on financial reporting so far this year has been minimal because most of the earnings reported are from periods before the April 5th tariffs took effect. Home Depot and Walmart shared financials through the end of April, while Costco data goes through mid-May. Kroger, which operates over 20 store banners including Ralphs and Harris Teeter, reported financials through January. Amazon’s first quarter financials run through March. Walmart, Amazon,Costco and Home Depot have pulled forward their inventory purchases to mitigate the impact of tariffs. Purchasing inventory in advance will help ensure a company has product in stock down the line and can offer the best possible pricing. Amazon encouraged its third-party suppliers to do the same. Costco moved up the delivery for patio products and sporting goods to stay ahead of the tariff pricing impacts. While Walmart says it cannot absorb all the cost pressures from tariffs and may have to raise ... More prices, it wants to keep food prices as low as they can. (Photo by: Jeffrey Greenberg/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) Even the U.S.’s largest retailers cannot take the sole burden of the tariffs by absorbing the costs without raising prices. Discount stores, grocery stores, ecommerce players, and warehouse clubs typically run on very thin profit margins. "We’re positioned to manage the cost pressure from tariffs as well or better than anyone. But even at the reduced levels, the higher tariffs will result in higher prices," said Doug McMillon, CEO of Walmart. The magnitude of the tariffs cannot be offset by lower-margin businesses. Home improvement giant Home Depot plans to maintain its competitive pricing despite tariff impacts through stronger supplier partnerships, supply chain diversification, and focusing on improving its productivity across activities. “We don’t see broad-based price increases for our customers at all going forward. It’s a great opportunity for us to take share, and it’s a great opportunity for our suppliers to take share as well,” said Billy Bastek, executive vice president of merchandising at Home Depot. In the grocery sector, where food prices are 2.0% higher on a rolling 12-month basis, consumers are already having to spend more based on inflation. Companies like Walmart are trying to protect against additional costs due to tariffs on food products, considered a non-discretionary expense. “We won’t let tariff-related cost pressure on some general merchandise items put pressure on food prices, " said McMillon. Food tariffs on countries in South and Central America are pressuring imported items like bananas, avocados, coffee, and flowers. “We’ll do our best to control what we can control in order to keep food prices as low as possible," said McMillon. Costco held pricing on pineapples and bananas despite the cost of these goods rising due to tariffs. However, when it came to flowers, which were also impacted by additional tariffs, the company felt that a price increase was absorbable by the consumer as flower purchases were viewed as a discretionary expense. Kroger, with 100% of its sales in the U.S., is looking at being proactive and diversifying its supplier base to keep prices lower, especially in the fresh produce category. "We expect inflation to be 1.5% to 2.5%, which does not include the effects from tariffs," said Todd Foley earlier in the year, interim CFO at Kroger. Amazon customers are becoming more reliant on the company for everyday essential products which ... More represented one out of every three units sold in the U.S. online at Amazon in the first quarter. Global retailers have been looking at diversifying sourcing options to reduce the cost of goods as tariffs are implemented. Amazon and Walmart have been diversifying their supply chains for many years, with a focus on not being too reliant on one country for imports. Two-thirds of what Walmart sells in the U.S. is made, assembled, or grown domestically. Walmart is further diversifying its revenue by leaning into better profit areas such as selling advertising through its retail media network, expanding its marketplace, and increasing membership income. Costco is rerouting goods to non-U.S. markets and working closely with suppliers to find alternate production locations. The private label brand, Kirkland Signature, which represents one-third of Costco’s sales, continues to be a consumer favorite in quality and value. The company has been sourcing the products into countries where items are sold to keep the pricing down. Costco’s most profitable sector, its membership revenue, is up 5.4%, with membership increasing to 137 million members last year despite a rise in its membership price. Home Depot has diversified its supply chain, with over 50% of purchases already sourced in the U.S. “We anticipate that twelve months from now, no single country outside of the United States will represent more than 10% of our purchases," said Ted Decker, CEO of Home Depot. Amazon is relentlessly focused on back-of-house infrastructure to improve delivery speeds and reduce costs by heavily investing in robotics and automation. The purchasing of everyday essentials continues to grow as a category for the consumer, making them more reliant on the Amazon brand and includes categories such as household goods, personal care items, and pantry staples. "We have an extremely large selection, hundreds of millions of unique SKUs (stock keeping units), which means we’re often able to weather challenging conditions better than others. When you have the broadest selection like we do and 2,000,000 plus global sellers like we do, you're better positioned to help customers find whatever items matter to them at lower price points than elsewhere," said Andy Jassy, CEO, Amazon. However, Costco’s narrow merchandise depth and broad assortment allow the company to focus on fewer SKUs, giving it a competitive advantage. "We believe our expertise in buying a limited SKU count model gives us greater agility to navigate the environment and ultimately increase our member values compared to the market," said Gary Millerchip, CFO at Costco. Home Depot will be looking at SKU optimization and possibly editing out some products that are significantly impacted by tariff costs but do not make sense to keep in its current assortment. Other retailers outside the big five have been working on optimizing the product styles that are most relevant to their customer base and eliminating the ones that are too costly or have lower turnover. As we move into the second quarter for most retailers (May through July), pricing may not be as impacted because retail buyers usually procure goods many months in advance of the selling season. However, going into fall and holiday selling, consumers may see price increases just in time for holiday purchasing. With imported items, the tariff is paid at the time it comes through customs, which means those products are most likely not in the U.S. yet. Retailers are unable to predict pricing for later in the year due to the uncertainty of where tariffs will land. There are too many assumptions and factors for retailers to chart a specific path forward during these highly unpredictable times in the retail landscape. The big five retailers continue to model various scenarios to help mitigate price increases or out-of-stocks for their customer base. The advantage with the larger multi-billion dollar retailers like Walmart, Amazon, Costco, Kroger, and Home Depot is the ability to leverage supplier networks and lean into the amount of resources available to help build out more sophisticated infrastructure to support a diversified supply network. The retailers are working hard to make sure prices stay in line with customer expectations, but it is too early within a volatile tariff landscape to predict the actual impact on pricing for consumers for the remainder of the year.

It’s a new month, and investors are heading into it amid fresh inflation data and rising pessimism that’s dominating headlines. With the Fed’s next meeting now just weeks away, all eyes will be on Friday’s jobs report, which could shape expectations for rate cuts this summer. At the same time, President Trump’s legal battles continue to reverberate throughout the market, just as a whopping 83% of of CEOs say they’re bracing for a downturn. Add in jobs data and earnings from a host of consumer names like Lululemon (LULU), MongoDB (MDB), HP (HPQ), and Dollar Tree (DLTR), and the first week of June looks unlikely to be lacking in storylines. Here’s what to watch: Campbell’s Company – parent of popular shelf staples including Prego and Goldfish – will release earnings before the market opens, with a conference call scheduled for 8:00 a.m. ET. Analysts are expecting revenue of approximately $2.43 billion, reflecting 2% growth. On the macro side, at 10:00 a.m. ET, the U.S. Census Bureau will release the April 2025 Construction Spending report. This data provides insights into the health of the construction sector, which can influence economic growth projections and decision-making in closely related industries from real estate to manufacturing. Tuesday brings a greater mix of significant earnings reports and economic data releases that could sway market sentiment. Cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike (CRWD) will share Q1 2026 earnings after the market closes. Analysts are closely watching for updates following the company’s recent announcement to cut approximately 5% of its workforce in one more corporate bid for AI-flavored “operational efficiency.” HP and Dollar General (DG) also report. The discount retailer is mid-turnaround, with its stock price recovering around 30% this year but still well off 52-week highs. Looking to the hard-economics side, expect BLS data on job opening and labor turnover at 10:00 a.m., alongside the Census Bureau’s Factory Orders and the OECD’s globe-spanning Economic Outlook. Wednesday brings another dose of retail and tech earnings. Dollar Tree will report before the bell. With roughly 40% of its inventory sourced from China, investors will parse the results for tariffs’ effects on retail. After the close, MongoDB and Five Below (FIVE) release their results, too. MongoDB’s earnings will offer a read on enterprise software spending amid a 40% drop in the company’s stock price since last year. Five Below’s report should reveal whether tween-and-teen discretionary spending on pool noodles, inflatable chairs, and Disney-branded collectibles is still chugging along. Economic data hits early, with the ADP private payrolls report for May landing around 8:15 a.m. ET, an important preview of government jobs numbers due later in the week. At 9:45 a.m., the final read on S&P Global’s U.S. Services PMI offers a snapshot of activity in the economy’s biggest sector, followed at 10:00 by the Census Bureau’s manufacturing shipments and inventory data. Thursday’s earnings lineup features Lululemon and DocuSign, both reporting after the bell. Lululemon’s results will shed light on a very important athleisure-maxi-dress debate (subject of much TikTok controversy), as well as international growth and inventory levels. DocuSign, meanwhile, will be watched for clues on whether demand for e-signatures and contract management is holding up in a tight corporate spending environment. Analysts expect modest growth but remain wary of margin pressures and customer churn. The macro calendar launches at 8:30 a.m. ET with revised productivity and labor cost data for Q1, which gives context regarding wage-inflation trends. Also at 8:30, the Census Bureau’s international trade report for April provides a look at goods and services flows amid the trade wars. Both reports could sway expectations heading into Friday’s closely watched jobs release. Friday is a pivotal day for markets. No major earnings releases are scheduled, but the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the May Employment Situation report at 8:30 a.m. ET. Expect a comprehensive look at job growth, unemployment rates, and the overall health of the job market. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Famed market bear Albert Edwards tells BI stocks are vulnerable — and opens up about his role as Wall Street's 'uber-bear'

Time Published: 2025-06-01T08:30:01Z
Full Content:
Even if the words coming out of Albert Edwards' mouth were gloomy, the famously bearish Société Générale strategist was in his usual good mood on Tuesday. It's something that tends to catch people off guard when they meet him, he said. "I'm quite a happy, upbeat person," Edwards told BI. "As opposed to the miserable bastard I come across in my written work." If you follow the British strategist's research, it's not hard to see why he comes across as a grouch. He is known as a perennial bear on Wall Street (he refuses the moniker of "perma-bear" and prefers "uber-bear"). His weekly client notes regularly question the prevailing market narrative and warn of downside scenarios. His latest report warned that rising Japanese bond yields could lead to a "global financial market Armageddon." His tune during a May 27 interview was no different. Edwards, who shot to fame for correctly calling the eventual dot-com bust in the late 1990s, said that stocks are still vulnerable to a pullback after their 18% rally from April lows. Despite investors starting to discount recession and inflation risks on the heels of President Donald Trump's tariff reductions, valuations remain high and risks abound, he said. One of those risks is the possibility that investors start to question hefty AI spending from the mega-cap tech firms. Another is a potential recession. But, in his opinion, the top risk the market should be aware of is rising Japanese interest rates, which could cause an exodus of capital from the US as investors unwind the yen carry trade and chase more attractive yields. The Bank of Japan, having kept interest rates low for years, pushed flows of money into US stocks and bonds. Now that the trend is reversing, those flows could grind to a halt, he said. Ultimately, however, it's not easy to know what will spark a stock-market decline. What's easier to know is simply that the market is in a precarious spot thanks to "steamy" valuations. One popular measure, the Shiller CAPE ratio, shows stock valuations at some of their highest levels in history. "These are really super high valuations," he said. "And you look at things like the relationship between bonds and equities, with bond yields where they are now and the equity risk premium being so low." "You just think, 'You're a bit vulnerable here to bad news, aren't you?'" he added. "Something comes along, you really are not in a great situation." Edwards is something of an anomaly on Wall Street. Most of the time, top strategists issue fairly bullish forecasts. For example, in January this year, the average 2025 S&P 500 price target saw 11.5% upside. Just two strategists — Stifel's Barry Bannister and BCA Research's Peter Berezin — predicted negative returns this year. It remains to be seen whether that will be the case, but suffice to say, investors were caught off guard by the S&P 500's 20% decline from February to April. It's these rapid declines, though few and far between, that Edwards wants investors to keep in mind as possible outcomes in frothy environments. As a result of pessimistic tendencies, Edwards isn't correct all too often, but that's not necessarily the point — and his readers know that. "A lot of clients who totally disagree with me like to read my stuff. It's a reality check," he said. Earlier this year, financial professionals detailed to BI the pressure that strategists face from both their bosses and clients if they're wrongly bearish for too long. David Rosenberg, who called the housing bubble and recession in the mid-to-late 2000s while working as the chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch, said the firm asked him not to use the word "bubble" to describe housing market dynamics at the time because it was scaring clients. Edwards said he doesn't feel that pressure. He writes his notes as Société Générale's "alternative view," separate from their house view. "You have to have good employers," he said. "People have said to me, 'If you worked at an American bank, you'd be fired immediately because of your views.'" Where Big Tech secrets go public — unfiltered in your inbox weekly.
