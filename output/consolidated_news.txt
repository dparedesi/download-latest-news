Title: DOJ, FTC Side Against Largest Asset Managers in ESG-Related Coal Suit
URL: https://www.ai-cio.com/news/doj-ftc-side-against-largest-asset-managers-in-esg-related-coal-suit/
Time Published: 2025-05-23T17:36:58Z
Full Content:
On Thursday, the Department of Justice and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a statement of interest supporting a complaint which alleges BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street conspired to suppress the coal market. In November 2024, 13 state attorneys general, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, filed a complaint, Texas et. al. v. BlackRock Inc., State Street Corp., and The Vanguard Group, against the three asset managers, alleging they conspired to suppress coal production in the United States and drive up the price of the commodity. According to the complaint, the three asset managers used their holdings in U.S. coal companies to pressure those companies to adopt environmental, social and governance targets. The complaint highlights these managers’ membership of organizations like Climate Action 100+ and the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, which both called for achieving net-zero investment portfolios. The complaint also alleges that the managers achieved “supra-competitive” profits by decreasing coal output and increasing prices. It also alleges the asset managers violated the Clayton Act, which prohibits the acquisition of minority stakes in companies to lessen competition. Never miss a story — sign up for CIO newsletters to stay up-to-date on the latest institutional investment industry news.  “The President has declared a national energy emergency, and we need competition in coal production now more than ever to help fuel American energy dominance,” said U.S. Assistant Attorney General Abigail A. Slater in a statement, referencing President Donald Trump’s Executive Order 14156, which declared a national energy emergency, and Executive Order 14261, which called for an increase in domestic energy production, including coal. “As the Supreme Court has held, ‘social justifications’ for anticompetitive conduct ‘do not make it any less unlawful,’” Slater continued in the statement. “We will not hesitate to stand up against powerful financial firms that use Americans’ retirement savings to harm competition under the guise of ESG.” BlackRock and State Street were signatories of Climate Action 100+ but later withdrew, while Vanguard was never a signatory. All three firms were, at one point, signatories of the Net Zero Asset Manager Initiative, which paused operations in January, following BlackRock’s exit from the organization. The three asset managers are the largest shareholders in all nine publicly listed U.S. coal companies, which comprise half of U.S. coal output, according to the statement of interest. The three managers are accused of engaging with the management of these companies to lower their carbon emissions by restricting coal production. In a statement, BlackRock denied the allegations: “The DOJ and FTC’s support for this baseless case undermines the Trump administration’s goal of American energy independence,” BlackRock stated. “As we made clear in our earlier motion to dismiss, this case is trying to re-write antitrust law and is based on an absurd theory that coal companies conspired with their shareholders to reduce coal production.” State Street called the lawsuit “baseless”: “State Street Global Advisors acts in the long-term financial interests of investors with a focus on enhancing shareholder value,” State Street stated. “As long-term capital providers, we have a mutual interest in the long-term success of our portfolio companies. This lawsuit is baseless, and we look forward to presenting the facts through the legal process. Additional filings do not change our assessment.” Vanguard responded that it acted lawfully: “Though we have concerns with many of the legal interpretations promoted by the agencies, Vanguard appreciates their explicit acknowledgement that the antitrust laws allow these three things: ‘passive fund investing,’ ‘shareholder advocacy for better corporate governance’ and ‘active investing that doesn’t harm competition,’ a Vanguard spokesperson said. “The facts show Vanguard has stayed well within this construct.” The Investment Company Institute, which represents regulated investment fund companies, stated Thursday that the federal intervention in the case could harm, rather than help, investment in coal companies. “Fund investments are invaluable in providing capital formation for American coal, oil, and gas companies,” the ICI stated. “Billions upon billions of dollars are invested by asset managers today on behalf of their clients to make the U.S. energy industry the best in the world both … like President Trump wants. The case the federal government is now weighing in on seeks to attack minority investors for decisions they believe are in the best interest of fund shareholders. The relief suggested by the plaintiffs would devastate funds, investors, and the energy industry itself. “ Related Stories: House Republicans Characterize ESG as an Anti-Trust Cartel Republican AGs File Suit Against Asset Managers Alleging Coal Repression Scheme Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative Pauses Activities Following BlackRock Exit Tags: BlackRock, Department of Justice, DoJ, State Street, Vanguard « The Market Is Not Melting Down—It’s Moving Forward

Title: Trump relishes uttering the outlandish. Here’s where some of his most showstopping comments stand

By WILL WEISSERT, Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) — It may start as a casual aside, a wee-hours social post or a much-hyped announcement. Whatever the delivery mechanism, President Donald Trump loves to toss out startling ideas aimed at dropping jaws, commandeering headlines and bolstering his political brand. Never in modern times has a president offered so many off-the-cuff statements with such a potential for wide, even global, impact. His sometimes implausible notions may become reality, or — through repetition — no longer sound so outlandish. At other times, Trump just moves on, either by fashioning a rhetorical off-ramp or finding a way to declare victory. Some ideas, though, just seem to fade away. Here’s a look at some of Trump’s showstopping utterances this term and where they stand. WHERE IT STANDS: Moving ahead. BACKSTORY: Trump has embraced the idea of getting a $400 million luxury plane as a gift from oil-rich Qatar for the U.S. to use as Air Force One until Boeing delivers long-delayed new planes to the government. The Pentagon said Wednesday it has accepted the jet for use as Air Force One, but retrofitting the plane to meet security requirements will be costly and take time. And ethics experts, Democrats, and even some conservatives have warned that accepting such a luxurious gift from a foreign government is unseemly and could violate constitutional provisions meant to avoid bribery. WHERE IT STANDS: In limbo. BACKSTORY: Trump posted on his social media site in early May that he wanted to reopen an “expanded and rebuilt” Alcatraz, the notorious former prison that has been closed for more than six decades — and he subsequently talked about it at the White House. The president hasn’t said much on the subject since, nor addressed how lengthy, difficult and costly such a reclamation project would be. William K. Marshall III, the director of the Bureau of Prisons, said he’s ordered an “assessment to determine our needs and the next steps,” even as California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, dismissed the idea as a “distraction.” Some administration officials have endorsed bringing back the lockup known as “The Rock,” which operated from 1934 to 1963. Border czar Tom Homan suggested it could be used to house migrants awaiting deportation. WHERE IT STANDS: Still talking. BACKSTORY: Trump first floated this idea of the “Great State of Canada” with a December post just after midnight. When new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney recently visited Trump at the White House, he made a point of saying that Canada “won’t be for sale, ever.” Trump responded, “never say never.” Carney said later that he told the president privately to quit talking about making Canada a state. He didn’t divulge Trump’s reaction, though, noting only that it was necessary to distinguish between “a wish and a reality.” Trump nonetheless insisted during the meeting that Canada joining the United States would be a “wonderful marriage.” WHERE IT STANDS: Still talking. BACKSTORY: Trump continues to insist that the U.S. could “get” Greenland, which is part of the kingdom of Denmark, despite Copenhagen saying that’s impossible. Vice President JD Vance visited Greenland in March for a quick stop at the U.S. military base there after island residents rejected a broader visit. During that trip, Vance scolded Denmark but acknowledged that Greenland would control its own sovereignty — while still suggesting that it may want to make a deal with the United States. WHERE IT STANDS: Political off-ramp found. BACKSTORY: Trump for months decried growing Chinese influence over the Panama Canal and even refused to rule out a U.S. invasion to retake control of the waterway. The situation appeared to simmer down when the White House hailed a nearly $23 billion deal announced in March that would sell two canal ports run by a company based in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong to investors led by the U.S. firm BlackRock. The deal has since hit regulatory snags, and has yet to be finalized. In the meantime, the U.S. signed an agreement giving its troops access to Panamanian facilities. WHERE IT STANDS: Faded away. BACKSTORY: Trump suggested in February that billionaire Elon Musk would be checking out Fort Knox in Kentucky to ensure that U.S. gold reserves were still there. Days later, the president said at a conservative conference outside Washington, “I’m going to go with Elon.” He then drew sustained applause by asking, “Would anybody like to join us?” Nothing has come of it since. WHERE IT STANDS: Losing steam. BACKSTORY: Trump has repeatedly floated the idea that the U.S. would “take over” war-torn Gaza and move out the Palestinians who live there. He even suggested that U.S. developers could turn the area into a “Riviera of the Middle East,” once the war between Israel and Hamas has concluded. The president at one point posted a fake video of himself and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sunbathing in Gaza and featuring a glitzy resort dubbed “TRUMP GAZA.” During his trip to the Mideast last week, Trump offered a different iteration of the idea, saying the U.S. could “get involved” in Gaza “and make it just a freedom zone.” The issue remains a nonstarter with Arab nations. WHERE IT STANDS: Still talking. BACKSTORY: Trump continues to suggest that an autopen was used to sign presidential pardons, legislation and other key documents during the tenure of former President Joe Biden. It’s an accusation designed to question his Democratic predecessor’s mental capacity and presidential authority. Trump’s repeated complaints about Biden’s autopen continue to get attention among some far-right media outlets and have prompted a Republican proposal in Congress to ban using autopens on presidential pardons. Trump has even suggested an investigation could be coming related to Biden signing immigration actions via autopen. “We’re going to start looking into this whole thing with who signed this legislation,” he said this week. WHERE IT STANDS: Faded away. BACKSTORY: Trump used his social media site in March to share a British media outlet’s suggestion that Britain’s King Charles III was making a “secret offer” to allow the United States to become an associate member of the British Commonwealth. “I love King Charles,” Trump wrote. “Sounds good to me!” Trump might have been joking, but his post sparked pushback online from supporters who roundly rejected the idea. He has not gone back to it. WHERE IT STANDS: Faded away. BACKSTORY: In February, Trump falsely labeled Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a “dictator without elections” in the midst of Russia’s ongoing invasion of that country. Before Zelenskyy, who was elected Ukraine’s president in 2019, prior to Russia’s attack on Ukraine, subsequently visited the White House, Trump backed off, saying, “Did I say that?” Trump still finds plenty to complain about with the Ukrainian leader, though, saying last week that U.S. aid to the country has been “pissed away.” WHERE IT STANDS: Still talking. BACKSTORY: In February, Trump said his administration would begin offering $5 million “ gold cards ” that give “very high-level people” a “route to citizenship.” The cards would grant foreigners visas to live and work in the United States. In early April, he held up a gold card featuring his name and picture and said they would be available in “less than two weeks, probably.” The card still hasn’t gone on sale, but Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick recently told the All-In podcast that he’d already personally sold 1,000 of them. WHERE IT STANDS: Still talking — off and on. BACKSTORY: The Constitution’s 22nd Amendment states no one can be elected president “more than twice.” That hasn’t stopped Trump from talking about it — or the Trump Organization from selling “Trump 2028” gear, despite the president himself offering mixed signals. Asked about running for a third term during a recent NBC News interview, Trump replied, “I’m not looking at that.” But he added: “So many people want me to do it. I have never had requests so strong as that. But it’s something that, to the best of my knowledge, you’re not allowed to do. I don’t know if that’s constitutional.” That followed his saying in an interview with NBC News in March: “I’m not joking. There are methods which you could do it.” And he suggested to Time Magazine, “There are some loopholes.” Will Weissert covers the White House for The Associated Press.

Title: Trump threatens 25% tax on Apple unless iPhones are made in U.S.

By JOSH BOAK, The Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Friday threatened a 50% tax on all imports from the European Union as well a 25% tariff on Apple products unless iPhones are made in America. The threats, delivered over social media, reflect Trump’s ability to disrupt the global economy with a burst of typing, as well as the reality that his tariffs have yet to produce the trade deals he is seeking or the return of domestic manufacturing he has promised voters. The Republican president said he wants to charge higher import taxes on goods from the EU, a long-standing U.S. ally, than from China, a geopolitical rival that had its tariffs cut to 30% this month so Washington and Beijing could hold negotiations. Trump was upset by the lack of progress in trade talks with the EU, which has proposed mutually cutting tariffs to zero even as the president has publicly insisted on preserving a baseline 10% tax on most imports. “Our discussions with them are going nowhere!” Trump posted on Truth Social. “Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025. There is no Tariff if the product is built or manufactured in the United States.” That post had been preceded by a threat of import taxes against Apple for its plans to continue making its iPhone in Asia. Apple joins Amazon, Walmart and other major U.S. companies in the White House’s crosshairs as they try to respond to the uncertainty and inflationary pressures unleashed by his tariffs. “I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone’s that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,” Trump wrote. “If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.” The statement by Trump is critical in that he suggests the company itself would bear the price of tariffs, contradicting his earlier claims as he rolled out a series of aggressive tariffs over the past several months that foreign countries would shoulder the cost of the import taxes. In general, importers pay the tariffs and the costs are often passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices. In response to Trump’s tariffs on China, Apple CEO Tim Cook said earlier this month that most iPhones sold in the U.S. during the current fiscal quarter would come from India, with iPads and other devices being imported from Vietnam. After Trump rolled out tariffs in April, bank analysts estimated that a $1,200 iPhone would if made in America jump in price anywhere from $1,500 to $3,500. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tried to provide some clarity on Trump’s postings in a Friday interview on the Fox News show “America’s Newsroom.” Bessent said the EU has a “collective action problem” because its 27 member states are being represented by “this one group in Brussels,” such that the “underlying countries don’t even know what the EU is negotiating on their behalf.” The Treasury secretary said he was not in a White House meeting this week that Cook attended, but he also spoke with the Apple CEO this week. Bessent said the goal was to have Apple bring more of its computer chip supply chain into the U.S. The core of Trump’s argument against the EU is that America runs a “totally unacceptable” trade deficit with the 27 member states. Countries run trade deficits when they import more goods than they export. From the vantage point of the EU’s executive commission, trade with the U.S. is roughly in balance if both goods and services are included. As a global center for finance and technology, the U.S. runs a trade surplus in services with Europe. That offsets some of the trade gap in goods and puts the imbalance at 48 billion euros ($54 billion). German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said the EU’s executive commission has his country’s full support in working to “preserve our access to the American market.” “I think such tariffs help no one, but would just lead to economic development in both markets suffering,” Wadephul said in Berlin. “So we are still counting on negotiations, and support the European Commission in defending Europe and the European market while at the same time working on persuasion in America.” Trump aides have said the goal of his tariffs was to isolate China and strike new agreements with allies, but the president’s tariff threats undermine the logic of those claims. Not only could the EU face higher tariffs than China, but the bloc of member states might have been better off by establishing a broad front with China and other countries against Trump’s trade policy, said German economist Marcel Fratscher. “The strategy of the EU Commission and Germany in the trade conflict with Trump is a total failure,” Fratscher, the head of the German Institute for Economic Research, said on X. “This was a failure you could see coming — Trump sees Europe’s wavering, hesitation and concessions as the weaknesses that they are.” Trump has run hot and cold on his relationship with Apple, a sign that currying favor with him might not necessarily shield a company from his anger. He has essentially told companies such as Walmart to “eat” the costs of his tariffs instead of raising prices, even though doing so could squeeze profits and cause layoffs. He now appears to deploying a similar degree of pressure to force Apple to accept the higher costs of relocating its supply chains. Trump had previously created an exemption on electronics imported from China to help companies such as Apple, something he could now remove. He also threatened separate 25% import taxes on computer chips and could have the tariffs schedule rewritten in ways that could expose Apple products to the taxes. Until recently, the U.S. president repeatedly bragged about the $500 billion that Apple in February pledged to invest domestically as part of its development of artificial intelligence technologies. But he publicly turned against the company last week while speaking in Qatar. If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

Title: The Digital Asset Primer: Why Equity Markets Are Being Tokenized
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/blockchain/2025/digital-asset-primer-why-equity-markets-are-being-tokenized/
Time Published: 2025-05-23T15:24:38Z

Highlights Kraken is introducing xStocks, tokenized versions of over 50 equities on the Solana blockchain, aimed at underserved markets in Europe, Latin America, Africa and Asia. Tokenized equities are gaining traction as financial institutions explore blockchain for real-world assets, signaling a shift toward using public blockchains for regulated financial instruments. While tokenized equities offer greater accessibility and efficiency, they face regulatory uncertainty and concerns over market integrity without traditional financial oversight. It’s been over 15 years since the first bitcoin was minted. Now, cryptocurrency is making good on some of its promises to reshape centuries-old financial paradigms. The sector’s latest target? Equity markets. Crypto exchange Kraken is planning to offer tokenized versions of more than 50 stocks, including names like Apple, Tesla and Nvidia, along with exchange-traded funds (ETFs), showing that blockchain is increasingly maturing beyond its earlier history as a fringe innovation. Branded as xStocks, Kraken’s tokenized equities are digital representations of actual shares, made tradable on the Solana blockchain. The xStocks will only be available to customers in Europe, Latin America, Africa and Asia. This isn’t the first attempt at bridging crypto with traditional equities. Binance, for instance, flirted with tokenized stocks in 2021 before regulatory scrutiny forced a retreat. However, Kraken’s approach is more calculated and compliance-conscious, built on partnerships and a clear value proposition. The exchange aims to prove that blockchain technology can provide a key substrate upon which next-generation financial services can be built. Each xStock is backed 1-to-1 by actual shares, held through Kraken’s Swiss partner, Backed Finance. Investors can redeem the tokens for the cash equivalent of the underlying assets, reinforcing price parity and transparency, two pillars often absent in early blockchain experiments. See also: The CFO and Treasurer’s Guide to Digital Assets Kraken’s xStocks aren’t targeting American day traders or Wall Street veterans. Instead, they’re aimed at retail investors in emerging and underserved markets, an often-overlooked demographic. In countries with capital controls or limited brokerage services, investing in U.S. stocks typically involves high fees, delayed settlement times and bureaucratic entanglements. Kraken hopes to eliminate these traditional barriers by using the decentralized nature of blockchain to provide instant, 24/7 trading access — no matter the time zone or local economic constraints. The core innovation of tokenized equities lies in the use of blockchain infrastructure to issue and manage these assets. By using smart contracts and decentralized ledgers, tokenized equities offer advantages such as fractional ownership, 24/7 trading and greater global accessibility. For investors in countries with limited access to U.S. financial markets, tokenized stocks may present a compelling alternative. Kraken isn’t alone in its interest in tokenizing equities and other real-world assets onto the blockchain. “Banks are in the state where they are thinking about blockchains as public infrastructure that they need to rely on,” Chainalysis co-founder and CEO Jonathan Levin told PYMNTS. “Back in 2014 … cryptocurrency only meant blockchains that had native cryptocurrency tokens in April. “Today, people are putting all types of financial instruments on the blockchain,” he added. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said all assets should be tokenized on a blockchain and tradable online, writing in his 2025 annual shareholder letter: “Every stock, every bond, every fund — every asset — can be tokenized.” In March, BlackRock launched its first tokenized fund on the Ethereum blockchain, backed by short-term U.S. Treasurys. Meanwhile, R3 and Solana Foundation announced Thursday (May 22) that they have partnered to bring regulated real-world assets onto a public blockchain, while Visa, Mastercard, J.P. Morgan and other financial players are exploring or piloting real-world tokenized payment and financial systems. Read also: Crypto Firms Grapple With Bank-Like Risks, Without the Regulation However, the rise of tokenized equities is not without challenges. Chief among them are regulatory uncertainty and the risk inherent to crypto players moving into mainstream financial services without the same level of oversight as traditional financial institutions. Custody solutions also play a critical role. For tokenized equities to be credible, there must be transparent and secure custody of the underlying assets. Some platforms partner with licensed custodians to hold actual shares, while others use synthetic representations, raising questions about counterparty risk and asset backing. From a technological standpoint, tokenized equities rely on a mix of public and permissioned blockchains. Ethereum remains a popular choice due to its robust smart contract capabilities and liquidity in decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems. However, scalability and gas fees have driven some platforms to alternative chains like Solana, Avalanche and Polygon. The growing adoption of tokenized equities also represents a potential disruption to traditional financial intermediaries. Brokers, clearinghouses and exchanges may find themselves disintermediated as blockchain-based systems streamline settlement and custody functions. Settlement times can shrink from T+2 to near-instantaneous, reducing counterparty risk and operational costs. This disintermediation, however, also raises concerns about market integrity and systemic risk. Without centralized oversight, questions about manipulation, insider trading and investor recourse become more pressing. Traditional finance’s emphasis on compliance and risk management remains a counterbalance.

Title: The Gen Z Right Is Pat Buchanan’s Lasting Legacy

Posted on 05/23/2025 8:00:19 AM PDT by Angelino97 On December 2, 2023, in the modest gymnasium of a community college in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, President Donald Trump addressed a raucous crowd of supporters. As he spoke about the enduring force of the movement he ignited in 2015, he paused to reflect on a man many had forgotten—but whose ideas are increasingly animating the rising generation of conservatives. “You know there was a man, Pat Buchanan, a good guy, a conservative guy,” Trump began. A sudden, collective cheer erupted from the left side of the stage—unmistakably youthful, unexpected in tone. “Wow! Young people, they know him,” Trump responded with a mix of surprise and amusement. The cheering came from a group of College Republicans—mostly young Midwestern men. They represented more than just campus enthusiasm. They were the surface current of a deeper, surging tide within the American right: a generation of young conservatives who have not merely rejected progressive orthodoxy, but who have turned their backs on the neutered, market-centric consensus that long dominated Republican politics. Their affinities lie not with Reaganite optimism or Bush-era globalism, but with the sobering, culture-first realism of Pat Buchanan. These are the heirs to the original Buchanan Brigade, animated by a blend of cultural traditionalism, economic nationalism, and a deep-seated skepticism toward America’s post–Cold War trajectory. They’re not interested in conserving the status quo. They want to recover something lost. Three developments define the social fabric of 21st-century America: the triumph of multiculturalism, the commodification of the consumer, and the cultural conquest of the Left. For decades, neither major party offered a meaningful response. Democrats embraced the transformation; Republicans timidly adjusted to it. In the 1990s, Buchanan was virtually alone in warning that the West was in decline—culturally, spiritually, and economically. The relative prosperity and comfort of the ’90s muffled his prophecy, and few listened. Then came the Great Recession. For millions of Americans, it was more than an economic downturn—it was the unveiling of a deeper, festering crisis. Young people, in particular, felt it viscerally. The America they inherited no longer resembled the country celebrated in their parents’ stories or history books. The economy seemed rigged, the culture foreign, and the future grim. By the time Donald Trump descended the escalator in 2015, a vanguard of young men had already begun rejecting the stale dogmas of Conservatism, Inc. They were the ideological foot soldiers of Trump’s first campaign—angry, disillusioned, and increasingly well-read. What started as a populist rebellion quickly matured into something more coherent. Tax cuts and platitudes about the Constitution no longer sufficed. Legal immigration was no longer seen as harmless. Endless foreign aid and wars of choice were now understood as betrayals—not of international obligations, but of national ones. The refrain “Democrats are the real racists” gave way to “Stop playing by the Left’s rules.” Conservatism, these young rebels concluded, should not exist to preserve the wreckage of liberalism—it should stand to restore greatness. It is no surprise, then, that Buchanan’s The Death of the West has become a sacred text among this emerging young right. In an era when most of their peers don’t read, these young conservatives have made it required reading. It has even shaped elected officials. The third-youngest vice president in U.S. history—himself a product of the Midwestern populist realignment—publicly cited Buchanan’s work as formative in 2021 during an interview with David Freiheit. This revival of Buchananite thought has unnerved many in the conservative establishment. The backlash has come not just from the left, but from within the right—from those who seek to redefine conservatism as a more polite version of liberalism. Joel Berry of The Babylon Bee, for example, dismissed the “Pat Buchanan Right” as radicals, himself seemingly more comfortable cracking Reagan-inflected jokes than grappling with the real challenges faced by today’s young workers, parents, and future homeowners. But the old consensus is crumbling. The new generation doesn’t want talking points; they want answers. They see through the empty gestures of conservative influencers who quote the Founders one minute and promote materialism the next. The polite right has had its time—and failed. While Trump may be the most visible beneficiary of Buchanan’s intellectual legacy, the future belongs to those young men and women now entering the institutions of politics, media, and civic life. Their influence will not be limited to elections, but to the cultural soil out of which political movements grow. Buchanan was once a lone voice, a dissident within his own party. Today, his ideas no longer echo in isolation. They resound in lecture halls, in podcasts, in online reading groups, and in quiet conversations among friends questioning what went wrong with the American dream. It is likely that Buchanan will not live to see the full fruit of this realignment. But it is his vision—of a nation rooted in faith, heritage, and cultural continuity—that may yet shape the American right for decades to come. This is his final, and perhaps most enduring, gift to the country he tried so long to save.

He didn't start out that way... The school of hard knocks and firsthand experiences changed his point of view.

This is an example of what happens when people and groups try to shut down a strong personality using every dirty trick in the book after the person made relevant observations and conclusions that were found to be distasteful to the accepted consensus. Buchanan had many Jewish friends, associates and staff. He was never accused of discriminating against individuals, but he was not afraid to speak the truth about history or current events regardless of whether it was politically correct or not. Rabbi Yahuda Levin of New York, served as one of Buchanan's four campaign co-chairmen during his presidential campaign and took a lot of heat for this. He said, “I don't have to be married to him or believe everything he says” and then went on to defend Buchanan as a person and his policies. One of my closest friends from childhood is Jewish and he can rail on and on about issues that we disagree on and I still love him. I was once talking to a guy who was sitting next to me on an airline flight. I told him that my friend was always very sensitive to any form of Jewish stereotype but that the older he got the more he resembled them. This was meant to be a humorous observation. But the person I was speaking to turned out to be a Jewish lawyer and he took great offense to this innocuous observation. He condemned me and said that I was a bad person. This foot in the mouth moment was actually quite humorous to me and this guy worked himself into a tizzy over basically nothing. Jewish people love to argue which is a trait in my own heritage, but in this case the other person despite his great intelligence seemingly had no ability for any form of introspection. 16 posted on 05/23/2025 9:03:42 AM PDT by fireman15 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies] To: dragnet2 Tony Brown’s Journal on PBS was the ‘intellectual black’.

Young people, they know him,” Trump responded with a mix of surprise and amusement. The cheering came from a group of College Republicans—mostly young Midwestern men. They represented more than just campus enthusiasm. They were the surface current of a deeper, surging tide within the American right: a generation of young conservatives who have not merely rejected progressive orthodoxy, but who have turned their backs on the neutered, market-centric consensus that long dominated Republican politics. Their affinities lie not with Reaganite optimism or Bush-era globalism, but with the sobering, culture-first realism of Pat Buchanan. These are the heirs to the original Buchanan Brigade, animated by a blend of cultural traditionalism, economic nationalism, and a deep-seated skepticism toward America’s post–Cold War trajectory. They’re not interested in conserving the status quo. They want to recover something lost. Three developments define the social fabric of 21st-century America: the triumph of multiculturalism, the commodification of the consumer, and the cultural conquest of the Left. For decades, neither major party offered a meaningful response. Democrats embraced the transformation; Republicans timidly adjusted to it. In the 1990s, Buchanan was virtually alone in warning that the West was in decline—culturally, spiritually, and economically. The relative prosperity and comfort of the ’90s muffled his prophecy, and few listened. Then came the Great Recession. For millions of Americans, it was more than an economic downturn—it was the unveiling of a deeper, festering crisis. Young people, in particular, felt it viscerally. The America they inherited no longer resembled the country celebrated in their parents’ stories or history books. The economy seemed rigged, the culture foreign, and the future grim. By the time Donald Trump descended the escalator in 2015, a vanguard of young men had already begun rejecting the stale dogmas of Conservatism, Inc. They were the ideological foot soldiers of Trump’s first campaign—angry, disillusioned, and increasingly well-read. What started as a populist rebellion quickly matured into something more coherent. Tax cuts and platitudes about the Constitution no longer sufficed. Legal immigration was no longer seen as harmless. Endless foreign aid and wars of choice were now understood as betrayals—not of international obligations, but of national ones. The refrain “Democrats are the real racists” gave way to “Stop playing by the Left’s rules.” Conservatism, these young rebels concluded, should not exist to preserve the wreckage of liberalism—it should stand to restore greatness. It is no surprise, then, that Buchanan’s The Death of the West has become a sacred text among this emerging young right. In an era when most of their peers don’t read, these young conservatives have made it required reading. It has even shaped elected officials. The third-youngest vice president in U.S. history—himself a product of the Midwestern populist realignment—publicly cited Buchanan’s work as formative in 2021 during an interview with David Freiheit. This revival of Buchananite thought has unnerved many in the conservative establishment. The backlash has come not just from the left, but from within the right—from those who seek to redefine conservatism as a more polite version of liberalism. Joel Berry of The Babylon Bee, for example, dismissed the “Pat Buchanan Right” as radicals, himself seemingly more comfortable cracking Reagan-inflected jokes than grappling with the real challenges faced by today’s young workers, parents, and future homeowners. But the old consensus is crumbling. The new generation doesn’t want talking points; they want answers. They see through the empty gestures of conservative influencers who quote the Founders one minute and promote materialism the next. The polite right has had its time—and failed. While Trump may be the most visible beneficiary of Buchanan’s intellectual legacy, the future belongs to those young men and women now entering the institutions of politics, media, and civic life. Their influence will not be limited to elections, but to the cultural soil out of which political movements grow. Buchanan was once a lone voice, a dissident within his own party. Today, his ideas no longer echo in isolation. They resound in lecture halls, in podcasts, in online reading groups, and in quiet conversations among friends questioning what went wrong with the American dream. It is likely that Buchanan will not live to see the full fruit of this realignment. But it is his vision—of a nation rooted in faith, heritage, and cultural continuity—that may yet shape the American right for decades to come. This is his final, and perhaps most enduring, gift to the country he tried so long to save.

He didn't start out that way... The school of hard knocks and firsthand experiences changed his point of view. And when the ADF and associated groups and individuals tried to “cancel” him before that was a widespread phenomenon... he gave back as good as he got. This is an example of what happens when people and groups try to shut down a strong personality using every dirty trick in the book after the person made relevant observations and conclusions that were found to be distasteful to the accepted consensus. Buchanan had many Jewish friends, associates and staff. He was never accused of discriminating against individuals, but he was not afraid to speak the truth about history or current events regardless of whether it was politically correct or not. Rabbi Yahuda Levin of New York, served as one of Buchanan's four campaign co-chairmen during his presidential campaign and took a lot of heat for this. He said, “I don't have to be married to him or believe everything he says” and then went on to defend Buchanan as a person and his policies. One of my closest friends from childhood is Jewish and he can rail on and on about issues that we disagree on and I still love him. I was once talking to a guy who was sitting next to me on an airline flight. I told him that my friend was always very sensitive to any form of Jewish stereotype but that the older he got the more he resembled them. This was meant to be a humorous observation. But the person I was speaking to turned out to be a Jewish lawyer and he took great offense to this innocuous observation. He condemned me and said that I was a bad person. This foot in the mouth moment was actually quite humorous to me and this guy worked himself into a tizzy over basically nothing. Jewish people love to argue which is a trait in my own heritage, but in this case the other person despite his great intelligence seemingly had no ability for any form of introspection. 16 posted on 05/23/2025 9:03:42 AM PDT by fireman15 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies] To: dragnet2 Tony Brown’s Journal on PBS was the ‘intellectual black’.

The third-youngest vice president in U.S. history—himself a product of the Midwestern populist realignment—publicly cited Buchanan’s work as formative in 2021 during an interview with David Freiheit. This revival of Buchananite thought has unnerved many in the conservative establishment. The backlash has come not just from the left, but from within the right—from those who seek to redefine conservatism as a more polite version of liberalism. Joel Berry of The Babylon Bee, for example, dismissed the “Pat Buchanan Right” as radicals, himself seemingly more comfortable cracking Reagan-inflected jokes than grappling with the real challenges faced by today’s young workers, parents, and future homeowners. But the old consensus is crumbling. The new generation doesn’t want talking points; they want answers. They see through the empty gestures of conservative influencers who quote the Founders one minute and promote materialism the next. The polite right has had its time—and failed. While Trump may be the most visible beneficiary of Buchanan’s intellectual legacy, the future belongs to those young men and women now entering the institutions of politics, media, and civic life. Their influence will not be limited to elections, but to the cultural soil out of which political movements grow. Buchanan was once a lone voice, a dissident within his own party. Today, his ideas no longer echo in isolation. They resound in lecture halls, in podcasts, in online reading groups, and in quiet conversations among friends questioning what went wrong with the American dream. It is likely that Buchanan will not live to see the full fruit of this realignment. But it is his vision—of a nation rooted in faith, heritage, and cultural continuity—that may yet shape the American right for decades to come. This is his final, and perhaps most enduring, gift to the country he tried so long to save.

He didn't start out that way... The school of hard knocks and firsthand experiences changed his point of view. And when the ADF and associated groups and individuals tried to “cancel” him before that was a widespread phenomenon... he gave back as good as he got. This is an example of what happens when people and groups try to shut down a strong personality using every dirty trick in the book after the person made relevant observations and conclusions that were found to be distasteful to the accepted consensus. Buchanan had many Jewish friends, associates and staff. He was never accused of discriminating against individuals, but he was not afraid to speak the truth about history or current events regardless of whether it was politically correct or not. Rabbi Yahuda Levin of New York, served as one of Buchanan's four campaign co-chairmen during his presidential campaign and took a lot of heat for this. He said, “I don't have to be married to him or believe everything he says” and then went on to defend Buchanan as a person and his policies. One of my closest friends from childhood is Jewish and he can rail on and on about issues that we disagree on and I still love him. I was once talking to a guy who was sitting next to me on an airline flight. I told him that my friend was always very sensitive to any form of Jewish stereotype but that the older he got the more he resembled them. This was meant to be a humorous observation. But the person I was speaking to turned out to be a Jewish lawyer and he took great offense to this innocuous observation. He condemned me and said that I was a bad person. This foot in the mouth moment was actually quite humorous to me and this guy worked himself into a tizzy over basically nothing. Jewish people love to argue which is a trait in my own heritage, but in this case the other person despite his great intelligence seemingly had no ability for any form of introspection. 16 posted on 05/23/2025 9:03:42 AM PDT by fireman15 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies] To: dragnet2 Tony Brown’s Journal on PBS was the ‘intellectual black’.

For decades, neither major party offered a meaningful response. Democrats embraced the transformation; Republicans timidly adjusted to it. In the 1990s, Buchanan was virtually alone in warning that the West was in decline—culturally, spiritually, and economically. The relative prosperity and comfort of the ’90s muffled his prophecy, and few listened. Then came the Great Recession. For millions of Americans, it was more than an economic downturn—it was the unveiling of a deeper, festering crisis. Young people, in particular, felt it viscerally. The America they inherited no longer resembled the country celebrated in their parents’ stories or history books. The economy seemed rigged, the culture foreign, and the future grim. By the time Donald Trump descended the escalator in 2015, a vanguard of young men had already begun rejecting the stale dogmas of Conservatism, Inc. They were the ideological foot soldiers of Trump’s first campaign—angry, disillusioned, and increasingly well-read. What started as a populist rebellion quickly matured into something more coherent. Tax cuts and platitudes about the Constitution no longer sufficed. Legal immigration was no longer seen as harmless. Endless foreign aid and wars of choice were now understood as betrayals—not of international obligations, but of national ones. The refrain “Democrats are the real racists” gave way to “Stop playing by the Left’s rules.” Conservatism, these young rebels concluded, should not exist to preserve the wreckage of liberalism—it should stand to restore greatness. It is no surprise, then, that Buchanan’s The Death of the West has become a sacred text among this emerging young right. In an era when most of their peers don’t read, these young conservatives have made it required reading. It has even shaped elected officials. The third-youngest vice president in U.S. history—himself a product of the Midwestern populist realignment—publicly cited Buchanan’s work as formative in 2021 during an interview with David Freiheit.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson By the time Donald Trump descended the escalator in 2015, a vanguard of young men had already begun rejecting the stale dogmas of Conservatism, Inc. They were the ideological foot soldiers of Trump’s first campaign—angry, disillusioned, and increasingly well-read. What started as a populist rebellion quickly matured into something more coherent. Tax cuts and platitudes about the Constitution no longer sufficed. Legal immigration was no longer seen as harmless. Endless foreign aid and wars of choice were now understood as betrayals—not of international obligations, but of national ones. The refrain “Democrats are the real racists” gave way to “Stop playing by the Left’s rules.” Conservatism, these young rebels concluded, should not exist to preserve the wreckage of liberalism—it should stand to restore greatness. It is no surprise, then, that Buchanan’s The Death of the West has become a sacred text among this emerging young right. In an era when most of their peers don’t read, these young conservatives have made it required reading. It has even shaped elected officials. The third-youngest vice president in U.S. history—himself a product of the Midwestern populist realignment—publicly cited Buchanan’s work as formative in 2021 during an interview with David Freiheit. This revival of Buchananite thought has unnerved many in the conservative establishment. The backlash has come not just from the left, but from within the right—from those who seek to redefine conservatism as a more polite version of liberalism. Joel Berry of The Babylon Bee, for example, dismissed the “Pat Buchanan Right” as radicals, himself seemingly more comfortable cracking Reagan-inflected jokes than grappling with the real challenges faced by today’s young workers, parents, and future homeowners. But the old consensus is crumbling. The new generation doesn’t want talking points; they want answers. They see through the empty gestures of conservative influencers who quote the Founders one minute and promote materialism the next. The polite right has had its time—and failed. While Trump may be the most visible beneficiary of Buchanan’s intellectual legacy, the future belongs to those young men and women now entering the institutions of politics, media, and civic life. Their influence will not be limited to elections, but to the cultural soil out of which political movements grow. Buchanan was once a lone voice, a dissident within his own party. Today, his ideas no longer echo in isolation. They resound in lecture halls, in podcasts, in online reading groups, and in quiet conversations among friends questioning what went wrong with the American dream. It is likely that Buchanan will not live to see the full fruit of this realignment. But it is his vision—of a nation rooted in faith, heritage, and cultural continuity—that may yet shape the American right for decades to come. This is his final, and perhaps most enduring, gift to the country he tried so long to save.

In an era when most of their peers don’t read, these young conservatives have made it required reading. It has even shaped elected officials. The third-youngest vice president in U.S. history—himself a product of the Midwestern populist realignment—publicly cited Buchanan’s work as formative in 2021 during an interview with David Freiheit. This revival of Buchananite thought has unnerved many in the conservative establishment. The backlash has come not just from the left, but from within the right—from those who seek to redefine conservatism as a more polite version of liberalism. Joel Berry of The Babylon Bee, for example, dismissed the “Pat Buchanan Right” as radicals, himself seemingly more comfortable cracking Reagan-inflected jokes than grappling with the real challenges faced by today’s young workers, parents, and future homeowners. But the old consensus is crumbling. The new generation doesn’t want talking points; they want answers. They see through the empty gestures of conservative influencers who quote the Founders one minute and promote materialism the next. The polite right has had its time—and failed. While Trump may be the most visible beneficiary of Buchanan’s intellectual legacy, the future belongs to those young men and women now entering the institutions of politics, media, and civic life. Their influence will not be limited to elections, but to the cultural soil out of which political movements grow. Buchanan was once a lone voice, a dissident within his own party. Today, his ideas no longer echo in isolation. They resound in lecture halls, in podcasts, in online reading groups, and in quiet conversations among friends questioning what went wrong with the American dream. It is likely that Buchanan will not live to see the full fruit of this realignment. But it is his vision—of a nation rooted in faith, heritage, and cultural continuity—that may yet shape the American right for decades to come. This is his final, and perhaps most enduring, gift to the country he tried so long to save.

He didn't start out that way... The school of hard knocks and firsthand experiences changed his point of view. And when the ADF and associated groups and individuals tried to “cancel” him before that was a widespread phenomenon... he gave back as good as he got. This is an example of what happens when people and groups try to shut down a strong personality using every dirty trick in the book after the person made relevant observations and conclusions that were found to be distasteful to the accepted consensus. Buchanan had many Jewish friends, associates and staff. He was never accused of discriminating against individuals, but he was not afraid to speak the truth about history or current events regardless of whether it was politically correct or not. Rabbi Yahuda Levin of New York, served as one of Buchanan's four campaign co-chairmen during his presidential campaign and took a lot of heat for this. He said, “I don't have to be married to him or believe everything he says” and then went on to defend Buchanan as a person and his policies. One of my closest friends from childhood is Jewish and he can rail on and on about issues that we disagree on and I still love him. I was once talking to a guy who was sitting next to me on an airline flight. I told him that my friend was always very sensitive to any form of Jewish stereotype but that the older he got the more he resembled them. This was meant to be a humorous observation. But the person I was speaking to turned out to be a Jewish lawyer and he took great offense to this innocuous observation. He condemned me and said that I was a bad person. This foot in the mouth moment was actually quite humorous to me and this guy worked himself into a tizzy over basically nothing. Jewish people love to argue which is a trait in my own heritage, but in this case the other person despite his great intelligence seemingly had no ability for any form of introspection. 16 posted on 05/23/2025 9:03:42 AM PDT by fireman15 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies] To: dragnet2 Tony Brown’s Journal on PBS was the ‘intellectual black’.

Goldwater’s funeral was noteworthy for the respect he received.

One of my closest friends from childhood is Jewish and he can rail on and on about issues that we disagree on and I still love him. I was once talking to a guy who was sitting next to me on an airline flight. I told him that my friend was always very sensitive to any form of Jewish stereotype but that the older he got the more he resembled them. This was meant to be a humorous observation. But the person I was speaking to turned out to be a Jewish lawyer and he took great offense to this innocuous observation. He condemned me and said that I was a bad person. This foot in the mouth moment was actually quite humorous to me and this guy worked himself into a tizzy over basically nothing. Jewish people love to argue which is a trait in my own heritage, but in this case the other person despite his great intelligence seemingly had no ability for any form of introspection. 16 posted on 05/23/2025 9:03:42 AM PDT by fireman15 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies] To: dragnet2 Tony Brown’s Journal on PBS was the ‘intellectual black’.

Their influence will not be limited to elections, but to the cultural soil out of which political movements grow. Buchanan was once a lone voice, a dissident within his own party. Today, his ideas no longer echo in isolation. They resound in lecture halls, in podcasts, in online reading groups, and in quiet conversations among friends questioning what went wrong with the American dream. It is likely that Buchanan will not live to see the full fruit of this realignment. But it is his vision—of a nation rooted in faith, heritage, and cultural continuity—that may yet shape the American right for decades to come. This is his final, and perhaps most enduring, gift to the country he tried so long to save.

One of my closest friends from childhood is Jewish and he can rail on and on about issues that we disagree on and I still love him. I was once talking to a guy who was sitting next to me on an airline flight. I told him that my friend was always very sensitive to any form of Jewish stereotype but that the older he got the more he resembled them. This was meant to be a humorous observation. But the person I was speaking to turned out to be a Jewish lawyer and he took great offense to this innocuous observation. He condemned me and said that I was a bad person. This foot in the mouth moment was actually quite humorous to me and this guy worked himself into a tizzy over basically nothing. Jewish people love to argue which is a trait in my own heritage, but in this case the other person despite his great intelligence seemingly had no ability for any form of introspection.

Tony Brown’s Journal on PBS was the ‘intellectual black’. He called him a racist. That was too much for me. Then ‘good guy’ Bernie said the same thing about Trump-not so good. These people try to nip these up-comers with that language and sometimes it works. It was used against Goldwater in ‘64 and it took 16 years to get over it with the election of Reagan. Goldwater’s funeral was noteworthy for the respect he received. Buchanan’s will be the same-that is if the MSM will cover it. You do realize that he is still around and his writings and point of view are the basis for much of the America first agenda? I do hope that President Trump is able to give him the recognition that he deserves.https://theimaginativeconservative.org/2025/03/pat-buchanan-america-first-foreign-policy-francis-p-sempa.html https://theimaginativeconservative.org/2025/03/pat-buchanan-america-first-foreign-policy-francis-p-sempa.html and yet he never became president. Trump is President and he has already achieved more than any President this century and beyond.

Tesla (TSLA) might have been in the news recently for all the wrong reasons, but that’s not stopping Wedbush from issuing one of Wall Street’s most bullish calls on the company in months. In a note Friday morning, analyst Dan Ives raised Tesla’s price target from $350 to $500, saying “the golden age of autonomous is now on the doorstep for Tesla.” The price hike is part of Ives’ larger vision for the company: a possible $2 trillion market cap by the end of 2026 in a “bull case scenario.” The potential catalyst? The long-promised launch of Tesla’s robotaxi service, which CEO Elon Musk claims will debut in Austin by the end of June — a “key next chapter of growth,” according to Ives. Wedbush’s price hike reflects this “massive stage of valuation creation ahead.” But Wedbush’s vision of Tesla is less about cars and more about code. “We have never viewed Tesla simply as a car company,” Ives wrote. “Instead we have always viewed Musk and Tesla as a leading disruptive technology global player and the first part of this grand strategic vision has taken shape over the past 5 years.” Ives sees Tesla as a platform positioned to capitalize on the convergence of autonomous driving and AI — an “AI revolution” that could eventually put Tesla in the same league as Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Palantir (PLTR), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), OpenAI, and Alphabet (GOOGL). “We believe Tesla remains the most undervalued AI play in the market today,” Ives said. “The core focus for investors is the AI Revolution is now coming to Tesla...which will make Tesla one of the best pure plays on AI over the next decade.” Ives said AI and autonomous are worth at least $1 trillion for Tesla. And the “golden goose”? The EV-maker’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) software, which has recently been more broadly rolled out. Wedbush said the automaker could see FSD adoption rates rise past 50% “and change the financial model/margins for Tesla looking ahead.” Still, the road to autonomy is littered with setbacks. Tesla’s FSD system has faced regulatory scrutiny and safety concerns for years, although Ives speculated that the close ties between Musk and President Donald Trump could help pave the way for fewer regulatory hurdles. And Musk’s timelines for autonomous Teslas have come and gone without delivery; FSD remains driver-assist tech, requiring a human at the wheel. Tesla also isn’t alone in the robotaxi push — Alphabet’s Waymo and Uber (UBER) are still major contenders in the U.S., and China’s Baidu (BIDU) is pushing forward on robotaxis abroad. Still, Ives believes Tesla has a leg up on the competition. “Given its unmatched scale and scope globally,” he wrote, “we believe Tesla has the opportunity to own the autonomous market and down the road license its technology to other auto players both in the US and around the globe.” Wedbush maintains its “Outperform” rating on Tesla, even as Ives warned that the stock’s trajectory will be volatile. “Rome was not built in a day,” he wrote, “and neither will Tesla’s autonomous and robotics strategic vision.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, May 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV) and reminds investors of the July 11, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the risk and cost profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid programs. While Defendants acknowledged that Medicaid expenses were rising, they repeatedly assured investors that this was adequately reflected in the Company’s guidance for the year. The truth began to emerge on July 17, 2024, when the Company revealed that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.” In response to this disclosure, the price of Elevance common stock declined by $32.21 per share, or 5.8%. However, Defendants continued to make false, reassuring statements to investors concerning the extent of the cost increase and how that was accounted for in the Company’s full year guidance. The truth was further revealed on October 17, 2024, when Elevance announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2024, revealing that the Company had missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations for the quarter by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Elevance further revealed that it was lowering EPS guidance for 2024 from $37.20 to $33.00, or 11.3%, as it expected these Medicaid issues to continue. T These disclosures caused the price of Elevance common stock to decline by another $52.61 per share, or 10.6%. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Elevance’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

The truth was further revealed on October 17, 2024, when Elevance announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2024, revealing that the Company had missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations for the quarter by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Elevance further revealed that it was lowering EPS guidance for 2024 from $37.20 to $33.00, or 11.3%, as it expected these Medicaid issues to continue. These disclosures caused the price of Elevance common stock to decline by another $52.61 per share, or 10.6%. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.

Learn more › I’ll tell you a secret: If you’re a gamer searching for the best sound quality for your games, you shouldn’t be looking at a gaming headset. Audio enthusiasts know that the best sound quality—for movies, games, and everything in between—comes from great headphones and in-ear monitors (IEMs). But when it comes to getting the the best isolation, audio, and comfort in a compact form factor, IEMs are the only way to go especially if you game on the go. If you’re on the hunt for an upgrade to your current headset and don’t mind using a separate microphone (at least, most of the time), there are lots of incredible options out there. I’ve been part of the IEM hobby for years and have done the hard work of testing dozens upon dozens of sets, on the hunt for the best of the best—like our top overall, the FiiO FA19. If you’re a gamer, this list is for you. I’ve been a gamer for as long as I can remember, cutting my teeth on the Atari 2600. In fact, I got my start in journalism writing about games for a number of small websites. In my adult life, I’ve fallen in love with the world of audio and IEMs in particular. I currently maintain an archive of over 100. Between my closet and storage spaces, I have around 30 pairs of headphones and have given away more gaming headsets than most people will in a lifetime. TL;DR: I love tech, I love gaming, and I love writing about the best picks for different types of people. This list represents my biggest hobbies, rolled into one. Chris Coke Why it made the cut: A customizable sound signature, great details, and a comfortable fit, the FA19 is tops for gaming. If you’re looking for the best of the best when it comes to gaming IEMs, the FiiO FA19 has you covered. This set doesn’t come cheap, but it’s an absolute banger for gaming and music alike. With its customizable sound signature, comfortable fit, and fantastic sound quality, it’s a stellar pick no matter what genre you’re gaming in. FiiO has been one of the biggest companies to watch for a number of years. Getting its start making portable digital audio players (DAPs) and amps, it has since expanded into IEMs, over-ear headphones, desktop amps and streaming media players, speakers, CD and cassette players, and that’s not even the full list. What’s even more impressive is that in most areas where it’s attempted to compete, it’s been able to offer high-quality options at prices that are comparatively quite reasonable. The FA19 is exactly such an option. It uses 10 balanced armatures per side and a shell 3D printed in medical-grade resin. It’s a comfortable fit, even as it offers 20 total speakers between its two earpieces, which usually necessitates a monster shell. The FA19 isn’t small, but it’s not uncomfortably large like many of its competitors are. That many drivers might seem excessive, but there’s a good reason for that excess. Each driver can concentrate on a particular frequency band, ensuring that none are pushed beyond their limits and that distortion is never a concern. Just as importantly, for gaming, all of those drivers make it easier to hear each distinct detail in the environment around you. You’ll never have to worry about footsteps or enemy vehicles sneaking up on you because they got lost in the mix. The FA19 provides exceptionally good layering, so you’ll always be able to make out every unique element that makes up your soundscape. It has also allowed the acoustic engineers at FiiO to fine-tune both of its distinct sound signatures. While the FA19 is hardly the only pair of in-ear monitors to offer a tuning switch, it is one of the few where its addition makes a meaningful difference to the sound. Here, you’re given the option between a reference tuning that’s perfect for discerning small details and a hi-fi tuning that provides a more exciting sound signature with added bass and treble. When I tested these, I found that I preferred the hi-fi tuning for its added energy and that it still performed well even in competitive shooters. For the utmost clarity, its reference option makes for a great alternative. And, surprise, surprise (not really), they are fantastic for music. It comes with a modular cable that supports a standard 3.5mm single-ended connection, as well as a 4.4mm Pentaconn connection for balanced sources, so you should be able to connect to everything from your motherboard to prestigious audiophile hardware (I recommend using a dedicated DAC for the best listening experience). When I’m not gaming with them, I’m using them to play guitar on stage with my church for a clean monitor mix. The only thing they lack is a microphone and a more accessible price point. But with the exception of only a few options in the IEM world, you’ll need to provide your own microphone anyway, so it’s hard to be too critical of this point. Overall, the FiiO FA19 is a pricey but outstanding pair of IEMs. They’re exceptional for gaming. And just about everything else, if you can afford them, they’re an easy recommendation. Tony Ware Why it made the cut: An expansive, holographic soundstage with impressively precise imaging offers strong spatial awareness in competitive gaming. The Kiwi Ears Aether carves a niche with a deft touch, walking the sonic tightrope between analytical precision and atmospheric immersion. These IEMs offer a soundstage that punches above their price point—an expansive, layered field that critics and users alike describe as impressively holographic. It’s not just wide; it’s well-structured, delivering the kind of positional accuracy that audiophiles crave and gamers covet. For music, the Aether’s oversized 15.3mm planar-magnetic diaphragms impress with articulate mids and a tight low end—clean enough for complex jazz arrangements, yet warm enough to give synth-heavy ambient tracks a sense of emotional heft. Highs shimmer without searing, providing detail without fatigue, a characteristic that makes long listening sessions a joy rather than a chore. The soundstage—wide, tall, and deep—creates breathing room for instruments, giving the illusion of space that’s more reminiscent of open-back headphones than a pair of IEMs. But where the Aether really surprises is in gaming mayhem. Footstep tracking in FPS titles is intuitive, thanks to that same dimensional clarity. Environmental cues and directional insights feel more vivid, not just heard but placed—a rare trait in IEMs under $500. Some might perceive a dip in sub-bass impact compared to bass-heavy sets (like the Kiwi Ears x HBB Punch), but it’s a tradeoff that benefits overall transitions and transparency. There’s a cohesion, a refinement to the sound throughout the frequency range, thanks to the single-driver, crossover-free setup (the same reason dynamic driver fans love the low-profile Sennheiser IE 600). The Kiwi Ears Aether isn’t trying to win you over with bombast. It’s a refined, thoughtful performer—an IEM that feels just as at home in a playlist deep-dive as it does in a multiplayer skirmish. Turtle Beach Why it made the cut: This affordable pair of IEMs adds a microphone to the mix and a surprisingly good tuning. Look no further than the Turtle Beach Battle Buds for gaming performance on a budget. At only $30 MSRP and frequently available for less, these earbuds represent one of the best values in IEMs dedicated to gaming. Between its price, performance, and versatility, they’re one of the only pairs of affordable “gaming earbuds” I recommend comfortably. They’re a great value for gamers on a budget. While there are plenty of IEMs that offer in-line microphones, there are very few that feature dedicated boom mics, but that’s exactly what this has. It’s clearer and louder than most in-line mics due to its proximity to your mouth, and that comes in clutch when you need to strategize with your team. When it’s not needed, it simply unplugs from the left earpiece, allowing you to have less weight and improved comfort as needed. Turtle Beach wisely outfitted each earpiece with a silicone retention wing, similar to exercise earbuds, so even with the mic installed, its weight doesn’t get in the way of comfort and stability. The quality of that mic is also surprisingly good. Its closest competitor is the SteelSeries Tusq, which is significantly more expensive at around $50. To my ear, the Battle Buds offer clearer pick-up, though neither offers software enhancements on their own. Since they connect with a standard 3.5mm jack, however, they’re compatible with third-party software. My ASUS ROG Maximus Hero gaming motherboard was able to apply its enhancements without difficulty. The earbuds themselves sound fine, but their quality won’t blow your socks off. I was able to pick out footsteps easily enough, but the Battle Buds lack the impressive layering and soundstage of other options on this list. As the saying goes, you get what you pay for. But for $30 or less, they’re not bad and will let you hear everything you need to without distorting or making you cringe from sibilance. The simplicity of their design, being traditional wired earbuds, also makes them versatile to use with different gaming platforms. Essentially, if your gaming system has a 3.5mm jack, they’re going to work, so PC, Switch, PS5, and Xbox are all perfectly compatible. At the same time, there’s no built-in DAC to add extra features like surround sound that would usually come with gaming headsets. This is something to keep in mind for most IEMs, however, and even those that do include DACs rarely offer surround sound or gaming features. As with most budget audio products, there are some concessions you’ll need to make with the Turtle Beach Battle Buds, but for their price, they are a fantastic value for anyone who wants the fit and function of in-ear monitors with a dedicated boom mic. There are plenty of other options that are worth considering, especially if you have a particular feature or purpose in mind. Even if you look for the “best earbuds for esports,” you’ll still find dozens of options to sift through, so I recommend a few other, more specialized sets to anyone scouring the market. For esports, look no further than the ZiiGaat x Fresh Reviews Arete. This set was tuned by Fresh Reviews, a popular YouTuber specializing in finding the best IEMs, headphones, and mice for competitive gaming. Though the brand is still relatively new, it has made a good name for itself with its handful of releases so far. This particular set features a single dynamic driver and four balanced armatures and can deliver a full and detailed sound signature that is also enjoyable for music. Still, it’s clear that competitive gaming was at the forefront of the YouTuber’s mind throughout the design process. It can pull important details like footsteps out of the mix in a way that enhances your situational awareness without sounding tinny like some full-sized gaming headsets. Like most picks, you will need a separate microphone with the ZiiGatt x Fresh Reviews Arete, which is something to keep in mind before pulling the trigger. Because they support a standard detachable cable, however, it’s easy to replace with a different option that includes one, like the Antlion Kimura. If you’re interested in cutting the cord, look no further than the Arc 3 Gaming Earbuds from Cleer Audio. While this is technically a cheat—as earbuds and in-ear monitors aren’t the same thing, and open-ear true wireless earbuds are even more removed—but it’s hard to deny the multiplatform, multipoint tech on display here. Featuring 16.2mm graphene drivers suspended at the ear canal opening to beam expansive, optimized spatial audio into your head while you maintain situational awareness. You don’t want someone sneaking up on you in real life anymore than you do in a game. Cleer Audio While there are plenty of true wireless earbuds to choose from, most pair over standard Bluetooth, which isn’t suited for gaming thanks to its higher latency. The Arc 3 buds sidestep that entirely with an included USB Type-C 2.4GHz dongle for a dedicated, ultra-low 30ms latency connection. You can plug it directly into your PlayStation 4 or 5, Nintendo Switch, Meta Quest, or your PC and enjoy wired-like gaming with the ease and freedom of true wireless. The Arc 3 simultaneously features Bluetooth 5.4 with Snapdragon Sound (supporting SBC and AAC but also aptX Lossless and LDAC) for hi-res music listening or conversations on the go. Plus there’s a dedicated app to fine-tune its performance and sound, which includes an adaptive mode that adjusts the volume to your surroundings. Their case is a little bulkier than the Galaxy Buds Pro 3 or Apple AirPods Pro, but along with the built-in batteries in each earbud, they offer an impressive 50 hours of battery life. Plus, they’re tuned for gaming audio and Dolby Atmos surround sound, so whether you’re playing a competitive shooter or getting lost in your favorite RPG, these earbuds have something for everyone. Finally, we have an additional suggestion for getting lost in your game with a deep, realistic soundstage and distinct details that enhance your immersion. For strong intelligibility and accurate placement of elements, the 7Hz Timeless 2 is another killer pick. The original Timeless has become legendary in the IEM world as one of the first sets to really kick off the affordable planar-magnetic revolution. This successor was a long time coming, but the Timeless 2 has been well worth the wait. It smooths out the frequency response of the original while still maintaining its excellent detail retrieval and crisp, wide sound signature, though its circular ear shells may appear uncomfortable at first, rest assured that the inner faces are shaped normally to fit comfortably in most ears. This is a set that you can listen to for hours and forget the world with. The stock sound signature is vocal forward with a cooler midrange, but it also comes with a set of interchangeable nozzles to customize the sound signature; however, I would recommend avoiding these as the stock nozzle provides the most balanced sound overall. Choosing a great pair of in-ear monitors is never as straightforward as you’d like it to be, and when you add gaming performance to the mix, it can be even more confusing. But, with the right pair of IEMs, you’ll find a new world of sound quality opens up for you, and you’ll hear your games in a new way—a way that gaming headsets usually struggle to come close to. So, grab an external mic and get to business. Great gaming audio is a quality pair of IEMs away.

Title: Why Buy Microsoft Stock?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Microsoft store in Manhattan, New York City, United States of America on July 16th, 2024. (Photo by ... More Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Why would you want to pay 50x cash flow for Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock, when you can buy Nvidia at about the same price? Nvidia’s revenues are growing close to 100%, Microsoft’s at 15%. Yes, not 50%, but 15%. What’s worse - Nvidia’s cash flow margins are about 47%, almost 1.7x Microsoft’s margins. In other words, more of that top line growth that Nvidia gets - makes its way to free cash flow! Cash that can be reinvested or distributed to investors as return. Good thing, who can argue? But Nvidia comes with large risk. Our High Quality (HQ) portfolio diversifies away stock-specific risks while giving exposure to upside, and has outperformed the S&P 500, the Nasdaq, and Russell 2000 - and has clocked > 91% returns since inception. Well, you could argue - Microsoft is a known, stable game. For more than 40 years, this thing has been running like a machine. Nvidia’s phenomenal growth is recent - it might fizzle. AI might fizzle. Large AI models might fizzle - or worse, deemed unnecessary. Deepseek showed small models work just as well, right? They didn’t even use Nvidia’s latest chips. However, what are the odds that Nvidia’s chips will cease to be the hottest date in town? There lies the guesswork. Nvidia revenues grew more than 80% annually, on average, in the last 3 years - and last year grew more than 100%. Could this drop to 60% or 40% growth? It has to - soon! See: Buy or Sell Nvidia? Nvidia’s biggest customers are the likes of Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon. These companies, each of them, spent more than tens of billions last year on Nvidia chips. Can Microsoft, Google, and others continue to spend 100% MORE on Nvidia chips next year? And the year after? Can they do it while their own revenue grows only 15% annually? The answer is absolutely not. The Nvidia 80-100% growth music has to stop at some point. When this high pitched growth music stops, Nvidia’s valuation will drop. A lot. But then, it might continue at a slower pace, at 20-30%, not bad, but not ridiculously high either. Point is, that’s why buying a little bit of Microsoft is OK. It’s also why you build a portfolio. A resilient one. To balance risk-reward. We did it in spades with the Trefis High Quality (HQ) portfolio. Balancing risk-reward is how HQ outperformed the S&P 500, the Nasdaq, and Russell 2000. HQ outperformed all of them, and has clocked >91% returns since inception. That’s why you buy a little bit of Microsoft, or Google, META, Amazon, and perhaps even Edwards Lifesciences. Comparison as a tool: The purpose of comparing Microsoft with Nvidia is all about understanding the risk-reward tradeoff of an investment of interest, in this case Microsoft. In practice, investment decisions are about understanding relative attractiveness. Buy Microsoft stock or keep your money as interest earning cash? Or buy an ETF on the S&P 500? Is expected return on Microsoft stock more than that on cash - by how much? What’s the downside risk you bear to earn that extra return on Microsoft? Drawing contrast with a specific “anchor” asset, in this case Nvidia and Microsoft, serves as a powerful tool to assess the risk-reward tradeoff. Note: Always use an appropriate comparison for a ticker. Microsoft example was about “growth” and reasonably high valuation. A comparison with Nvidia provides interesting perspective as the stock offers much more at a similar valuation (FCF based) - but also carries with it, a huge downside risk. It is exactly this downside risk, versus relative upside tradeoffs we made - at scale, in constructing the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio. With a selection of 30 stocks, it has demonstrated a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the past 4-year span. What accounts for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks achieved superior returns with reduced risk compared to the standard index, with a smoother performance evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

VANCOUVER, BC, May 23, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Equity Insider News Commentary – A new report from Philips reveals a growing divide between doctors and patients when it comes to AI in healthcare. While 63% of surveyed healthcare professionals believe AI can help improve outcomes, only 48% of patients share that optimism. As researchers explore what's needed for successful AI adoption in healthcare, major players in tech and biotech are already moving ahead—recent updates have come from Avant Technologies, Inc. (OTCQB: AVAI), Renovaro Inc. (NASDAQ: RENB), Certara, Inc. (NASDAQ: CERT), CareCloud, Inc. (NASDAQ: CCLD), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT). Analysts at MarketsandMarkets expect the AI healthcare sector to grow at a 38.6% CAGR, topping $110 billion by 2030. Accenture goes even further, estimating AI could inject another $461 billion in added value by 2035—amplifying impact across a global healthcare system already on track to surpass $2.26 trillion. Analysts at MarketsandMarkets expect the AI healthcare sector to grow at a 38.6% CAGR, topping $110 billion by 2030. Accenture goes even further, estimating AI could inject another $461 billion in added value by 2035—amplifying impact across a global healthcare system already on track to surpass $2.26 trillion. Avant Technologies, Inc. (OTCQB: AVAI), in partnership with Ainnova Tech, is positioning its Vision AI platform at the forefront of predictive healthcare. The company is in advanced discussions to acquire or exclusively license a patented early disease detection technology that could significantly enhance its diagnostic capabilities. If finalized, the deal would allow Vision AI to generate clinical insights even in the absence of a complete patient dataset—unlocking earlier intervention opportunities and supporting a more proactive model of care. "Our purpose is to create the future of early disease detection in an accessible way, so that patients can get a preventive check-up anywhere, at a low cost, and easily," said Vinicio Vargas, CEO at Ainnova and member of the Board of Directors of the joint venture company, Ai-nova Acquisition Corp. (AAC), said of AAC's aim to continue to add to its portfolio. "We want to prevent patients with risk factors from developing other diseases that could have been avoided before they became a real problem. To this end, we are seeking to integrate new technologies into our portfolio within a single platform, both through our R&D efforts and through potential exclusive licenses or acquisitions." The potential acquisition aligns with Avant and Ainnova's shared mission to deliver scalable, preventive health tools that merge retinal imaging, vital sign monitoring, and machine learning into one streamlined platform. Vision AI is already positioned as a next-generation diagnostic engine for chronic conditions like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and kidney dysfunction. Now, the joint venture is pushing further—evaluating breakthrough technologies that could detect emerging health issues at a pre-symptomatic stage. Recent platform updates saw four proprietary algorithms—trained on over 2.3 million real-world clinical cases—fully integrated into Vision AI. The addition of new IP from this proposed deal would mark a significant leap forward, enabling predictive models to extract meaningful signals from even limited patient data. Avant and Ainnova view this initiative as part of a broader strategy to consolidate breakthrough tools that make early disease detection more scalable, mobile, and applicable across diverse healthcare settings. While a final agreement has yet to be announced, the companies have stated they will keep shareholders informed as developments progress. In parallel, Avant has entered formal discussions to acquire Ainnova outright—building on their existing alignment under the Ai-nova Acquisition Corp. (AAC) structure. The timing is deliberate, coming just ahead of a planned FDA pre-submission meeting this July. A completed merger would unify operations, reduce internal complexity, and bolster the joint venture's regulatory readiness as it prepares for potential U.S. market entry. "We believe bringing the two companies together will offer tremendous value for shareholders," said Vargas. "It will simplify the process of advancing our technology to market, and it will deliver value to our customers and partners as we promote our technology portfolio globally." At the center of this initiative is Vision AI—a non-invasive screening platform that integrates retinal imaging, vital sign monitoring, and machine-learning models to flag early indicators of chronic disease. The system targets conditions such as diabetic retinopathy, cardiovascular issues, kidney and liver disorders, and type 2 diabetes. Operated under the AAC structure, the joint venture holds global rights to Vision AI, which has demonstrated over 90% sensitivity in early detection based on research cited by the NIH. "This milestone reflects our two-tiered strategy, rapid deployment in low-regulation markets where Vision AI operates as a screening tool, and simultaneous progress toward FDA clearance for the U.S. market," said Vargas. "Entering the U.S. will unlock significant commercial potential, and early engagement with regulators ensures we do so with speed, credibility, and a validated product." While many AI healthcare platforms remain stuck in pilot stages, Avant's Vision AI is already live across multiple Latin American markets—including Chile, Mexico, and Brazil—where it's actively being used in clinical settings. These real-world deployments are generating essential data on safety and efficacy, while also providing user feedback that guides ongoing system improvements. To broaden its diagnostic reach, the Ai-nova joint venture recently integrated four additional algorithms into the platform. Each was trained on a dataset of more than 2.3 million clinical records, enhancing Vision AI's precision across a wider spectrum of chronic diseases. With active momentum abroad and U.S. regulatory discussions now underway, Avant's trajectory appears to be moving from early validation toward broader market penetration. CONTINUED...

Title: Why CEOs Should Develop AI Acumen To Lead In 2025 And Beyond

ByRussell Sarder ByRussell Sarder, Forbes Councils Member. Chairman & CEO Russell Sarder leads NetCom Learning with a mission to build a world of lifelong learners. Today’s CEOs face challenges their predecessors couldn’t have imagined. From ethical concerns to governance complexities and workforce upheaval, the stakes are high. To face these challenges, numerous industries, including supply chain management and customer service, are revolutionizing their workforces through the use of AI tools. In fact, studies show that as much as 30% of tasks in 60% of jobs (registration required) can be automated by AI. A few months ago, I caught up with a friend who is the CEO of a mid-sized tech firm. He had felt behind on AI integration, unsure of how to incorporate it into his business. But after diving into AI, he implemented it in his customer service operations. The result was a significant surge in customer satisfaction within months. This was a complete transformation, not just a small improvement. I believe this underscores a lesson we all need to internalize: Rather than being just another tool, AI is an important part of a competitive strategy in today's market. AI isn’t going away; rather, it's reshaping businesses. According to a Cisco study, 75% of leaders state confidence that AI will open new opportunities and disrupt their industry, and 83% already consider it a strategic necessity. I've witnessed in my own company how using AI-driven analytics to predict demand and optimize inventory can lead to reduced waste, cost savings and the ability to anticipate market trends. However, implementing AI effectively can be more challenging than leaders anticipate. According to a study, many are underprepared for the expected AI disruption to their industry: 62% of surveyed companies experience difficulties in cross-functional alignment during implementation, and 63% struggle to adjust workflows. What's more, research shows that "51% of IT leaders (registration required) cited governance and regulatory compliance challenges as their primary concern with AI initiatives." Integrating AI isn’t just about increasing efficiency—it can also help with differentiation. Think about Amazon. Its AI-driven recommendation algorithm doesn’t just suggest products—it predicts what you’ll want based on your browsing habits. That's part of why Amazon sales are sky-high. On the other hand, Nvidia suffered a $593 billion market value loss in a single day due to a competitive threat from DeepSeek, a Chinese AI innovator. DeepSeek’s energy-efficient AI model outpaced Nvidia’s, shifting the balance of power. Similarly, Intel’s failure to keep up in the AI chip market led to layoffs and a $10 billion reduction in capital spending. These losses emphasize both how AI is disrupting industries and how important it is for CEOs to prepare for this shift in order to protect market share and company valuation. In my experience, CEOs cannot afford to delegate AI knowledge. You need to grasp AI in order to make informed decisions about investments, AI models or governance frameworks. While 75% of executives rank AI among their top three strategic priorities, only 16% of organizations have met their AI-related goals. I believe this gap is because AI success hinges less on technology and more on the CEO's active, visible leadership. To bridge the gap, pursue AI literacy with intent. This means understanding what AI can and cannot do, as well as how it applies to your business. Start by exploring credible resources like online courses, executive programs and industry reports. I also recommend participating in roundtables, summits and AI governance forums to engage with evolving norms and practices. Understanding how AI may optimize interconnected functions requires more than simply installing a solution in one area of your company. For instance, by strategically incorporating AI into HR and Operations, you can potentially raise staff engagement and make your team more unified and effective. You can also leverage AI tools to promote comprehensive plans that improve multiple areas at once, such as improving customer satisfaction, streamlining processes and raising employee satisfaction levels. McKinsey’s 2025 analysis reveals a pronounced asymmetry: 13% of employees indicate that GenAI now comprises over 30% of their daily functions, yet C-suite leaders estimate that only 4% of their employees have reached that level. This disparity helps underscore the importance of education initiatives. In my experience, effective AI training begins by anchoring learning to real business impact. Strengthen your training frameworks by balancing conceptual grounding with applied experience. Initial sessions should introduce essential concepts, clarify the boundaries of what AI can and cannot do and address common misconceptions. From there, shift into practical immersion. Identify one high-impact area, like sales forecasting, customer support or inventory planning, and pilot a focused solution. Use that project as both proof of value and a learning vehicle. Once it has been validated, scale with discipline and with training embedded at each stage. Finally, training should be seen as an ongoing process. One common pitfall I've encountered is the assumption that early exposure is sufficient. Another is over-relying on third-party programs without building internal ownership. One of the most damaging missteps, however, is deploying AI technologies in production environments before equipping your teams to use them ethically, accurately and with contextual understanding. As Ben Cook, president of Acumen Learning, warns, "If you don’t understand the business, you have no business using AI." Today, the flip side is equally important: If you don’t understand AI, you could struggle to lead your business in 2025. To lead in the AI-driven future, I believe we, as CEOs, must experiment with AI, learn new things constantly and establish a strong foundation within our companies. The question isn’t if AI will reshape your industry—it’s whether you’ll be the disruptor or the disrupted. Forbes Business Council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders. Do I qualify?

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Friday threatened a 50% tax on all imports from the European Union as well a 25% tariff on smartphones unless those products are made in America. The threats, delivered over social media, reflect Trump’s ability to disrupt the global economy with a burst of typing, as well as the reality that his tariffs have yet to produce the trade deals he is seeking or the return of domestic manufacturing he has promised voters. The Republican president said he wants to charge higher import taxes on goods from the EU, a longstanding US ally, than from China, a geopolitical rival that had its tariffs cut to 30% this month so Washington and Beijing could hold negotiations. Trump was upset by the lack of progress in trade talks with the EU, which has proposed mutually cutting tariffs to zero even as the president has publicly insisted on preserving a baseline 10% tax on most imports. “Our discussions with them are going nowhere!” Trump posted on Truth Social. “Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025. There is no Tariff if the product is built or manufactured in the United States.” Speaking later in the Oval Office, Trump stressed that he was not seeking a deal with the EU and might delay the tariffs if more companies invested in the United States. “I’m not looking for a deal,” Trump told the reporters. “We’ve set the deal. It’s at 50%.” The EU’s top trade official, Maros Sefcovic, posted on the social media site X that he spoke Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. “The EU’s fully engaged, committed to securing a deal that works for both,” Sefcovic said. “EU-US trade is unmatched & must be guided by mutual respect, not threats. We stand ready to defend our interests.” All smartphones could be affected Trump’s tariffs against Europe had been preceded by a threat of import taxes against Apple for its plans to continue making its iPhone in Asia. Apple now joins Amazon, Walmart and other major U.S. companies in the White House’s crosshairs as they try to respond to the uncertainty and inflationary pressures unleashed by his tariffs. “I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone’s that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,” Trump wrote. “If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.” Trump later clarified his post to say that all smartphones made abroad would be taxed and the tariffs could be coming as soon as the end of June. “It would be also Samsung and anybody that makes that product,” Trump said. “Otherwise, it wouldn’t be fair.” The statements by Trump are critical in that he suggests the company itself would bear the price of tariffs, contradicting his earlier claims as he rolled out a series of aggressive tariffs over the past several months that foreign countries would shoulder the cost of the import taxes. In general, importers pay the tariffs and the costs are often passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices. In response to Trump’s tariffs on China, Apple CEO Tim Cook said earlier this month that most iPhones sold in the U.S. during the current fiscal quarter would come from India, with iPads and other devices being imported from Vietnam. After Trump rolled out tariffs in April, bank analysts estimated that a $1,200 iPhone would if made in America jump in price anywhere from $1,500 to $3,500. Stocks sold off after Trump’s postings, with the S&P 500 index down roughly 0.67%. The markets have developed a hair-trigger sensitivity to the U.S. president’s statements, often slumping when he announces high tariffs and rallying when he retreats from those threats. US vs. EU U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tried to provide some clarity on Trump’s postings in a Friday interview on the Fox News show “America’s Newsroom.” Bessent said the EU has a “collective action problem” because its 27 member states are being represented by “this one group in Brussels,” such that the “underlying countries don’t even know what the EU is negotiating on their behalf.” The Treasury secretary said he was not in a White House meeting this week that Cook attended, but he also spoke with the Apple CEO this week. Bessent said the goal was to have Apple bring more of its computer chip supply chain into the U.S. The core of Trump’s argument against the EU is that America runs a “totally unacceptable” trade deficit with the 27 member states. Countries run trade deficits when they import more goods than they export. From the vantage point of the EU’s executive commission, trade with the U.S. is roughly in balance if both goods and services are included. As a global center for finance and technology, the U.S. runs a trade surplus in services with Europe. That offsets some of the trade gap in goods and puts the imbalance at 48 billion euros ($54 billion). German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said the EU’s executive commission has his country’s full support in working to “preserve our access to the American market.” “I think such tariffs help no one, but would just lead to economic development in both markets suffering,” Wadephul said in Berlin. “So we are still counting on negotiations, and support the European Commission in defending Europe and the European market while at the same time working on persuasion in America.” Trump aides have said the goal of his tariffs was to isolate China and strike new agreements with allies, but the president’s tariff threats undermine the logic of those claims. Not only could the EU face higher tariffs than China, but the bloc of member states might have been better off by establishing a broad front with China and other countries against Trump’s trade policy, said German economist German economist Marcel Fratzscher. “The strategy of the EU Commission and Germany in the trade conflict with Trump is a total failure,” Fratscher, the head of the German Institute for Economic Research, said on X. “This was a failure you could see coming — Trump sees Europe’s wavering, hesitation and concessions as the weaknesses that they are.” Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the 50% tariffs on Europe are most likely a “negotiating ploy” by Trump, as he has previously retreated on tariffs after taking a hard line. She said Trump seems to believe that negotiations operate by going to a “threat point” that could risk self-harm to the U.S. just to demonstrate how serious he is, in hopes that doing so would produce an agreement. But Lovely said that in the long-run Trump’s approach “suggests that the U.S. is an unreliable trading partner, that it operates on whim, not on rule of law.” A history with Apple Trump has run hot and cold on his relationship with Apple, a sign that currying favor with him might not necessarily shield a company from his anger. He has essentially told companies such as Walmart to “eat” the costs of his tariffs instead of raising prices, even though doing so could squeeze profits and cause layoffs. He now appears to deploying a similar degree of pressure to force Apple to accept the higher costs of relocating its supply chains. Trump had previously created an exemption on electronics imported from China to help companies such as Apple, something he could now remove. He also threatened separate 25% import taxes on computer chips and could have the tariffs schedule rewritten in ways that could expose Apple products to the taxes. Until recently, the U.S. president repeatedly bragged about the $500 billion that Apple in February pledged to invest domestically as part of its development of artificial intelligence technologies. But he publicly turned against the company last week while speaking in Qatar. “I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,” Trump told the audience. “I said to him: ‘My friend, I treated you very good. You’re coming here with $500 billion, but now I hear you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India.’” Analysts have been skeptical that Apple could quickly shift device manufacturing to the U.S., mainly because it has spent decades embedding complex supply chains in China to feed the factories. But it also has the challenge of grappling with “the unpredictable nature of the current U.S. administration,” said Ben Wood, chief analyst at U.K.-based research firm CCS Insight. “At any moment, things can change overnight, making it extremely difficult for companies such as Apple to plan their business,” Wood said. “It seems that despite the best efforts of the Apple leadership team to lobby the U.S. administration to treat the iPhone more favorably, a curveball can come out of nowhere and derail any plans they have in place.” AP writers Paul Wiseman, David McHugh in Frankfurt, Germany, Geir Moulson in Berlin and Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report.

But Lovely said that in the long-run Trump’s approach “suggests that the U.S. is an unreliable trading partner, that it operates on whim, not on rule of law.” Trump has run hot and cold on his relationship with Apple, a sign that currying favor with him might not necessarily shield a company from his anger. He has essentially told companies such as Walmart to “eat” the costs of his tariffs instead of raising prices, even though doing so could squeeze profits and cause layoffs. He now appears to deploying a similar degree of pressure to force Apple to accept the higher costs of relocating its supply chains. Trump had previously created an exemption on electronics imported from China to help companies such as Apple, something he could now remove. He also threatened separate 25% import taxes on computer chips and could have the tariffs schedule rewritten in ways that could expose Apple products to the taxes. Until recently, the U.S. president repeatedly bragged about the $500 billion that Apple in February pledged to invest domestically as part of its development of artificial intelligence technologies. But he publicly turned against the company last week while speaking in Qatar. “I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,” Trump told the audience. “I said to him: ‘My friend, I treated you very good. You’re coming here with $500 billion, but now I hear you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India.’” Analysts have been skeptical that Apple could quickly shift device manufacturing to the U.S., mainly because it has spent decades embedding complex supply chains in China to feed the factories. But it also has the challenge of grappling with “the unpredictable nature of the current U.S. administration,” said Ben Wood, chief analyst at U.K.-based research firm CCS Insight. “At any moment, things can change overnight, making it extremely difficult for companies such as Apple to plan their business,” Wood said. “It seems that despite the best efforts of the Apple leadership team to lobby the U.S. administration to treat the iPhone more favorably, a curveball can come out of nowhere and derail any plans they have in place.” AP writers Paul Wiseman, David McHugh in Frankfurt, Germany, Geir Moulson in Berlin and Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report.

All rights reserved President Donald Trump silences his phone that rang twice as he was speaking to reporters after signing executive orders regarding nuclear energy in the Oval Office of the White House, Friday, May 23, 2025, in Washington, as Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth watch. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump on Friday threatened a 50% tax on all imports from the European Union as well a 25% tariff on smartphones unless those products are made in America. The threats, delivered over social media, reflect Trump's ability to disrupt the global economy with a burst of typing, as well as the reality that his tariffs have yet to produce the trade deals he is seeking or the return of domestic manufacturing he has promised voters. Recommended Videos The Republican president said he wants to charge higher import taxes on goods from the EU, a longstanding US ally, than from China, a geopolitical rival that had its tariffs cut to 30% this month so Washington and Beijing could hold negotiations. Trump was upset by the lack of progress in trade talks with the EU, which has proposed mutually cutting tariffs to zero even as the president has publicly insisted on preserving a baseline 10% tax on most imports. “Our discussions with them are going nowhere!” Trump posted on Truth Social. “Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025. There is no Tariff if the product is built or manufactured in the United States.” Speaking later in the Oval Office, Trump stressed that he was not seeking a deal with the EU and might delay the tariffs if more companies invested in the United States. “I’m not looking for a deal,” Trump told the reporters. “We’ve set the deal. It’s at 50%.” The EU’s top trade official, Maros Sefcovic, posted on the social media site X that he spoke Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. “The EU’s fully engaged, committed to securing a deal that works for both,” Sefcovic said. “EU-US trade is unmatched & must be guided by mutual respect, not threats. We stand ready to defend our interests.” All smartphones could be affected Trump's tariffs against Europe had been preceded by a threat of import taxes against Apple for its plans to continue making its iPhone in Asia. Apple now joins Amazon, Walmart and other major U.S. companies in the White House's crosshairs as they try to respond to the uncertainty and inflationary pressures unleashed by his tariffs. “I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone’s that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,” Trump wrote. “If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.” Trump later clarified his post to say that all smartphones made abroad would be taxed and the tariffs could be coming as soon as the end of June. “It would be also Samsung and anybody that makes that product,” Trump said. “Otherwise, it wouldn’t be fair.” The statements by Trump are critical in that he suggests the company itself would bear the price of tariffs, contradicting his earlier claims as he rolled out a series of aggressive tariffs over the past several months that foreign countries would shoulder the cost of the import taxes. In general, importers pay the tariffs and the costs are often passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices. In response to Trump’s tariffs on China, Apple CEO Tim Cook said earlier this month that most iPhones sold in the U.S. during the current fiscal quarter would come from India, with iPads and other devices being imported from Vietnam. After Trump rolled out tariffs in April, bank analysts estimated that a $1,200 iPhone would if made in America jump in price anywhere from $1,500 to $3,500. Stocks sold off after Trump's postings, with the S&P 500 index down roughly 0.67%. The markets have developed a hair-trigger sensitivity to the U.S. president's statements, often slumping when he announces high tariffs and rallying when he retreats from those threats. US vs. EU U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tried to provide some clarity on Trump's postings in a Friday interview on the Fox News show “America's Newsroom.” Bessent said the EU has a “collective action problem” because its 27 member states are being represented by “this one group in Brussels,” such that the “underlying countries don’t even know what the EU is negotiating on their behalf.” The Treasury secretary said he was not in a White House meeting this week that Cook attended, but he also spoke with the Apple CEO this week. Bessent said the goal was to have Apple bring more of its computer chip supply chain into the U.S. The core of Trump's argument against the EU is that America runs a “totally unacceptable” trade deficit with the 27 member states. Countries run trade deficits when they import more goods than they export. From the vantage point of the EU's executive commission, trade with the U.S. is roughly in balance if both goods and services are included. As a global center for finance and technology, the U.S. runs a trade surplus in services with Europe. That offsets some of the trade gap in goods and puts the imbalance at 48 billion euros ($54 billion). German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said the EU's executive commission has his country’s full support in working to “preserve our access to the American market.” “I think such tariffs help no one, but would just lead to economic development in both markets suffering,” Wadephul said in Berlin. “So we are still counting on negotiations, and support the European Commission in defending Europe and the European market while at the same time working on persuasion in America.” Trump aides have said the goal of his tariffs was to isolate China and strike new agreements with allies, but the president's tariff threats undermine the logic of those claims. Not only could the EU face higher tariffs than China, but the bloc of member states might have been better off by establishing a broad front with China and other countries against Trump’s trade policy, said German economist Marcel Fratzscher. “The strategy of the EU Commission and Germany in the trade conflict with Trump is a total failure,” Fratzscher, the head of the German Institute for Economic Research, said on X. “This was a failure you could see coming — Trump sees Europe’s wavering, hesitation and concessions as the weaknesses that they are.” Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the 50% tariffs on Europe are most likely a “negotiating ploy” by Trump, as he has previously retreated on tariffs after taking a hard line.

May 23, 2025 08:07 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, May 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that its missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

That offsets some of the trade gap in goods and puts the imbalance at 48 billion euros ($54 billion).German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said the EU's executive commission has his country’s full support in working to “preserve our access to the American market.”“I think such tariffs help no one, but would just lead to economic development in both markets suffering,” Wadephul said in Berlin. “So we are still counting on negotiations, and support the European Commission in defending Europe and the European market while at the same time working on persuasion in America.”Trump aides have said the goal of his tariffs was to isolate China and strike new agreements with allies, but the president's tariff threats undermine the logic of those claims. Not only could the EU face higher tariffs than China, but the bloc of member states might have been better off by establishing a broad front with China and other countries against Trump’s trade policy, said German economist Marcel Fratzscher.“The strategy of the EU Commission and Germany in the trade conflict with Trump is a total failure,” Fratzscher, the head of the German Institute for Economic Research, said on X. “This was a failure you could see coming — Trump sees Europe’s wavering, hesitation and concessions as the weaknesses that they are.”Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the 50% tariffs on Europe are most likely a “negotiating ploy” by Trump, as he has previously retreated on tariffs after taking a hard line.She said Trump seems to believe that negotiations operate by going to a “threat point” that could risk self-harm to the U.S. just to demonstrate how serious he is, in hopes that doing so would produce an agreement.But Lovely said that in the long-run Trump's approach “suggests that the U.S. is an unreliable trading partner, that it operates on whim, not on rule of law.”Trump has run hot and cold on his relationship with Apple, a sign that currying favor with him might not necessarily shield a company from his anger. He has essentially told companies such as Walmart to “eat” the costs of his tariffs instead of raising prices, even though doing so could squeeze profits and cause layoffs. He now appears to deploying a similar degree of pressure to force Apple to accept the higher costs of relocating its supply chains.Trump had previously created an exemption on electronics imported from China to help companies such as Apple, something he could now remove. He also threatened separate 25% import taxes on computer chips and could have the tariffs schedule rewritten in ways that could expose Apple products to the taxes.Until recently, the U.S. president repeatedly bragged about the $500 billion that Apple in February pledged to invest domestically as part of its development of artificial intelligence technologies. But he publicly turned against the company last week while speaking in Qatar.“I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,” Trump told the audience. “I said to him: ‘Tim, you're my friend. I treated you very good. You’re coming here with $500 billion, but now I hear you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India.'”Analysts have been skeptical that Apple could quickly shift device manufacturing to the U.S., mainly because it has spent decades embedding complex supply chains in China to feed the factories. But it also has the challenge of grappling with “the unpredictable nature of the current U.S. administration,” said Ben Wood, chief analyst at U.K.-based research firm CCS Insight.“At any moment, things can change overnight, making it extremely difficult for companies such as Apple to plan their business,” Wood said. “It seems that despite the best efforts of the Apple leadership team to lobby the U.S. administration to treat the iPhone more favorably, a curveball can come out of nowhere and derail any plans they have in place.”___AP writers Paul Wiseman, David McHugh in Frankfurt, Germany, Geir Moulson in Berlin and Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report. The threats, delivered over social media, reflect Trump's ability to disrupt the global economy with a burst of typing, as well as the reality that his tariffs have yet to produce the trade deals he is seeking or the return of domestic manufacturing he has promised voters.The Republican president said he wants to charge higher import taxes on goods from the EU, a longstanding US ally, than from China, a geopolitical rival that had its tariffs cut to 30% this month so Washington and Beijing could hold negotiations. Trump was upset by the lack of progress in trade talks with the EU, which has proposed mutually cutting tariffs to zero even as the president has publicly insisted on preserving a baseline 10% tax on most imports.“Our discussions with them are going nowhere!” Trump posted on Truth Social. “Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025. There is no Tariff if the product is built or manufactured in the United States.”Speaking later in the Oval Office, Trump stressed that he was not seeking a deal with the EU and might delay the tariffs if more companies invested in the United States.“I’m not looking for a deal,” Trump told the reporters. “We’ve set the deal. It’s at 50%.”The EU’s top trade official, Maros Sefcovic, posted on the social media site X that he spoke Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.“The EU’s fully engaged, committed to securing a deal that works for both,” Sefcovic said. “EU-US trade is unmatched & must be guided by mutual respect, not threats. We stand ready to defend our interests.”Trump's tariffs against Europe had been preceded by a threat of import taxes against Apple for its plans to continue making its iPhone in Asia. Apple now joins Amazon, Walmart and other major U.S. companies in the White House's crosshairs as they try to respond to the uncertainty and inflationary pressures unleashed by his tariffs.“I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone’s that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,” Trump wrote. “If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.”Trump later clarified his post to say that all smartphones made abroad would be taxed and the tariffs could be coming as soon as the end of June.“It would be also Samsung and anybody that makes that product,” Trump said. “Otherwise, it wouldn’t be fair.”The statements by Trump are critical in that he suggests the company itself would bear the price of tariffs, contradicting his earlier claims as he rolled out a series of aggressive tariffs over the past several months that foreign countries would shoulder the cost of the import taxes. In general, importers pay the tariffs and the costs are often passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices.In response to Trump’s tariffs on China, Apple CEO Tim Cook said earlier this month that most iPhones sold in the U.S. during the current fiscal quarter would come from India, with iPads and other devices being imported from Vietnam. After Trump rolled out tariffs in April, bank analysts estimated that a $1,200 iPhone would if made in America jump in price anywhere from $1,500 to $3,500.Stocks sold off after Trump's postings, with the S&P 500 index down roughly 0.67%. The markets have developed a hair-trigger sensitivity to the U.S. president's statements, often slumping when he announces high tariffs and rallying when he retreats from those threats.U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tried to provide some clarity on Trump's postings in a Friday interview on the Fox News show “America's Newsroom.”Bessent said the EU has a “collective action problem” because its 27 member states are being represented by “this one group in Brussels,” such that the “underlying countries don’t even know what the EU is negotiating on their behalf.”The Treasury secretary said he was not in a White House meeting this week that Cook attended, but he also spoke with the Apple CEO this week. Bessent said the goal was to have Apple bring more of its computer chip supply chain into the U.S.The core of Trump's argument against the EU is that America runs a “totally unacceptable” trade deficit with the 27 member states.

It’s at 50%.”The EU’s top trade official, Maros Sefcovic, posted on the social media site X that he spoke Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.“The EU’s fully engaged, committed to securing a deal that works for both,” Sefcovic said. “EU-US trade is unmatched & must be guided by mutual respect, not threats. We stand ready to defend our interests.”Trump's tariffs against Europe had been preceded by a threat of import taxes against Apple for its plans to continue making its iPhone in Asia. Apple now joins Amazon, Walmart and other major U.S. companies in the White House's crosshairs as they try to respond to the uncertainty and inflationary pressures unleashed by his tariffs.“I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone’s that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,” Trump wrote. “If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.”Trump later clarified his post to say that all smartphones made abroad would be taxed and the tariffs could be coming as soon as the end of June.“It would be also Samsung and anybody that makes that product,” Trump said. “Otherwise, it wouldn’t be fair.”The statements by Trump are critical in that he suggests the company itself would bear the price of tariffs, contradicting his earlier claims as he rolled out a series of aggressive tariffs over the past several months that foreign countries would shoulder the cost of the import taxes. In general, importers pay the tariffs and the costs are often passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices.In response to Trump’s tariffs on China, Apple CEO Tim Cook said earlier this month that most iPhones sold in the U.S. during the current fiscal quarter would come from India, with iPads and other devices being imported from Vietnam. After Trump rolled out tariffs in April, bank analysts estimated that a $1,200 iPhone would if made in America jump in price anywhere from $1,500 to $3,500.Stocks sold off after Trump's postings, with the S&P 500 index down roughly 0.67%. The markets have developed a hair-trigger sensitivity to the U.S. president's statements, often slumping when he announces high tariffs and rallying when he retreats from those threats.U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tried to provide some clarity on Trump's postings in a Friday interview on the Fox News show “America's Newsroom.”Bessent said the EU has a “collective action problem” because its 27 member states are being represented by “this one group in Brussels,” such that the “underlying countries don’t even know what the EU is negotiating on their behalf.”The Treasury secretary said he was not in a White House meeting this week that Cook attended, but he also spoke with the Apple CEO this week. Bessent said the goal was to have Apple bring more of its computer chip supply chain into the U.S.The core of Trump's argument against the EU is that America runs a “totally unacceptable” trade deficit with the 27 member states. Countries run trade deficits when they import more goods than they export.From the vantage point of the EU's executive commission, trade with the U.S. is roughly in balance if both goods and services are included. As a global center for finance and technology, the U.S. runs a trade surplus in services with Europe. That offsets some of the trade gap in goods and puts the imbalance at 48 billion euros ($54 billion).German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said the EU's executive commission has his country’s full support in working to “preserve our access to the American market.”“I think such tariffs help no one, but would just lead to economic development in both markets suffering,” Wadephul said in Berlin. “So we are still counting on negotiations, and support the European Commission in defending Europe and the European market while at the same time working on persuasion in America.”Trump aides have said the goal of his tariffs was to isolate China and strike new agreements with allies, but the president's tariff threats undermine the logic of those claims. Not only could the EU face higher tariffs than China, but the bloc of member states might have been better off by establishing a broad front with China and other countries against Trump’s trade policy, said German economist Marcel Fratzscher.“The strategy of the EU Commission and Germany in the trade conflict with Trump is a total failure,” Fratzscher, the head of the German Institute for Economic Research, said on X. “This was a failure you could see coming — Trump sees Europe’s wavering, hesitation and concessions as the weaknesses that they are.”Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the 50% tariffs on Europe are most likely a “negotiating ploy” by Trump, as he has previously retreated on tariffs after taking a hard line.She said Trump seems to believe that negotiations operate by going to a “threat point” that could risk self-harm to the U.S. just to demonstrate how serious he is, in hopes that doing so would produce an agreement.But Lovely said that in the long-run Trump's approach “suggests that the U.S. is an unreliable trading partner, that it operates on whim, not on rule of law.”Trump has run hot and cold on his relationship with Apple, a sign that currying favor with him might not necessarily shield a company from his anger. He has essentially told companies such as Walmart to “eat” the costs of his tariffs instead of raising prices, even though doing so could squeeze profits and cause layoffs. He now appears to deploying a similar degree of pressure to force Apple to accept the higher costs of relocating its supply chains.Trump had previously created an exemption on electronics imported from China to help companies such as Apple, something he could now remove. He also threatened separate 25% import taxes on computer chips and could have the tariffs schedule rewritten in ways that could expose Apple products to the taxes.Until recently, the U.S. president repeatedly bragged about the $500 billion that Apple in February pledged to invest domestically as part of its development of artificial intelligence technologies. But he publicly turned against the company last week while speaking in Qatar.“I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,” Trump told the audience. “I said to him: ‘Tim, you're my friend.

In general, importers pay the tariffs and the costs are often passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices.In response to Trump’s tariffs on China, Apple CEO Tim Cook said earlier this month that most iPhones sold in the U.S. during the current fiscal quarter would come from India, with iPads and other devices being imported from Vietnam. After Trump rolled out tariffs in April, bank analysts estimated that a $1,200 iPhone would if made in America jump in price anywhere from $1,500 to $3,500.Stocks sold off after Trump's postings, with the S&P 500 index down roughly 0.67%. The markets have developed a hair-trigger sensitivity to the U.S. president's statements, often slumping when he announces high tariffs and rallying when he retreats from those threats.U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tried to provide some clarity on Trump's postings in a Friday interview on the Fox News show “America's Newsroom.”Bessent said the EU has a “collective action problem” because its 27 member states are being represented by “this one group in Brussels,” such that the “underlying countries don’t even know what the EU is negotiating on their behalf.”The Treasury secretary said he was not in a White House meeting this week that Cook attended, but he also spoke with the Apple CEO this week. Bessent said the goal was to have Apple bring more of its computer chip supply chain into the U.S.The core of Trump's argument against the EU is that America runs a “totally unacceptable” trade deficit with the 27 member states. Countries run trade deficits when they import more goods than they export.From the vantage point of the EU's executive commission, trade with the U.S. is roughly in balance if both goods and services are included. As a global center for finance and technology, the U.S. runs a trade surplus in services with Europe. That offsets some of the trade gap in goods and puts the imbalance at 48 billion euros ($54 billion).German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said the EU's executive commission has his country’s full support in working to “preserve our access to the American market.”“I think such tariffs help no one, but would just lead to economic development in both markets suffering,” Wadephul said in Berlin. “So we are still counting on negotiations, and support the European Commission in defending Europe and the European market while at the same time working on persuasion in America.”Trump aides have said the goal of his tariffs was to isolate China and strike new agreements with allies, but the president's tariff threats undermine the logic of those claims. Not only could the EU face higher tariffs than China, but the bloc of member states might have been better off by establishing a broad front with China and other countries against Trump’s trade policy, said German economist Marcel Fratzscher.“The strategy of the EU Commission and Germany in the trade conflict with Trump is a total failure,” Fratzscher, the head of the German Institute for Economic Research, said on X. “This was a failure you could see coming — Trump sees Europe’s wavering, hesitation and concessions as the weaknesses that they are.”Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the 50% tariffs on Europe are most likely a “negotiating ploy” by Trump, as he has previously retreated on tariffs after taking a hard line.She said Trump seems to believe that negotiations operate by going to a “threat point” that could risk self-harm to the U.S. just to demonstrate how serious he is, in hopes that doing so would produce an agreement.But Lovely said that in the long-run Trump's approach “suggests that the U.S. is an unreliable trading partner, that it operates on whim, not on rule of law.”Trump has run hot and cold on his relationship with Apple, a sign that currying favor with him might not necessarily shield a company from his anger. He has essentially told companies such as Walmart to “eat” the costs of his tariffs instead of raising prices, even though doing so could squeeze profits and cause layoffs. He now appears to deploying a similar degree of pressure to force Apple to accept the higher costs of relocating its supply chains.Trump had previously created an exemption on electronics imported from China to help companies such as Apple, something he could now remove. He also threatened separate 25% import taxes on computer chips and could have the tariffs schedule rewritten in ways that could expose Apple products to the taxes.Until recently, the U.S. president repeatedly bragged about the $500 billion that Apple in February pledged to invest domestically as part of its development of artificial intelligence technologies. But he publicly turned against the company last week while speaking in Qatar.“I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,” Trump told the audience. “I said to him: ‘Tim, you're my friend. I treated you very good. You’re coming here with $500 billion, but now I hear you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India.'”Analysts have been skeptical that Apple could quickly shift device manufacturing to the U.S., mainly because it has spent decades embedding complex supply chains in China to feed the factories.

Not only could the EU face higher tariffs than China, but the bloc of member states might have been better off by establishing a broad front with China and other countries against Trump’s trade policy, said German economist Marcel Fratzscher.“The strategy of the EU Commission and Germany in the trade conflict with Trump is a total failure,” Fratzscher, the head of the German Institute for Economic Research, said on X. “This was a failure you could see coming — Trump sees Europe’s wavering, hesitation and concessions as the weaknesses that they are.”Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the 50% tariffs on Europe are most likely a “negotiating ploy” by Trump, as he has previously retreated on tariffs after taking a hard line.She said Trump seems to believe that negotiations operate by going to a “threat point” that could risk self-harm to the U.S. just to demonstrate how serious he is, in hopes that doing so would produce an agreement.But Lovely said that in the long-run Trump's approach “suggests that the U.S. is an unreliable trading partner, that it operates on whim, not on rule of law.”Trump has run hot and cold on his relationship with Apple, a sign that currying favor with him might not necessarily shield a company from his anger. He has essentially told companies such as Walmart to “eat” the costs of his tariffs instead of raising prices, even though doing so could squeeze profits and cause layoffs. He now appears to deploying a similar degree of pressure to force Apple to accept the higher costs of relocating its supply chains.Trump had previously created an exemption on electronics imported from China to help companies such as Apple, something he could now remove. He also threatened separate 25% import taxes on computer chips and could have the tariffs schedule rewritten in ways that could expose Apple products to the taxes.Until recently, the U.S. president repeatedly bragged about the $500 billion that Apple in February pledged to invest domestically as part of its development of artificial intelligence technologies. But he publicly turned against the company last week while speaking in Qatar.“I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,” Trump told the audience. “I said to him: ‘Tim, you're my friend. I treated you very good. You’re coming here with $500 billion, but now I hear you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India.'”Analysts have been skeptical that Apple could quickly shift device manufacturing to the U.S., mainly because it has spent decades embedding complex supply chains in China to feed the factories. But it also has the challenge of grappling with “the unpredictable nature of the current U.S. administration,” said Ben Wood, chief analyst at U.K.-based research firm CCS Insight.“At any moment, things can change overnight, making it extremely difficult for companies such as Apple to plan their business,” Wood said. “It seems that despite the best efforts of the Apple leadership team to lobby the U.S. administration to treat the iPhone more favorably, a curveball can come out of nowhere and derail any plans they have in place.”___AP writers Paul Wiseman, David McHugh in Frankfurt, Germany, Geir Moulson in Berlin and Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report. The Treasury secretary said he was not in a White House meeting this week that Cook attended, but he also spoke with the Apple CEO this week. Bessent said the goal was to have Apple bring more of its computer chip supply chain into the U.S.The core of Trump's argument against the EU is that America runs a “totally unacceptable” trade deficit with the 27 member states.

Trump has run hot and cold on his relationship with Apple, a sign that currying favor with him might not necessarily shield a company from his anger. He has essentially told companies such as Walmart to “eat” the costs of his tariffs instead of raising prices, even though doing so could squeeze profits and cause layoffs. He now appears to deploying a similar degree of pressure to force Apple to accept the higher costs of relocating its supply chains.Trump had previously created an exemption on electronics imported from China to help companies such as Apple, something he could now remove. He also threatened separate 25% import taxes on computer chips and could have the tariffs schedule rewritten in ways that could expose Apple products to the taxes.Until recently, the U.S. president repeatedly bragged about the $500 billion that Apple in February pledged to invest domestically as part of its development of artificial intelligence technologies.

Unheeded warnings: The shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers outside the Jewish museum in Washington, D.C., is not an isolated act—it’s the latest incident of left-wing, frequently anti-Israel radicalism that academic administrators and law enforcement officials have been treating with kid gloves, writes our Washington Free Beacon editors. "The 30-year-old assailant, steeped in the radical anti-Israel and anti-Western ideology in which our universities are awash, is just past college age. So were his two victims." Just one microcosm: Harvard never disciplined two graduate students charged with assaulting an Israeli classmate. Law enforcement let them off with community service and an anger management class. It’s an obvious precursor for what unfolded Wednesday evening, and "the domestic terrorism unleashed in the nation’s capital is just a foretaste of what we can expect if universities and law enforcement, both local and federal, don’t change their approach," the Beacon’s editors warn. "Americans of good conscience, including those in the federal government, can act now—pressing for the death penalty in this case and scrutinizing every group with which the perpetrator was affiliated—or live to regret it later." READ MORE: Terror in DC: Where We Go From Here Nonprofit but pro-Hamas: The man accused of Wednesday’s terrorist act worked until the middle of last year at a "nonpartisan" nonprofit funded by the Ford and MacArthur foundations, reports our Jessica Costescu and Jessica Schwalb. Elias Rodriguez, the left-wing activist who shouted "Free Palestine" before his arrest, was employed as a researcher at The HistoryMakers, a group that has received at least $1 million from the Ford Foundation since 2024 and partnered with PBS on public programming. The HistoryMakers, which claims to be "committed to preserving and making widely accessible the untold personal stories of both well-known and unsung African Americans," presents itself as a nonpartisan effort. But, as Costescu and Schwalb note, its work suggests a left-wing political bent, to say the least. "Clarence Thomas, the second black Supreme Court justice, is omitted, but Anita Hill, who accused him of sexual harassment, is included. The renowned economist Thomas Sowell is omitted, but Al Sharpton is present. Its biography of Nation of Islam chief Louis Farrakhan omits any mention of his long history of anti-Semitism, noting instead that he’s ‘at times a controversial figure’ who pushes a ‘message of a unified community,’" they write. Rodriguez also has a history of anti-Israel radicalism. An X account apparently tied to him promoted Hamas, shared calls for "Death To Israel" and "De@th 2 Amerikka," and praised "armed action" as "the only sane thing to do." He also previously belonged to the Chicago chapter of the Party for Socialism and Liberation, which frequently organizes anti-Israel protests. READ MORE: Suspected Israeli Embassy Shooter Worked for Woke Education Group Backed by Ford, MacArthur Foundations Trump targets ESG: The Trump administration is backing a lawsuit that accuses BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard of using their influence in the financial sector to distort energy markets and drive up costs for American consumers, reports our Thomas Catenacci. The Federal Trade Commission filed a brief Thursday in support of the suit, which claims the three asset management giants may have violated U.S. antitrust law by coordinating efforts to limit coal production through environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives. The case, filed by 12 Republican-led states, alleges the asset managers used their substantial ownership stakes in major coal companies to push left-wing climate goals, including a 50 percent reduction in coal output by 2030. The FTC’s filing marks the first time the Trump administration has intervened in an ESG-related case. "Critics of the ESG movement say it seeks to improperly boost politically favored green industries that aren't profitable at the expense of more profitable energy industries. In doing so, they argue, ESG policies harm American investors—asset managers that have a legally mandated fiduciary duty to promote the wellbeing of clients whose money they manage," Catenacci writes.

Title: Thematic And Sector ETFs: Real Opportunity Or Financial Fashion?

ByGianluca Sidoti ByGianluca Sidoti, Forbes Councils Member. Gianluca Sidoti is an Independent Financial Advisor, Founder of TraDetector and Managing Partner at The Wealth Company International. Investors are always searching for the next big opportunity. In recent years, thematic and sector ETFs have offered precisely that: access to transformational trends like artificial intelligence, green energy, biotechnology or digital finance. Their promise is simple yet enticing: By investing in these funds, you can ride the wave of innovation and potentially unlock above-average returns. As an independent financial advisor, I encounter a growing number of clients asking whether these strategies belong in their portfolios. They’ve seen the headlines, heard about impressive short-term gains and want to participate. Yet, as with any investment decision, the reality is more nuanced than the marketing narratives suggest. Thematic and sector ETFs are designed to provide concentrated exposure to a particular industry or a future-driven trend. Unlike traditional broad-market ETFs, these funds typically invest in a narrower selection of companies, sometimes spread globally, sometimes focused on emerging players. During certain market environments, these thematic funds have delivered spectacular returns. The rise of electric vehicles, the boom in renewable energy and the acceleration of cloud computing all offered extraordinary windows of opportunity for early investors. However, history shows that such windows often come with a catch: They open wider during moments of euphoria and tend to close when volatility strikes. Clients sometimes approach me with enthusiasm, eager to devote large portions of their portfolios to the latest trend. I understand the appeal; thematic ETFs combine a compelling story with the excitement of future possibilities. But part of my role is helping investors distinguish between a sound long-term investment and the risks of chasing performance. One of the most significant challenges with thematic investing is timing. By the time a trend becomes obvious and investment products are widely available, much of the initial explosive growth has often already occurred. Take, for instance, the surge in clean energy ETFs in 2020 and early 2021. Funds like the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF attracted massive inflows, yet many investors who entered late experienced disappointing returns once valuations normalized. The same pattern emerged with disruptive innovation funds. The ARK Innovation ETF became a household name after skyrocketing in 2020, only to see significant declines in subsequent years. It’s a powerful reminder that enthusiasm alone does not guarantee investment success. Being early in identifying a secular trend is one thing; being early—and staying disciplined—is another. When working with clients, I approach thematic ETFs carefully and deliberately. Rather than positioning them as core holdings, I integrate them into a broader framework built on diversification, risk management and long-term objectives. A thematic ETF might represent a small, strategic satellite position—a way to align part of a portfolio with a client’s interests or beliefs without jeopardizing their broader financial stability. One client, a technology entrepreneur, recently approached me, interested in blockchain-related investments. While his conviction about the technology’s future was strong, I advised against committing a disproportionate share of his assets. Instead, we agreed to allocate a modest percentage of his portfolio into a diversified blockchain ETF, complemented by exposure to established technology companies supporting blockchain innovation. This approach allowed him to participate in the trend while maintaining a balanced, resilient portfolio. Another client, passionate about environmental sustainability, wanted to focus on clean energy and ESG-driven sectors. Together, we selected a thematic ESG ETF but ensured her investment was part of a well-diversified equity allocation, not a stand-alone bet. By setting expectations appropriately—understanding that even promising sectors can experience short-term volatility—she remained confident during inevitable market fluctuations. The reality is that not every emerging trend will deliver outsized returns. Some themes are crowded, with high valuations already priced in. Others may take longer than expected to materialize, testing investors’ patience and risk tolerance. In my practice, I emphasize to clients that thematic investing is not about trying to predict the next breakout industry overnight. It’s about positioning intelligently, with a clear understanding of the potential upside, the timeline and the risks involved. One of the critical tools in evaluating thematic ETFs is scrutinizing the underlying holdings. Many funds share the same handful of high-profile stocks, creating hidden concentration risks. Others may stretch the definition of a theme to broaden their asset base, including companies only tangentially related to the supposed focus area. Due diligence matters. It’s not enough to be excited about “artificial intelligence” or “renewable energy”—it’s essential to understand what you’re actually investing in. Furthermore, thematic ETFs often suffer from a lack of historical performance data. Since many are launched during times of high interest, it’s difficult to gauge how they will behave across full market cycles, especially during recessions or periods of rising interest rates. Investors need to be prepared for periods of underperformance and accept that patience is often a necessary component of thematic investing. Despite these challenges, thematic and sector ETFs can have a meaningful role within an intelligently constructed portfolio. They offer investors a way to express specific convictions, diversify sources of growth and align their investments with personal values. The key is to integrate them thoughtfully—and never at the expense of long-term security. In today’s world, where innovation is constant and narratives drive markets, it’s tempting to follow the latest trend. But successful investing, as I often remind my clients, is rarely about chasing headlines. It’s about building a resilient strategy capable of withstanding both the noise and the hype. Thematic and sector ETFs can be a part of that strategy, provided they are treated with the right mindset: not as magic solutions or shortcuts to wealth, but as deliberate choices, aligned with a disciplined financial plan. In the end, trends will come and go, but sound principles endure. The information provided here is not investment, tax or financial advice.

Title: Wrong Again, Democrats: Paying “Influencers” Misses the Boat
URL: https://newrepublic.com/article/195609/democrats-paying-influencers-joe-rogan-left
Time Published: 2025-05-23T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
When I joined the race for Democratic National Committee chair a few months ago, there was one area of consensus among all the candidates—including the eventual victor, Ken Martin. One of the big lessons of the loss from the last election cycle was that we collectively spent too much money on TV and digital ads, driven in large part by decisions of well-placed and well-heeled Democratic consultants. We’re about to fall into the same trap in 2025. The new flavor of the moment, though, isn’t TV ads; it’s “influencers.” According to reporting in The New York Times, liberal donors are now planning to spend ungodly amounts on creating an “army of left-leaning” digital creators of all stripes and styles. Having realized that we’re outgunned by the right in both reach and scale of conversation online, we’re now doing what Democrats often resort to—spending money to try to solve the problem. This mindset masks a deeper issue: spending money to create content with no editorial vision or strategy. When we don’t have organic grassroots appeal and we are not sufficiently connected to huge numbers of real Americans, we paper over that problem by trying to pay to reach people in unidirectional ways (paid ads, paid influencers, paid organizers). We need to focus less on the pipes and tactics of contacting people and put more emphasis on the content vision and ideas of what people find authentically and organically engaging. The inputs into the Democratic Party’s elite have strayed from meaningful conversations that ordinary citizens find interesting. We’re losing in the attention economy, as MSNBC host Chris Hayes has written. I believe a big part of the reason for that is that Democrats aren’t talking about economic justice and class-based issues in compelling and interesting ways, at a time when those class-based problems are dominating the lives of everyday Americans in every possible way. These conversations are more likely to be heard on right-leaning podcasts than on left-leaning ones. But if we engage them, the conversations speak to the broadest ideological spectrum of Americans. I talk daily to candidates wanting to run for office, and I pose this simple question to them. If I dropped you into a random town hall in any city in America, and you didn’t know anything about who was in the room, what would you say to them in order to get them to agree with you? Many have no idea what they’d say; others want to pander to pablum about “Costs are high,” or “We need to rebuild the middle class,” or “Donald Trump is terrible.” The answer must start with the reality of what we are seeing in this economy. We know the basic story that connects with voters: Corporate CEOs, monopolists, and the passive-wealth-generating elites of America have rigged an economic and political system to prioritize their needs over ours. If we are to have any chance of creating better lives for future generations, we have to be willing to wrestle power back from them through working-class solidarity. And we need politicians who have the integrity, conviction, and knowledge to be unbought and unbossed by these powerful actors. But right now, we aren’t sufficiently grounded in the lived experience and language of working Americans, who expect leaders to understand the reality of their daily struggles and own the friction with established power. To earn credibility, we have to name the culprits who deprive them of liberty. We must elevate potential solutions to give people a serious chance at a secure retirement, health care, decent wages, housing, and education in an increasingly complex and rigged economy. The consulting and funding classes are still not sure what content people actually want to consume—because they have no ways of engaging organic feedback from regular people outside of paid polls and focus groups. The social listening inputs into the left-of-center architecture are broken. If I tell a leading Democratic strategist that I want to make an ad about three global asset management companies that would help explain how they’re profiting off the lives of working people, here’s what I’d expect to hear in response: “People don’t know what asset managers are.” “That’s too complicated of a topic!” “We need the financial industry’s donations and support, so this is counterproductive.” I could go on. This exact video about Blackrock and other asset managers is currently the most-watched video on More Perfect Union’s YouTube page, with 6.6 million views and counting, and finding great appeal with Trump voters. And it’s not an anomaly for us. We’re one of the fastest-growing digital media companies since the launch of Vox, and at a moment when there’s lots of ink being spilled about the right model for growing the Democratic voting base and winning back working-class Americans with compelling information, we think more funders and outlets could stand to learn from an approach that is already working in speaking to people beyond their politically polarized viewpoints. The current conversations playing out on the left about culture, authenticity, and influence are illuminating a central challenge for the Democratic Party in this political moment. We’ve been told versions of, “We need to be willing to go on Joe Rogan’s show!” or, “We need more Joe Rogans of our own!” or, my personal favorite, “We used to have Joe Rogan!” All of these are missing the point. Without speaking for Rogan, let me just suggest that most leading platforms and podcasters want depth of knowledge, integrity, and conviction from guests who have something meaningful to convey. In my view, Joe Rogan, Theo Von, Lex Fridman, Andrew Schulz, and so many other prominent online influencers have hosted and liked Bernie Sanders not because he chose to go on their programs—it’s because of what he had to say! Sanders has had the integrity and conviction to take on power with a meaningful message about the priorities and needs of regular people who are getting screwed—which happens to be compelling and interesting content for these shows, which the audiences want to hear more discussion about. The other side understands this proposition. The arguments that helped elect Donald Trump didn’t start in consulting offices in D.C. or at exclusive donor meetings, speculating about a cultural “vertical” to fill with poll-tested talking points. They started with the things Americans were saying to one another in their day-to-day lives—and what they were sharing in comments sections and everyday meetups. Keeping their ears to the ground, conservatives found people were fed up with masking mandates and were angry about school curricula deprioritizing basic math, English, and science skills in favor of other factors as students came back after missing a year. People were worried about the flow of illegal immigrants across the border, its impact on jobs, wages, and public investments. There were serious issues about public safety in our cities, amounting to threats to their way of life. The right created enemies in the out-of-control, out-of-touch, far-left politicians as they discussed these issues. That’s not to justify any of the right’s disinformation campaigns around these matters. But the feelings that their target audience had were real, and the people crafting the campaign’s messaging knew it. As a result, in political terms, populism largely exists on the right. But I also want populism of the left. We need movements to be connected to the emotions of real people at scale. It’s worth considering this: Would Bernie’s very successful “Fighting Oligarchy Tour”—the greatest, record-breaking-turnout events Democrats have put on this year—ever have happened if the consultant-driven language police had been in charge? They tell us, “It’s the economy, stupid.” They tell us, “It’s the authenticity, stupid.” Now, “It’s the influencers, stupid.” Next election cycle, they’ll tell us it’s something else, stupid. How about this? Let’s first invest in getting to know people’s economic lives, then create the content that evidences their pains and struggles, and finally—with policy depth—connect those struggles to tangible solutions. The voters aren’t stupid, and they never have been. So let’s stop treating them that way. Faiz Shakir is the founder of the advocacy journalism organization More Perfect Union.

It may start as a casual aside, a wee-hours social media post or a much hyped announcement WASHINGTON -- It may start as a casual aside, a wee-hours social post or a much-hyped announcement. Whatever the delivery mechanism, President Donald Trump loves to toss out startling ideas aimed at dropping jaws, commandeering headlines and bolstering his political brand. Never in modern times has a president offered so many off-the-cuff statements with such a potential for wide, even global, impact. His sometimes implausible notions may become reality, or — through repetition — no longer sound so outlandish. At other times, Trump just moves on, either by fashioning a rhetorical off-ramp or finding a way to declare victory. Some ideas, though, just seem to fade away. Here's a look at some of Trump's showstopping utterances this term and where they stand. WHERE IT STANDS: Moving ahead. BACKSTORY: Trump has embraced the idea of getting a $400 million luxury plane as a gift from oil-rich Qatar for the U.S. to use as Air Force One until Boeing delivers long-delayed new planes to the government. The Pentagon said Wednesday it has accepted the jet for use as Air Force One, but retrofitting the plane to meet security requirements will be costly and take time. And ethics experts, Democrats, and even some conservatives have warned that accepting such a luxurious gift from a foreign government is unseemly and could violate constitutional provisions meant to avoid bribery. WHERE IT STANDS: In limbo. BACKSTORY: Trump posted on his social media site in early May that he wanted to reopen an “expanded and rebuilt” Alcatraz, the notorious former prison that has been closed for more than six decades — and he subsequently talked about it at the White House. The president hasn't said much on the subject since, nor addressed how lengthy, difficult and costly such a reclamation project would be. William K. Marshall III, the director of the Bureau of Prisons, said he's ordered an “assessment to determine our needs and the next steps,” even as California's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, dismissed the idea as a “distraction.” Some administration officials have endorsed bringing back the lockup known as “The Rock,” which operated from 1934 to 1963. Border czar Tom Homan suggested it could be used to house migrants awaiting deportation. WHERE IT STANDS: Still talking. BACKSTORY: Trump first floated this idea of the “Great State of Canada” with a December post just after midnight. When new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney recently visited Trump at the White House, he made a point of saying that Canada “won’t be for sale, ever.” Trump responded, “never say never.” Carney said later that he told the president privately to quit talking about making Canada a state. He didn't divulge Trump's reaction, though, noting only that it was necessary to distinguish between “a wish and a reality.” Trump nonetheless insisted during the meeting that Canada joining the United States would be a “wonderful marriage.” WHERE IT STANDS: Still talking. BACKSTORY: Trump continues to insist that the U.S. could “get” Greenland, which is part of the kingdom of Denmark, despite Copenhagen saying that's impossible. Vice President JD Vance visited Greenland in March for a quick stop at the U.S. military base there after island residents rejected a broader visit. During that trip, Vance scolded Denmark but acknowledged that Greenland would control its own sovereignty — while still suggesting that it may want to make a deal with the United States. WHERE IT STANDS: Political off-ramp found. BACKSTORY: Trump for months decried growing Chinese influence over the Panama Canal and even refused to rule out a U.S. invasion to retake control of the waterway. The situation appeared to simmer down when the White House hailed a nearly $23 billion deal announced in March that would sell two canal ports run by a company based in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong to investors led by the U.S. firm BlackRock. The deal has since hit regulatory snags, and has yet to be finalized. In the meantime, the U.S. signed an agreement giving its troops access to Panamanian facilities. WHERE IT STANDS: Faded away. BACKSTORY: Trump suggested in February that billionaire Elon Musk would be checking out Fort Knox in Kentucky to ensure that U.S. gold reserves were still there. Days later, the president said at a conservative conference outside Washington, “I'm going to go with Elon.” He then drew sustained applause by asking, “Would anybody like to join us?” Nothing has come of it since. WHERE IT STANDS: Losing steam. BACKSTORY: Trump has repeatedly floated the idea that the U.S. would “take over” war-torn Gaza and move out the Palestinians who live there. He even suggested that U.S. developers could turn the area into a “Riviera of the Middle East,” once the war between Israel and Hamas has concluded. The president at one point posted a fake video of himself and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sunbathing in Gaza and featuring a glitzy resort dubbed “TRUMP GAZA.” During his trip to the Mideast last week, Trump offered a different iteration of the idea, saying the U.S. could “get involved” in Gaza “and make it just a freedom zone.” The issue remains a nonstarter with Arab nations. WHERE IT STANDS: Still talking. BACKSTORY: Trump continues to suggest that an autopen was used to sign presidential pardons, legislation and other key documents during the tenure of former President Joe Biden. It's an accusation designed to question his Democratic predecessor's mental capacity and presidential authority. Trump's repeated complaints about Biden's autopen continue to get attention among some far-right media outlets and have prompted a Republican proposal in Congress to ban using autopens on presidential pardons. Trump has even suggested an investigation could be coming related to Biden signing immigration actions via autopen. “We’re going to start looking into this whole thing with who signed this legislation,” he said this week. WHERE IT STANDS: Faded away. BACKSTORY: Trump used his social media site in March to share a British media outlet's suggestion that Britain's King Charles III was making a “secret offer” to allow the United States to become an associate member of the British Commonwealth. “I love King Charles,” Trump wrote. “Sounds good to me!” Trump might have been joking, but his post sparked pushback online from supporters who roundly rejected the idea. He has not gone back to it. WHERE IT STANDS: Faded away. BACKSTORY: In February, Trump labeled Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a “dictator without elections” in the midst of Russia's ongoing invasion of that country. Before Zelenskyy subsequently visited the White House, Trump backed off, saying, “Did I say that?” Trump still finds plenty to complain about with the Ukrainian leader, though, saying last week that U.S. aid to the country has been “pissed away.” WHERE IT STANDS: Still talking. BACKSTORY: In February, Trump said his administration would begin offering $5 million “ gold cards ” that give “very high-level people” a “route to citizenship.” The cards would grant foreigners visas to live and work in the United States. In early April, he held up a gold card featuring his name and picture and said they would be available in “less than two weeks, probably.” The card still hasn't gone on sale, but Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick recently told the All-In podcast that he'd already personally sold 1,000 of them. WHERE IT STANDS: Still talking — off and on. BACKSTORY: The Constitution's 22nd Amendment states no one can be elected president “more than twice.” That hasn't stopped Trump from talking about it — or the Trump Organization from selling “Trump 2028” gear, despite the president himself offering mixed signals. Asked about running for a third term during a recent NBC News interview, Trump replied, “I’m not looking at that.” But he added: “So many people want me to do it. I have never had requests so strong as that. But it’s something that, to the best of my knowledge, you’re not allowed to do. I don’t know if that’s constitutional.” That followed his saying in an interview with NBC News in March: “I’m not joking. There are methods which you could do it.” And he suggested to Time Magazine, “There are some loopholes.” ___ Will Weissert covers the White House for The Associated Press. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: ‘I burst out crying on referendum results day. I realised how exhausted and scared I had been’

Ten years ago this week, Ireland became the first country in the world to legalise same-sex marriage through a popular vote. More than 6,000 same-sex couples have been married in the decade since. Here, 10 of them share their wedding stories, reflecting on how the referendum changed their lives, and Ireland, and their concerns over a regression in attitudes towards LGBTQ+ rights. Independent politician and former government minister Katherine Zappone and Ann Louise Gilligan first met in 1981 in Boston College in Massachusetts, where they were both theology doctoral students. “The programme only took two people that year,” says Katherine, recalling the fated first encounter with her late wife. “We were a little nervous that it was just ourselves initially, but that dissipated pretty quickly.” The pair instantly hit it off and became a couple, and in October 1982 they held an intimate life-partnership ceremony to celebrate their love and commitment to each other. Katherine “never ever anticipated living or working or being in a partnership with anybody other than an American in America”, but she gladly followed Ann Louise back to Ireland, where they built a life together – Ann Louise as a theologian and Katherine as a lecturer, chief executive of the National Women’s Council, and later an independent politician. [ From the archive: Ireland becomes first country to approve same-sex marriage by popular voteOpens in new window ] Speaking of the anxiety they experienced living and working in Ireland during the 1980s and 1990s – homosexuality was only decriminalised in 1993 – Katherine says: “There was always that fear that if we became public Ann Louise would lose her job.” Ann Louise taught at St Patrick’s College in Drumcondra, “a college managed by the Archbishop of Dublin, and she did suffer at different times because of that”. In 2003, Katherine and Ann Louise’s relationship was legally recognised when they married at “a beautiful small gathering” in Vancouver in Canada. The couple then “prepared to take on the State, the Irish government”, so their Canadian marriage could be recognised here as well. Their legal battle was a significant catalyst for the Irish campaign for marriage equality. “When we got the judgment in 2006 that we couldn’t get our Canadian marriage recognised because it was against the Constitution, it sparked an even greater momentum,” Katherine says. “This was holy Ireland. During this period too, some of the authority of the church was being challenged because of all the forms of institutional abuse, especially against children. So people were starting to step back and think, ‘we need to be critical Catholics and make some decisions on our own’.” Katherine believes the Yes campaign’s success was thanks to the “radical spirit” of the Irish people. “I don’t want to romanticise this, but I think there’s something extraordinary about the culture of the people here. Because of that lengthy oppression and willingness to say no and resist and find creativity and be kind, in spite of it all, and to be radical. I just think this tapped into all that. “It reinvigorated our democracy in a way we had never seen before,” she adds, remembering the striking displays of “solidarity across differences, across political parties, across generations” and “also that image of citizens that know that they have the power” as the Yes result was announced at Dublin Castle on Saturday May 23rd, 2015. Katherine and Ann Louise’s Irish wedding took place in Dublin in January 2016. “She looked remarkably beautiful and was so strong,” says Katherine of Ann Louise, who was recovering from a brain haemorrhage at the time. Ann Louise died in June 2017, following a short illness. The striking red and black dresses they married in were subsequently donated by Katherine to the National Museum of Ireland, and have been displayed at Collins Barracks as symbols of the historic referendum. There are “several outstanding issues that make it difficult to be fully free or equal in Ireland,” says Katherine now, reflecting on progress on LGBTQ+ rights 10 years on from the referendum. “The marriage equality win went a long way to normalise the identities of lesbian and gay people. Obviously we have another journey in relation to trans and non-binary [people] which should flow from the former, but doesn’t necessarily. There are challenges in terms of mental health and wellbeing. The terrible, non-existing state of trans healthcare, especially for young people. The fact that not all ‘rainbow families’ are able to get both parents recognised in law.” Buzz O’Neill met Peter Maxwell online 18 years ago. Buzz recalls his first date with Peter – “a pint in The Norseman, and then dinner across in Pintxo’s across the way in Crown Alley” – in Dublin’s Temple Bar. The couple moved in together four months later and now live with their German shepherd Eric in Amsterdam, where Peter works for Heineken. Buzz is a club promoter, and has been involved with campaigning for LGBTQ+ rights in Ireland from “day one”. “When you say you’re from Ireland and you’re in a gay bar, anywhere in the world, the first thing people say is, ‘That was the first place to vote same-sex marriage in,’” says Buzz, referencing a recent encounter with someone he met while visiting Cape Town in South Africa. “It wasn’t just the stroke of a pen by a progressive government, it was the actual people of Ireland. We had to go out there for months and months and months to get it across the line.” PantiBar on Capel Street was a hub of joy on that May weekend in 2015, and a place Buzz “just didn’t want to leave”. “I wanted to be there, more than Dublin Castle with all the celebs. A load of my friends came in, gay and straight, and I just broke down,” he recalls, welling up at the memory. On a family holiday celebrating his parents’ 50th wedding anniversary that year, Buzz proposed to Peter during a day trip to Florence. I guess we were activists in the soft sense of the word during the marriage equality campaign. We were part of all the networks that popped up. We went around the country knocking on doors A few months later, on December 28th, 2015, they married in the Dublin Unitarian Church. The reception took place in The Grand Hotel in Malahide, where Buzz’s parents had celebrated their own wedding 50 years previously. “Because we were the first same-sex couple to get married in the Unitarian Church, our solemniser was emotional, to say the least,” laughs Buzz. “So emotional, that she forgot half of the actual written service. “You can go in there now and view that registry, which me and Peter have done a few times, and it’s hundreds and hundreds of marriages going back hundreds of years and then you just see two boys’ names.” He is concerned at the “backwards” shift in attitudes towards LGBTQ+ rights in recent years. “If the campaign was run today, I don’t think we’d win.” Etain Kidney and Michelle Walls met at The George in Dublin 20 years ago. “We famously have been married three times, and every one was as good as the last,” says Etain. “In 2012, Michelle asked me to marry her, and I have such a God complex that I then asked her back.” The couple were joined by close family and friends in the small registry office on Grand Canal Street in Dublin and became civil partners in April 2014. “Then we went to Spain and had a big wedding over there,” Etain says. Around 150 guests were present at their “official wedding day” in the sunny hills of the Costa del Sol. Almost a year after the marriage equality referendum, Etain and Michelle’s story came full circle and they tied the knot once more on home turf, in the same registry office where they had their first ceremony. Etain works in education and Michelle in car rental, and they live together in Dublin city centre with their sons Tadhg (8) and Bobby (5). Remembering the mix of emotions on results day, Etain describes how she “just burst out crying” at the count centre “and then realised how exhausted and scared I had been”. “I guess we were activists in the soft sense of the word during the marriage equality campaign,” she says. “We were part of all the networks that popped up. We went around the country knocking on doors.” Ten years on, the euphoria of the campaign’s success is “a real juxtaposition” with reality. “It’s quite poignant now to reflect on marriage equality 10 years later, when we got such resounding support from the country, to be a little bit scared to walk down the street again,” says Etain. “In the same way we were brave and bold back then, we need to all be brave and bold again. We need to use this anniversary of marriage equality to remind people that it’s a fight, that we still need to protest, and that freedom doesn’t happen by accident.” Linda Cullen and Feargha Ní Bhroin live in Blackrock in Dublin with their 15-year-old twin daughters Tess and Rosa Cullen-Byrne. The couple have been together for 20 years. “We discussed having kids very early on,” says Linda, a TV producer and chief executive of production company Coco Content. She directed The 34th, a documentary telling the story of marriage equality in Ireland. Feargha is a social justice researcher. The couple became civil partners in 2012, and joined the board of Marriage Equality years in advance of the referendum campaign. I have always loved Ireland. And yet, I did wonder, gosh if it’s a no, can we actually stay? “One of the main drivers was to seek protections for our children. And we knew marriage would have to come first. It shouldn’t have to, but we knew it would, and it did,” reflects Feargha, highlighting that “there are families without those protections still”. Linda recalls a poster from the No campaign erected outside their daughters’ bedroom “saying every child deserves a mother and a father” in the months leading up to the referendum. “They were at that age where they could absorb stuff very easily … When you opened the curtains every morning, that was facing them.” The campaign was “hugely emotional”, Linda recalls. “I have always loved Ireland. I’m a real nester. I’m in the house I was born in, I’m a complete home bird. And yet, I did wonder, gosh if it’s a no, can we actually stay?” For Feargha, the conversations that happened between friends in the days and weeks following the result were particularly meaningful. “We were all talking about our stories of coming out and issues we‘d had at work – friends who’d lost their jobs because they were lesbian – and we were talking in a way that we hadn’t before about the things that had happened to us or we‘d encountered. You couldn’t look at them before because you just had to keep going.” After a busy night celebrating the Yes result in May 2015, Linda was talked into proposing to Feargha on BBC’s 5 Live Breakfast Radio show. The couple married at a small wedding ceremony on August 20th, 2019. “On a personal level, I’m finally beginning to get comfortable with referring to Linda publicly as my wife. I found it so hard saying that for the longest time,” Feargha says. “So many times, when our names were put together, they assumed Feargha was a typo and would put ‘l’ at the end. So it would be Fergal and Linda. It is funny how people do all sorts of mental gymnastics to be able to accommodate the idea of two women with children being married.” Pointing to rollbacks in LGBTQ+ rights in Italy, Hungary and the US, they share concerns for the legal and personal safety of queer couples around the world. Ireland’s vote for marriage equality has been “life changing” for them, Linda says. “Before we met, we didn’t know we could have a life like this.” Joey Kavanagh moved from Co Meath to London the year before the referendum, from where he led the emigrant voting campaign Get the Boat 2 Vote – “a spur-of-the-moment thing that then became a very big part of my life” – which saw tens of thousands of young Irish citizens travelling home from abroad to vote for marriage equality. “It was only in the 48 hours coming up to the referendum that it really became clear that it was a big deal. There were people coming from Australia and Canada and all parts of the world to cast their vote. It was a really cool thing to be part of.” He remembers “feeling ecstatic” celebrating the result at Dublin Castle. “It felt like a watershed moment, a breakthrough after decades of hard-won fights by people who had been campaigning for this and turning out for protests and rallies and marches … It forced a lot of really difficult but useful conversations, and from that emotion and sharing of stories came some catharsis.” [ Marriage equality a decade on: ‘Things have gone backwards’Opens in new window ] Just a few weeks later, he was in the queue for a nightclub in Soho when he met Australian Liam Karma, who was coming to the end of a two-year visa and getting ready to return home to Melbourne. After a few months together, the relationship became a long distance one until shortly before their Irish wedding day three years later. On June 29th, 2018 – “the hottest day of the year” – they tied the knot and held a prom-themed wedding party at the Commercial Rowing Club in Islandbridge in Dublin 8. “It wasn’t a traditional wedding,” says Liam, whose mother joined them from Australia for the celebrations. “Dublin Pride was on the 30th so that was essentially day two of our wedding,” adds Joey. “A friend was working on PR for Dublin Bus and she got me and Liam and 15 of our friends on one of the buses. So we got to be in the Pride parade.” While “it does feel like queerness has been normalised in Ireland and it feels different to when I was growing up”, Joey says, “we‘re not in as hopeful a place at the moment, like the pendulum has swung and we‘re seeing very regressive moves, particularly around trans rights.” The couple now live with their two cats, Mog and Dagen, in Dublin 7. “We have no plans to adopt human children but these are our babies.” Joey works for the Arts Council and Liam is a store manager; he was granted Irish citizenship in December. On their first date in 2016, after hitting it off during a night out in Belfast’s Union Street Bar, James McConville told Paul Corcoran “that we were going to get married”. Three years later they celebrated their wedding at Ballyvolane House in Fermoy, Co Cork, not far from where they now live. On August 17th, 2019, James, an entrepreneur from Belfast, and Paul, a Cork native who works in tech support, held their marriage ceremony in a barn. Paul is a solemniser with Pagan Federation Ireland. “For me, the word pagan is equivalent to being spiritually queer. It is having a sense of your own agency and autonomy, still working within a community, but you kind of get to make the rules up as you go along,” he says. When it was his turn to be on the other side of the altar, he wanted to incorporate some pagan traditions. “We had all the chairs arranged in two concentric circles, with a central altar. A circle was cast around the space and we consecrated the circle with water and fire. We both come from Catholic families so that sort of ceremony with smells and bells is something they’re all very comfortable with.” The couple want to start a family, but “it’s not as easy for us, as gay men,” says James. “We looked at the adoption route and we were told by someone in Tusla that it was near impossible, because of the legislation in place at the minute. To be told that because of who we are we wouldn’t be able to adopt, it did feel like we were second-class citizens.” Paul recounts the intensity of the period leading up to the referendum in 2015. “I remember the last two weeks, I was working in a cafe in Galway and we were surrounded by the No campaign posters. I walked to work with my head down.” Afterwards, he describes feeling huge relief; “There was a huge shift in my head because everyone that I looked at, I thought, you probably voted Yes.” Ten years later, emotions are still high. “I was in a shop the other day and that Snow Patrol song Just Say Yes came on, and I started crying.” Val Tataru and Max Plamadeala met at their local nightclub in Moldova 16 years ago and their relationship quickly blossomed. The couple moved to Dublin together six years ago. Having grown up in Moldova and worked for some time in Russia, both countries where same-sex marriage is illegal, Ireland’s new law was the deciding factor in their move. “What attracted us here was the referendum, to be honest … we were in need of that security,” says Val, who was encouraged by the 62 per cent Yes vote. “This says something about the country and the friendliness of the people here.” I was somehow shocked how normal it felt to be able to go to the registry office and do it officially When Val and Max moved to Ireland, they house-shared with another gay couple who encouraged them to attend Dublin Pride. Although apprehensive, they agreed to go to the parade. It was “a completely different experience” for Val, who was more accustomed to “something like a very small manifestation in a nightclub, which was not advertised” in Moldova. “I saw another side to the world where you don’t have to hide ... That was probably the moment when I felt liberated from my fears. And from then on, we were never afraid to hold hands in public.” On May 24th, 2019, the couple were married in front of friends and family in Dublin. “It was a nice ceremony, full of tears ... I was somehow shocked how normal it felt to be able to go to the registry office and do it officially.” For Val, marriage means safety and peace of mind. “You feel like you are protected. I know my husband will be able to visit me in hospital and have the possibility to make decisions for me, should I be unable to.” It also opens the door for other “steps that you usually take in your life, such as buying a house”, because they can do so as a couple here. “It empowered us to feel included in society. We have the same rights as everyone else.” Actors Shane O’Reilly and Paul Curley met while acting in a show together with Kilkenny Barnstorm Theatre Company in 2009. Shane is also a playwright and Paul is a children’s theatre maker. “I was playing a giant and Paul was playing Jack in a version of Jack and the Beanstalk, so Jack and the giant got together in this story,” says Shane. “Under the stars beside this astonishing lake, he asked me to marry him,” he adds, recalling Paul’s romantic proposal in New Zealand 16 years later. The pair opted to get married in City Hall, Dublin, on January 29th this year. As well as its association with the referendum celebrations, the location was meaningful for Shane’s father “who worked for Dublin City Council his whole life as a carpenter”. “He did his initial exams and his introduction to Dublin through that room in City Hall.” Shane’s parents are both deaf so there were a lot of sign language and visual elements integrated into the day. “Then we headed over to Fallon and Byrne and ate and drank and danced the night away.” [ ‘It’s better than a dig in the face’: LGBT employees on how the workplace became more accepting ] The day the Yes result was announced is one that remains “seared into your consciousness”, says Shane, who vividly remembers “driving out of the city with this enormous sense of celebration behind us as we headed towards Galway,” where they were going to see a friend’s show. At Paul’s family home in east Galway, there is a series of wedding photographs tracing lineage from his great grandparents to his parents. “It’s always been something I’ve looked at when having dinner there and thought, God, what a beautiful legacy of people who have gotten married. They are like totems of this family,” says Shane, who feels secure in the fact that he and Paul now share the same status. For Paul, his wedding ring is “more than a symbol, it’s a real recognition of our commitment and life together”, which he is reminded of every time he puts the ring back on after performing on stage. Ireland AM presenter Alan Hughes and theatre producer Karl Broderick met on the street in Dublin on September 20th, 1993. “We got on the same bus,” Karl remembers. “The number 28. Alan asked for my number and got off in Fairview, and I got off in Artane, and the next day he phoned and we met that night.” Their first date was in The Yacht in Clontarf, a few weeks after legislation was passed decriminalising homosexuality in Ireland. Karl recalls the discomfort they felt on the date, thinking they could bump into people they knew. “But there was a thriving gay scene in Dublin, even at that stage. There were bars like the South William and the Viking and the George,” Alan recalls. “People were protective and looked out for each other.” Twenty-three years later, Alan and Karl celebrated their civil partnership at the Unitarian Church on St Stephen’s Green in 2011. They threw a “lavish” wedding party in the Mansion House which attracted a lot of media coverage, including a cover story for VIP Magazine. “We felt a huge responsibility to every gay person out there,” Karl says. As a presenter on Irish breakfast TV, Alan has always been open about his sexuality. “From day one I always talked about Karl. I was on breakfast TV 25 years ago in Ireland as an openly gay man.” Following an on-screen proposal after the referendum, the couple were married on September 30th, 2016 at a “low-key” ceremony. Just Alan’s brother Kevin and Karl’s sister Ann – who also took the photographs - were present as witnesses. “The four of us went to the registry office in Bray, got lunch in Powerscourt Hotel and were in the spa by 4pm.” Reflecting on the decade anniversary of the referendum, Karl says “younger people need to know where we come from and never forget that we stand on the shoulders of giants. We’re lucky with the time we’re in. If we think of history as one line made up of pencil dots, we’re in that pencil dot where it became okay. That’s huge. People who went before us couldn’t live the life they were meant to live.” Alan believes there has been a marked shift towards acceptance overall, highlighting interactions with fans of the couple’s annual pantomime. “Thousands of people come to see our panto every year and they know me and they know I’m gay, they know Karl is my husband. That’s a lovely reflection on society, and acceptance.” But more needs to be done, he says: “Ten years on, we need to reset the focus. Things are getting bad again and we need to start spreading the word that love is love.” Sarah McDevitt was 32 when she came out in September 2013. The following St Patrick’s Day, she met Geraldine Stone, and exactly a year later the couple got engaged on Streedagh Beach in Co Sligo, near where Sarah grew up, the day after her mother‘s 60th birthday celebrations. It was March 2015, two months before the referendum. “At that point we were planning to get civil partnered; we weren’t getting married. That wasn’t even a possibility,” Sarah says. When they booked Kilronan Castle in Co Roscommon for their wedding reception that December, the couple “didn’t know Roscommon was going to vote No and that we‘d end up being the first people to get married there after marriage equality”, says Sarah. “The morning of the results, I went wedding dress shopping because I thought that was the best way to deal with the nerves.” Sarah and Geraldine and their four children – Lochlan, Grayson, Willow and Cooper – now live in Killester in north Dublin. Sarah works in advertising and Geraldine in telecommunications. They took it in turns carrying and giving birth to each child. Sharing this experience, Sarah says, has made them “stronger as a couple”. “You can be a lot more empathetic to your partner.” A prominent campaigner for LGBTQ+ parental rights, Sarah says the fight for equality is not over, as the Children and Family Relationships Act, passed in April 2015 to expand parental rights and responsibilities to non-traditional families, still excludes gay men with children. “When we had Lochlan, it wasn’t enacted,” she says, referring to the Children and Family Relationships Bill. “Before we even started IVF, we were writing to Simon Harris [asking] ‘When is it going to happen?’ [ LGBT families in Ireland still caught in legal loopholeOpens in new window ] “When he [Lochlan] was born, I was a single parent because there was no way that Ger could be on the birth certificate ... Ger couldn’t make any decisions for him. It was like she was a total stranger to him, even though she was raising him … that was really painful.” The scope of the legislation widened in May 2020 to include co-parenting legal recognition for certain same-sex female couples, says Sarah, though in her view it remains “very limited”. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Watch These IonQ Price Levels After Quantum Stock Soared 37% on Thursday

IonQ (IONQ) shares surged Thursday to lead quantum computing stocks higher as the company’s CEO said it aims to become the Nvidia (NVDA) of quantum computing. CEO Niccolo de Masi told Barron’s in an interview that the company is “in the business of quantum just like Nvidia and Broadcom (AVGO) are in the business of classical GPUs,” asserting that he believes IonQ will be the Nvidia player. The remarks come after D-Wave Quantum (QBTS) earlier this week announced the launch of its next gen quantum computer, known as Advantage2, underpinning bullish sentiment across Wall Street’s latest hottest sector. IonQ shares jumped 37% to $45.79 on Thursday, pushing the stock into positive territory for 2025. The shares have more than doubled from their early-April lows and have risen more than five fold over the last year, as investors bet that quantum computing will revolutionize areas like drug discovery, cybersecurity, and finance. Below, we take a closer look at IonQ’s chart and apply technical analysis to identify price levels that investors will likely be watching. After finding support at the closely watched 200-day moving average, IonQ shares trended higher within a rising wedge before staging a volume-backed breakout above the pattern in Thursday’s trading session. While the relative strength index confirms bullish price momentum with a reading above the 70 threshold, the indicator also flashes overbought conditions that could trigger short-term profit-taking. Let’s identify two key overhead areas on IonQ’s chart to watch amid the stock’s recent buying and also locate support levels worth monitoring during potential retracements. The first overhead area to watch sits around $55. Investors who have accumulated shares during the rising wedge could look for exit points at this level near the stock’s all-time high. To forecast an upside price target above the all-time high, investors can use the bars pattern tool. When applying the technique to IonQ’s chart, we extract the price bars comprising the stock’s uptrend from November to January and reposition them from today’s breakout point. This analysis projects a target of around $100, about 120% above Thursday’s closing price. We selected this prior move higher as it commenced following a one-day gain of around 35%, similar to Thursday’s percentage change. It's also worth noting that trend played out over 40 trading days, meaning a similar move from the current breakout could last until late July if price action rhymes. During retracements in the stock, investors should initially monitor the $28 level. This area on the chart finds support from the nearby rising 50-day MA and a horizontal line that connects a range of trading activity on the chart extending back to last November. Finally, selling below this level could see IonQ shares revisit lower support around $18. Investors may seek buying opportunities in this location near the late-October peak and early-March trough.

Title: “The future of retail”: Walmart eliminates 1,500 jobs to replace with AI

Brooke Sjoberg In recent years, many large companies have chosen to embrace automated intelligence to help produce leaner, more efficient operations at the corporate level. For the most part, this has mostly occurred in the technology sector at companies like Microsoft, as well as Google and Amazon. A total of about 61,000 technology sector jobs have been caught in the crossfire of layoffs in the wake of companies adopting AI. But it’s not just tech companies, as retail businesses have entered the chat. Even the company known for the smiling faces of its door greeters has fallen to AI use. That’s right—the company known for literal smiley faces as part of its branding in the early aughts has announced it will lay off 1,500 of its employees at the corporate level. Most of these positions are concentrated in the Bentonville, Arkansas, and Hoboken, New Jersey hubs, as reported by FingerLakes1.com. According to reporting on the issue from FingerLakes, the Bentonville-headquartered company is choosing to restructure to “sharpen focus” and embrace automation. The cuts were described by Walmart U.S. CEO John Furner and Global Chief Technology Officer Suresh Kumar in a joint letter to employees as necessary for building the “future of retail,” FingerLakes reports. “We are eliminating roles as well as opening some new ones aligned with our business priorities and growth strategy,” the memo shared with employees reads. The use of automated intelligence in the retail space has become a hot-button issue for many retailers. Just as Walmart has made its intention to use AI in corporate roles public, Starbucks has elected to “go slow” on its rollout of AI and focus on higher staffing. Notably, Amazon began using AI-powered audio product summaries to help shoppers learn more about other customers’ experiences. On the customer-facing side of operations, Walmart is also reportedly preparing for shoppers to use AI to build grocery lists and potentially make purchasing decisions for them. As the company catches heat amid national conversations about tariffs, company officials have reportedly confirmed that the retailer will absorb some of the cost increase, as well as pass a portion of it to consumers. Regarding layoffs, impacted employees will receive support in this transition, representatives of Walmart said, as reported by FingerLakes. Despite the cuts, the company said it would likely be adding positions related to AI and “digital transformation.” Internet culture is chaotic—but we’ll break it down for you in one daily email.

Title: The Istanbul kabuki – decoded

Editor Empire Pepe Escobar, Strategic Culture Foundation The endgame is clear: the US losing the entire Eurasian land mass. Ukraine, under these immense geopolitical imperatives, is only a sovereign-deprived pawn in the (Great) Game. Did President Putin really change the game by proposing the resumption of negotiations on the proxy war in Ukraine in Istanbul – over three years after the first ones were scotched by NATO? It’s complicated. And depends on which “game” we’re talking about. What the Russian move instantly accomplished was to throw into total disarray the European warmongering Three Stooges (Starmer, BlackRock chancellor, Le Petit Roi) Cocaine Express. Irrelevant Europe was not even at the table in Istanbul – except via extensive previous briefing of the low-rent, shabby-dressed Ukrainian delegation. That was compounded by the noisy barking threat in the sidelines advocating “more sanctions” to “pressure Russia”. In March 2022 in Istanbul, Kiev could have stopped the war. Every one of us who were in Istanbul at the time could foresee that Kiev would eventually have to be forced to the table all over again. So in essence we are back to the same negotiation – with the same top Russian negotiator, competent historian Vladimir Medinsky, heading a delegation composed by pros, but with Ukraine now facing over a million dead; deprived of at least four regions – more on the way; what’s left of its mineral wealth de facto controlled by the US; and a horrendous black hole that passes for an “economy”. We are talking about country 404 territory. During the negotiations on Friday, Medinsky went straight to the point: “We don’t want war, but we are ready to fight for a year, two, three – as long as it takes. We fought with Sweden for 21 years [the Great Northern War, 1700-1721, as it is known in Russia]. How long are you ready to fight?” That’s the geopolitical/military state of things for Kiev and their “to the last Ukrainian” warmongering backers: either you capitulate, or we’re going to hurt you even more. What’s the point of these negotiations? Turkiye under uber-opportunist Sultan Erdogan in fact hosted a P.R. meeting between Moscow, Kiev and itself – with the Ukrainians unleashing a blitzkrieg of infantile tantrums only designed to influence global public opinion. In sharp contrast, the head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, Kirill Dmitriev, did his best to put a positive spin on the proceedings. Istanbul 2.0, Dmitriev asserted, achieved a large exchange of prisoners (1,000 on each side); ceasefire options to be presented by both sides; and a continuation of dialogue. That’s not much. Well, at least they discussed in the same language: Russian. Nothing was lost in translation. A serious case can be made that to propose the resumption of these negotiations, under this format, was meaningless. There’s no evidence in the horizon both parties might touch the fundamental issue anytime soon: the whole geopolitical strategic equation in Eastern Europe, from the Barents Sea to the Black Sea and beyond – leading to an “indivisibility of security” new deal with global repercussions. That implies that whatever track these negotiations may follow further on down the road, they are an objective impossibility. Meanwhile, the proxy war in Ukraine – and the SMO – will go on. That would also suggest that the Moscow security establishment considers the neo-nazi instrumentalized goons in Kiev at best as a re-enactment of the 6th Army of Paulus, with which you negotiate the end of a battle, but not the end of the war. Even NATO semi-realists as retired Commodore Steven Jermy have been forced to admit that “Russia is in the driving seat” and clueless Europeans “appear to believe that the losers should dictate the terms of ceasefire or surrender.” All the barking by the – European – chihuahuas of war cannot disguise the fundamental geopolitical/military fact: a massive NATO humiliation. Trump’s humongous problem is that he has to manage it – and sell it to domestic public opinion and the global public opinion as some sort of “deal” he struck with Putin. It’s enlightening once again to go back to Grandmaster Lavrov, always the uber-realist, back in September 2024: “In April 2022, Russian and Ukrainian negotiators reached agreement in Istanbul. If that agreement had been observed, Ukraine would have preserved part of Donbass. But every time another agreement, always accepted by Russia, is broken, Ukraine shrinks in size.” The (Great) Game, revisited Now back to the (Great) Game. Kiev negotiators eventually admitting Ukrainian capitulation means a NATO capitulation and an Empire of Chaos capitulation. That’s the ultimate anathema for the US ruling classes. Even an ultra-negotiated, carefully managed Ukrainian surrender will be an impossible sell – not to mention Washington under Narcissus Drowned Trump acknowledging a strategic defeat. Because that will mean the Empire of Chaos losing Eurasia for good: the ultimate Mackinder/Brzezinski nightmare. Coupled with the consequential solidification of the multi-nodal, multipolar world. The Russia-China stategic partnership is very much aware of every nook and cranny in this larger-than-life process. Beyond the current Turkish kabuki, they clearly understand the Big Eurasia Equation. Beijing is fully aware NATO’s real goal was always to confront it via Russia. Ukraine was NATO’s pawn to take down Russia then get to China from the West. The goal of the US ruling elites as they configured their thalassocratic empire remains to blockade China from the West by land and sea, using Russia; then use Taiwan as a staging area to blockade China from the East by sea. No wonder control of Taiwan is a Chinese strategic imperative. Enter Mackinder panic – all over again: the China-Russia strategic partnership can beat NATO hands down – and Russia, by itself, is already doing it. Xi and Putin once again discussed the chessboard in detail, in person, prior to the Victory Day parade last week in Moscow. The endgame, once again, is clear: the US losing the entire Eurasian land mass. Ukraine, under these immense geopolitical imperatives, is only a sovereign-deprived pawn in the (Great) Game. As for the tantrum-addicted clown in Kiev, he is merely an actor with no authority whatsoever, negotiations included. He is completely dominated by Ukrainian neo-Nazis who will kill him if and when the war is over. He merely fronts for them and gets paid off. And that’s why – enthusiastically supported by inconsequential London, Paris and Berlin – he’s obsessed to continue a Forever War destroying the very nation he claims to represent.

Shares of quantum computing companies rocketed higher Thursday, led by IonQ (IONQ), whose chief executive said it aims to become the Nvidia (NVDA) of quantum computing. IonQ shares popped close to 37% after CEO Niccolo de Masi said in an interview with Barron’s that his company is “in the business of quantum just like Nvidia and Broadcom are in the business of classical GPUs,” adding “I believe IonQ will be the Nvidia player." "There will be other people that copy us and follow us; they have always copied and followed us,” de Masi reportedly said. Meanwhile, D-Wave Quantum (QBTS) stock jumped 24%. The company on Tuesday had unveiled its newest quantum computer, sending shares higher earlier in the week. CEO Alan Baratz said D-Wave’s machine, known as Advantage2, “marks a significant milestone not just for D-Wave, but for the quantum computing industry as a whole.” Rigetti Computing (RGTI) also rose Thursday, adding 26%, while Quantum Computing (QUBT) climbed more than 14%.

Title: New SSA chief praises DOGE for ‘making things better’

Frank Bisignano, commissioner of Social Security Administration, arrives to testify at his Senate Finance Committee confirmation hearing at the Dirksen Senate Office Building on March 25, 2025 in Washington, DC. Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images Stay Connected By Natalie Alms The Social Security Administration’s new commissioner, Frank Bisignano, told managers in a meeting yesterday that he represents “consistency” and “stability” for the agency and that the presence of the Department of Government Efficiency at SSA has been a good thing. “Social Security is not going anywhere,” Bisignano said during the meeting, which Nextgov/FCW obtained a recording of, promising to improve morale at the agency while acknowledging recent “turmoil.” A new entrant to government service, having spent his prior career in the financial services industry, Bisignano told attendees at the meeting that he had to Google his new job when he was offered it. “I looked up like, I’ll be honest,” he said. “I’m like, what the heck's the Commissioner of Social Security?” “So I’m Googling Social Security. One of my great skills, I’m one of the great Googlers on the East coast. Put that as the headline for the Post,” he told managers at the meeting, during which he frequently noted his desire to prevent news leaks. “One of my main jobs is not having newspaper articles saying we’re a problem,” said Bisignano. An SSA official said Bisignano was “clearly” making a joke about needing to Google the responsibilities of his position. The Senate confirmed him earlier this month despite accusations that he’d lied during his confirmation hearing. Democrats cited his reputation for cutting workforces in the private sector in their opposition to his nomination. “Commissioner Bisignano’s proven success in the financial services industry uniquely positions him to lead the Trump Administration’s commonsense efforts to modernize the agency and improve its efficiency,” Liz Huston, a White House spokesperson, told Nextgov/FCW after it reached out to SSA for comment. The career finance executive spoke Wednesday about his intentions concerning further workforce cuts, the use of technology at the agency and more. His tenure follows months of upheaval at SSA, which has indeed placed the agency in the news for customer service problems. Recently, the agency reversed an anti-fraud policy that was slowing down retirement processing and hurting customer service after it found essentially no fraud. That policy was put in place after leaders at the Department of Government Efficiency and White House repeated false and misleading claims about SSA phone lines being riddled with fraud. Bisignano defended DOGE during the meeting, telling employees that, “your bias has to be — because mine is — [that] DOGE is helping make things better.” “It may not feel that way, but don’t believe everything you read,” he added. Related articles SSA tech shop to be led by another DOGE associate SSA weighs axing payments to 170,000 beneficiaries SSA has also been reassigning staff across the agency, moving many to the front lines. It has also made draft plans to cut its workforce by thousands, even as its staffing was already at a 25-year low in fiscal 2022. Many staff have already left the agency through the administration's deferred resignation program or early retirement. “I have no intent to RIF people,” he said Wednesday, using the acronym for reduction in force, a government term for layoffs. But he didn’t rule out further cuts. “If I wake up and we can do all our work with 20,000 people — which I can't see that right about now — well, then we'll be 20,000. If I wake up and see, we need 80,000, we'll be 80,000,” he said. “I gotta determine what the right staffing level is. But nobody asked me to come do this job and RIF people.” The agency announced plans in February to shrink its workforce to 50,000 employees, down from about 57,000, first through voluntary departures and then through layoffs. Downsizing the federal workforce has been a priority for the Trump administration. An SSA official told Nextgov/FCW that Bisignano is visiting offices and meeting employees to hear their ideas for how the agency can better serve customers in-person, on the telephone and online. The new commissioner said that technology and automation are top priorities, arguing that SSA needs to use artificial intelligence on high-labor tasks, move off of paper and push people to do things online instead of come into SSA offices. He pointed to the lengthy disability determination process as one where “there’s a ton of things that AI can apply to move it along faster.” Right now, it takes applicants about seven months to get an initial decision for disability benefits. People who appeal that decision wait another eight months, and those that request a hearing wait over nine months. Thirty thousand people died waiting for their benefit determinations in fiscal 2023, Nextgov/FCW previously reported. The disability policy landscape is extremely complicated, making it difficult to administer, and the agency has also gotten less funding over the last decade. “Tech’s got to be the great enabler, right,” said Bisignano. “We’re going to invest.” Jack Smalligan, who formerly worked at the Office of Management and Budget and recently helped write a report on SSA and AI, and is also a senior policy fellow at the Urban Institute, previously told Nextgov/FCW that AI could help the agency. But the technology also comes with risks like bias and staffing reductions, which could push the agency to use tools that aren’t ready, he warned. “I think we should get a lot more done on the web,” Bisignano told managers. “You’re competing with experiences that people have on Amazon.” “I mean, the best thing that could happen is we answer the phone in one minute, a lot of it through technology. We turned around our claims, whether they were disability or retirement, at much different speed, right? Our web was unbelievable,” he said. The agency previously shuttered the office that had overhauled the SSA website, putting employees on administrative leave. SSA later brought some of those staff back, installing them elsewhere throughout the agency.

Title: Bill Gates Could've Been The Worlds First Trillionaire

Time Published: 2025-05-22T20:30:00Z
Full Content:
I am a long term buy and hold investor who focuses on dividend growth stocks Bill Gates is one of the founders of software giant Microsoft (MSFT). Before Microsoft went public in 1986, he held 11,222,000 shares in the company. He owned 49.20% of it. He sold a portion of his stake at the IPO, and has been regularly and consistently been reducing his stake in Microsoft for the past 38 years. This is how the stock price did since the IPO: Many of the funds have been allocated through his private family office, and have been diversified away. Much of the funds have also found their way to his charitable arm, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has worked on eradicating a variety of issues around the world (e.g. polio). The money has done a lot of good. It's still fascinating to think about how much this stake would have been worth, had he not sold anything, and kept all shares. For the sake of simplicity, I would assume that all dividends received were not reinvested. Otherwise, the numbers get even higher, but messier too. While his ownership of the float would have likely remained around 50%, after accounting for issuance of stock options and restricted stock units to employees, with dividends reinvested he could've been in a hypotetical situation where his ownership is more than 100%. Which of course is impossible. You can view the trend in shares outstanding for Microsoft between 1990 and 2025 here (adjusted for stock splits): The stock has gone through nine stock splits since its IPO in 1986. This also means that his 11,222,000 shares from 1986 would have turned to 3,231,936,000 shares today. At the current share price of $455/share, this translates into a net worth of almost $1.5 trillion dollars. This means that Bill Gates would have been the world's first trillionaire. He would have also been richer than the richest people in the world today. These are the four richest people in the world today, according to Forbes: Instead, he's worth "only" $115 billion today, and is number 12 on the list of the world's richest people. Of course, this is mostly a discussion with a lot of hindsight bias. Back in 1986, Bill Gates did not really know how the next 38 years would unfold. It could have been very likely that Microsoft did not survive or if it did, it did not deliver the amazing returns it did. In general, it makes sense to diversify your investments in order to protect yourself from unknown risks. It's also a good idea to give back and help those in need. My take-away from this story is that I should keep my winners for as long as possible, and not diworsify away any potential. While I start my strategy with a diversified exposure to a large group of entities that fit my criteria, I do believe that the key to building long-term wealth is to let winners run. When auditing my investment decisions, I realized that selling too early was one of my biggest mistakes. In other words, you want to water the flowers and cut the weeds. If you sell out those future wealth builders too early, you may not make a lot of money in your strategy overall. Since you do not really know which of your portfolio holdings will be the best performing ones over the next 40 years, it makes sense to avoid too much turnover and selling them prematurely. Higher turnover is associated with a higher potential for making a mistake, and increasing costs. That being said, it's also good to have some diversification as well. After all, things could have gone wrong for his net worth, if Microsoft had not performed as it did. The company had to work hard to endure the changes in the business and tech world for decades, and thrive as well. But as we all know, different paths could have led to different outcomes as well.

Title: Kraken to offer tokenized securities, including Apple, Tesla, and Nvidia, to customers outside the U.S

Time Published: 2025-05-22T20:20:00Z

U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange, Kraken Partners, has partnered with Backed, a leading issuer of tokenized stocks, and the Solana Foundation to bring tokenized U.S. equities to investors worldwide. According to a company press release, Backed will initially deploy SPL-based digital representations of U.S.-listed stocks (including Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA)) and ETFs on the Solana blockchain. These tokenized assets will soon be available to eligible Kraken clients in select non-U.S. markets directly through the Kraken app. Under the Trump administration, the regulatory environment has become more favorable for companies like Kraken. In March, Trump’s SEC dismissed its case against crypto exchange Kraken, which was accused of combining the roles of an exchange, broker, dealer, and clearing agency without registering securities. Matthew Ruley, director of content for dypto-crypto, a crypto information site, said that by offering assets in non-U.S. markets, Kraken is doing some “alpha testing” so they’re ready to go the second they’re given the green light to begin in the United States. Meanwhile, Dave Weisberger, co-founder at crypto strategy firm CoinRoutes said Kraken’s move is one more way to make crypto available to the masses. “It brings fully transparent access to investing in U.S. stocks to all geographies Kraken operates in. It likely will be available at a much lower cost than GDRs (Global depository receipts) which are offered institutionally today,” Weisberger said, adding that, if successful, this may be seen as the first step towards the mass tokenization of equities. And if that happens, Weisberger predicts lower trading costs, improved liquidity and streamlined operational functions. Other stakeholders also lauded the news. “This is a big moment. Tokenized stocks on Solana mean everyday investors can finally access U.S. equities without being gated by geography, legacy systems, or slow settlement,” says Mike Cahill, CEO of Doura Labs. Cahill says that Kraken and Backed are pushing the market forward by proving that public equities can move at internet speed. “It goes way beyond more efficient—this is about making it more open, accessible, and real-time.” — Vinamrata Chaturvedi contributed to this article.

May 22, 2025 16:12 ET | Source: Robbins LLP Robbins LLP SAN DIEGO, May 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Robbins LLP reminds stockholders that a class action was filed on behalf of all purchasers of Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) common stock between April 18, 2024 and October 16, 2024. Elevance is a healthcare company that, among other things, provides health insurance plans to a variety of markets. For more information, submit a form, email attorney Aaron Dumas, Jr., or give us a call at (800) 350-6003. The Allegations: Robbins LLP is Investigating Allegations that Elevance Health, Inc. (ELV) Failed to Disclose the Impact Medicaid Redetermination Would Have on its Business Prospects According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the Medicaid redetermination process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the risk and cost profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid programs. While Defendants acknowledged that Medicaid expenses were rising, they repeatedly assured investors that this was adequately reflected in the Company’s guidance for the year. Defendants further reassured investors that “we’re intentionally remaining thoughtful and prudent in our outlook,” and that, while the Company was seeing an acuity mix shift in the Medicaid business, it was “nothing outside of the bounds of what we’ve expected and guided for.” In truth, the redeterminations were causing the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members to rise significantly, as sicker patients with higher acuity tended to remain on Medicaid after redetermination, leading to higher per-patient costs. This shift was occurring to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations with the states or in its financial guidance for 2024. On July 17, 2024, the Company revealed that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population, including in outpatient home health, radiology, durable medical equipment, as well as some elective procedures.” In response to these disclosures, the price of Elevance common stock declined by $32.21 per share, or 5.8%, from a closing price of $553.14 on July 16, 2024, to a closing price of $520.93 on July 17, 2024. What Now: You may be eligible to participate in the class action against Elevance Health, Inc. Shareholders who want to serve as lead plaintiff for the class are required to file their papers with the court by July 11, 2025. The lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. You do not have to participate in the case to be eligible for a recovery. If you choose to take no action, you can remain an absent class member. For more information, click here. All representation is on a contingency fee basis. Shareholders pay no fees or expenses.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) threw their weight behind an antitrust lawsuit against major asset managers that alleges the firms colluded to tank coal production with their embrace of zero-emissions goals on Thursday morning. The lawsuit, led by Paxton and backed by ten other state attorneys general, alleges that BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street collusively used their market power to suppress coal production, thereby burdening consumers by causing the price of coal to skyrocket. The Trump FTC and the DOJ filed a statement of interest on Thursday supporting the attorneys general’s lawsuit, signaling the administration’s view that the firms’ so-called “environmental, social and corporate governance” (ESG) investing may fall afoul of antitrust law. “President Donald Trump understands the importance of coal for our energy security and has vowed to fight left-wing ideologues who seek to make us weaker and poorer under the guise of ESG,” said FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson. “Today, the Federal Trade Commission carries out this administration’s mission to unleash American energy dominance, protect coal, and stop the left’s attempt to corrupt financial markets with political and social objectives.” (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Attorney General Ken Paxton Sends Warning To Companies Using ESG Practices) Larry Fink, Chairman and CEO of BlackRock visits “The Claman Countdown” at Fox Business Network Studios on April 11, 2025 in New York City. (Photo by Jamie McCarthy via Getty Images) “These companies allegedly blocked the production of American coal in the name of climate change scaremongering, all so they could take money out of the pockets of American consumers and put it in theirs,” Ferguson continued. The FTC and DOJ are taking action following Trump’s day-one energy emergency declaration and his April 8 executive order, which directed federal agencies to “encourage and support our Nation’s coal industry to increase our energy supply, lower electricity costs, stabilize our grid, create high-paying jobs, support burgeoning industries, and assist our allies.” “The President has declared a national energy emergency, and we need competition in coal production now more than ever to help fuel American energy dominance,” said Assistant Attorney General Abigail A. Slater of the DOJ’s Antitrust Division. “American consumers suffer when institutional asset managers use shareholdings in competing companies to orchestrate output reductions.” BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard are three of the world’s largest asset managers. All three were members of the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative until Vanguard dropped out in December 2022 and BlackRock exited the coalition in January. The DOJ and FTC’s “support for this baseless case undermines the Trump Administration’s goal of American energy independence,” a BlackRock spokesperson wrote to the Daily Caller News Foundation. “As we made clear in our earlier motion to dismiss, this case is trying to re-write antitrust law and is based on an absurd theory that coal companies conspired with their shareholders to reduce coal production. Forcing asset managers to divest from coal companies will harm their ability to access capital and invest in their businesses and employees, likely leading to higher energy prices.” “These asset managers, which have been acting as an ESG climate cartel have not only deceived investors but also harmed millions of American families by raising costs and contributing to record inflation,” executive director of Consumers’ Research Will Hild wrote to the DCNF. “Not only does the FTC and DOJ agree that the investments made were driven by a radical, political objective, but go directly against President Trump’s energy goals.” The White House, the FTC, Paxton’s office, Vanguard and State Street did not respond to the DCNF’s requests for comment.

Back then, the price of the leading cryptocurrency stood at next to nothing, with the asset trading from $0.001 to a high of $0.29 at the end of the year, and was only available on a handful of niche exchanges. Fast-forward 15 years, and BTC just hit a new high of $111,770 Thursday afternoon, according to CoinGecko. That record price means 10,000 BTC today is worth over $1.1 billion, or 2,726,000,000% more than the $41 paid for the two Papa John's pies on Bitcoin Pizza Day. Bitcoin Pizza Day celebrates the time that Hanyecz wrote on a Bitcoin forum asking if someone would send him food in exchange for 10,000 BTC. "I'll pay 10,000 Bitcoin for a couple of pizzas… like maybe 2 large ones so I have some left over for the next day," he posted on May 22, 2010. "If you're interested, please let me know and we can work out a deal," he added. A fellow Bitcoiner responded to Hanyecz, taking him up on the offer. It's worth noting that the Papa John's restaurant did not accept cryptocurrency, and someone bought the pizzas and sent them to Hanyecz's house using dollars in exchange for the 10,000 BTC. But the story is marked every year for one of the first known times Bitcoin was used to buy something—and a startling reminder of how much the price of BTC has surged over the last 15 years. Since then, the price of the digital coin has endured several booms and busts, and is no longer just a tool used by people to buy drugs on dark web marketplaces or reimburse strangers for long-distance pizza orders. Crypto exchanges are now available across the globe, and institutions have jumped in headfirst, with Bitcoin exchange-traded funds managed by the likes of Wall Street giants BlackRock and Fidelity allowing customers to get exposure to the cryptocurrency. The U.S. government even has a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the works, thanks to President Trump's recent executive order—with the idea to hold the cryptocurrency like it does with other assets, such as gold. Still, Bitcoin was created as an alternative to fiat currency and the traditional banking system, so one could send and receive money without going through a middleman. And despite the fast rise of the digital asset, it still isn't easy to spend Bitcoin on pizza or other real-world items. Things might be changing—albeit slowly—after American fast food chain Steak 'n Shake announced last week that customers could use the cryptocurrency to buy burgers. The move is unusual, though, and most restaurants still don't accept the big orange coin. While some businesses do accept BTC payments, many Bitcoiners are indeed reluctant to spend the money given its growing status as a store-of-value asset and its sizable long-term gains. Given how much the value of Hanyecz's BTC grew in the 15 years since he swapped 10K worth for a couple pizzas, it’s easy to see why Bitcoiners wouldn’t want to repeat his feat.

Title: Musk Adviser May Make as Much as $1 Million a Year While Helping to Dismantle Agency that Regulates Tesla and X

Time Published: 2025-05-22T18:00:59Z
Full Content:
Legal Issues This story was originally published by ProPublica. Republished under a CC BY-NC-ND 3.0 license. One of Elon Musk’s employees is earning between $100,001 and $1 million annually as a political adviser to his billionaire boss while simultaneously helping to dismantle the federal agency that regulates two of Musk’s biggest companies, according to court records and a financial disclosure report obtained by ProPublica. Ethics experts said Christopher Young’s dual role — working for a Musk company as well as the Department of Government Efficiency — likely violates federal conflict-of-interest regulations. Musk has publicly called for the elimination of the agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, arguing that it is “duplicative.’’ Government ethics rules bar employees from doing anything that “would cause a reasonable person to question their impartiality” and are designed to prevent even the appearance of using public office for private gain. Court records show Young, who works for a Musk company called Europa 100 LLC, was involved in the Trump administration’s efforts to unwind the consumer agency’s operations and fire most of its staff in early February. Young’s arrangement raises questions of where his loyalty lies, experts said. The dynamic is especially concerning, they said, given that the CFPB — which regulates companies that provide financial services — has jurisdiction over Musk’s electric car company, Tesla, which makes auto loans, and his social media site, X, which announced in January that it was partnering with Visa on mobile payments. The world’s richest man has in turn made no secret of his desire to do away with the bureau, posting just weeks after Donald Trump’s election victory, “Delete CFPB. There are too many duplicative regulatory agencies.” “Musk clearly has a conflict of interest and should recuse,” said Claire Finkelstein, who directs the Center for Ethics and the Rule of Law at the University of Pennsylvania. “And therefore an employee of his, who is answerable to him on the personal side, outside of government, and who stands to keep his job only if he supports Musk’s personal interests, should not be working for DOGE.” Young, a 36-year-old Republican consultant, has been active in political circles for years, most recently serving as the campaign treasurer of Musk’s political action committee, helping the tech titan spend more than a quarter billion dollars to help elect Trump. Before joining Musk’s payroll, he worked as a vice president for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the trade association representing the pharmaceutical industry’s interests, his disclosure shows. He also worked as a field organizer for the Republican National Committee and for former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, the New York Times reported. Young was appointed a special governmental employee in the U.S. Office of Personnel Management on Jan. 30 and dispatched to work in the CFPB in early February, according to court records and his disclosure form. Someone with his position could be making as much as $190,000 a year in government salary, documents obtained by Bloomberg show. At the same time, Young collects a salary as an employee of Musk’s Texas-based Europa 100 LLC, where, according to his disclosure report, his duties are to “advise political and public policy.” Beyond that description, it’s not clear what, exactly, Young does at Europa 100 or what the company’s activities are. It was created in July 2020 by Jared Birchall, a former banker who runs Musk’s family office, Excession LLC, according to state records. The company has been used to pay nannies to at least some of Musk’s children, according to a 2023 tabloid report, and, along with two other Musk entities, to facilitate tens of millions of dollars in campaign transactions, campaign finance reports show. As a special government employee, Young can maintain outside employment while serving for a limited amount of time. But such government workers are still required to abide by laws and rules governing conflicts of interest and personal and business relationships. Cynthia Brown, the senior ethics counsel at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which has sued the administration to produce a range of public records documenting DOGE’s activities, said that Young’s government work appears to benefit his private sector employer. “Which hat are you wearing while you’re serving the American people? Are you doing it for the interests of your outside job?” she asked. In addition to his role at Europa 100, Young reported other ties to Musk’s private businesses. He affirmed in his disclosure form that he will “continue to participate” in a “defined contribution plan” sponsored by Excession, the Musk home office, and that he has served since February as a “vice president” of United States of America Inc., another Musk entity organized by Birchall, where he also advises on “political and public policy,” the records show. While he lists the latter among “sources of compensation exceeding $5,000 in a year,” the exact figure is not disclosed. Young did not return a call and emails seeking comment. The CFPB, DOGE and the White House did not respond to requests for comment. Musk didn’t respond to an email seeking comment, and Birchall didn’t return a call left at a number he lists in public formation records. A lawyer who helped form United States of America Inc. hung up when reached for comment and hasn’t responded to a subsequent message. Asked about how his business interests and government work may intersect, Musk said in a February interview that, “I’ll recuse myself if it is a conflict.” The revelation of Young’s apparent violation of federal standards of conduct follows a series of ProPublica stories documenting how another DOGE aide helped carry out the administration’s attempts to implement mass layoffs at the CFPB while holding as much as $715,000 in stock that bureau employees are prohibited from owning — actions one expert called a “pretty clear-cut violation” of the federal criminal conflict-of-interest statute. The White House has defended the aide, saying he “did not even manage” the layoffs, “making this entire narrative an outright lie.” A spokesperson also said the aide had until May 8 to divest, though it isn’t clear whether he did and the White House hasn’t answered questions about that. “These allegations are another attempt to diminish DOGE’s critical mission,” the White House said. Following ProPublica’s reporting, the aide’s work at the CFPB ended. Last Monday, a group of 10 good government and consumer advocacy groups, citing ProPublica’s coverage, sent a letter to the acting inspector general of the CFPB, asking him to “swiftly investigate these clear conflicts of interest violations of Trump Administration officials acting in their own personal financial interest.” ProPublica has identified nearly 90 officials assigned to DOGE, though it’s unclear how many, if any, have potential conflicts. Government agencies have been slow to release financial disclosure forms. But Finkelstein said the cases reported by ProPublica call into question the motivation behind DOGE’s efforts to undo the consumer watchdog agency. “It matters because it means that the officials who work for the government, who are supposed to be dedicated to the interests of the American people, are not necessarily focused on the good of the country but instead may be focused on the good of themselves, self enrichment, or trying to please their boss by focusing on enriching their bosses and growing their portfolios,” she said. Unionized CFPB workers have sued the CFPB’s acting director, Russell Vought, to stop his attempts to drastically scale down the bureau’s staff and its operations. Since taking office, the Trump administration has twice attempted to fire nearly all of the agency’s employees, tried canceling nearly all of its contracts and instituted stop-work mandates that have stifled virtually all agency work, including investigations into companies, ProPublica previously reported. The parties will appear before an appeals court this Friday for oral arguments in a case that will determine just how deeply Vought can cut the agency while still ensuring that it carries out dozens of mandates Congress tasked it with when lawmakers established the bureau in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The court records produced in the litigation offer a window into the role Young played in gutting the CFPB during the administration’s first attempt to unwind the bureau beginning in early February. He was dispatched to the CFPB’s headquarters on Feb. 6, just two days after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, then the agency’s acting director, told the staff and contractors to stop working. The following day, Young and other DOGE aides were given access to nonclassified CFPB systems, court records show. That same day, Musk posted “CFPB RIP” with a gravestone emoji. On Feb. 11 and 12, Young was included on emails with top agency officials. One of those messages discussed the cancellation of more than 100 contracts, an act that a contracting officer described in a sworn affidavit as including “all contracts related to enforcement, supervision, external affairs, and consumer response.” Another message involved how to transfer to the Treasury Department some of the more than $3 billion in civil penalties that the bureau has collected from companies to settle consumer protection cases, a move that could deny harmed consumers compensation. A third discussed the terms of an agreement that would allow for the mass layoff of staffers, court records show. In his financial disclosure form, which he signed on Feb. 15, Young listed his employment by Musk’s Europa 100 as active, beginning in August 2024 through the “present.” Then, in early March, as the legal fight over the administration’s cuts played out before a federal judge, Young sent the CFPB’s chief operating officer a message about forthcoming firings, known as a “reduction in force,” or RIF, in government parlance. In the email, he asked whether officials were “prepared to implement the RIF” if the judge lifted a temporary stay, according to a March district court opinion that has for the moment stopped most of the administration’s proposed cuts. In addition to his employment, Young’s disclosure presents another potential conflict. He also lists owning as much as $15,000 in Amazon stock, a company that is on the bureau’s “Prohibited Holdings” list. Agency employees are forbidden from having such investments, and ethics experts have said that participating in an agency action that could boost the stock’s value — such as stripping the CFPB of its staff — constitutes a violation of the criminal conflict-of-interest statute. Young hasn’t responded to questions about that either.

The most innocent explanation is that it’s named after one of the moon’s of Jupiter. Somewhat less innocent is that it refers to the literal embodiment of Zeus’s horniness.

Title: Tech giants Nvidia, OpenAI and others join forces for massive UAE Stargate AI data center

A group of global tech giants gathered in Abu Dhabi to pose for a photo as an AI supergroup, including OpenAI’s Sam Altman, Oracle’s (ORCL) Larry Ellison, Nvidia’s (NVDA) Jensen Huang, and Chuck Robbins of Cisco (CSCO), along with their new UAE partners. They were gathered to launch Stargate UAE, an AI infrastructure 1-gigawatt compute cluster located in the Persian Gulf country. This comes a week after President Trump visited the region and signed an agreement to build the largest AI campus outside the U.S., with a total 5-gigawatt capacity, of which Stargate will be a part. The Trump deal would also give the UAE access to advanced Nvidia chips, as many as 500,000, according to Reuters. In the closing days of the Biden administration, it contemplated denying the country access to American chips due to UAE’s close ties with China. In particular, key Stargate partner G42 was considered a serious security threat by the CIA in 2023. Trump’s team had no such concerns. G42 CEO Peng Xiao said in the press release that “this initiative is about building a bridge —rooted in trust and ambition — that helps bring the benefits of AI to economies, societies, and people around the world.” Stargate UAE is an extension of a project announced in January by OpenAI with Microsoft (MSFT) and others, as a massive investment in AI infrastructure. OpenAI’s Sam Altman said it would also “provide strategic capability to protect the national security of America and its allies.” One of the many funders in the American Stargate is the UAE fund MGX. Microsoft was not listed as a partner in the UAE campus. Stargate U.S. plans to invest $500 billion over the next four years building new AI infrastructure in America. No price tag has yet been attached to the UAE campus. The facility, spanning 10-square miles in Abu Dhabi, will “be powered by nuclear, solar, and natural gas to minimize carbon emissions,” said the press release.

Russ Choma, Dan Friedman, and Tim MurphyMay 22, 2025 Illustrations by James Clapham Illustrations by James Clapham Eight years ago, if you wanted to line the first family’s pockets, your choices—while ethically unprecedented—were limited. There was only so much you could spend on hotel rooms or Mar-a-Lago fundraisers. Fortunately for foreign governments, megacorporations, and anyone else with an agenda, the Trumps have diversified. “It’s a whole different scale than it was in 2017,” observes Noah Bookbinder, president of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, who says President Donald Trump and his underlings “seem to believe that the American people don’t care. They’re not making much of an effort to hide any of this stuff.” A post shared by Mother Jones (@motherjonesmag) The options for paying tribute to the president, his kin, and the MAGA movement are now legion. There are even exciting new opportunities to protect your business by reaching a “settlement” with the leader of the free world. Or you can just hand over a 747 for him to use as Air Force One, as Qatar did. Best of all, these creative funding methods might not even be against the law—especially for Trump. (Thanks, SCOTUS!) So here’s your guide to participating in the brave new Trumpworld of executive enrichment. As the “Bitcoin orange” Trump-branded watches ($799) indicate, the 47th commander in chief is the “Crypto President.” Last year, Trump rolled out his own crypto firm, called World Liberty Financial. After Trump won, crypto investor Justin Sun bought $75 million worth of WLF tokens, with more than $50 million of that potentially going to the Trumps, according to Bloomberg. Shortly after Trump took office, the Securities and Exchange Commission—which had accused Sun of fraud in a federal complaint—agreed to pause its lawsuit while the parties pursued a “potential resolution.” That was one of more than a dozen lawsuits and investigations targeting crypto firms that the SEC reportedly backed off from after Trump took office. Foreign governments can get in on the action, too. A state-backed United Arab Emirates firm, for instance, recently agreed to use a Trump-affiliated digital coin in a multibillion-dollar deal—a move that, according to the New York Times, could hand the Trump family hundreds of millions of dollars. Savvy investors can also purchase $TRUMP, a meme coin the president launched just before his inauguration. A billion $TRUMP coins will ultimately be made available, though a company affiliated with the Trumps will own many of them—so if demand causes the price to rise, the Trumps theoretically get wealthier. The coin’s value rocketed past $70 before inauguration, then immediately crashed. But in April, it ticked up to more than $15—after the coin’s official website offered dinner with Trump at his DC-area golf club and a “VIP White House Tour” to the top $TRUMP holders. (The White House tour offer quickly disappeared following an uproar.) This week, Sun identified himself as the top $TRUMP investor. He declared his excitement to attend the president’s “Gala Dinner as his TOP fan” and “discuss the future of our industry.” Sun now holds $18.6 million worth of $TRUMP, according to CNBC. If you can’t match that, don’t worry: $MELANIA coins go for less than a buck. This is a simple one—you don’t even have to invest in $TRUMP coins. Business leaders can now simply pay $5 million for one-on-one meetings with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, Wired reported. If that’s too rich for your blood, there’s a cheaper option—donors can pony up $1 million each for a small-group “candlelight dinner” with the president. “This exorbitant level of payment for presidential access raises serious concerns about the possibility of corruption by candlelight,” Jon Golinger, a transparency advocate with Public Citizen, told USA Today. For those who recall the five-alarm scandal generated in the ’90s when the Clinton administration rewarded major campaign donors with overnight stays in the Lincoln Bedroom—well, clearly, that was a more innocent time. Trump’s ethical outrages are so numerous and brazen that these meals have barely registered a blip. The dinners are organized by MAGA Inc., a super-PAC that backed Trump’s 2024 campaign—and that also has spent tens of millions of dollars to cover Trump’s personal legal expenses. A “source with direct knowledge of the dinners,” however, told Wired that “it’s all going to” Trump’s future presidential library. Then again, the $400 million Qatari jet supposedly will, too. Trump has turned his vendettas against law firms that cross him into executive orders that threaten their ability to operate. When firms have fought back, judges have blocked Trump’s “unprecedented attack” on the rule of law. But some of the country’s wealthiest firms have made a different choice—accepting humiliating “settlements” with the president and promising tens of millions of dollars in free legal work for causes he supports. Paul Weiss was the first to capitulate, agreeing to provide $40 million in pro bono work in support of what Trump described as “the Administration’s initiatives.” From there, the price skyrocketed. Skadden inked a preemptive deal for at least $100 million in free legal work. Then five more firms cut deals for $100 million to $125 million apiece. Trump hopes to “use these very prestigious firms to help us out” on projects ranging from his trade war to protecting the coal industry. “Big Law continues to bend the knee to President Trump because they know they were wrong, and he looks forward to putting their pro bono legal concessions toward implementing his America First agenda,” Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, has said. For years, Trump has filed lawsuits over news coverage he dislikes. Many of these cases have been thrown out of court. But after the 2024 election, some of the world’s most powerful media companies decided to fork over millions of dollars rather than fight back. It began in December, when Disney agreed to give $15 million to Trump’s presidential library foundation to settle a dubious defamation claim against ABC News. Then Meta, Facebook’s parent company, agreed to pay its own $25 million library tribute to settle a lawsuit Trump brought after the platform banned him following the January 6 insurrection. “It looks like a bribe and a signal to every company that corruption is the name of the game,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren tweeted. X—now controlled by Elon Musk—soon followed, settling a similar case for $10 million. Paramount executives reportedly believe that settling a Trump lawsuit against CBS, which it owns, would ease the path to a lucrative merger with Skydance. Paramount, which so far hasn’t surrendered, called the case an “affront to the First Amendment…without basis in law or fact” in a March court filing. Trump is also leveraging his control of the Federal Communication Commission to demand “the maximum fines and punishment” for CBS. “They should lose their license!” he declared. In a letter to Paramount’s chairperson Monday, Warren and other lawmakers charged that the company appears to be trying to settle the lawsuit and “moderating the content of its programs” in an effort to win FCC approval for the merger. “If Paramount officials make these concessions,” the lawmakers wrote, it might amount to an illegal “quid pro quo.” When the Washington Post spiked an already written Kamala Harris endorsement last year, its owner, Jeff Bezos, wanted to make one thing clear: There was “no quid pro quo.” Yes, he acknowledged, the head of Blue Origin—a Bezos company that competes for billions in government contracts—met with Trump the day the paper killed the editorial. But that was just an unfortunate coincidence. “When it comes to the appearance of conflict, I am not an ideal owner of the Post,” Bezos conceded. “Every day, somewhere, some Amazon executive or Blue Origin executive, or someone from the other philanthropies and companies I own or invest in is meeting with government officials.” Indeed. In December, after Melania Trump had pitched a documentary about herself to Amazon’s film studio, Bezos had dinner with the incoming first couple, according to the Wall Street Journal. Amazon later agreed to pay a whopping $40 million to license the film; 70 percent of that goes directly to Melania. An Amazon spokesperson said the dinner “was separate from any discussions” about the film. “We licensed the upcoming Melania Trump documentary film and series for one reason and one reason only—because we think customers are going to love it,” the spokesperson said. Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kusher advised his father on Middle Eastern matters during the president’s first term, with questionable results. But that work likely helped Kushner win hundreds of millions of dollars from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and a United Arab Emirates fund for a private equity firm he launched after leaving the White House. Kushner’s company, Affinity Partners, also landed lucrative development deals with the governments of Serbia and Albania. He’s building a luxury Trump- branded property in a former Yugoslav Ministry of Defense building, empty since NATO bombed it in 1999. And in Albania, Kushner plans to construct a luxury resort on an island once used as a military outpost. Those deals were reportedly brokered by Richard Grenell, who forged ties with both governments while serving as Trump’s special envoy in the Balkans. Both countries want US help joining the European Union despite long-standing corruption challenges, among other issues. Grenell is now Trump’s envoy for special missions, a global portfolio that could make him a valuable friend for any enterprising foreign government. When he took office in 2017, Trump refused to relinquish ownership of his business empire, which offered obvious opportunities for those with means to enrich him. That hasn’t changed. He still owns nine hotels, 18 golf courses, four commercial real estate properties, six estates, and a real estate brokerage. In his first term, these properties took in tens of millions in revenue—including a $15.8 million condo sale to a woman linked to Chinese military intelligence and a $13.5 million mansion sold to an Indonesian politician and businessman (who is developing two Trump golf resorts). Trump no longer owns the Washington, DC, hotel that served as a clubhouse for Republican lobbyists and foreign leaders in his first term. But Trump’s other hotels—like one in New York that saw a huge revenue boost in 2018 hosting the entourage of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman—are still going strong. The Trump Org says it plans to open 10 new properties, including a hotel in the UAE’s Dubai and a golf resort in Oman. The White House claims the Trump family’s businesses don’t create conflicts of interest because “the president’s assets are in a trust managed by his children.” But that trust isn’t blind, so the president can still know who’s helping him—and his kids—get richer. Sure, you could buy a club membership and some Trump-branded golf accessories. But if you really want to help out the president, bring him a whole tournament. That’s what Turkish Airlines—in which the Turkish government controls a 49 percent stake—did when it hosted a tournament at Trump’s course outside DC during his first year in office. After the January 6 coup attempt, the PGA distanced itself from Trump. But the Saudi sovereign wealth fund–owned league LIV Golf rushed to embrace Trump, hosting numerous tournaments at his courses around the United States. The latest took place in April at Trump’s National Doral Golf Club in Miami—just as Trump’s tariffs were crashing the stock market. Trump claims the tournaments are “peanuts” to him financially, but industry experts say each one is a multimillion-dollar deal for his businesses. In a deposition in 2023, Trump bragged that he could sell his Turnberry course in Scotland to LIV Golf for “a fortune,” though he declined to say whether such an offer had actually been made. Trump isn’t the first president to accept corporate contributions for his inauguration, but the scale is unprecedented. Meta and Amazon weren’t shy about their huge donations of $1 million each—the public obsequiousness was the point. Pilgrim’s Pride, owned by a subsidiary of Brazilian meat company JBS, gave $5 million. In April, JBS—which has a history of scandals and legal problems—won SEC approval to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, a longstanding company goal that the agency had previously blocked. A spokesperson for JBS told Forbes that the inaugural donation was not related approval of the stock listing. Syngenta—an agribusiness giant that is owned by a Chinese government–controlled firm and is currently fighting a Federal Trade Commission lawsuit—kicked in $250,000. In February, the SEC dropped a lawsuit against crypto platform Coinbase, which gave $1 million to Trump’s inauguration. Coinbase, Pilgrim’s Pride, and the SEC didn’t respond to questions from Mother Jones; Amazon noted it also gave to Joe Biden’s inauguration, and Syngenta said it works “with both sides of the aisle.” The money helped Trump—who reportedly kept close tabs on who paid up—raise more than $200 million for lavish inaugural events. Any surplus can be transferred to a political committee or his eventual presidential library. Inaugural committees also offer opportunities for presidential enrichment. In 2022, for example, Trump’s previous inaugural committee paid $750,000 to settle a lawsuit accusing it of overpaying Trump properties that hosted events. While serving as a Trump Org executive, the president’s eldest son has also launched a series of anti-woke ventures. He’s a partner at 1789 Capital, which invests in conservative companies, and he’s slated to join the board of online firearms retailer GrabAGun. Don Jr. doesn’t have an official White House job, but he’s touted his influence over administration personnel decisions and MAGA politics. He recently traveled, twice, to Serbia—where Kushner and the Trump Org are developing a hotel—and lent his support to the country’s embattled president. For moguls who aren’t ready to do a deal with Don Jr., there’s now a more direct way to send him and his business partners money—an exclusive, invite-only DC club called “Executive Branch” that reportedly costs more than a half-million dollars to join. The plan, according to Politico, is “to ensure the C-suite crowd can mingle with Trump advisers and cabinet members without the prying eyes of the press and wanna-be insiders.” Arthur Schwartz, an adviser to Don Jr., downplayed his influence in the White House but declined to respond in greater detail when asked whether his activities create ethical problems. “Write your ridiculous story.

Title: Trump Admin Throws Weight Behind Lawsuit Alleging Wall Street Embraced ESG To Shut Down Coal

Skip to comments. Posted on 05/22/2025 9:30:27 AM PDT by george76 Brief represents the first time the Trump administration has weighed in on green investing issues.. The Federal Trade Commission is throwing its weight behind a high-profile federal lawsuit led by 12 Republican-led states accusing three of the world's largest asset managers—BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard—of artificially constricting the coal market in violation of U.S. antitrust laws, the Washington Free Beacon has learned. The filing in the case is a remarkable move that represents the first time the Trump administration has waded directly into an issue or case related to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) policies. Led by powerful asset managers and banks, the ESG movement broadly calls for investors to pull money away from traditional energy industries, like coal and oil, and divert it to green energy industries in the fight against global warming. "Competition in coal markets incentivizes companies to produce as much coal as the market demands," the FTC stated in its Thursday brief. "Allowing the marketplace to freely determine the intersection of supply and demand is thus critical to America’s energy security and economic dynamism." "This case is about alleged anticompetitive conduct that increased energy prices for ordinary American consumers and businesses," it continued. The case dates back to November when Texas attorney general Ken Paxton filed a complaint alongside 11 other states, accusing defendants of violating century-old antitrust laws by collectively acquiring substantial ownership stakes in every major coal company in the country before using their newfound influence to pressure the industry to adopt climate goals like cutting coal output in half by 2030. Paxton said those actions have contributed to rising electricity prices. Coal-fired power currently generates less than 15 percent of the nation's total electricity, down from the 33 percent it generated a decade ago, according to federal data. In that same time period, the average price of electricity has steadily increased. In its brief Thursday, filed in the District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, the FTC made clear its interest in protecting Americans from anticompetitive behavior that "reduces the production of domestic energy, raises energy prices for consumers and businesses, and undermines America’s energy dominance." The brief clarified that antitrust laws allow for passive fund investing and that the federal government does not intend to argue otherwise. The case, however, is about the coordinated use of the power to distort output and prices in energy markets, the commission wrote. Paxton's complaint alleged that BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard ultimately deceived thousands of investors "who elected to invest in non-ESG funds to maximize their profits" but whose money was used to pursue ESG strategies. "The President has declared a national energy emergency, and we need competition in coal production now more than ever to help fuel American energy dominance," Abigail Slater, the assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s antitrust division, said in a statement. "American consumers suffer when institutional asset managers use shareholdings in competing companies to orchestrate output reductions." Texas's complaint accuses defendants of violating the Sherman Act and Clayton Act. Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, West Virginia, and Wyoming joined as plaintiffs. "This is great news for the case and for the country because it helps validate the arguments that Ken Paxton's office and the other states have been making," Will Hild, the executive director of watchdog group Consumers Research and a prominent critic of ESG policies, said in an interview. "What I really hope to see coming out of this is these companies acknowledging that they messed up and figuring out how they're going to make it right for American consumers in these states and then promising never to do it again," he continued. "But I think the pressure is really building in a monumental way." BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The court is expected to rule on the defendants' motion to dismiss in the coming weeks. A hearing on the motion is slated for early June. Critics of the ESG movement say it seeks to improperly boost politically favored green industries that aren't profitable at the expense of more profitable energy industries. In doing so, they argue, ESG policies harm American investors—asset managers that have a legally-mandated fiduciary duty to promote the wellbeing of clients whose money they manage. Citing those arguments, several GOP states like Texas and lawmakers have taken action to block ESG policies nationwide. "Woke corporations are collectively adopting and imposing progressive policy goals that American consumers do not want or do not need," Rep. Jim Jordan (R., Ohio), the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said in 2022 after he launched a sweeping antitrust investigation into Wall Street over ESG. ESG efforts proliferated on Wall Street in recent years, with major financial institutions, including the defendants in Texas's case, joining large net zero coalitions designed to marshal initiatives pushing public companies to reduce their carbon emissions. And the Biden administration itself introduced ESG-related policies at the Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Labor. President Donald Trump's electoral victory, however, dealt a crippling blow to the ESG movement and, as a result, Wall Street largely backtracked from its previous efforts. For example, the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, a high-profile international coalition whose membership included some of the world's largest banks, suspended operations in January after BlackRock withdrew for unspecified legal reasons. Texas referenced the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative in its November lawsuit, alleging that it was used by defendants to push their ESG objectives.

"The President has declared a national energy emergency, and we need competition in coal production now more than ever to help fuel American energy dominance," Abigail Slater, the assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s antitrust division, said in a statement. "American consumers suffer when institutional asset managers use shareholdings in competing companies to orchestrate output reductions." Texas's complaint accuses defendants of violating the Sherman Act and Clayton Act. Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, West Virginia, and Wyoming joined as plaintiffs. "This is great news for the case and for the country because it helps validate the arguments that Ken Paxton's office and the other states have been making," Will Hild, the executive director of watchdog group Consumers Research and a prominent critic of ESG policies, said in an interview. "What I really hope to see coming out of this is these companies acknowledging that they messed up and figuring out how they're going to make it right for American consumers in these states and then promising never to do it again," he continued. "But I think the pressure is really building in a monumental way." BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The court is expected to rule on the defendants' motion to dismiss in the coming weeks. A hearing on the motion is slated for early June. Critics of the ESG movement say it seeks to improperly boost politically favored green industries that aren't profitable at the expense of more profitable energy industries. In doing so, they argue, ESG policies harm American investors—asset managers that have a legally-mandated fiduciary duty to promote the wellbeing of clients whose money they manage. Citing those arguments, several GOP states like Texas and lawmakers have taken action to block ESG policies nationwide. "Woke corporations are collectively adopting and imposing progressive policy goals that American consumers do not want or do not need," Rep. Jim Jordan (R., Ohio), the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said in 2022 after he launched a sweeping antitrust investigation into Wall Street over ESG. ESG efforts proliferated on Wall Street in recent years, with major financial institutions, including the defendants in Texas's case, joining large net zero coalitions designed to marshal initiatives pushing public companies to reduce their carbon emissions. And the Biden administration itself introduced ESG-related policies at the Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Labor. President Donald Trump's electoral victory, however, dealt a crippling blow to the ESG movement and, as a result, Wall Street largely backtracked from its previous efforts. For example, the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, a high-profile international coalition whose membership included some of the world's largest banks, suspended operations in January after BlackRock withdrew for unspecified legal reasons. Texas referenced the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative in its November lawsuit, alleging that it was used by defendants to push their ESG objectives.

"Allowing the marketplace to freely determine the intersection of supply and demand is thus critical to America’s energy security and economic dynamism." "This case is about alleged anticompetitive conduct that increased energy prices for ordinary American consumers and businesses," it continued. The case dates back to November when Texas attorney general Ken Paxton filed a complaint alongside 11 other states, accusing defendants of violating century-old antitrust laws by collectively acquiring substantial ownership stakes in every major coal company in the country before using their newfound influence to pressure the industry to adopt climate goals like cutting coal output in half by 2030. Paxton said those actions have contributed to rising electricity prices. Coal-fired power currently generates less than 15 percent of the nation's total electricity, down from the 33 percent it generated a decade ago, according to federal data. In that same time period, the average price of electricity has steadily increased. In its brief Thursday, filed in the District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, the FTC made clear its interest in protecting Americans from anticompetitive behavior that "reduces the production of domestic energy, raises energy prices for consumers and businesses, and undermines America’s energy dominance." The brief clarified that antitrust laws allow for passive fund investing and that the federal government does not intend to argue otherwise. The case, however, is about the coordinated use of the power to distort output and prices in energy markets, the commission wrote. Paxton's complaint alleged that BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard ultimately deceived thousands of investors "who elected to invest in non-ESG funds to maximize their profits" but whose money was used to pursue ESG strategies.

The case, however, is about the coordinated use of the power to distort output and prices in energy markets, the commission wrote. Paxton's complaint alleged that BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard ultimately deceived thousands of investors "who elected to invest in non-ESG funds to maximize their profits" but whose money was used to pursue ESG strategies. "The President has declared a national energy emergency, and we need competition in coal production now more than ever to help fuel American energy dominance," Abigail Slater, the assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s antitrust division, said in a statement. "American consumers suffer when institutional asset managers use shareholdings in competing companies to orchestrate output reductions." Texas's complaint accuses defendants of violating the Sherman Act and Clayton Act. Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, West Virginia, and Wyoming joined as plaintiffs. "This is great news for the case and for the country because it helps validate the arguments that Ken Paxton's office and the other states have been making," Will Hild, the executive director of watchdog group Consumers Research and a prominent critic of ESG policies, said in an interview. "What I really hope to see coming out of this is these companies acknowledging that they messed up and figuring out how they're going to make it right for American consumers in these states and then promising never to do it again," he continued. "But I think the pressure is really building in a monumental way." BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The court is expected to rule on the defendants' motion to dismiss in the coming weeks. A hearing on the motion is slated for early June. Critics of the ESG movement say it seeks to improperly boost politically favored green industries that aren't profitable at the expense of more profitable energy industries. In doing so, they argue, ESG policies harm American investors—asset managers that have a legally-mandated fiduciary duty to promote the wellbeing of clients whose money they manage. Citing those arguments, several GOP states like Texas and lawmakers have taken action to block ESG policies nationwide. "Woke corporations are collectively adopting and imposing progressive policy goals that American consumers do not want or do not need," Rep. Jim Jordan (R., Ohio), the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said in 2022 after he launched a sweeping antitrust investigation into Wall Street over ESG. ESG efforts proliferated on Wall Street in recent years, with major financial institutions, including the defendants in Texas's case, joining large net zero coalitions designed to marshal initiatives pushing public companies to reduce their carbon emissions.

In doing so, they argue, ESG policies harm American investors—asset managers that have a legally-mandated fiduciary duty to promote the wellbeing of clients whose money they manage. Citing those arguments, several GOP states like Texas and lawmakers have taken action to block ESG policies nationwide. "Woke corporations are collectively adopting and imposing progressive policy goals that American consumers do not want or do not need," Rep. Jim Jordan (R., Ohio), the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said in 2022 after he launched a sweeping antitrust investigation into Wall Street over ESG. ESG efforts proliferated on Wall Street in recent years, with major financial institutions, including the defendants in Texas's case, joining large net zero coalitions designed to marshal initiatives pushing public companies to reduce their carbon emissions. And the Biden administration itself introduced ESG-related policies at the Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Labor. President Donald Trump's electoral victory, however, dealt a crippling blow to the ESG movement and, as a result, Wall Street largely backtracked from its previous efforts. For example, the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, a high-profile international coalition whose membership included some of the world's largest banks, suspended operations in January after BlackRock withdrew for unspecified legal reasons.

Title: Bitcoin Breaks Records as Market Value Hits Historic Peak – Here Are The Key Drivers
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hits-historic-peak/
Time Published: 2025-05-22T16:30:18Z
Full Content:
The crypto market recently witnessed a historic moment as Bitcoin, the largest digital asset, rallied hard to a new all-time high on Wednesday, triggering renewed optimism in the sector. After the milestone, BTC’s bullish performance has been analyzed and attributed to several key favorable conditions. Since gaining upward traction in April, the market value of Bitcoin has officially risen to a new all-time high of $111,867, surpassing its previous peak at the $109,241 level achieved during United States President Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20. The notable upsurge to a new peak marks a major turning point in the cryptocurrency’s development as a widely recognized financial instrument. However, this spike is being driven by a combination of strong variables rather than speculative hype. According to Santiment, a leading on-chain data platform, this milestone was reached just six weeks after the news of Trump’s tariffs caused the crypto sector to display extreme FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt). This is a clear example that crypto markets have often moved in the opposite direction of institutional whales’ capital and retail expectations. The on-chain platform has also taken a step to outline the key factors that supported the recent rally to a new all-time high. Aside from the tariffs being lowered and the 90-day truce between the US and China, a major factor behind the BTC’s rally highlighted by Santiment has been the increasing number of institutional investors. This heightened institutional interest has been observed among top asset management firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, Ark Invest, and others. Santiment noted that BlackRock’s interest is evidenced by the expansion of its BTC holdings through its Spot Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, which currently breached the $20 billion milestone. During the period, Fidelity and Ark Invest have also reported record inflows. BTC’s notable surge has triggered bullish sentiment in the sector. Due to ongoing tariff uncertainties and widespread jadedness, there has not been much FOMO, therefore, the path was paved for BTC to finally create history. Over time, Bitcoin has swiftly transformed from a speculative asset to a vital part of diversified investments. This is because of its increasing inclusion in the portfolios of significant asset managers and hedge funds. With the growing presence and crowd’s greed, Santiment is confident that BTC might surge to the $115,000 and $120,000 price range in the near future. Ali Martinez, a crypto analyst and trader, also predicted a continuation of the uptrend, claiming that BTC is entering price discovery. Given the robust performance so far, Martinez believes that the next key levels to watch include $116,000, $126,000, $136,000, and $148,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $110,834, demonstrating a nearly 9% increase in the past week. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that investors are capitalizing on the ongoing upward trend as BTC’s trading volume has risen sharply by more than 73% in the past day.

The offering, which covers more than 50 U.S.-listed stocks and exchange-traded funds, will be facilitated through a partnership with Backed, a firm specializing in tokenized securities, using the Solana blockchain to offer so-called xStocks, the company said. Tokenization refers to the process of taking real-world assets, whether stocks or bonds, and representing them on-chain using digital assets. Kraken said that stocks will be represented on Solana using SPL tokens, a token standard mirroring ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum. xStocks, which will be issued on a public blockchain, are expected to trade around the clock. According to Kraken, the exchange and Backed chose Solana as the first chain for xStocks because of its “unmatched performance, low latency and thriving global ecosystem.” However, the company said it will explore tokenized securities on other networks as well. “We’re reimagining equities investing and ushering in a new wave of demand from clients seeking better alternatives to the status quo,” Mark Greenberg, Kraken’s global head of consumer, said. “Access to traditional U.S. equities remains slow, costly, and restricted.” In April, Kraken began offering U.S.-listed stocks and ETFs to U.S.-based customers. The company says it is eyeing similar expansion in the UK, Europe, and Australia. The push comes as the exchange reportedly prepares for an initial public offering this year. Among traditional financial institutions, tokenization has several backers. In 2022, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink hailed the concept as the future of markets, saying that blockchain-based plumbing could yield near-instantaneous settlement and reduced fees. In the U.S., firms like Securitize have emerged as leaders in the tokenization space. The company manages BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) fund, which has a market capitalization of around $2.8 billion, according to analytics firm rwa.xyz. Collapsed crypto exchange FTX waded into the tokenization space in 2020, when it began offering tokenized stocks for marijuana firms. Binance had dabbled in tokenized securities as well, including offering a version of Coinbase’s stock, at one point. Tokenized stocks have a relatively nascent footprint compared to stablecoins or products like BUIDL. According to rwa.xyz, around $373 million worth of tokenized requites exist on-chain, namely Exodus Movement’s stock, which is issued by Securitize on the Algorand blockchain.

Good news – we are still waiting on final arrival of George Wilson, Phantom 34, and the Dark Shadows Paper Doll book (expected next week). We have always received the products before Diamond, before shipping out to their distribution center for fulfillment on their end. This is why those who ordered directly from us generally get their products before those elsewhere. Now for the bad news – if you ordered any of these titles or future titles from Amazon especially, or other sites, they will not be fulfilled for an undetermined amount of time as we look for a new distributor. As of now, the only way to get our books will be directly through our website. We know this isn't ideal for everyone, but it is the only current option while we work through this change. "If you are a comic book shop and want to get our products, please reach out to info@hermespress.com directly to discuss options on getting direct shipment and pricing from us. We want to help in any way we can as we know you are also moving through this transition and trying to fill orders. We need your help and support now, more than ever. We are still sending books to the printer and receiving products, and we plan to continue for a very long time. If you need to pre-order titles, especially those arriving in the near future, please do so at www.hermespress.com and use code MEMORIAL25 for 25% off your order, good through May 27 at 11:50 p.m. (est). We appreciate your support and look forward to getting books into your hands shortly. Please note there may be a delay in email responses as we work through shipping, we are a small team who loves what we do and sometimes it just takes a little time. Thank you for your patience. " Hermes Press exclusively produces books and comic strip reprints focusing on the art and artists of the comics, cartoon and comic strips, pulp magazines of the 1920s and 1930s, art books covering science fiction, and popular culture.

Kraken plans to list tokenized shares of Nvidia, Apple, Tesla and over 50 other U.S. stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the Wall Street Journal reported. The tokens, deployed on Solana SOL$177.56, will be known under the name “xStocks” and will be available to trade 24/7 for investors all across the world. Some of the ETFs that will be available to trade include the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), which tracks the S&P 500 index, and the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD). The stocks will be represented by real shares held by Backed Finance and can be redeemed 1:1 for their cash value. Kraken had announced the initial rollout of over 11,000 U.S.-listed stocks and ETFs in April, starting with 10 U.S. states and offered through Kraken Securities. This latest announcement expands Kraken’s offering to include tokenized versions of over 50 stocks and ETFs to customers outside of the U.S., starting with Europe, Latin America, Africa and Asia. The move puts Kraken in direct competition to platforms like Robinhood (HOOD) and makes it the first exchange to successfully offer tokenized shares of major U.S. stocks. Binance attempted to launch tokenized U.S. stocks in 2021 but canceled their plans eventually due to regulatory uncertainty. A Kraken spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal that the exchange is “actively working with various regulators” to ensure that xStocks can be offered legally in each jurisdiction as regulation varies. Tokenization, which turns real-world assets into blockchain tokens, has become the latest buzz word in crypto with more and more companies starting to enter the space. Some, including Ondo Finance, BlackRock and Franklin Templeton, have long been pioneers in the area, pushing their overall tokenization market to a $65 billion market cap as of May.

Image Credit: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com HONG KONG, May 22 (Reuters) – CK Hutchison confirmed on Thursday that Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte’s family-run MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company is the main investor in a group seeking to buy 43 ports from the Hong Kong conglomerate. Hutchison co-managing director Dominic Lai was speaking at the company’s annual general meeting following weeks of scrutiny and criticism in China of its proposal to sell most of its $22.8 billion global ports business to a consortium led by U.S. investment firm BlackRock. When asked if the Swiss-headquartered MSC shipping empire, which is controlled by the Aponte family, was the major investor, Lai said: “Yes, it has been from the beginning.” CK Hutchison has not previously disclosed the exact ownership of each investor in the consortium. Shipping Giant MSC Set to Become World’s Largest Terminal Operator in Hutchison Ports Deal MSC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Lai’s remarks. The sale of assets, which would include two ports along the strategically important Panama Canal, has become highly politicised at a time of intensifying U.S.-China trade tensions. In April, China’s top market regulator said it was paying close attention to CK Hutchison’s planned sale and that parties to the deal should not try to avoid an antitrust review. CK Hutchison, controlled by tycoon Li Ka-shing, said this month that the deal would strictly adhere to all required compliance standards. The proposed sale has also drawn the attention of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly expressed his desire to reduce Chinese influence around the Panama Canal and termed the deal a “reclaiming” of the waterway.

Title: Trump Admin Throws Weight Behind Lawsuit Alleging Wall Street Embraced ESG To Shut Down Coal
URL: https://freebeacon.com/energy/trump-admin-wades-into-esg-case-accusing-wall-street-of-shutting-down-coal-jacking-up-electric-prices/
Time Published: 2025-05-22T15:52:02Z
Full Content:
The Federal Trade Commission is throwing its weight behind a high-profile federal lawsuit led by 12 Republican-led states accusing three of the world's largest asset managers—BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard—of artificially constricting the coal market in violation of U.S. antitrust laws, the Washington Free Beacon has learned. The filing in the case is a remarkable move that represents the first time the Trump administration has waded directly into an issue or case related to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) policies. Led by powerful asset managers and banks, the ESG movement broadly calls for investors to pull money away from traditional energy industries, like coal and oil, and divert it to green energy industries in the fight against global warming. "Competition in coal markets incentivizes companies to produce as much coal as the market demands," the FTC stated in its Thursday brief. "Allowing the marketplace to freely determine the intersection of supply and demand is thus critical to America’s energy security and economic dynamism." "This case is about alleged anticompetitive conduct that increased energy prices for ordinary American consumers and businesses," it continued. The case dates back to November when Texas attorney general Ken Paxton filed a complaint alongside 11 other states, accusing defendants of violating century-old antitrust laws by collectively acquiring substantial ownership stakes in every major coal company in the country before using their newfound influence to pressure the industry to adopt climate goals like cutting coal output in half by 2030. Paxton said those actions have contributed to rising electricity prices. Coal-fired power currently generates less than 15 percent of the nation's total electricity, down from the 33 percent it generated a decade ago, according to federal data. In that same time period, the average price of electricity has steadily increased. In its brief Thursday, filed in the District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, the FTC made clear its interest in protecting Americans from anticompetitive behavior that "reduces the production of domestic energy, raises energy prices for consumers and businesses, and undermines America’s energy dominance." The brief clarified that antitrust laws allow for passive fund investing and that the federal government does not intend to argue otherwise. The case, however, is about the coordinated use of the power to distort output and prices in energy markets, the commission wrote. Paxton's complaint alleged that BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard ultimately deceived thousands of investors "who elected to invest in non-ESG funds to maximize their profits" but whose money was used to pursue ESG strategies. "The President has declared a national energy emergency, and we need competition in coal production now more than ever to help fuel American energy dominance," Abigail Slater, the assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s antitrust division, said in a statement. "American consumers suffer when institutional asset managers use shareholdings in competing companies to orchestrate output reductions." Texas's complaint accuses defendants of violating the Sherman Act and Clayton Act. Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, West Virginia, and Wyoming joined as plaintiffs. "This is great news for the case and for the country because it helps validate the arguments that Ken Paxton's office and the other states have been making," Will Hild, the executive director of watchdog group Consumers Research and a prominent critic of ESG policies, said in an interview. "What I really hope to see coming out of this is these companies acknowledging that they messed up and figuring out how they're going to make it right for American consumers in these states and then promising never to do it again," he continued. "But I think the pressure is really building in a monumental way." State Street did not immediately respond to request for comment. "The DOJ and FTC’s support for this baseless case undermines the Trump administration’s goal of American energy independence," a BlackRock spokesman said in a statement. "As we made clear in our earlier motion to dismiss, this case is trying to re-write antitrust law and is based on an absurd theory that coal companies conspired with their shareholders to reduce coal production. Forcing asset managers to divest from coal companies will harm their ability to access capital and invest in their businesses and employees, likely leading to higher energy prices." "The underlying lawsuit contorts the law in a way that will hurt individual investors, and Vanguard will continue to defend our long history of safeguarding and promoting long-term investment returns on behalf of Vanguard-advised funds and their investors," added a Vanguard spokesman. The court is expected to rule on the defendants' motion to dismiss in the coming weeks. A hearing on the motion is slated for early June. Critics of the ESG movement say it seeks to improperly boost politically favored green industries that aren't profitable at the expense of more profitable energy industries. In doing so, they argue, ESG policies harm American investors—asset managers that have a legally mandated fiduciary duty to promote the wellbeing of clients whose money they manage. Citing those arguments, several GOP states like Texas and lawmakers have taken action to block ESG policies nationwide. "Woke corporations are collectively adopting and imposing progressive policy goals that American consumers do not want or do not need," Rep. Jim Jordan (R., Ohio), the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said in 2022 after he launched a sweeping antitrust investigation into Wall Street over ESG. ESG efforts proliferated on Wall Street in recent years, with major financial institutions, including the defendants in Texas's case, joining large net zero coalitions designed to marshal initiatives pushing public companies to reduce their carbon emissions. And the Biden administration itself introduced ESG-related policies at the Securities and Exchange Commission and Department of Labor. President Donald Trump's electoral victory, however, dealt a crippling blow to the ESG movement and, as a result, Wall Street largely backtracked from its previous efforts. For example, the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, a high-profile international coalition whose membership included some of the world's largest banks, suspended operations in January after BlackRock withdrew for unspecified legal reasons. Texas referenced the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative in its November lawsuit, alleging that it was used by defendants to push their ESG objectives.

Title: Microsoft is racing to build an AI ‘agent factory’
URL: https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/672598/microsoft-ai-agent-factory-jay-parikh-interview
Time Published: 2025-05-22T15:51:43Z
Full Content:
An interview with Microsoft’s new CoreAI chief. by Tom Warren When Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella ran into Meta’s former engineering chief, Jay Parikh, at a conference last summer, he had the future of AI top of mind. The pair have known each other for around 15 years, but this meeting was different, and Nadella called Parikh shortly after bumping into him to dig into what was really on his mind. “We were chatting about the future and chatting about all the stuff he needs to do here and that the team needs to do around AI,” Parikh, now head of Microsoft’s CoreAI team, tells The Verge. “That’s when he said, ‘Hey, why don’t you come join and help me transform the company around all of this AI stuff?’” Nadella regularly talks about Microsoft being part of a new AI era, but he now wants the company to overhaul how it builds software to meet this new era head-on. Parikh, who transformed Facebook engineering teams, now leads a transformation that he describes as building an AI “agent factory” for Microsoft’s customers. ”I described this agent factory idea to Bill [Gates], not knowing that he and Paul [Allen] described Microsoft 50 years ago as the software factory,” Parikh says. “Just like how Bill had this idea of Microsoft being a bunch of software developers building a bunch of software, I want our platform, for any enterprise or any organization, to be able to be the thing they turn into their own agent factory.” In essence, this idea of an AI agent factory is Microsoft’s way of redefining its platform that businesses around the world already rely on and finding a coherent way to leverage the best bits of GitHub, Copilot, Azure AI Foundry, and even Azure to let businesses “build their own factory to build agents,” Parikh says. Parikh has only been at Microsoft for a little over six months, but the company is already moving at pace toward this agent factory goal. “We have rewired some of the ways we do product development here, to support this vision of building the products and platform that we do in this agent factory mode,” he says. Parikh has also been pushing some of his team, many of whom are the core developer division of Microsoft, to adopt AI and get ready for this transformation that he’s now in charge of. I’ve heard he regularly sends an email missive about AI to his team, sometimes even on a Saturday morning. He’s described himself in the past as having a “quiet intensity,” where he’ll listen to lots of opinions and then push teams to a particular goal with that learned knowledge. This experience has led him to oversee a variety of projects in the past, including Meta’s experimental solar-powered drone project to provide internet to remote locations and some of the key engineering at Akamai that kept the world’s biggest websites online. Pushing Microsoft’s developers to build technology that could eventually replace their previous coding efforts might just be his greatest challenge yet. Not only will Parikh have to convince his team of this change, but Microsoft also needs to convince businesses that its vision of AI agents isn’t just another chatbot idea that, outside of ChatGPT, hasn’t really produced results. “In the last couple of years, we were looking at mostly chatbots with AI… everyone was clamoring for where’s the ROI? And frankly there was no ROI, that was people dipping their toes in the water and understanding what was there,” Parikh says. “Now, people are moving on from that and the models are super super advanced, compared to even a year ago.” Parikh envisions a future where app developers start with AI first. “Instead of duct-taping a little AI to an existing app, what we want the platform to support is you start with the model, then you leverage the scaffolding that’s there in the platform.” Microsoft isn’t alone in this AI agent push. Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, and many others are racing toward this idea of AI agents controlling parts of our digital life or automating the tasks at work that we’d rather not have to do. OpenAI, Microsoft’s key partner in its AI efforts, is also building its own platform that could easily compete with Microsoft’s work. “We want to be people’s core AI subscription,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a recent interview. “Some of that will be what you do inside ChatGPT, we’ll have a couple of other key parts of that subscription. But mostly we will hopefully build this smarter and smarter model and have these surfaces like future devices and future things that are sort of similar to operating systems.” That sounds like OpenAI could certainly compete with Microsoft’s various platforms and hardware, particularly as the AI lab just acquired Jony Ive’s AI startup in a nearly $6.5 billion deal that could shake up the nascent AI hardware market and really bring these AI agents to life. It certainly feels like everyone in tech is now racing toward a similar goal of owning what they believe to be the next wave of computing. It’s fast-paced, ever changing, and the future of who wins is uncertain, but Microsoft seems determined to meet the moment, even embracing the open-source Model Context Protocol as part of a push to reshape Windows in a world of AI agents. “We just have to learn the fastest. If we’re learning the fastest out of everybody out there, I feel confident that we’ll deliver great value to our customers and hone into our craft of these products working well,” says Parikh. “That’s what we’ve got to do. It’s exciting and it’s not for the faint of heart.” Note: I interviewed Parikh ahead of a Palestinian tech worker interrupting his keynote at Build earlier this week, when the company was still refusing to comment on its cloud and AI contracts with the Israeli government. Microsoft eventually issued a statement a few days after my interview. Microsoft held its Build developer conference in Seattle this week, and while the news wasn’t earth-shattering this year, it was certainly an eventful week. Top announcements included Microsoft’s plan to fix the web by letting websites run AI search for cheap, Windows getting native MCP support, and the surprise open-sourcing of the Windows Subsystem for Linux. Outside of that, this year’s Microsoft Build will, for many, be remembered more for protests and the surprise appearance of Elon Musk. Alongside the more than 6,000 layoffs at Microsoft earlier this month, a lot of employees I’ve spoken to recently are feeling anxious about the direction Microsoft is taking. On Monday, just minutes after Satya Nadella began delivering the opening keynote, Microsoft employee Joe Lopez yelled, “How about you show how Israeli war crimes are powered by Azure?” Moments later, Lopez sent an email to thousands of Microsoft employees. He was fired later that day. The keynote on Build’s second day was also interrupted, this time by a Palestinian tech worker that disrupted Jay Parikh, forcing him to briefly pause his presentation and for Microsoft to mute its livestream. Then on Wednesday, two former Microsoft employees disrupted a Build developer session, where the commotion led to a Microsoft executive inadvertently revealing internal messages regarding Walmart’s use of AI. The protests came just days after Microsoft had acknowledged its cloud and AI contracts with Israel, but it claimed it had found “no evidence” that its tools were used to “target or harm people” in Gaza. Lopez wasn’t the only Microsoft employee to send a mass email this week. Jasmina Mathieu, a senior product designer at Microsoft, announced her resignation to thousands of colleagues including the company’s leadership, and decried Microsoft’s response to employee protesters. “It may work as a PR stunt but it’s easy to conclude, that if the Israeli government is using Azure, they are using it to enable the genocide in Gaza,” Mathieu said. Late on Wednesday, Microsoft responded again to the protests, this time by temporarily blocking any emails sent within the company that include the terms “Palestine,” “Gaza,” and “genocide” in email subject lines or in the body of a message. Microsoft confirmed it had made some changes to its email system in a statement to The Verge. “Emailing large numbers of employees about any topic not related to work is not appropriate,” said Microsoft spokesperson Frank Shaw. Microsoft’s response to concerns over its Israeli contracts wasn’t the only thing causing controversy among employees this week. I’ve spoken to multiple Microsoft employees who weren’t happy to see Elon Musk appear virtually at Build this week. Nadella invited Musk as part of the announcement that xAI’s Grok 3 models are now available on Azure AI Foundry. It was obvious that this would be a controversial move internally, but I understand Nadella has been pushing for it regardless of any potential fallout with employees. I’m always keen to hear from readers, so please drop a comment here, or you can reach me at notepad@theverge.com if you want to discuss anything else.

Title: Mantle and Republic Technologies Forge Strategic Partnership to Pioneer Institutional mETH Integration
URL: https://dailyhodl.com/2025/05/22/mantle-and-republic-technologies-forge-strategic-partnership-to-pioneer-institutional-meth-integration/
Time Published: 2025-05-22T14:04:54Z

May 22, 2025 – Singapore, Singapore Mantle, the largest sustainable hub for on-chain finance with over $3 billion in TVL (total value locked), today announced a strategic partnership with Republic Technologies, the Ethereum (ETH) treasury of publicly listed Canadian company Beyond Medical Technologies Inc. (CSE: DOCT) (IBKR: DOCT) (FSE: 7FM). This partnership marks a major milestone in institutional cryptocurrency adoption, positioning Mantle’s mETH as the first liquid staking token to be held on the balance sheet of a publicly listed company. Through the partnership, Republic Technologies plans to delegate a significant portion of its ETH holdings to Mantle’s mETH Protocol and will hold mETH as a yield-bearing, liquid staking token on its balance sheet. The collaboration underscores a structural shift in institutional digital asset strategy and growing investor conviction in Ethereum-native yield infrastructure, reflecting Republic Technologies’ deepening alignment with the Mantle ecosystem. Republic Technologies is establishing a new institutional paradigm by building a treasury strategy around Ethereum, seen as the foundational layer for smart contracts, tokenization and decentralized financial settlement. In contrast to Bitcoin-focused strategies employed by firms like Strategy and Metaplanet, whose reserves are largely Bitcoin-based, Republic Technologies’ approach is anchored in Ethereum’s role as the infrastructure layer powering both blockchain innovation and real-world enterprise integration. By accumulating ETH as a core balance sheet asset, Republic Technologies advances the growth of its underlying healthcare technology businesses while offering institutional-grade exposure to digital assets for all shareholders. This strategy attracts growing interest from traditional markets and accelerates institutional participation in the emerging technology sector. Daniel Liu, CEO of Republic Technologies, said, “We hold strong conviction that Ethereum is the institutional chain, with ETH serving as the digital fuel powering global financial systems. “Our initial entry through Mantle’s Scout program helped us gain early exposure to the broader Mantle ecosystem, where our alignment with mETH Protocol came as a natural next step. “More than 50 established incumbents – including BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, PayPal and Visa – have already built services on Ethereum. Wall Street has made its decision. “Our role now is to extend the benefits of this macro tailwind to a broader base of institutional and retail participants worldwide.” Its leadership team brings decades of experience from top-tier financial institutions, including Apollo Global Management, Goldman Sachs, BlackRock and Canaccord Genuity. Republic Technologies operates under the publicly listed company Beyond Medical Technologies Inc., a technology firm integrating blockchain infrastructure to drive operational efficiency and improve patient outcomes across the medical ecosystem. In March 2025, Republic Technologies entered into a licensing agreement and launched its medical attestation platform, leveraging Ethereum-based distributed systems to power healthcare data integrity and regulatory compliance. The Ethereum treasury was established to support and scale this vision, marking a first-of-its-kind integration. Mantle’s mETH Protocol has quickly emerged as one of the leading platforms in Ethereum liquid staking and restaking. Within just 66 days of launch, it surpassed $1 billion in TVL – the fastest growth in its category – and has since peaked at over $2.19 billion. Designed with institutional-grade capital efficiency and composability in mind, mETH enables institutions to access Ethereum-native yield through a fully composable and capital-efficient framework. To date, over 170,000 mETH (approximately $455 million) has been restaked into EigenDA, securing Mantle’s modular data availability layer. Validator operations are distributed across leading infrastructure providers, including Stakefish, P2P.org, Blockdaemon, A41 and Veda, ensuring high availability and robust institutional reliability. Jonathan Low, growth lead at mETH Protocol, said, “Republic Technologies’ participation highlights mETH Protocol’s ability to support institutional strategies built natively on Ethereum. “As demand accelerates for ETH-native yield and utility, we remain focused on building resilient infrastructure that long-term allocators can trust.” The partnership precedes mETH’s inclusion in MI4 (Mantle Index Four), a tokenized, yield-focused index fund developed in collaboration with Securitize – the tokenization firm behind BlackRock’s BUIDL and Apollo’s ACRED. Backed by up to $400 million anchor investment from the Mantle Treasury, MI4 targets $1 billion in AUM and will offer regulated exposure to BTC, ETH, SOL, stablecoins and select staking assets, with mETH playing a central role in its ETH allocation strategy. In parallel, Mantle is preparing to extend mETH’s utility across TradFi (traditional finance) through Mantle Banking, an initiative that will integrate mETH into fiat rails, credit products and conventional payment systems. This integration will allow users to spend, borrow and invest with mETH across traditional payment rails, unlocking real-world utility for digital assets. A pioneering on-chain ecosystem dedicated to revolutionizing the future of finance and blockchain scalability, seamlessly bridging TradFi and DeFi (decentralized finance). Through innovative products like Mantle Network, mETH Protocol, Function (FBTC) and MI4, Mantle’s ecosystem empowers users and institutions with a unified financial services platform, redefining how the world spends, saves and invests in the Web 3.0 era.

Title: Cost-effective solutions for high-throughput enzymatic DNA methylation sequencing
URL: https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1011667
Time Published: 2025-05-22T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
Characterizing DNA methylation patterns is important for addressing key questions in evolutionary biology, development, geroscience, and medical genomics. While costs are decreasing, whole-genome DNA methylation profiling remains prohibitively expensive for most population-scale studies, creating a need for cost-effective, reduced representation approaches (i.e., assays that rely on microarrays, enzyme digests, or sequence capture to target a subset of the genome). Most common whole genome and reduced representation techniques rely on bisulfite conversion, which can damage DNA resulting in DNA loss and sequencing biases. Enzymatic methyl sequencing (EM-seq) was recently proposed to overcome these issues, but thorough benchmarking of EM-seq combined with cost-effective, reduced representation strategies is currently lacking. To address this gap, we optimized the Targeted Methylation Sequencing protocol (TMS)—which profiles ~4 million CpG sites—for miniaturization, flexibility, and multispecies use at a cost of ~USD 80. First, we tested modifications to increase throughput and reduce cost, including increasing multiplexing, decreasing DNA input, and using enzymatic rather than mechanical fragmentation to prepare DNA. Second, we compared our optimized TMS protocol to commonly used techniques, specifically the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip (n = 55 paired samples) and whole genome bisulfite sequencing (n = 6 paired samples). In both cases, we found strong agreement between technologies (R2 = 0.97 and 0.99, respectively). Third, we tested the optimized TMS protocol in three non-human primate species (rhesus macaques, geladas, and capuchins). We captured a high percentage (mean = 77.1%) of targeted CpG sites and produced methylation level estimates that agreed with those generated from reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (R2 = 0.98). Finally, we confirmed that estimates of 1) epigenetic age and 2) tissue-specific DNA methylation patterns are strongly recapitulated using data generated from TMS versus other technologies. Altogether, our optimized TMS protocol will enable cost-effective, population-scale studies of genome-wide DNA methylation levels across human and non-human primate species. DNA methylation profiling is important for understanding key questions in biology, but current techniques can be expensive and have technical limitations. Enzymatic methyl sequencing (EM-seq) was proposed as a potential solution, but thorough testing is still needed. In this study, we optimized a new method (Targeted Methylation Sequencing or TMS) to make it more cost-effective, flexible, and applicable to multiple species. We tested modifications to increase sample multiplexing, reduce DNA input, and use enzymatic fragmentation. We compared our optimized TMS protocol to common methylation profiling techniques and found strong agreement in DNA methylation levels. We also successfully applied the optimized TMS protocol to three non-human primate species. Finally, we show that common analyses of DNA methylation data produce similar results using TMS data versus data from other technologies. Together, we hope this work will enable cost-effective, population-scale DNA methylation profiling across human and non-human species.

Understanding variation in DNA methylation levels across tissues, the lifespan, disease states, and populations is important for addressing key questions in biology. DNA methylation—the covalent addition of methyl groups to cytosines—is a semi-malleable and environmentally-responsive epigenetic modification involved in gene regulation in many species, including our own [1]. Because DNA methylation moderates gene expression throughout the life course, it is critical for processes such as development [2–4], cell programming [5], tissue specificity [6], aging [7–11], and disease progression [12–14]. For example, changes in DNA methylation are considered a “hallmark” of the aging process, with most studies reporting age-associated gains in methylation in hypomethylated regions (e.g., promoters and transcribed regions) and age-associated losses in methylation in hypermethylated regions (e.g., heterochromatic regions, Polycomb-repressed regions) [15–17]. These age-related patterns are so consistent that DNA methylation variation have been used to construct molecular clocks that reliably predict chronological age [18,19]. Further, because DNA methylation is known to respond to environmental inputs, it has been implicated as a mechanism through which diverse environmental exposures can impact long-term physiology and health (e.g., famine [20–24], psychosocial stress [25–29], or infection [30–33]). To profile genome-wide DNA methylation at scale, most studies rely on reduced representation methods: human studies have largely favored microarrays, while non-human studies have favored reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) due to the lack of species-specific microarrays (though recent work has led to the development of the Infinium Mouse DNA Methylation BeadChip as well as the Mammalian Methylation Array) [34–36]. Both RRBS and microarrays quantify DNA methylation at a subset (1–5%) of CpGs in the genome, and thus provide a cost-effective strategy relative to genome-wide assays (e.g., whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS)). For example, the Infinium MethylationEPIC v2.0 BeadChip, or EPIC array, covers ~ 930K CpG sites including functional elements identified by the ENCODE project [37], DNase hypersensitive sites, and putatively important sites for human disease and development [38,39]. In contrast, RRBS fragments DNA using the Msp1 enzyme that cuts DNA at CCGG motifs, which following size selection, enriches for 1–5% of the genome with high CpG content such as CpG islands and gene bodies [34,40]. Importantly, both microarrays and RRBS rely on sodium bisulfite, which converts unmethylated cytosines to thymine while leaving methylated cytosines protected from conversion. This chemical reaction requires high pHs and temperatures, which can cause unwanted DNA fragmentation and damage, especially to unmethylated cytosines [41]. Ultimately, such damage can create difficulties during library preparation as well as biases in the downstream data [41–43]. Enzymatic methyl sequencing (EM-seq) offers a useful alternative to bisulfite sequencing with several key benefits: EM-seq relies on enzymatic rather than chemical conversion of unmethylated cytosines to thymine, resulting in substantially less DNA damage [42]. As a result, whole genome EM-seq has been shown to recover more CpGs sites, have lower duplication rates, have better between-replicate correlations, and require less DNA input than WGBS [42]. However, existing EM-seq benchmarked protocols rely on whole genome rather than reduced representation strategies, hindering their adoption especially for population-scale studies. To address this gap, Twist Biosciences recently created a hybrid capture panel that targets ~4 million CpG sites in the human genome and is compatible with EM-seq. The Twist methylation capture reaction uses ~ 550k probes to target functionally relevant CpG sites (e.g., those in enhancers, gene bodies, and near transcription start sites) and to cover ~95% of CpG sites included on the widely used EPIC array [44–47]. Off the shelf, this protocol is similar or lower in cost to existing reduced representation approaches. However, we note that total cost for any sequencing-based approach will depend on the desired coverage (i.e., the average number of reads that cover each CpG site); best practices for average per CpG coverage are still debated, but most studies recommend at least 20x [48–51]. Increased coverage will increase the precision of DNAm estimates, and thus to some degree the desired coverage depends on the anticipated effect size. Here, we aimed to develop and benchmark an optimized and further cost-reduced version of the targeted methylation sequencing (TMS) approach suitable for population-scale studies, including both human and non-human primate (NHP) studies (Fig 1A). To do so, we built upon the off the shelf TMS protocol (Fig 1B), which recommends 8 plexing of samples per capture reaction and 200 ng of DNA input, and tested four multiplexing strategies (12, 24, 48, and 96 plex, using 200 ng of sample input; Fig 1C). We also tested five DNA input amounts (25, 50, 100, 200, and 400ng, using the 12-plex strategy) and other minor protocol modifications such as varying the annealing temperature during hybrid capture and varying the method used for DNA fragmentation (Fig 1C). Following optimization, we assessed: 1) the robustness of our protocol through a direct comparison with the EPIC array and WGBS; 2) the extension of optimized TMS for use in NHP species; and 3) the ability of our protocol to recapitulate biological results (epigenetic age estimates and identification of tissue-specific patterns) obtained from data generated using other technologies (see Table 1 for sample sizes and sample information; Fig 1C). Overall, we found that we were able to miniaturize and optimize the TMS protocol to ~USD 80 per sample, while maintaining data quality and comparability to existing methods. In total, our protocol provides coverage of approximately four times as many CpG sites relative to the EPIC array at one fourth the cost—a ~ 16-fold gain in the data-to-price ratio (S1 Table). [A] To optimize the TMS protocol, we used samples from three human and three NHP populations: the Tsimane of Bolivia, a Vanderbilt University Medical Center cohort, the Orang Asli of Malaysia, rhesus macaques from Cayo Santiago in Puerto Rico, tufted capuchins from captive sites throughout the United States, and gelada monkeys from Ethiopia. Created using BioRender. [B] The TMS protocol begins with DNA fragmentation and adapter ligation. Next, two enzymes, TET2 and APOBEC, are used to oxidize and deaminate the DNA. TET2 recognizes methyl groups attached to cytosines and converts them to Ca/g. APOBEC follows TET2 and converts the unmethylated cytosines to uracils. Following PCR amplification (which converts uracils to thymines), hybrid capture is used to enrich for targeted regions of the genome. Samples are then assayed via high throughput sequencing.

Raw quality control metrics such as percent CHH methylation (a proxy for the rate at which unmethylated cytosines are converted to thymine) and mapping efficiency (percent of reads uniquely mapped to the genome) were high for all samples. Mapping efficiency was consistent across plexing strategies (average mapping efficiency: 12-plex = 71.9%, 24-plex = 72.9%, 48-plex = 72.5%, and 96-plex = 73.5%; ANOVA: F-value = 0.843, p-value = 0.472; Fig 2A) but affected by input amount, with higher DNA input having greater mapping efficiency (ANOVA: F-value = 13.57, p-value < 0.001, Fig 2B and S3 Table). CHH methylation was consistently well below 1%, indicative of high conversion rate across all plexing and input strategies (range = 0.1-0.27%; S1 Fig, and S4 and S5 Tables) [53].

On average, this represented 96.42% and 92.19% coverage of the TMS probe set across the plexing and input experiments, respectively (S8 and S9 Tables). Across experiments, we found average coverage of targeted CpG sites to be far greater than our minimum coverage of 5x, ranging from 21-89x across datasets (S2 Fig and S2 Table). In addition to consistently recovering the expected set of CpGs, we also observed extremely repeatable methylation levels across the plexing and input experiments (all R2 > 0.99; S10 and S11 Tables). The CpGs covered by our experiments were distributed across diverse genomic annotations, and the median DNA methylation levels within a given annotation displayed expected patterns (Fig 2C and 2D) [54]. For example, we observed high levels of methylation in quiescent and heterochromatin regions and low levels of methylation in promoters and transcribed regions. In experiments 1 and 2, we used the recommended 65°C annealing temperature during the hybrid capture step—where prepared DNA is bound to the capture probe set to select CpG sites of interest—and the recommended 2uL of methylation enhancer, which increases the efficiency of this reaction. Here, we found that ~3/4 of all of our mapped reads were “on-target”, meaning that they overlapped with the designed probe set and represented successful hybrid capture (S8 and S9 Tables). This suggests that ~ ¼ of reads are “off target” and randomly distributed across the genome rather than within our regions of interest. We therefore performed a third experiment using Tsimane DNA to test two protocol modifications that might decrease the off-target proportion: we increased the annealing temperature (testing 65°C or 68°C) and we varied the amount of methylation enhancer (testing 0uL, 2uL, or 4uL). We note that similar previous work has reported on-target read percentages of 75–85% [55–57], suggesting the capture reaction will likely never be completely efficient. In experiment 3, we found that increasing the annealing temperature from 65°C to 68°C resulted in a lower proportion of off-target reads (ANOVA: F-value = 84.2, p-value < 0.0001; Figs 2E and S4, and S12 Table). Across samples annealed at 65°C, an average of 78.5% of reads were on-target, while this number rose to 84.2% at 68°C. However, this increase in capture efficiency came at a cost to the breadth of CpG sites covered: across samples annealed at 65°C, we observed coverage of on average 92.0% of the probe set, while this number fell to 72.2% for samples annealed at 68°C (Fig 2F, and S13 and S14 Tables). This suggests that higher annealing temperatures lead to greater but more specific binding during the hybrid capture step, and thus the increased capture efficiency comes at the expense of recovering all the expected CpG sites. In general, we did not find meaningful differences across methylation enhancer amounts and we therefore excluded this reagent from downstream experiments (Fig 2E and 2F). Given the loss of certain genomic regions at 68°C, downstream experiments focused on a 65°C annealing temperature. We next performed a fourth experiment focused on protocol optimization, in which we varied the strategies used to fragment genomic DNA prior to EM-seq library preparation: specifically, we tested mechanical fragmentation via Covaris sonication against enzymatic fragmentation with the NEBNext UltraShear reagent. Mechanical fragmentation is the current standard approach but is expensive, requires special equipment, and is labor intensive. Conversely, enzymatic fragmentation is cheaper, does not require special equipment, and is more compatible with automation. For experiments 3 and 4, we used the 96-plex strategy and 200 ng of sample input, since experiments 1 and 2 suggested that data quality does not suffer from higher plexing strategies. These experiments used DNA from a human population in Malaysia, the Orang Asli [58]. Enzymatic fragmentation resulted in a similar number of covered sites as was previously observed with mechanical fragmentation (n = 4,591,123 and 4,523,981 filtered CpG sites for the 10 and 20 minute protocols, respectively). Average site-specific methylation levels were also highly concordant between approaches (mechanical versus 10 min enzymatic: R2 = 0.9875; mechanical versus 20 min enzymatic: R2 = 0.9876; 10 min versus 20 min enzymatic: R2 = 0.9944; S5 Fig). This was also true when we focused on a subset of DNA samples processed using both methods (n = 3; mechanical versus 10 min enzymatic: average R2 = 0.971; mechanical versus 20 min enzymatic: average R2 = 0.971; 10 min versus 20 min enzymatic: average R2 = 0.987, S15 Table). From these experiments, we concluded that enzymatic fragmentation can be substituted into the protocol with no loss to data quality. We also used these data, which represent our “best” protocol (96-plex, 200ng input, 65°C annealing, no methylation enhancer, enzymatic fragmentation), to understand two critical aspects of experimental design—how many reads one would need to generate to achieve a given mean (or median) coverage per CpG site (S6 Fig) and how this mean coverage impacts power to detect differential methylation (S3 Fig). In general, we observe a ~ 1:1 relationship between the number of mapped, paired end reads (in millions) and mean coverage, such that 20 million mapped paired end (40 million total reads) translates to ~20x mean coverage (or ~14x median coverage) per CpG site. Using simulations [49,59] of datasets of different sizes (n = 100, 200, 400) and mean coverages (20x, 40x, and 80x), we found that increasing coverage can provide power gains for smaller sample sizes, but in larger datasets increasing coverage will matter less as power is derived from the overall sample size rather than gains in precision (S3 Fig). To ensure that TMS could perform comparably to the most popular current reduced-representation technology (the EPIC array), we generated paired data for 55 samples using both platforms (and following the 96-plexing, 200 ng input TMS protocol from experiment 1). After filtering, we analyzed 682,295 CpG sites common to both technologies, and found high concordance between per-site DNA methylation levels averaged across all individuals in the dataset (R2 = 0.97; Fig 3A). We also examined correlations between the two technologies when we subsetted to 1) variably methylated CpG sites (i.e., sites with methylation levels >10% and <90%; mean R2 = 0.83; Fig 3B); 2) CpG islands, shores, and shelves (R2 = 0.97, 0.97, 0.94, respectively); 3) hypomethylated (<50% average methylation; R2 = 0.89) regions; 4) hypermethylated (>50% average methylation; R2 = 0.70) regions; and 5) particular EPIC v2 array probe types (S7 and S8 Figs). Because methylation patterns are relatively consistent across individuals for many regions of the human genome, we also confirmed that these correlations were higher for EPIC-TMS data generated from the same sample compared to EPIC-TMS comparisons made between random pairs of samples (mean R2 for all sites: 0.95 versus 0.93 for random sample pairs, mean R2 for variable sites only: 0.83 versus 0.75 for random sample pairs; S9 Fig).

This is because EPIC-derived DNA methylation levels are represented as beta values, calculated as the ratio of the intensity of the methylated bead type to the total locus intensity plus an offset value. Due to the addition of the offset value, beta values of 1 are mathematically impossible. As a result, the correlation between average TMS- and EPIC-measured DNA methylation levels is slightly off the x = y line (Fig 3A) and correlations are much lower than the genome-wide average for hypo- as well as hyper-methylated regions. For further validation, we also generated WGBS data for 6 Tsimane samples included in experiment 3 (96-plexing, 200 ng input, 65°C annealing temperature, no ME, mechanical fragmentation). After filtering and merging with the TMS data, we retained 3,078,771 CpG sites covered by both the TMS and WGBS approaches. For these sites, the average methylation levels observed across technologies was highly correlated (R2: 0.9871; Fig 3C). We also found that the genome-wide distribution of DNA methylation levels derived from WGBS was more similar to TMS than to the EPIC array, specifically in that it included many sites with average methylation levels of 100% or close to 100%, as expected (Figs 3D and S10). To enable epigenomic analyses in our close primate relatives, we also tested whether TMS (96-plex, 200ng input protocol from experiment 1) could be effectively applied to three NHP species: tufted capuchins (Sapajus apella; n = 28 samples from blood), rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta; n = 96 samples from 6 tissues (see S11 Fig and S16 Table)), and geladas (Theropithecus gelada; n = 68 samples from blood). While the probe set is designed from the human genome, NHP species share high levels of sequence homology with humans, especially in coding regions and regions near genes [61], leading us to hypothesize that a majority of CpG sites would be recovered. We mapped the Twist probe sequences to each of the NHP genomes to confirm this intuition, and from this analysis expected to capture 3.0-4.8 million CpG sites across the three species (Fig 4B). Importantly, for the rhesus macaque samples, we also generated paired RRBS data and compared our TMS results to a technology that does not rely on hybrid capture. [A] Optimized TMS in NHPs results in high mapping efficiencies despite the use of human-specific probes. Here, each of the species are mapped to their respective reference genome. We hypothesize that low mapping efficiency in certain rhesus macaque samples is due to variation in sample quality. [B] Number of expected and observed CpG sites covered in each NHP genome.

[E] Density plot of linear model R2 values obtained from comparing data generated via optimized TMS and RRBS for the same rhesus macaque samples. R2 values are provided when all CpG sites common to both technologies are included, as well as when only variably methylated (methylation > 10% and methylation < 90%) CpG sites are included. [F] Density curves of the average genome-wide DNA methylation level estimates for each NHP species. Curves show the expected bimodal distribution in which many of the CpG sites in the genome are either hypomethylated or hypermethylated. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011667.g004 When examining initial quality control metrics, we found that all three NHP species had high mapping efficiencies (average = 81.96% for capuchins, 82.62% for geladas, and 81.35% for macaques; Fig 4A). Further, the average CHH methylation levels were all extremely low (<1%), again suggesting high conversion rates (S12 Fig). Following filtering, we recovered ~ ½ to ¾ of expected CpG sites in the NHP datasets (3,343,133 in capuchin, 5,387,280 in gelada, and 5,486,073 in macaque). The number of sites recovered scales generally with divergence time (capuchins share a common ancestor with humans 35–45 million years ago, geladas and rhesus macaques share a common ancestor with humans 23–28 million years ago) [62]. In all species, we were able to reliably measure more sites than would be typical of RRBS (see below), and we note that some of the between-species variation in performance could be explained by heterogenous read depth (S2 Table) as well as reference assembly quality. In particular, the quality of the rhesus macaque genome is much higher than the gelada or capuchin (using CNEr in R and the N50() and N90() commands [63]): mmul_10 N50 = 153,388,924, N90 = 79,627,064; tgel1 N50 = 147,341,205, N90 = 77,542,005; cimit N50 = 5,274,112, N90 = 1,283,179. When examining average DNA methylation levels across species, we found that, as expected, all exhibited bimodal genome-wide profiles similar to humans (Fig 4F). Further, because the rhesus macaque samples were derived from 6 different tissue types (S11 Fig and S16 Table), we also confirmed that samples displayed expected tissue-specific epigenetic patterns. Specifically, we demonstrated that a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was able to reliably separate samples by tissue type (Fig 4C), as has been observed in previous studies using both bisulfite sequencing and the EPIC array [64–66]. Studies of NHP species have historically relied on RRBS because of the species-specificity of microarray technologies and the cost barrier of WGBS [49,67,68]. To test how our optimized TMS protocol compares to RRBS, we generated paired data for all 96 rhesus macaque samples. After filtering both datasets to 721,766 common CpG sites, we found a high concordance of the average DNA methylation levels estimated by both technologies (R2 = 0.97; Figs 4D and S13). This remained true when we subsetted specifically to 92,692 variably methylated CpG sites (i.e., sites with average DNA methylation levels >0.1 and <0.9; R2 = 0.5945; Fig 4E). Thus far we have compared DNA methylation levels measured with TMS versus other technologies; if these measurements are robust across platforms, then power to detect biological patterns should also be similar. We thus asked whether data generated from paired samples, but using different technologies, could recapitulate 1) epigenetic age predictions using DNA methylation-based clock algorithms [7,69–73] and 2) tissue-dependent methylation signatures when comparing diverse organ systems. For analysis #1, we used the 55 VUMC cohort samples with paired EPIC and TMS data (focusing on 682,295 CpG sites passing filters and common to both technologies). For analysis #2, we used the 96 rhesus macaque samples with paired RRBS and TMS data (focusing on 391,758 CpG sites passing filters and common to both technologies). For analysis #1, we observed a high correlation between epigenetic age estimates derived from TMS and EPIC data (Fig 5A; average R2 = 0.91). This agreement was high across a variety of existing epigenetic clock algorithms. For analysis #2, we found that effect size estimates of tissue dependency (for example, from linear models comparing DNA methylation levels in liver to all other tissues) were very similar genome-wide when applied to TMS versus RRBS data (Fig 5B and 5C). Additionally, we confirmed that sites identified as significantly associated (FDR < 5%) with a given tissue in RRBS versus TMS data overlapped more than expected by chance (Fig 5D). Together, these results support the ability of TMS data to uncover biological patterns in similar ways as revealed by other technologies.

We recommend an optimal protocol for future work (96-plex, 200ng input, 65°C annealing, no methylation enhancer, enzymatic fragmentation), but found that data quality remained high across plexing strategies, input amounts, and protocol modifications. Importantly, the 96-plex version of the TMS protocol—including sequencing to achieve ~ 25x coverage per CpG site on the Illumina NovaSeq X—can currently be performed for ~USD 80 per sample (with roughly half being reagents and labor, and the other half being sequencing on the NovaSeq X platform; S1 Table). Relative to the commonly used EPIC array for human studies, this represents massive savings enabling larger-scale, population-based studies. We recognize that the total cost of TMS will vary by the amount of sequencing performed, and we provide simulations (and modifiable code) based on real TMS coverage distributions for users to explore the impact of coverage on power for a given study design. For example, we find that with a sample size of n = 100, moderate differences in methylation (e.g., 20%) can be identified with high power at relatively low read depths (e.g., 20x), while detecting small differences would require higher read depths. However, the relative impact of coverage on power diminishes at higher sample sizes. Researchers will thus need to tailor their sequencing plan based on both their expected effect size and the number of samples in hand (S3 Fig). We found high concordance between TMS-derived DNA methylation levels and those derived from other commonly used methods—namely the EPIC array, WGBS, and RRBS. WGBS is the gold standard for comprehensive DNA methylation measurement, but is prohibitively expensive for most studies given the breadth of sequencing (to cover the whole genome) and the necessity for deep sequencing (to achieve high levels of precision) [50]. RRBS has filled in as a more cost-effective alternative, but due to the stochastic nature of the Msp1 digestion followed by size selection, not all CpG sites are reliably covered across individuals and missing data can impede downstream analyses (S14 Fig). We note that variation in coverage (and thus precision) across CpG sites will be an issue, to some degree, for any sequencing-based technology. As a result of these challenges, microarray-based methods (such as the EPIC array) have become the most commonly used approach in human genomics. Consequently, many popular bioinformatics pipelines and specialized algorithms for DNA methylation data (e.g., epigenetic clocks or cell type deconvolution [74,75]) are currently keyed to microarrays. While DNA methylation levels derived from TMS are strongly correlated with the EPIC array, it is important to keep in mind that: 1) a small subset of sites are not covered by both technologies, and 2) because microarrays output beta values (equivalent to methylated signal/(total signal + an offset)), the relationship between TMS- and EPIC-derived values cannot be exactly 1:1. We caution that care will thus be needed when applying existing microarray-based algorithms to TMS data, though our initial attempts at doing so with epigenetic clock algorithms do seem to perform well. The study of DNA methylation in NHP species is deeply important to our understanding of gene regulatory evolution [76–78], comparative aging [67,68,79,80], and environmental impacts on phenotype [68,81]. For example, both captive and field-based NHP studies have strongly contributed to our understanding of how social and ecological inputs influence fitness-related traits through changes in DNA methylation [82,83]. These studies have sometimes relied on microarrays (e.g., the Mammalian Methylation Array [36,84–86] or the application of human arrays to NHP species [87–89]). However, given the high costs of arrays, a large proportion of previous work has relied on RRBS [68,80,81,83]. Although RRBS is easily adapted for non-human species, TMS can work with smaller amounts of input DNA than bisulfite-based protocols [42], which can be critical for studies of wild or endangered species. While TMS uses capture probes designed from the human genome, NHPs share high levels of sequence similarity, which we show is sufficient to reliably capture 2–3 million CpG. Though not all ~ 4 million CpG sites are captured, TMS still represents a more consistent and cost-effective approach relative to the alternatives. Notably, we find that TMS is effective in both catarrhine (monkeys of Africa and Asia) and platyrrhine (monkeys of Central and South America) species, suggesting it may be effective in other members of these clades for capturing conserved regions. One potential issue that requires further study is that the probes (which are designed from human genetic variation) do not specifically avoid or take into account within-species polymorphisms. To show that TMS data could detect expected biological patterns, in ways that are comparable to existing technologies, we performed the same analyses of epigenetic age estimation and tissue-specificity in matched TMS, EPIC, and RRBS data, respectively. From these analyses we found that the epigenetic ages estimated with TMS versus EPIC data were highly correlated as were genome-wide estimates of tissue specific patterns from TMS versus RRBS data. The potential portability of epigenetic clock algorithms is particularly encouraging, as this approach is becoming increasingly popular for measuring biological age [90–92], and will be exciting to pair with cost-effective methods going forward. Together, our optimized TMS protocol has the potential to add value and enable larger-scale studies in the many fields that query DNA methylation patterns, such as genetic medicine, developmental biology, evolutionary biology, anthropology, public health, geroscience, and more. For the Tsimane participants, informed consent was collected at three levels: by the individual (formal written consent), by the community, and by the Tsimane Gran Consejo (Tsimane governing body). All study protocols, including the generation of DNA methylation data, were approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the University of New Mexico (#07–157), the University of California Santa Barbara (#3-21-0652), and Universidad Mayor San Simon, Cochabomba. For the Orang Asli participants, informed consent was also collected at multiple levels: first by first describing the project to the community as a whole and seeking the permission of community leaders, and subsequently through individual-specific review of the protocol and formal written consent. The study protocol, including the generation of DNA methylation data, was approved by Vanderbilt University (IRB #212175) as well as the Malaysian Medical Research Ethics Council. For the rhesus macaque samples, the study protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee through the University of Puerto Rico’s Caribbean Primate Research Center (IACUC #A400117). For the gelada samples, the study protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at the University of Washington (protocol 4416-01) and Arizona State University (20–1754 R) along with approval from the Ethiopian Wildlife and Conservation Agency. For the tufted capuchin samples, the study protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Georgia State University (protocol A20018). Data generation drew on previously collected samples from multiple human and non human primate populations. A brief description of each population is provided below. The Tsimane are an Indigenous horticulturalists population spread across >90 villages in the Bolivian lowlands and totaling approximately 17,000 people [52]. We extracted DNA from 192 venous whole blood (WB) samples collected between the years of 2010–2021 as part of the Tsimane Health and Life History Project (THLHP). The THLHP has continuously collected demographic, behavioral, environmental, and health data along with the provision of medical services for over two decades [93]. Samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen, transferred on dry ice to Arizona State University, and stored at -80°C prior to analysis. The sample set for this project included 103 females and 89 males, with a mean age of 54.3 years old (range 18.0–83.6 years old) (see Table 1). Genomic DNA was extracted using the Zymo Quick-DNA 96 kit (Zymo Research #D3012) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The Orang Asli consist of ~19 ethnolinguistic groups and a total population of ~210,000 people [58]. They traditionally subsist on a mixture of hunting, gathering, fishing, small-scale farming, and trade of forest products [94,95]. We extracted DNA from 88 white blood cell (WBC) samples that were collected in 2023 as part of the Orang Asli Health and Lifeways Project (OA HeLP) [58]. Samples included in data generation were derived from venous blood draws followed by washing with QIAGEN PureGene red blood cell lysis. Samples were stored in liquid nitrogen upon collection, and at -80C for longer term storage. The Orang Asli sample included 46 females and 42 males, with a mean age of 35.3 years old (range 18–78 years old; Table 1). Genomic DNA was extracted using the Zymo Quick-DNA/RNA MagBead kit (Zymo Research #R2131) following the manufacturer’s instructions. We were granted access to de-identified EPIC array data (Infinium MethylationEPIC v2.0 Kit) and TMS data from 55 paired human whole blood samples. These samples were sourced from a healthy cohort recruited through the Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) in Nashville, TN USA. Due to IRB restrictions, demographic data or other metadata were not available for these samples. We obtained extracted DNA from rhesus macaque tissue samples (n = 96) collected by the Cayo Biobank Research Unit in partnership with the University of Puerto Rico’s Caribbean Primate Research Center (CPRC) [96–100]. Beginning in 2016, samples were collected from individuals living on the island of Cayo Santiago, an NIH-managed free-range colony of provisioned rhesus macaques. Specifically, as part of an ongoing population management plan designed by CPRC, select individuals were culled and tissues from all major organ systems were systematically harvested, stored in a fixative buffer, and frozen at -80C. This data set consists of samples from six different tissue types: adrenal, heart, kidney, lung, liver, and spleen, with 16 samples from each type and samples coming from 23 unique individuals (S3 Table). This dataset includes samples from 11 females and 12 males, ages 3.2 to 19.9 years old (mean 10.6 years old), collected from 2016–2019 (Tables 1 and S3). Genomic DNA was extracted using the Zymo Quick-DNA/RNA MagBead kit (Zymo Research #R2131) following the provided manufacturer’s protocols. We extracted DNA from whole blood from 68 geladas; 21 were female and 47 were male and all were considered adult (i.e., over 4 years old, the minimum average age of reproductive maturation in this species [101]) (Table 1). Gelada samples were collected as part of the Simien Mountains Gelada Research Project (SMGRP) which, since 2017, has carried out annual capture-and-release campaigns to collect morphometric data and whole blood samples from wild Ethiopian geladas [102]. Samples were stored in liquid nitrogen upon collection, and at -80C for longer term storage. Genomic DNA was extracted using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood & Tissue kits (Qiagen #69581) following the provided protocols. Blood was collected from individuals in the captive tufted capuchin monkey colony at Georgia State University in January 2023. Of the 28 capuchins, 19 were female and 9 were male with an average age of 19.4 years old (range 9–41 years old; Table 1). A trained veterinarian anesthetized the monkeys using 13 mg/kg Ketamine, delivered intramuscularly. Whole blood samples were collected during the monkeys’ annual physicals, stored at 4°C upon collection, and shipped to Arizona State University where they were flash frozen into 0.5mL aliquots and stored at -80°C until used for analysis. DNA was extracted using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood & Tissue kits (Qiagen #69581) following the manufacturer’s protocols. We used the Qubit dsDNA assay to determine the quantity of all extracted DNA. DNA libraries were normalized and prepared using the NEBNext Enzymatic Methyl-seq kit (P/N: E7120L) following a modified version of the manufacturer’s protocol that included 9 cycles of PCR for the final library amplification followed by a 0.65X bead cleanup. To prepare for the hybrid capture reaction, the total DNA input requirement (2000ng in this case) was divided by the total number of samples being pooled (12, 24, 48, or 96 as will be discussed below). In the 96-plex experiment, for example, 84ng of DNA from each sample was pooled totaling 8ug, and ¼ of the volume was used for the hybrid reaction and captured using the Human Methylome panel from Twist Biosciences following the manufacturer’s instructions (P/N: 105521). The final post-capture PCR reaction was split into 2 reactions per pool and cleaned with a 1X bead cleanup and then combined. Pool quality was assessed post-hybridization using the Agilent Bioanalyzer and quantified using a qPCR-based method with the KAPA Library Quantification Kit (P/N: KK4873) and the QuantStudio 12K instrument. Prepared library pools were sequenced on the NovaSeq 6000 at the Vanderbilt Technologies for Advanced Genomics (VANTAGE) Core. We used 150 bp paired-end sequencing and generally targeted 30-50M paired-end reads per sample. Real Time Analysis Software (RTA) and NovaSeq Control Software (NCS) (1.8.0; Illumina) were used for base calling. MultiQC (v1.7; Illumina) was used for data quality assessments. For each sample, we applied the Illumina DRAGEN Methylation Pipeline v4.1.23 using the custom bed file from Twist Biosciences. The deliverables from DRAGEN consist of FASTQs, bams, cytosine reports (which include counts of methylated and unmethylated reads per CpG site), and methyl and mapping metric reports. To determine whether TMS can be effectively multiplexed beyond the recommended 8-plex, we used 96 Tsimane samples to test four different multiplexing strategies during capture: 12-, 24-, 48-, and 96-plex. To test whether TMS is robust to DNA input amounts, we tested five input amounts: specifically, 25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 ng of sample were used as input into the EM-seq library prep. Here, we kept the plexing strategy constant (12-plex) and used three Tsimane samples, each represented three times within each pool and included three replicates of a control sample (HG01879 from the 1000 Genomes Project) [103]. To optimize the capture efficiency of Twist target sites, we tested the use of two different annealing temperatures–65° and 68° C–along with the use of a methylation enhancer (ME)– produced by Twist Biosciences (Catalog #103557) consisting of Tris EDTA buffer to block the binding of off-target probes thereby improving on-target capture efficiency. The specific combinations we explored were: testing a 65°C annealing temperature with 0uL (n = 192), 2uL (n = 96), and 4uL (n = 96) of ME and testing a 68°C annealing temperature with 0uL (n = 96) and 2uL (n = 192) of ME. These experiments were conducted with 96-plexed Tsimane samples (n = 192), and using 200 ng of sample input. Next, we tested the use of an enzymatic fragmentation method to replace the Covaris (LE220) mechanical fragmentation approach. Mechanical fragmentation is known to decrease library quality through damage to DNA; however, enzymatic fragmentation is not currently recommended by the TMS protocol. To compare these approaches, we performed the optimized TMS with enzymatic fragmentation using 4uL of NEBNext UltraShear (NEB #M7634S/L) for 10 or 20 minutes. This experiment was conducted using 96-plexed samples from the Orang Asli (n = 88) and using 200 ng of sample input. To evaluate the efficacy of optimized TMS on three NHP species—macaques, geladas, and capuchins—we applied the 96-plex protocol design from experiment 1 with 200 ng input. To compare rhesus macaque TMS to RRBS, we generated RRBS libraries using 150 ng of DNA input in combination with 1ng of lambda phage DNA and 1uL of Msp1—a digestive enzyme which cuts CCGG nucleotide motifs. Next, using NEBNext Ultra II reagents, we performed end repair and adapter ligation to the DNA fragments produced by Msp1 digestion. We then performed bisulfite conversion on the fragments using the EZ-96 DNA Methylation Lightning MagPrep kit (Zymo Research #D5046) following the manufacturer directions. The samples were then PCR amplified for 16 cycles with unique dual indexed sequencing primers. We selected for 180–2000 bp fragments and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq S2 flow cell with 2x51bp sequencing [80,104]. For experiments 1, 2, 7, and 8, we used a custom bioinformatics pipeline to process all FASTQ files into counts of methylated versus unmethylated cytosines at each CpG site. For experiments 3, 4, 5, and 6, we used Illumina’s Dynamic Read Analysis for GENomics (DRAGEN) pipeline [105] to process all FASTQ files into counts of methylated versus unmethylated cytosines at each CpG site. Importantly, both our custom pipeline and DRAGEN follow the same general steps and rely on the Bismark suite [106], making them highly comparable. We also processed 7 samples from experiment 4 using both methods to empirically confirm that our custom pipeline and the Illumina DRAGEN pipeline produced near identical results (S15 Fig). For our custom pipeline, we first trimmed adapters using Trimmomatic (version 0.39) [107] and TrimGalore (version 0.6.6) [108] for human and NHP samples, respectively. Following trimming, we used Bismark (version 0.24.0) [106] to map reads to each species’ respective genomes (hg38 for human, mmul10 for rhesus macaque, cimit for capuchin, and tgel1 for gelada). We retained only uniquely mapped reads and used the methylation extractor function within Bismark to extract counts of methylated versus unmethylated cytosines at each cytosine. These files were further filtered for CpG contexts only. For all samples, run through either the custom or DRAGEN pipeline, we extracted two measures of data quality that are automatically calculated by Bismark: the percent of reads that mapped uniquely to the reference genome and the average methylation percentage for cytosines in a CHH context. The latter value serves as a commonly used estimate of the efficiency with which a given protocol converts unmethylated cytosines to thymine, because cytosines located outside of CpG contexts are extremely unlikely to be methylated in the mammalian genome [109,110]. Estimates of CHH methylation were extracted from an automatically generated report file when using Bismark to align the trimmed FASTQ files to the reference genome. For experiments 1 and 2, we tested whether multiplexing strategy and input amount impacted mapping efficiency and percent CHH methylation using a one-way ANOVA test, followed by a pairwise t-test in the case of significance, with the ‘aov’ and ‘pairwise.t.test’ functions in the ‘stats’ R package [111]. For each study, we used the BSseq R package [112] to compile count matrices (derived from our custom pipeline or DRAGEN) across samples and to perform region, coverage, and missingness filtering. For experiments 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 we used built-in functions in BSseq to filter for sites within the probes regions (+/- 200 bp) and for sites covered at>5X in >75% of samples. We made slight modifications to this filtering pipeline for other experiments. For experiment 2, where n = 3 for each input amount, we relaxed our missingness filter to sites with at least one read observed in at least ⅔ samples. For experiment 7, which focused on NHP genomes for which the probe set coordinates (which are provided in hg38) are irrelevant, we did not perform region filtering. The number of sites analyzed for each experiment (reported in the main text and in S4 Fig) therefore varies slightly depending on sample size, sequencing coverage, and other factors that impact which CpG sites passed our filters. To confirm the fidelity of optimized TMS, we also checked whether CpGs captured by the protocol were distributed as expected throughout different genomic regions (e.g., promoters, enhancers) and that the average methylation levels in different genomic regions were as expected. To do so, we annotated each CpG site by whether it fell into a gene body, promoter, or non-genic region, and by chromatin state. We used hg38 gene body coordinates from Ensembl’s ‘biomaRt’ package in R, and we defined promoter regions as the 2000 bp region upstream of TSSs. We annotated CpGs as falling in chromatin states as defined by hg38 ChromHMM annotations from NIH’s Roadmap Epigenomics Project [54]. We then counted the number of CpG sites that fell in each region (Fig 2C) and evaluated the median methylation across samples (Fig 2D). A subset of our experiments sought to understand and optimize two measures of efficiency of the hybrid capture step: 1) how many of the expected CpG sites from the probe set passed our filtering parameters and were thus analyzable and 2) how many of the reads we generated for a given sample were on-target and putatively captured by the probe set, rather than representing off-target randomly sequenced DNA fragments that do not contribute to analyzable data as they are often sparsely shared between samples. For #1, we used the bedtools (version 2.28.0) [113] intersect command to determine the proportion of CpG sites that are within +/- 200 bp with at least 1 probe [using a bed file available on the Twist Biosciences website (https://www.twistbioscience.com/resources/data-files/twist-human-methylome-panel-target-bed-file)]. For #2, we used the bedtools function bamtobed to convert the mapped reads for each sample into a bed file; because we used a paired end sequencing strategy, each bed coordinate included a fragment start position from R1 and a fragment end position from R2. We then used the bedtools intersect command to determine the proportion of mapped read pairs that are within 200 bp of at least 1 Twist probe. To understand what level of coverage is necessary to detect particular effect sizes in different sample sizes, we conducted a power analysis using simulated data based on the true coverage distribution of 1,000 sites in our TMS dataset, drawing with replacement to simulate sample sizes of n = 100, 200 and 400 (following the methods in [49,59]). We then assigned each sample a binary predictor variable (0 or 1), estimated methylation level differences between groups for a given effect size, and simulated the number of methylated counts per sample we would observe under this scenario by sampling from a binomial distribution (given the number of total counts and the probability of a count being methylated). We simulated data for effect sizes ranging from a 0–20% difference in methylation levels between groups and calculated power as the proportion of sites in which the predictor variable had a significant effect on methylation at a nominal p-value threshold of 0.001. We ran this analysis 3 times, first using the true mean coverage of our dataset (~20x), then again simulating coverage of 40x and 80x by multiplying the total counts of each site by 2 and 4, respectively. We used our filtered BSSeq object from experiment 5 to compare to data from the EPIC array generated for 55 paired human samples (average number of CpG sites measured with EPIC = 936,280; average call rate = 0.999). We downloaded the EPIC CpG coordinates from the Illumina website and merged with the TMS CpG locations, resulting in a shared dataset of 682,295 CpG sites passing filters and common to both technologies. We then performed two analyses to understand consistency. First, we calculated the average per-site methylation level across all samples included in the TMS or EPIC array datasets, respectively. We then ran a linear model testing the relationship between the two sets of average methylation levels using the ‘lm’ function in the ‘stats’ package in R. Second, we used the ‘lm’ function to estimate the R2 value comparing per-site methylation levels for estimates derived from each technology for a given individual (i.e., not averaged across the dataset). This resulted in a distribution of 55 R2 values. Because all humans share canonical methylation patterns, we also compared this distribution to a distribution of 55 R2 values derived from the same analysis after sample identity was permuted. We used the ‘t.test’ function in the ‘stats’ package in R to ask whether these distributions were significantly different. We used a very similar strategy to compare ~ 30x WGBS data generated for six paired Tsimane samples with TMS data generated from experiment 1 (96-plex, 200 ng input). First, we performed low level processing of the WGBS data using Illumina’s DRAGEN pipeline and merged this with our filtered TMS data, resulting in 3,078,771 CpG sites common to both datasets. We calculated the average methylation level across samples reported for each site and technology and ran a linear model using the ‘lm’ function in the ‘stats’ package in R to calculate the R2 value. We did not compare individual-based R2 values to permuted values for this experiment, given the small number of individuals. To estimate the number of CpG sites that we expected to recover when applying the human probe set to each NHP species, we converted the probe bed file to a FASTA file using the bedtools command ‘getfasta’ [113] and the hg38 reference genome. We then used Bismark to map the FASTA file to each non-human primate’s respective genome. From the mapped bam file, we used the ‘bamToBed’ function in bedtools to extract coordinates for the mapped probes and to add a + /- 200 bp offset. Finally, we applied the ‘getfasta’ function in bedtools to extract the sequence for the mapped regions (plus the 200 bp buffer) from the non-human primate genome and to count the number of CpG sites in this region set. Similar to the comparisons between TMS and the EPIC array, we used paired RRBS data for the 96 rhesus macaque samples to directly compare methylation data generated using TMS versus RRBS. To do so, we processed the RRBS data using the same custom pipeline and filtering parameters described for TMS data, with the only modification being that we used the ‘—rrbs’ parameter in TrimGalore to remove unmethylated cytosines artificially introduced during library preparation from the 3’ end of fragments. We merged the filtered TMS and RRBS datasets, resulting in 721,766 CpG sites common to both technologies. As described for the TMS-EPIC array comparison, we then 1) calculated the average per-site methylation level across all samples included in each dataset and compared these vectors using linear models and 2) estimated the R2 value for methylation level estimates derived from each technology for a given individual, and used a t-test to compare this distribution to a distribution for the same analysis where sample identity was permuted (S16 Fig). First, we compared epigenetic age predictions from paired samples that were sequenced on different platforms. We estimated epigenetic age from the PC-based versions of five well-established epigenetic clocks, including the Horvath multi-tissue clock, Hannum blood clock, PhenoAge clock, and telomere length clock. The PC-based versions of these clocks have much higher reliability and less susceptibility to technical noise than the original CpG-site level clocks [73]. We estimated epigenetic age from these clocks using the PC-Clocks R package [114] and calculated the Pearson’s correlation coefficient for estimates from samples generated with TMS versus the EPIC array. Second, we compared tissue-specific effect size estimates between samples generated with RRBS and TMS. Specifically, we asked whether tissue type significantly (FDR < 5%) predicted DNA methylation among the multi-tissue macaque data for each technology, using beta binomial models implemented in the R package ‘aod’. We performed these analyses iteratively to compare a given tissue to all other tissues (for example, comparing liver versus all other tissues to estimate liver-specific effects). We limited this analysis to variably methylated CpG sites (median methylation <90% or >10%). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011667.s001 (XLSX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011667.s002 (XLSX) P-values generated from pairwise t-tests comparing the percentage of reads that were uniquely mapped to the human genome from sequencing data generated using the TMS protocol with varying amounts of input DNA. * represents a significant (p < 0.05) difference in mapping efficiency between conditions. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011667.s003 (XLSX) P-values generated from pairwise t-tests comparing the percentage of cytosines in a CHH context marked as methylated (an estimate of conversion efficiency). * represents a significant (p < 0.05) difference in percent CHH methylation between conditions. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011667.s004 (XLSX) P-values generated from pairwise t-tests comparing the percentage of cytosines in a CHH context marked as methylated (an estimate of conversion efficiency). * represents a significant (p < 0.05) difference in percent CHH methylation between conditions. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011667.s005 (XLSX) Sites are filtered for those within the Twist probe set and covered at>5x coverage in >75% of samples.

Title: Lehman’s Cordless Mason Jar Vacuum Sealer, by Mike in Alaska
URL: https://survivalblog.com/2025/05/23/lehmans-cordless-mason-jar-vacuum-sealer-by-mike-in-alaska/
Time Published: 2025-05-22T13:09:28Z
Full Content:
I recently bought a Mason Jar vacuum sealer from the Lehman’s Non-Electric store located in Kidron, Ohio. The following is my informal review. Disclaimer: I paid full retail price for this jar sealer. Lehman’s has not paid me or otherwise compensated me, nor do I represent them. I am simply offering to readers of the blog our experience with this product. We have bought many items from Lehman’s over the years, from cast iron products, food, candies, to Aladdin Lamps. The quality of their products is what we call “generational quality”; that is, you can pass their products down to the next generation. (Except for the candy and food items. Those don’t get by me for long.) We have an All-American Pressure Canner we bought from Lehman’s several years ago., If you’re going to preserve liquid foods, then use that method and save the Pressure Vacuum canner in this review for prolonging the storage of dry goods and foods. We use the pressure canner for our meats, fish, vegetables, and fruit, since that method is the safest way to preserve those types of foods. For this device, I decided to buy it because it was not very expensive, even with shipping to the interior of Alaska. The total cost was $115.97 and this included the shipping costs of $32.99 and an extra-large pack of new jar lids. It seemed like an inexpensive way to store dry items that we can buy in quantity like cereal, grains, and other stuff that we would buy but not use quickly enough that it wouldn’t go stale sitting on the shelf in the original box or whatever container that the manufacturer shipped it in. For this review, I used a bag of beeswax beads that I had procured a long time ago and felt like it would be a good first time use in learning about this sealer. Now that I’ve had a chance to use it with a product I’m not worried about spoiling or messing up, I am going to start using it to store other items like sugar, flour, and dry food items that we use regularly. Once I’ve put up a number of items, I will put them on the shelf in our storage room. (My garage that has turned into a “root cellar” since it is kept above freezing in the long, dark winters of the arctic, and stays at around 50 degrees to 55 degrees in the summer since it is so well insulated.) The instructions that come with the unit are not going to dazzle you with their brilliance. But then that’s just the mind of a fuzzy-brained old guy, so I’ll let you be the judge of them, should you buy one of these critters. I read them several times before it dawned on me that I was overthinking them. There are apparently other attachments you can buy that allow you to use this vacuum pump on bags and such and so the instructions mix in those operations in the beginning and so I was looking for what was missing; or so I thought. No, not missing, I just didn’t order them and probably won’t since we already have a nice unit that was made for sealing bags of food and such. My next project to seal beyond the bee’s beeswax beads will be my personal mix of nuts, grains, and dehydrated fruit in what I like as a munchy kit for use on the trail or on the road. So, once I read the whole operations manual and realized what they were trying to get across, it turned out to be much easier and simpler than I initially thought. All the inventory, diagrams and such for the accessories should have been listed in the back of the operator’s guide and just get to the good stuff of the basic operation on jars up front. Embarrassing for me to admit, but it is so easy that even a grizzled old caveman (or woman) can do it. Why bee wax? Because my bride of many years who is very wise to my ways and antics said no to food stuff for now. She didn’t understand why I bought that bag of bee’s wax beads in the first place and since it was long ago and far away in another time domain neither do I? But I’m sure it was for a good reason and seemed like a good thing at the time. Besides, why experiment on food that I plan to eat? Next up will be flour and such. Once I figured out how this contraption works, I went ahead and plugged it into the wall wart charging unit. It comes with the charging cord a C-type USB cord with a normal USB plug on one end and the C type on the other end. I happened to have a two-place wall wart charging unit, so I plugged the sealer in and let it charge up until the green light that was blinking when it arrived went to solid green. You could use a computer USB port to charge it with, but also any wall wart that can output 5 volts to charge up the unit will work as well. It took about 20 minutes to fully charge this critter, and I haven’t used it enough yet to see how many cycles it will run until it runs down. Sealing the jar of wax only took about 10 to 15 seconds and I repeatedly did the process just for the practice and yet the charge light is still green. First, if you’re going to be sealing anything you plan to eat then you must first sterilize the jars. The usual hot bath canning method will be the best way to do this, and I highly recommend that you do this. As for the beeswax, I have no plans to eat that stuff, so I didn’t sterilize the jar. The wax came in a zip lock baggie, so I’ll just put it back in the bag and use the jar for real food. Once you have sterilized your jars, lids, and rings just as you would if you were going to pressure cook food stuff set them aside to dry completely. Place whatever you plan to seal like flour, sugar, oats or such in the jar you are using. This machine will seal any regular Mason or Ball jar with the wide-mouth lids or regular mouth lids. The unit came with new lids made by Superb Canning Lids Company, and I used their lids as well as a used Mason lid that I had on the jar to begin with. It didn’t seem to matter which brand of lid I used but the Superb brand was there and in addition to the six lids the unit comes with (3-large and 3- small) I also bought the “Bakers Dozen” package of Superb Lids as well because we are low on lids and they are out of stock up here locally. That package has 12 dozen lids in it in a mix of large and small types. They were not very expensive which for us up here in the hinterboonies is relative to needs and availability. For folks on the outside (the rest of the USA) it is probably not an issue. Fill the jar to just below the rounded top of the jar, place the lid on the jar and use the three-finger method to tighten down the ring. Do not over-tighten as this will prevent a seal from being formed. I did that on purpose just to know that it’s possible to mess this up. Once the lid is set with the ring attached, push the power button in the middle of the pump, simply push the vacuum sealer down on the jar top until it bottoms out. There are some rubber seals inside that unit which are there to seal the jar into the pump. Do not try to seal a jar without the ring on it as the jar will not seal and that lid will remain inside the seal area as the ring comes off. Yeah, I did that. You’ll see at the top of the pump after you push the power button in the center of the pump that there will be a display in blue to indicate the process you want to perform, either Mason Jar, Accessory, External Vac, or Marinating. Just hold pressure on the jar and push the Mason Jar button and let the pump run until it stops. As I said the jars of wax only took about 10 to 15 seconds to seal. Remove the pump and press in the middle of the lid of the jar you just sealed. It should make a popping sound, and this shows that a good seal has been made. When we use the pressure canner the jars will pop as they cool down indicating a good vacuum seal, this is the same as for the lid popping when you seal it with the pump. That’s it, finished. So, is it worth it? That you will need to decide for yourself. It’s fast, it’s simple and it’s inexpensive. I am going to spend the weekend canning (vacuum sealing) some food stuff. I’ll mark and date the jar lids and set them in the storage room and let you know in a few months just how well this experiment has fared. When we go to the store, usually Safeway but occasionally Costco, we don’t buy the larger quantity of items. So, here is my devious plan; go to Costco, get that big bag of macaroni, rice, sugar, or whatever and can it in the jars in amounts that we will consume it in as opposed to opening that bulk bag, jar, or whatever container the stuff comes in and can it in the smaller storage quantity for our current use needs. The problem is that when I go shopping, I don’t go for just a gallon of milk or a loaf of bread. When I go to Costco it is for $400 or more and I try to avoid the bulk size deals that are a better buy in terms of quantity versus cost. We don’t have 10 children to feed, so there’s that. Now I am thinking that all those extra canning jars setting around have a good use and storing the dry stuff I can buy in the bulk size and break down into quantities we would use is where this vacuum sealer may well prove to be a good deal. If you are considering buying one of these units, then I recommend it. It appears to be made of good quality material, it is easy to use and should last a long time if it is kept stored clean. Lehman’s has always stand behind their products and I’ve never had any issues with them for breakage or poor-quality products.

R3 and Solana Foundation today announce a strategic collaboration to bring regulated financial institutions and their real-world assets onto Solana. 0 22 May 2025 Be the first to comment This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra. It expresses the views and opinions of the author. It will deliver the first enterprise-grade, permissioned consensus service offered to the public directly on a Layer 1 network. This brings the institutional TradFi and DeFi worlds into true convergence, marrying the unparalleled reach of R3 into the TradFi ecosystem with the scale, liquidity, and innovation of internet capital markets. As the world’s most used public blockchain, the Solana blockchain offers unmatched performance, low fees, and a vibrant global ecosystem - making it the ideal foundation for the next generation of regulated digital finance.R3 has invited Lily Liu, President of the Solana Foundation, to R3’s Board of Directors, marking a strategic shift for R3 that unites the strengths of public and permissioned blockchains.Solana and R3 will bring regulated assets onto a public blockchain at a time when the RWA sector is at a pivotal juncture: regulatory tailwinds are spurring investor confidence in digital assets, financial institutions are becoming increasingly comfortable with leveraging public networks, and the DeFi sector is maturing. These forces are driving growing demand for high-quality, tokenized assets on public networks.As the world's largest collection of permissioned RWA networks, with over $10 billion in regulated assets on-chain across its platforms, the R3 ecosystem is ideally positioned to meet this demand. R3’s Corda has the most live, in-production use cases and millions of transactions processed daily by leading institutional players. Integrating with Solana’s blockchain will enable these assets to flow to meet the growing demand on public networks, and unlock new settlement options across these ecosystems, including using high-quality stablecoins. Unlike traditional interoperability approaches, this comprehensive integration means private transactions on Corda can be confirmed directly on Solana mainnet, inheriting the network's performance and security, and enabling true transactional atomicity.The collaboration will create a consensus service deployed on Solana to enable native interoperability between R3’s existing Corda platform - as well as other private networks - and Solana, bridging the gap between permissioned and public blockchain ecosystems for the first time. This will enable regulated financial institutions - including banks, financial market infrastructure providers, and asset managers - to fully harness the openness and efficiency of Solana without re-writing their applications or compromising on compliance, security, or asset control.R3 chose Solana as its public Layer-1 substrate and the basis for its new consensus service following an extensive evaluation and technical review of decentralized protocols, selecting Solana for its low transaction fees, speed, scalability, as well as the Solana ecosystem’s robust developer community, and relationships with numerous regulated financial institutions, including Blackrock, Franklin Templeton, and Hamilton Lane which have all deployed regulated assets on the network.Critically, this collaboration simplifies the complexity of managing RWAs on public blockchains - bringing Corda’s proven strengths in identity, privacy, and compliance to a public and permissioned environment. This allows traditional financial institutions to operate with the same control and clarity they expect from enterprise-grade infrastructure, while unlocking the scale and flexibility of a public network. “This is a major step forward for the institutional adoption of public blockchain," said Lily Liu, President of the Solana Foundation. "R3’s decision to bring its regulated financial network onto Solana is powerful validation that public blockchains have reached institutional readiness. With Solana's unmatched performance, enterprise-grade permissioning, and growing roster of regulated assets, we're not just witnessing convergence between TradFi and DeFi - we're enabling it. This collaboration signifies that the future of capital markets will be built on public infrastructure. We’re thrilled that the Solana ecosystem is leading the way."David E. Rutter, Founder and CEO of R3 commented: “We’ve never pursued blockchain for its own sake - our mission is to solve real financial problems. After years of laying the groundwork, R3 is ready to bring our experience and our network of regulated financial institutions towards a new public future with one of the best and most trusted public ecosystems - Solana. This is more than a milestone; it’s a strategic realignment for the entire industry. We know DeFi isn’t coming to TradFi, so it’s up to us to build the connective infrastructure that links these two ecosystems. This is about adapting to deliver real-world utility, institutional-grade readiness, and shaping the long-term future of regulated markets.”Clearstream, a leading post-trade infrastructure provider at the forefront of digitizing financial markets, is a long-standing user of R3’s Corda which underpins its digital collateral solution. Jens Hachmeister, Head of Issuer Services & New Digital Markets at Clearstream, commented: “Tokenization isn’t just about digitizing assets - it’s about building scalable, global infrastructure where real-world assets can interact directly and securely, no matter where investors are located. The convergence of public and private blockchains is no longer a future promise - it’s happening now. This is a generational shift in how value moves, and a compelling moment for any institution looking to enter the crypto space. We’re excited for what’s ahead.”

Title: Ant International Helps HSBC Hong Kong Offer Tokenized Deposits
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/news/banking/2025/ant-international-helps-hsbc-hong-kong-offer-tokenized-deposits/
Time Published: 2025-05-22T12:28:17Z

Ant International has teamed with HSBC on the bank’s tokenized deposit service in Hong Kong. The service is designed to support treasury management via real-time, “always-on” Hong Kong and U.S. dollar payments between corporate wallets held by an HSBC Hong Kong client, according to a Thursday (May 22) press release. In addition, the service is also Hong Kong’s first bank-led, blockchain-based settlement service, and follows a pilot test between HSBC and Ant International on Ant’s Whale platform. “We are very excited to work with an industry leader like HSBC, who shares the belief that tokenisation is the key to bridging the stability of traditional banking with the efficiency of blockchain, to enable real-time treasury management,” Kelvin Li, general manager of platform tech at Ant International, said in the release. “As a tech connector in the fast-evolving financial services industry, our banking partnerships are expanding from tokenization to AI-driven global FX and liquidity initiatives. We look forward to working with more public and private-sector partners to unlock more transparent, accessible and efficient treasury management solutions for businesses worldwide.” The partnership is happening at a moment when, as covered here last month, money and assets are experiencing a transformation thanks to tokenization on the blockchain. “On-chain tokenization is moving from concept to practice, with players like Visa, Mastercard, J.P. Morgan, and other commercial banks exploring or piloting real-world tokenized payment and financial systems,” PYMNTS wrote. “For chief financial officers and corporate treasurers, tokenization isn’t just a tech issue; it could represent a capital strategy shift.” BlackRock CEO Larry Fink also wants all assets to be tokenized and tradable online, telling shareholders: “Every stock, every bond, every fund — every asset — can be tokenized.” At its most basic level, tokenization refers to representing real-world assets like fiat currency, securities and investment contracts as digital tokens on a distributed ledger. From there, these tokens can be transferred, programmed, or settled in ways traditional systems don’t allow. Tokenization “isn’t a cryptocurrency play,” that report added, but rather a way for businesses and financial services stakeholders to move value faster, cheaper, and more securely across networks. It’s also a way to modernize money movement while democratizing investment access to institutional-grade products. “Banks are in the state where they are thinking about blockchains as public infrastructure that they need to rely on,” Chainalysis Co-founder and CEO Jonathan Levin told PYMNTS. “Back in 2014 … cryptocurrency only meant blockchains that had native cryptocurrency tokens. Today, people are putting all types of financial instruments on the blockchain.” This Week in AI: The Agentic Web, AI-Native Devices and Search Tools Trump Threatens to Raise Tariffs on Apple and European Union The Digital Asset Primer: Why Equity Markets Are Being Tokenized Report: SBA Staffing Cuts Reduce Service to Entrepreneurs We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Hits 2-Week High as $BTC Nears $112K. BTC Bull Token to Follow?
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-etfs-rally-after-135k-btc-prediction-btc-bull-token-next/
Time Published: 2025-05-22T12:06:54Z

BlackRock ETFs have experienced a two-week high while Bitcoin is pushing to its first-ever $112K price mark. Projects like BTC Bull Token could rally next. Farside Investors published the numbers, showing that IBIT’s net inflows peaked at $530.6M, the highest since May 5th $531.2M. The ETF tracking Trader T also highlighted BlackRock’s record Bitcoin intake, as it peaked at 4,931 $BTC, the highest volume since January 23. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas: ‘Classic feeding frenzy in effect, new ATHs will do that,’ referring to Bitcoin’s recent performance, which is nothing short of inspirational. What does this mean and, perhaps more importantly, how can you leverage this bull run through BTC Bull Token, which promises free Bitcoin? Let’s dig in! The BlackRock ETF rally tells a larger story—that of Bitcoin’s record-breaking rally, sprinkled with modest swings, but overall very bullish. $BTC hit its peak at $111,746 on May 22 at 7:00AM and, while it lost $1K in the meantime, it doesn’t seem that the bull run is anywhere near over. Titan of Crypto’s X prediction of a $135K $BTC for 2025 is more than reasonable, given the recent Bitcoin adoption trend among public and private institutions. However, it turns out that Titan’s $135K prediction is among the tamest ones, as technical analyst Gert van Lagen envisions a $320K Bitcoin by the end of 2025. Peter Brandt, veteran Bitcoin trader, shares Lagen’s optimism, stating: I think it is wonderful Bitcoin is making ATHs. I am long. […] On track maybe for top of $125,000 to $150,000 by the end of August? —Peter Brandt, X That being said, despite Bitcoin’s 30-day pump of 25%, investors should still show caution and patience, according to Joao Wedson, CEO of Alphractal: Public obsession with breaking the ATH matters more than risk management — setting the stage for traps targeting both bulls and bears. —Joao Wedson, X Caution or not, though, you should know that Bitcoin’s steroid-fueled chart run is bound to rally some of the best altcoins on the market today. One such altcoin is BTC Bull Token, one of the most promising meme coins in 2025. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is a meme project that fuels its run by offering you free $BTC airdrops, so long as you hold your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet. The project was born from the idea that Bitcoin is an unstoppable force that will eventually breach the $1M price ceiling. Following the same line of thought, a $250K price point for 2025 isn’t out of the question either. The presale is understandably pumping, with over $6.1M raised since inception and a token price of $0.002525. According to the same projection, you should expect a more modest ROI of 160% by the end of 2025, if the $0.006467 prediction comes true. In this context, the airdrops are the cherry on top, as the project will reward holders with real $BTC every time Bitcoin breaches through predetermined price points ($150K and $200K) With such a low token price and the fact that the project is still in presale, BTC Bull Token appears to be a good investment opportunity, especially in a market where even Ethereum is witnessing consistent gains. If you decide to catch this bull by the horns, check out our ‘how to buy $BTCBULL’ guide today to streamline the acquisition process. We’ve no reason to think the Bitcoin bull is coming out of the china shop yet. It’s definitely resting, though, as Bitcoin appears to consolidate its position around $110,700-ish. But given the avalanche of Bitcoin-endorsing policies coming from the White House in Q1 2025 and the mass adoption over the last year, it’s safe to say that 2025 will be Bitcoin’s time to shine. So, don’t get blindsided by the King coin’s break, and don’t ignore potential honeypots like the BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL). Remember: this is not financial advice, so don’t take anything you read for granted.

Title: D&AD Awards 2025: who won what?

Time Published: 2025-05-22T11:52:00Z

With the judging process changing dramatically this year, which agencies won big in the D&AD Awards 2025? With the judging process changing dramatically this year, which agencies won big in the D&AD Awards 2025? For many, it's the biggest and most nerve-wracking night in the creative calendar. D&AD held its 63rd awards ceremony last night (Thursday 22 May) at London's Southbank Centre and handed out a record-breaking 668 Pencils across all categories. Most significantly, three coveted Black Pencils—the highest D&AD accolade—were awarded to groundbreaking work that exemplified the year's themes of commercial impact and narrative excellence. With no quota system for Pencil awards, D&AD maintains its reputation for uncompromising standards. In some years, no Black Pencils are given out at all, making the awarding of three a significant achievement for these winners: Designing Paris 2024 by W Conran Design won in Graphic Design for its innovative approach to sports marketing. The judges highlighted how the design created a unifying yet distinctive feel that successfully merged heritage elements with modern sporting aesthetics. A$AP Rocky - Tailor Swif by Iconoclast LA won in Music Videos, exemplifying the year's emphasis on narrative storytelling. The winning work featured long-form storytelling where music was integral to the narrative structure rather than an afterthought, demonstrating how narrative arcs can transcend different mediums and artistic disciplines. Spreadbeats by FCB New York won in Digital Marketing for what the agency described as "Innovation through nostalgic technologies." This work aligned with a trend of brands cleverly inserting themselves into events, sports, and games through inventive approaches. This year's judging process marked a major evolution in D&AD's approach. Jurors emphasised the critical importance of commercial viability, seeking work that demonstrates tangible business impact and drives meaningful behavioural change rather than celebrating creativity for its own sake. In other words, if there was ever a danger that agencies would make work primarily to win awards rather than serve the client, that's now history. In 2025, you have to do both. "This year's awards celebrated the power of design not just as a form of art but as a catalyst for commercial success and behavioural change," noted Dara Lynch, CEO of D&AD. "The idea is that innovative ideas must possess both aesthetic appeal and tangible impact." The Black Pencil winners perfectly embodied this philosophy. For instance, W Conran Design's 'Designing Paris 2024' was recognised for illustrating how design thinking can transform an entire city's attitude and behaviour. Judges from the Graphic Design category praised it as "a breakthrough for sports marketing and traditional sports marketing aesthetics," noting its playful yet scalable approach that successfully blended heritage with contemporary sport. Alongside commercial effectiveness, jurors were looking for exceptional craft. From Radio and Audio to Film, their message was clear: in an increasingly automated creative landscape, looking good simply isn't enough. "The resurgence of craftsmanship stands as a reminder that in an era of automation, true excellence lies in the thoughtful execution of ideas," Dara explained. "It's not enough just to look good; true creative excellence must also leave a lasting impression." This was particularly evident in D&AD's new Creator Content category, where judges called for clearer definitions of craft excellence and higher standards in content creation. The winning entries all demonstrated work that creates meaningful impact and genuinely engages audiences. The 2025 D&AD Awards achieved unprecedented global reach, with entries submitted from 86 countries worldwide—the highest number in the awards' history. This international participation resulted in over 30,000 pieces of work from 11,689 total entries. "It's exciting to see so many brands and companies refreshing their identities," said D&AD trustee Lisa Smith, global executive creative director at Jones Knowles Ritchie. "Judging has been challenging. Too many entries follow the same established design codes and trends, making everything start to look and feel alike, regardless of category. The work that stood out was the kind that breaks away from the expected: inspiring, well-crafted, and truly fit for purpose." The awards ceremony also recognised outstanding agency performance across various specialisations. FCB New York claimed the prestigious title of Advertising Agency of the Year, while Serviceplan Design was named Design Agency of the Year for the first time. DIVISION continued their remarkable winning streak, earning Production Company of the Year for the fifth consecutive year. In the network categories, Serviceplan took home Independent Network of the Year, while FCB was also named Network of the Year. Apple received recognition as Client of the Year, acknowledging its commitment to creative excellence across its marketing initiatives. The 2025 D&AD President's Award went to Koichiro Tanaka, founder of interdisciplinary creative boutique Projector. Chosen by D&AD President Kwame Taylor-Hayford, Tanaka was recognised for his pioneering work at the intersection of storytelling, interactivity, and craft, which helped define a formative era in digital creativity. "I'm very honoured," Tanaka said. "To receive this award from D&AD, which has lived longer than I have, and to feel part of its long story is now something I live with. Being recognised with care and an open heart is a special thing to me." Kwame, who is co-founder of Kin, explained his choice: "Koichiro Tanaka's pioneering work at the intersection of storytelling, interactivity, and craft helped define a formative era in digital creativity. His career journey, bold ideas, and meticulous attention to detail have been a constant source of personal inspiration." Beyond the three Black Pencils, the ceremony awarded three White Pencils, 48 Yellow Pencils, 176 Graphite Pencils and 434 Wood Pencils. Additionally, four Future Impact Pencils were awarded, recognising work that demonstrates potential for significant positive change. The diverse range of winning work spanned 44 categories, from traditional advertising and design to emerging areas like Gaming & Virtual Worlds and the newly introduced Creator Content category. Craft categories collectively garnered 198 Pencils, underscoring the year's emphasis on exceptional execution. The complete list of Pencil-winning work and shortlisted entries are showcased on the D&AD website, while the official D&AD Rankings will be released alongside the digital D&AD Annual. These rankings provide definitive tables of the most successful companies, networks, countries and clients based on the awards results.

Title: Mantle Partners Republic Technologies to Pioneer Institutional mETH Integration

Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. This article should not be regarded as investment advice. Mantle, a pioneering on-chain ecosystem revolutionizing the DeFi space, has partnered strategically with Republic Technologies, the Ethereum (“ETH”) treasury of publicly listed Canadian company Beyond Medical Technologies Inc. According to an official announcement today, the partnership will see Republic Technologies integrating Mantle’s mETH Protocol to foster Defi innovation. Following this partnership, Mantle’s mETH will become the first liquid staking token to be held on the balance sheet of a publicly listed company, marking a major milestone in institutional cryptocurrency adoption. Nonetheless, Republic Technologies has disclosed plans to delegate a significant portion of its ETH holdings to Mantle’s mETH Protocol and will hold mETH as a yield-bearing, liquid staking token on its balance sheet. While this move highlights growing investor conviction in Ethereum-native yield infrastructure, it reflects Republic Technologies’ deepening alignment with the Mantle ecosystem. With this partnership, Republic Technologies seeks to establish a new institutional paradigm by building a treasury strategy around Ethereum, which is seen as the foundational layer for smart contracts, tokenization, and decentralized financial settlement. Per the announcement, Republic Technologies adopts an approach anchored in Ethereum’s role as the infrastructure layer powering blockchain innovation and real-world enterprise integration. This is unlike Bitcoin-focused strategies employed by firms like Strategy and Metaplanet, whose reserves are largely Bitcoin-based. As such, Republic Technologies will be accumulating ETH as its core balance sheet asset, advancing the growth of its underlying healthcare technology businesses while offering institutional-grade exposure to digital assets for all shareholders. Daniel Liu, the CEO of Republic Technologies, commented on this,s saying; “We hold strong conviction that Ethereum is the institutional chain, with ETH serving as the digital fuel powering global financial systems…Our initial entry through Mantle’s Scout Program helped us gain early exposure to the broader Mantle ecosystem, where our alignment with mETH Protocol came as a natural next step.” “More than 50 established incumbents—including BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, PayPal, and Visa—have already built services on Ethereum. Wall Street has made its decision. Our role now is to extend the benefits of this macro tailwind to a broader base of institutional and retail participants worldwide,” Liu added. The firm’s decision to establish an Ethereum treasury has fueled its decision to integrate Mantle’s mETH Protocol. This DeFi platform has quickly emerged as one of the leading platforms in Ethereum liquid staking and restaking. Designed with institutional-grade capital efficiency and composability in mind, mETH enables institutions to access Ethereum-native yield through a fully composable and capital-efficient framework. Jonathan Low, the Growth Lead at mETH Protocol has also commented on the partnership saying; “Republic Technologies’ participation highlights mETH Protocol’s ability to support institutional strategies built natively on Ethereum…As demand accelerates for ETH-native yield and utility, we remain focused on building resilient infrastructure that long-term allocators can trust.” Following efforts to boost mETH’s adoption while offering users the opportunity to spend, borrow, and invest with mETH across traditional payment rails, Mantle is making plans to extend mETH’s utility across traditional finance through Mantle Banking. This initiative seeks to integrate mETH into fiat rails, credit products, and conventional payment systems.

Title: Ryan Reynolds-Linked MNTN Goes Public at $16 Per Share to Grow Connected TV Ads

We deliver! Get curated industry news straight to your inbox. Subscribe to Adweek newsletters. Connected TV advertising firm MNTN is making its market debut on the New York Stock Exchange. The company announced a $16-per-share IPO on May 21, the high end of its expected range. The share price puts MNTN’s valuation at around $1.2 billion. Actor Ryan Reynolds has served as MNTN’s chief creative officer since the company bought his creative shop, Maximum Effort, in 2021. MNTN divested from Maximum Effort in March, but Reynolds stayed on as CCO. However, Reynolds didn’t travel to New York for the IPO this week, MNTN founder and chief executive officer Mark Douglas told ADWEEK. MNTN aims to capitalize on the demand the company has seen for performance-focused CTV ad placements by going public, Douglas said. MNTN’s advertisers are primarily small and medium-sized businesses, with 96% using the ad platform to experiment with TV advertising for the first time. According to bankers’ estimates, there was demand for 14 times the shares that MNTN had available to sell, Douglas said, which helped bolster the case for an IPO. “The market responded,” he said. “A lot of our customers depend on Google, Meta, and now MNTN to help drive the growth in their business. So we want to be transparent in terms of the strength of our business, [in terms of] scale and so forth, to those companies.” MNTN’s offering consists of 11.7 million shares in total, with 8.4 million from the company itself and another 3.3 million from existing stockholders. Stockholders also gave underwriters—which include Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, and Evercore—the option to buy an additional 1.8 million shares at the initial price within 30 days of the IPO. While MNTN didn’t make an overall profit in 2024, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (also known ads EBITDA) were $39 million, Douglas noted. He expects that to increase in 2025. MNTN Is Selling Ryan Reynolds’ Agency Maximum Effort, SEC Filing Shows As it eyes the next phase of growth, MNTN plans to continue focusing on small and medium-sized businesses, Douglas said. The company will also invest in product innovation using artificial intelligence. “We like large brands also—we have some of those,” Douglas said about MNTN’s mix of clients. “But in the time it takes to get one of those, you can add 6,000 smaller brands on the platform.” Douglas sees MNTN’s role as a matchmaker rather than as an advertising company, connecting consumers with brands and products they might love through 30-second ads on popular streaming platforms like HBO Max, Bravo, and ESPN. “It’s a really impactful medium,” Douglas said. Douglas founded the company in 2009 as SteelHouse, rebranding to MNTN in 2021. Kathryn Lundstrom is Adweek's sustainability editor.

Title: 8 Best AI SEO Tools for 2025 (Tested Firsthand)
URL: https://www.semrush.com/blog/best-ai-seo-tools/
Time Published: 2025-05-22T10:43:00Z
Full Content:
As a content marketer, I regularly use AI SEO software to analyze data faster, optimize content, and achieve higher rankings. But with so many tools making bold claims, it's hard to separate the genuinely useful from the overhyped. That's why I’ve tested dozens of AI SEO tools myself and narrowed them down to the 8 that actually deliver results. Here's my detailed review of each. Spoiler alert: here are my favorite AI tools for SEO: 1. ContentShake AI for generating SEO-friendly content 2. Semrush Copilot for personalized SEO recommendations 3. Clearscope for SEO content optimization 4. SurferSEO for advanced SEO content creation 5. ChatGPT for brainstorming and data analysis 6. Copy.ai for automating your SEO workflows 7. SERP Gap Analyzer for finding keyword opportunities 8. Perplexity for conducting online content research Let’s look at each of them in detail. Semrush Content Toolkit is the smart writing tool we've developed at Semrush. It combines AI with our proprietary SEO data to help you create entire articles, find content ideas, and write in your unique brand voice. I recommend using this tool for creating SEO-friendly drafts, especially if you’re not an SEO expert. I love that it finds your target keywords and analyzes SERPs so that it can optimize your content for search intent—something SEO beginners usually struggle with. Let’s look at a sample workflow. First, enter a high-level content idea and get dozens of data-driven keyword and topic suggestions. Next, click ‘Start writing’ and choose whether you want to create an SEO content brief or generate a full blog post from scratch. This will open the setup window, where you can adjust your target keywords, content length, and brand voice. Check the ‘Add an extra SEO boost’ box for advanced SERP analysis and click ‘Create article’. In just a few minutes, your draft will be ready. You can then use the blog editor to add more original ideas and further enhance your content. Content Toolkit also includes an integrated AI chat, an AI image generator, and a content optimization tool to improve your copy. Pros Cons Very easy to use—ideal for beginners with little SEO experience Less suited to large teams and enterprise users Uses Semrush’s data to optimize AI-generated content Some stock images suggested by the tool may not always be relevant Covers the entire content creation cycle, from ideation to publishing Semrush Copilot is an AI-powered assistant that offers personalized recommendations based on your SEO performance. Copilot analyzes all of your Semrush data from tools like Site Audit, Backlink Gap, and Keyword Gap.. It then consolidates the issues and action items into tailored recommendation cards, related to your keyword rankings, domain authority, organic competitors, and more. I use it to regularly check SEO recommendations and spot potential issues, such as with technical SEO or backlinks. When I see a recommendation or alert, I head to each specific tool to investigate it further: Pros Cons Makes it easy to prioritize action items for SEO performance Exclusive to Semrush users: not compatible with other tools Helps navigate the many tools in Semrush’s suite While the reports provide a lot of useful data, some users may want more in-depth summaries Offers daily alerts to keep you posted about real-time concerns Converts data into actionable insights in order of priority Clearscope is an AI content platform that helps with keyword research, content optimization, and analytics. The content optimization feature offers somewhat similar benefits to other AI content tools. But the workflow is different. When you add an existing URL and your target keyword, the tool will analyze the published page for you. It will then provide suggestions for improvement, such as: The tool also helps with topic research and generates basic SEO reports. For example, it tracks your ranking positions and provides high-level content analytics metrics. Pros Cons Automates the process of building content briefs and optimizing content More expensive than most SEO content creation tools and has no free trial Keep tabs on published content to find opportunities to refresh content Doesn’t offer many content creation possibilities Provides content analytics, which simplifies performance analysis Content analytics and keyword research tools are somewhat basic, and the content grade simply checks if you’ve covered all related keywords SurferSEO offers a suite of SEO tools to discover keywords, find content ideas, create outlines, optimize content, and more. Many content teams use it for content optimization. Similar to Clearscope, it analyzes the organic results for your target keywords and makes content structure recommendations. Surfer also offers some useful features for search engine optimizers, including a topical map, an SERP analyzer, and a content audit tool. A word of caution: I’d be careful with metrics like optimal content length and the recommended number of headings. While they might be useful suggestions, you’ll know best if they make sense for your particular content piece. Finally, while you can generate full articles, they each cost an additional $19, with a maximum of 30 articles on the cheapest plan. Pros Cons Easy to use when working with content writers, as it helps to track keywords in your drafts Might not be the best choice for beginners and folks looking for more automation as it involves more steps and requires more SEO experience Sleek and modern UI Limited credits make it difficult to use freely The Google Docs extension makes it easy to work anywhere The Google Docs extension can get a bit buggy Lots of data-driven tools useful for SEOs and content marketers The Content Editor doesn’t let you adjust your targets 💡 Find out who comes out on top in our ContentShake AI vs SurferSEO comparison. In the screenshot above, ChatGPT claims it can do a variety of SEO tasks. But I would take this with a pinch of salt. ChatGPT, along with other AI chatbots like Gemini and Claude, is amazing for brainstorming and analysis. But it doesn’t have any real-time SEO data and is not adapted for long-form content creation. So, I’d only use it together with an actual SEO tool that has access to SERP data. That said, ChatGPT is useful for other SEO tasks such as: Let’s look at an example. I downloaded a list of keywords from Semrush, uploaded the CSV file to ChatGPT, and asked it to group my keywords by category: Here’s the result: This is just one of many examples of how ChatGPT can save you time with SEO tasks—as long as you already have the data you need. Pros Cons Powerful AI with integrated data analysis features Doesn't offer real-time SEO data and specialized SEO output ChatGPT's best model (ChatGPT 4-o) is free for all users The interface is not optimized for long-form content creation Beginner-friendly interface and affordable price point Prone to factual errors and inaccurate responses 💡 Check out how ChatGPT compares to ContentShake AI. Copy.ai is an AI-powered automation platform with content creation tools for sales and marketing needs. Like other AI writing tools, it was originally used primarily for content creation. But it has recently shifted its focus towards automation. Copy.ai's new standout feature is its ability to create multi-step workflows for SEO processes. You can use the library of workflow templates for different use cases, such as writing a blog post, an SEO brief, and so on. The tool also lets you design custom workflows to automate different parts of your SEO setup. Here’s what it looks like: Pros Cons The unique workflow creation feature works great for enterprise SEO teams and large agencies with lots of processes It’s somewhat hard to use and might take a while to figure out Offers a sleek and modern UI Doesn’t offer any SEO data Integrates with 2,000+ tools SERP Gap Analyzer helps you discover low-difficulty keywords for your content plan. You can use it to find relevant keywords with higher search volume and less competition. This is especially helpful if you’re in a saturated niche and have to compete with lots of high-authority websites. Just enter your site and a seed topic to run an analysis. The tool then analyzes the search results for multiple relevant keywords and displays the ranking difficulty for each keyword. You can access other insights such as global search volume, SERP weaknesses, and more. Pros Cons Solves one of the key SEO pains—finding high-potential content topics Doesn’t integrate with most other SEO tools, except Semrush Generates briefs, outlines, and other content Can be a bit confusing to figure out Documents SERP analysis in detail to guide SEO efforts Perplexity is a conversational AI tool that’s connected to the Internet. It lets you parse the web, find information quickly, and conduct deep web research. Wondering why I included this tool in a list of SEO software? Because effective SEO is closely connected to quality content. And quality content needs fresh information and useful examples. I often use Perplexity to find out in minutes what could otherwise take hours of scouring web sources. For example: imagine I need to find an example of a content marketing campaign for small businesses for an article I’m writing. Perplexity will use various online sources and instantly suggest interesting ideas: Pros Cons Conducts image and video search There’s a limited number of questions that you can ask in a day on the free plan Organizes research with collections of multiple threads Limited to research and doesn’t serve very well for content creation Performs focused research on specific sites, such as YouTube, Reddit, etc. Sometimes hallucinates AI SEO tools use artificial intelligence to automate and fast-track SEO processes, such as keyword research, SERP analysis, and content creation. They can help you make better data-based decisions, increase productivity, and save time on routine tasks. Earlier this year, I surveyed over 2,500 small businesses and asked them about their experience with AI. And guess what? 68% of companies report higher SEO and content marketing ROI when using AI. There has been a lot of talk lately about Google “penalizing” AI-generated content. Let’s get this sorted once and for all. Google doesn’t care if it’s AI copy or not. It cares only about your content being genuine, useful, and relevant. Here’s what else they say: “Poor quality content isn't a new challenge for Google Search to deal with. We've been tackling poor quality content created both by humans and automation for years.” We’ve further proven that AI-generated content ranks nearly as well as human-written copy—as long as it offers value and original insights. I wouldn’t recommend relying solely on AI to create content for SEO and content creation. Why? Because AI doesn’t have the unique topical expertise that you need to create compelling content. But using AI as a tool to create content under your supervision and with your input? Or leveraging it to generate content ideas, cluster keywords, and analyze SEO data? Why not! That’s a wrap on my weeks of testing and shortlisting my favorite AI SEO tools. The key takeaway? Choose a tool that suits your specific needs and context. For example: Remember: there’s a limit to what AI tools can do. Use them to get rid of routine tasks, and to support your work, not replace it, and you won’t be disappointed.

Title: Time To Buy Adobe Stock?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Photo illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE), a global frontrunner in creative software and digital experiences, has consistently achieved strong financial outcomes over the years due to innovation-driven growth. However, the stock’s performance during the past five years has been lackluster, as it is presently at almost the same level it occupied in May 2020! Although some investors may see its valuation as moderate or even somewhat expensive relative to the broader market, Adobe’s operational performance, profitability, and financial health provide a more compelling narrative. We examine Adobe’s valuation, growth, profitability, financial stability, and resilience during economic downturns to aid investors in determining whether it’s time to buy or exercise caution with the ADBE stock. As an aside, see Why Buy Microsoft Stock? At first glance, Adobe may seem slightly overvalued in comparison to broader market metrics. Its valuation multiples—based on the current stock price and most recent financials filed on March 26—suggest a neutral stance. While it is not trading at a notable discount, Adobe is not overvalued enough to discourage long-term investors, especially when viewed through the perspective of its solid balance sheet and earnings growth. Notably, Adobe's price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios of 7.3 times and 23.8 times demonstrate confidence in its future, even if they are somewhat higher than market averages. Investors paying a premium now are doing so for a company that has traditionally delivered double-digit growth, high margins, and consistent innovation. We see a potential upside of over 30% based on our analysis of Adobe's valuation. Adobe's revenue performance has been especially noteworthy. Over the last three years, Adobe has increased its revenue at an average annual rate of 10.9%. In the previous twelve months alone, revenues surged 10.5%, rising from $20 billion to $22 billion. The company’s most recent quarter also revealed a 10.3% year-over-year revenue increase, jumping from $5.2 billion to $5.7 billion. These statistics confirm Adobe's capability to maintain its leadership in creative and digital tools while diversifying into new growth areas such as artificial intelligence. Profitability is another key highlight. Adobe reported $8.0 billion in operating income, with a strong 36.3% operating margin. Operating cash flow was even more robust at $9.4 billion, resulting in a 42.5% cash flow margin. Meanwhile, net income reached $6.8 billion, resulting in a 30.6% net margin. These figures illustrate Adobe's remarkable efficiency and its skill in converting revenues into genuine, scalable earnings — qualities that are highly valued in uncertain markets. Adobe's balance sheet highlights its operational discipline. The company possesses $6.6 billion in debt compared to a market capitalization of $182 billion, resulting in a conservative debt-to-equity ratio of less than 4.0%. Even more impressive is its liquidity: Adobe has $7.4 billion in cash and equivalents, which makes up 24.8% of its $30 billion in total assets. This strong financial foundation affords the flexibility to invest in R&D, pursue strategic acquisitions, and endure economic challenges. With substantial free cash flow and minimal debt, Adobe is well-positioned to manage competitive pressures and economic uncertainties. Its solid capital structure allows it to consistently return value to shareholders, whether via share buybacks or reinvestment in future growth initiatives. Although Adobe excels in most financial metrics, its history during economic downturns reveals some weaknesses. During the 2022 inflation shock, Adobe’s stock plummeted 60.0%, from a peak of $688 (Nov 2021) to $275 (Sept 2022) — a considerably sharper decline than the 25.4% decrease in the S&P 500. The stock has yet to reclaim its previous high, reaching a maximum of $634.76 (Feb 2024) before settling at current levels. In past crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, Adobe experienced a 25.6% drop, swiftly bouncing back to its pre-crisis high within months. During the 2008 financial crisis, Adobe fell by 66.7% and took approximately five years to fully recover. These trends demonstrate that while Adobe can rebound strongly, it is not immune to significant declines during global shocks — an important factor for more risk-averse investors. Despite its volatility during downturns, Adobe's overall performance continues to be extremely appealing. Its remarkable growth rate, profitability, and robust financials make a compelling argument for long-term investment. While the valuation is not a screaming deal, it reflects a business that consistently provides value and innovation at scale. For investors willing to adopt a long-term perspective, Adobe presents a high-quality growth opportunity with established leadership in the creative and digital software sector. Those who are able to handle short-term volatility might find the current levels to be an attractive entry point for a company likely to gain from ongoing digital transformation, AI integration, and enterprise software demand. That being said, investing in a single stock like Adobe carries inherent risks. Conversely, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, composed of 30 stocks, has a history of substantially outperforming the S&P 500 over the last four years. What accounts for this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; a less turbulent experience, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Forget tariffs: These are the next fronts in the trade war
URL: https://qz.com/us-china-trade-war-tariff-nvidia-huawei-openai-deepseek-1851781781
Time Published: 2025-05-22T09:00:00Z

The U.S. and China have stepped back from tariff brinkmanship for now — but don’t mistake handshakes for harmony. The real trade fight is just beginning, and it’s moving into murkier terrain: microchips, AI infrastructure, and data sovereignty. And neither side is going to back down from the fierce contest over who controls the future of technology. While tariffs still loom large, both sides have agreed to a temporary ceasefire and a framework to bring sky-high levies back down to earth. But the next front in the trade war isn’t about crates of soybeans or textile factories. It’s about who owns the rails of tomorrow’s digital economy — and who gets boxed out. The U.S. and China have been circling — and increasingly clashing over — critical AI technologies for roughly a decade. Washington has heightened controls on semiconductor exports, limiting China’s access to advanced AI chips and pressuring allies to follow suit. Beijing is doubling down on self-reliance, retaliating with restrictions on critical minerals and squeezing the parts of the supply chain it still dominates. “There are a lot of issues [the trade framework] doesn’t address,” Susan Shirk, a professor at the University of California, San Diego School of Global Policy and Strategy, said in an interview. “The tech tensions are going to be a very high priority.” The Trump administration recently rolled back the Biden-era AI diffusion rule, which regulated global distribution of advanced AI technology — a move praised by top CEOs that has cracked open a lucrative market for U.S. tech giants. Now, companies such as Nvidia (NVDA) are cleared to ship millions of high-performance GPUs to countries including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, supercharging those nations’ ambitions to become regional AI powerhouses. The moves into the Middle East contrast starkly with Washington’s approach toward China. Since 2022, the U.S. has been methodically severing Beijing’s access to the most advanced semiconductors and the tools needed to manufacture them, targeting the building blocks of AI and next-gen military systems. Those export controls, first implemented under President Joe Biden, have continued to varying degrees in President Donald Trump’s second administration. Now, the scope of restrictions is poised to widen. Policymakers in Washington are weighing measures that go beyond simply blocking hardware sales and moving into the realm of research and collaboration. That includes monitoring cloud infrastructure partnerships, joint academic projects, and potential third-country workarounds. China isn’t swinging back with blunt instruments like tariffs. It’s opting for precision hits. Late last year, Beijing imposed export controls on critical minerals such as gallium and germanium — both vital for chipmaking and EV production. And behind the scenes, China is pouring billions into building its tech lifeboat. The country’s top chipmakers — such as Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) and Yangtze Memory Technologies (YMTC) — are quietly expanding capacity, even under the weight of U.S. export controls. China’s leadership knows that even if the country can’t leapfrog the U.S. in the near term, it can at least build a parallel tech ecosystem — one resilient enough to survive sanctions, export bans, or a full-scale decoupling. No two companies better illustrate the stakes and asymmetries than China’s Huawei and America’s Nvidia. Huawei has become the face of China’s tech ambitions — and of U.S. attempts to stifle them. Last week, the Commerce Department warned that Huawei’s Ascend chips are subject to sweeping export controls. Then, China warned Tuesday that the move “seriously undermined the consensus” that the two countries reached when they agreed to pause tariffs, suggesting China might retaliate. Huawei, long seen as the face of China’s tech rise, was hit hard by U.S. sanctions in 2019. But, denied access to U.S. chips and software, the company didn’t fold — it pivoted. It partnered with SMIC to develop chips for its Mate 60 Pro smartphones and is now pushing its Ascend AI chips as homegrown alternatives to Nvidia’s. Huawei’s chips aren’t on par with Nvidia’s, but they’re part of Beijing’s “tech independence” push. Meanwhile, Nvidia, whose high-end GPUs power almost every leading AI model, has become a geopolitical linchpin. The U.S. has repeatedly restricted its ability to sell to China, citing military concerns. Now, Nvidia walks a tightrope: maintaining global dominance while complying with U.S. restrictions. How Washington treats Nvidia is a window into the Trump administration’s broader strategy. The U.S. wants to preserve Nvidia’s status without letting China piggyback on it. Huawei and Nvidia are mirrored chess pieces in this larger game. The chip war is about hardware, but the software battle is just as critical. The U.S. leads in large foundation models, with OpenAI, Anthropic, and others training massive models on U.S.-based infrastructure. These are tightly controlled via APIs and export rules — a “controlled openness” approach designed to balance innovation with national security. OpenAI is the crown jewel of the U.S. AI stack — not just because it makes ChatGPT, but because it helped kick off an AI arms race in which the rest of the world is scrambling to catch up. But China is countering with open-source models, the most notable being DeepSeek, from China’s Moonshot AI, which rattled Silicon Valley earlier this year. By releasing training weights and model architecture, DeepSeek sidesteps export restrictions and helps build domestic capacity. DeepSeek and OpenAI offer a compelling contrast in how China and the U.S. are positioning themselves in the next phase of the tech war: not just around chips and hardware, but around AI capabilities, open-source strategy, and control of foundational models. When DeepSeek’s “R1” model dropped early this year, it stunned the market. Despite running on less powerful hardware, it achieved performance levels that were previously thought to be exclusive to U.S. firms. Nvidia stock dropped 18% in a day — a $589 billion market cap loss — reflecting investor fear that efficient models could reduce the demand for high-end GPUs. But what makes DeepSeek especially important is that it shows China is adapting, not just reacting. “If each nation’s current trajectory holds … the battle for AI supremacy will be fought not between the United States and China, but between high-tech Chinese cities like Shenzhen and Hangzhou,” Kyle Chan, a researcher at Princeton University, wrote recently in The New York Times. As AI becomes the backbone of national competitiveness, who owns the data — where it’s stored, how it’s governed, and who gets to access it — is turning into a geopolitical fault line. For the U.S., the concern is clear: Sensitive data flowing to China is a national security risk. That’s why Biden, and now Trump again, pushed forward a suite of export controls and executive orders aimed at walling off U.S. citizens’ data from potential misuse abroad. The logic is that data is power, and in the AI era, leaking it is leaking leverage. But China was ahead of the curve. Since 2017, it has required all foreign firms operating in China to store data locally and undergo cybersecurity reviews. Cross-border data transfers are tightly restricted. In response, some multinationals have built parallel “data bunkers” in China to maintain compliance. The result: a splintered internet. Data once flowed freely across borders, but it’s now increasingly fenced in by digital walls. For global companies, navigating this minefield means balancing privacy laws, national security concerns, and market access. For countries, it’s about who trains the best models, who sets the standards — and who stays in control. The stakes go far beyond privacy. In an age of foundation models and AI training loops, data is the new oil, and sovereignty is about control of the refinery. Both Washington and Beijing know that the side with the best data will train the best models — and that whoever controls the pipelines controls the future. Both Washington and Beijing are playing to win. The U.S. is pressuring allies to block China’s access to advanced chipmaking tools. China, meanwhile, is financing Huawei-built telecom infrastructure in “One Belt, One Road” countries (China’s global infrastructure aimed initiative at connecting Asia, Europe, and beyond), pushing Chinese data standards in international bodies, and expanding RMB-based digital payments. Caught in the middle are U.S. allies that trade heavily with China but rely on Washington for security. Some are hedging, adjusting policies without picking sides. But in a world where every cloud server and chip fab is a potential battleground, neutrality is becoming harder to maintain. This next phase of the U.S.-China economic conflict is less about what’s being traded — and more about who gets to write the rules of the digital future. Because this isn’t just a trade war anymore. It’s a contest for the 21st century. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Ethereum staking hits record high, ETF inflows turn bullish – Impact on market?

The return of positive ETF inflows and rise in depositing addresses for staking could pave way for a better environment of Ethereum products. Ethereum [ETH] ETFs produced a combined $64.8o million in net flows on the 20th of May 2025. This pointed to an extra religion from essential institutions and influential individuals known as ‘smart money’ who seemed to be positioning themselves. BlackRock’s ETHA fund led with a $45.0 million raise, while Fidelity’s FETH secured $19.8 million. Meanwhile, there were no net flow changes for Bitwise (ETHW), 21Shares (CETH), VanEck (ETHV), Invesco (QETH), Franklin (EZET), or Grayscale’s funds (ETHE and ETH). These inflows follow a period of mixed or lower flows, following the—$39.8 million outflow on the 15th of May, primarily from Grayscale and Fidelity. Source: X On the 20th of May, major institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity made significant purchases, contributing $152.9 million in inflows and $15.2 million in outflows since the 8th of May. Their actions suggest an attempt to position themselves ahead of potential price increases or key market triggers. If this trend continues, it could further solidify the bullish structure for ETH’s price soon. The sudden surge in new capital indicates a notable shift in how high-conviction investors allocate their resources. Moreover, there were now more than 225,000 depositor addresses taking part in Ethereum’s staking contract—a record high. The change climbed by 0.30% over the past week, 1.77% in the past month, and 5.76% in the previous three months. It appeared more consumers were joining the Ethereum staking feature, with steady rates starting from mid-2023. Although the market was volatile, the strong growth of staked ETH demonstrated that more people were joining the network. With the total staked ETH standing at 34,559,715, this growth highlighted rising network participation despite market volatility. As the conversation about ETH ETF staking accelerated, the rise in unique staking addresses indicated that more validators were now participating. Source: IntoTheBlock Though it did not connect to institutions, it showed that ETH was still in high demand as an asset providing high yields. Although these numbers could rise significantly more, regulatory approval was necessary for it to happen. ETH’s resilience could be key to its future price stability. BlackRock has continued to push for approval of ETH ETF staking, options, and tokenization, signaling growing investor interest in Ethereum’s products as the market recovers. The company’s discussions with the SEC Crypto Task Force could accelerate the creation of clearer cryptocurrency regulations. If ETH ETF staking is approved, large investors may shift toward Ethereum, boosting its adoption. In the long term, these developments could drive higher ETF inflows, especially as Ethereum leads efforts in tokenization and stablecoin infrastructure. However, the outcome ultimately depends on regulatory decisions and market response.

Title: Walmart says it's cutting roles to 'remove layers and complexity'

Walmart is laying off corporate staff in the US to "remove layers and complexity." The retailer will lay off 1,500 employees, The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter. Bloomberg, citing anonymous sources, reported that the layoffs were in the company's Arkansas headquarters and other offices. The retailer's US CEO, John Furner, and global technology chief, Suresh Kumar, announced the layoffs in a Wednesday memo to corporate staff titled "Building for the future," seen by BI. "We are reshaping some teams in our Global Tech and Walmart U.S. organizations where we have identified opportunities to remove layers and complexity, speed up decision-making, and help associates innovate rapidly," the memo wrote. It added that the technology team would be slimmed down to simplify its structure and "facilitate speed and innovation." Aside from the layoffs, Walmart will also be opening new roles that align with its business priorities and growth strategy, the memo read. Walmart is not the only company flattening its corporate structure. Big Tech companies, like Amazon, Google, and Intel, have been cutting middle managers to boost efficiency. On the retail side, Amazon said in September that it would increase the ratio of its workers to supervisors by at least 15%. The news of Walmart's layoffs comes about a week after the retailer announced in an earnings call that it would increase the prices of its products due to President Donald Trump's tariffs. Walmart said it imports a third of what it sells in the US from outside the country, such as China, Vietnam, and Mexico. Although Trump has paused his additional tariffs, Walmart's CFO said reduced tariff rates are still "too high." "Even at the reduced levels, the higher tariffs will result in higher prices," CEO Doug McMillon said in the earnings call. Walmart reported a 2.5% revenue growth in its latest quarter compared to the year before, with sales of $165.60 billion. Where Big Tech secrets go public — unfiltered in your inbox weekly.

Title: Cigna is putting a cap on weight loss drug costs

Getting access to popular weight loss drugs will be simpler and cheaper for some. Health insurer Cigna (CI) announced a new deal for copay caps on Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NVO) weight loss drugs. The deal caps copays at $200 a month through employer healthcare programs. Evernorth, the health services division of The Cigna Group, announced the benefit that will make popular weight loss medications Wegovy and Zepbound more available to patients. Through direct negotiations with the medications’ manufacturers, Evernorth announced that it has ensured that patients’ monthly cost will not exceed $200. Cigna is listed by the National Association of Insurance Carriers as the nation’s eighth largest health insurer. The insurer touted the lower costs in a press release on Wednesday. “We are reimagining pharmacy benefits to reduce costs and better serve patients,” said Adam Kautzner, Pharm D, President of Evernorth Care Management and Express Scripts, in the release. Evernorth did not respond to a request from Quartz for comment. The company also highlighted other savings from the new arrangement, including savings of as much as $3,600 per year compared to buying these medications directly from manufacturers or through consumer programs. Customers will also notice a simplified and automated process for faster access. The news from Cigna comes as the FDA is cracking down on compounding pharmacies that have been offering cheaper copies of the popular weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy. Compounding pharmacies may offer compounded drugs — which aren’t regulated by the FDA—as an alternative during times of a declared national shortage. But in a memo released on Feb 21, the FDA declared “that the semaglutide injection product shortage is resolved.” Starting May 22, the FDA will begin enforcing action against pharmacies still dispensing the drugs. Cigna shares were trading down just below 1% in mid-morning activity. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

The ₹2,150-crore IPO is entirely a fresh issue by the company, with no offer-for-sale component. Against an offer size of about 17.71 crore shares, the IPO received bids for 11.82 crore shares, subscribing 0.67 times. The IPO will close on May 23. The price band for the offer has been pegged at ₹85-90 per share, and investors can bid for a minimum of 166 equity shares. The offer is being made through the book-building process, wherein not more than 50 per cent of the offer shall be available for allocation on a proportionate basis to qualified institutional buyers, not less than 15 per cent for allocation to non-institutional bidders, and up to 35 per cent of the offer to retail investors. While the quota for non-institutional investors, generally referred to as HNIs, was subscribed 1.44 times, the retail portion elicited 0.48 times subscription and the institutional quota 0.42 times. Ahead of the IPO, Belrise Industries on Tuesday garnered ₹645 crore from anchor investors. The company informed the bourses that it had allocated 71,666,665 shares at ₹90 per share to anchor investors. The investors who participated in the anchor book include foreign institutions such as BlackRock, Capital Group, M&G, and Pinebridge, and domestic institutions such as ICICI Prudential MF, HDFC MF, Nippon India MF, ValueQuest, and Bajaj Allianz Life. The proceeds from the fresh issue, to the extent of ₹1,618.13 crore, will be used for repayment or prepayment, in full or in part, of certain borrowings availed by the company, and for general corporate purposes. Belrise Industries Ltd (BIL) is an automotive component manufacturing company, offering a diverse range of safety critical systems and other engineering solutions for two-wheelers, three-wheelers, four-wheelers, commercial vehicles, and agri-vehicles. Its product portfolio includes metal chassis systems, polymer components, suspension systems, body-in-white components, and exhaust systems, among others. BIL’s products are largely agnostic to vehicle powertrain types, reflecting its ability in catering to both electric vehicles and internal combustion engine vehicles, thus positioning it favourably to adapt to the growing electric vehicle market. The company specialises in precision sheet metal pressing and fabrication (i.e., the process of joining sheet metal components to create unified structures for assembling vehicle subsystems and bodies), and had a market share of 24 per cent in the overall two-wheeler metal components segment in India as of March 31, 2024, in terms of revenue (Source: CRISIL Report). Belrise has a long-standing relationship with OEMs such as Bajaj Auto Limited, Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India Private Limited, Hero MotoCorp Limited, Jaguar Land Rover Limited, and Royal Enfield Motors Limited, among others. Belrise Industries’ revenue from operations increased by 13.70 per cent to ₹7,484.24 crore for the financial year 2024, from ₹6,582.50 crore for the financial year 2023, primarily attributable to an increase in product sales and higher prices of raw materials and components. Profit after tax for FY24 stood at ₹310.88 crore. For the nine months ended December 31, 2024, revenue from operations stood at ₹6,013.43 crore, and profit after tax stood at ₹245.47 crore. Axis Capital Limited, Jefferies India Private Limited, HSBC Securities and Capital Markets (India) Private Limited, and SBI Capital Markets Limited are the book-running lead managers, while MUFG Intime India Private Limited is the registrar to the issue.

(NYSE:ELV) Class Period: April 18, 2024, and October 16, 2024 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 11, 2025 According to the lawsuit, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that, with the Medicaid redetermination process nearly complete, defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the risk and cost profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid programs. While defendants acknowledged that Medicaid expenses were rising, they repeatedly assured investors that this was adequately reflected in Elevance’s guidance for the year. These representations were materially false or misleading. In truth, the redeterminations were causing the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members to rise significantly, as the members being removed from Medicaid programs were, on average, healthier than those who remained eligible for the programs. This shift was occurring to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations with the states or in its financial guidance for 2024. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

(NYSE:WST) Class Period: February 16, 2023, - February 12, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: July 7, 2025 The West Pharmaceutical class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) despite claiming strong visibility into customer demand and attributing headwinds to temporary COVID-related product destocking, West Pharmaceutical was in fact experiencing significant and ongoing destocking across its high-margin High-Value Products portfolio; (ii) West Pharmaceutical’s SmartDose device, which was purportedly positioned as a high-margin growth product, was highly dilutive to West Pharmaceutical’s profit margins due to operational inefficiencies; and (iii) these margin pressures created the risk of costly restructuring activities, including West Pharmaceutical’s exit from continuous glucose monitoring (“CGM”) contracts with long-standing customers. The West Pharmaceutical class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 13, 2025, West Pharmaceutical issued its 2025 revenue forecast in the range of $2.88 billion to $2.91 billion, significantly below expectations. According to the complaint, West Pharmaceutical attributed the disappointing guidance in part to Contract Manufacturing headwinds, including the loss of two major CGM customers that had begun transitioning to in-house manufacturing of next-generation devices because West Pharmaceutical “made the decision to not participate going forward as our financial thresholds cannot be achieved.” The West Pharmaceutical class action lawsuit further alleges that West Pharmaceutical also revealed that its SmartDose wearable injector will become margin dilutive in 2025 due to lower pricing. On this news, the price of West Pharmaceutical’s stock fell more than 38%.

Title: Why Nvidia-Backed CoreWeave's Stock Popped 19% Wednesday
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/why-nvidia-backed-coreweave-stock-popped-19-percent-wednesday-11739642
Time Published: 2025-05-21T21:35:14Z
Full Content:
CoreWeave (CRWV) shares soared 19% Wednesday after the company announced an upsized $2 billion debt offering. The Nvidia (NVDA)-backed cloud computing company's offering consisted of senior notes with a 9.25% interest rate due in 2030, according to a statement, and was $500 million larger than CoreWeave initially planned. The company reportedly told CNBC that the deal was five times oversubscribed. CoreWeave said it intends to use proceeds from the offering to repay existing debt, among other corporate purposes. The news comes after CoreWeave last week posted first-quarter revenue that grew more than 400% year-over-year. It was the company's first quarterly report since its initial public offering. CoreWeave makes money by providing its clients with access to data centers, which are used to develop artificial intelligence models. The company’s data centers are equipped with highly coveted chips from Nvidia, which held a roughly 7% stake in CoreWeave as of the end of March, a filing last week showed. With Wednesday's gains, CoreWeave's stock has nearly tripled in value since the company went public in March.

Title: Are You Ready for Agentic AI Shoppers as Customers?

Time Published: 2025-05-21T20:20:02Z

CMSWire's Marketing & Customer Experience Leadership channel is the go-to hub for actionable research, editorial and opinion for CMOs, aspiring CMOs and today's customer experience innovators. Our dedicated editorial and research teams focus on bringing you the data and information you need to navigate today's complex customer, organizational and technical landscapes. We've got you covered. Payments get smarter. Agentic AI allows bots to make purchases securely with tokenized payments. This helps shift trust and control dynamics in ecommerce. Search gets rewritten. Brands must optimize product data for AI agents as discovery shifts from SEO to intent-driven automation. CX gets invisible. Agentic AI compresses the entire buying journey into a seamless background process. As much as agentic AI promises to make our lives easier, delegating tasks and errands is certainly not new. Even in our mobile-first, app-based reality, you can use Instacart for your groceries, Stitch Fix for your wardrobe, Uber to get driven to your next destination and countless other apps to get other people to help you get things done. Yet all of those things still involve people to fulfill your requests. Shopping, planning and nearly everything else are gaining a whole new level of automation. This comes from deeper integration and the introduction of agentic AI into even the most complex and security-critical tasks we perform. The recent developments in the payments space illustrate this well. Visa, Mastercard and PayPal have recently introduced agentic AI functionality so that software agents can swipe a “card” as easily as a human thumb‑printing a phone. For retail brands, the clock is ticking. Whoever serves these bots first will capture the carts they fill on behalf of their human customers. Let’s look at three ways that agentic AI is going to transform the ecommerce buying experience. First, let's discuss the biggest change that agentic AI payments introduce from a customer perspective. That’s handing over your payment information to an AI agent. Technologies such as Visa’s Intelligent Commerce and Mastercard’s Agent Pay create 16‑digit network tokens (think prepaid cards with parental controls) that an AI agent uses across the web without exposing details like credit card numbers or other PII. While some shoppers may bristle at this idea, it can be a win-win from a convenience and security standpoint. Consumers can cap a bot’s weekly “allowance,” whether that’s total spend or on a specific list of items such as groceries. Shoppers can also review an audit trail that shows every purchase the software made. Peace of mind replaces the low‑grade anxiety that has long haunted card‑on‑file commerce that doesn’t have the same types of protections. What does this mean for retailers? This shift calls for several key implementations to support a seamless process. Checkout flows must be updated to accommodate the new token format and to surface agent-level permissions such as spend ceilings and stock keeping unit (SKU) categories. Creating data loops is also essential; receipt data should be fed back instantly so agents can reconcile budgets without guesswork. At the same time, fraud strategies need to be rethought. While chargeback risks may decrease, the intolerance for even a single false decline will rise. While this may feel like a big shift for consumers, there have been small steps toward this already. Whether it’s digital wallets, saved payment sources or delegating shopping needs to less automated apps and processes, the next logical step is to allow agentic payments. Increased transparency and control make this even more compelling. The next aspect is one that is fundamentally changing the way that brands are reaching their potential and current customers. While search engine optimization has played a key role in driving awareness and even repeat purchases, the rapid growth of AI-generated search results within platforms like Perplexity, ChatGPT and even Google are changing the way customers discover products and services. With the introduction of agentic AI and AI-based shoppers, the marketing funnel will shift from a predominantly human, keyword‑based search to include a greater focus on agent intent optimization (AIO), which means feeding AI-based integrations the richest possible product attributes so they can satisfy a shopper’s request (i.e., “vegan leather sneakers, size 9, under $120, carbon‑neutral shipping”). How autonomous AI is redefining the buying journey from discovery to post-purchase. The buyer’s journey will be forever changed by this change. While people shopping for themselves will likely never go away completely, the idea that a consumer could brief a bot once and outsource time-consuming searching, browsing and shopping behaviors, particularly for the more mundane items on their list, will win many shoppers over quickly. For brands, this means that having their products show at the top of a Google search isn’t quite the prize it used to be. Instead, they need their SKU on bots’ short lists to remain relevant. Retailers will need to take steps here to make sure they are as agent-optimized as they are currently search-optimized. This includes investing in product‑information hygiene by creating exhaustive attributes, standardized taxonomy and plain‑language “why buy” notes an agent can quote back to a shopper. They’ll also need to expose their inventory and price APIs to make sure that recommendations incorporating their products stay current. Lastly, brands should focus on the details by tagging sustainability, warranty and fit‑and‑feel data, as many agents will rank based on sustainability or the likelihood of returns. Related Article: Is AI Your New Shopping Buddy? Because of its highly autonomous nature, agentic commerce collapses discovery, comparison, payment and even returns into a single behind‑the‑scenes flow while the consumer is able to sit back and do something else. In this scenario, consumers will come to value time over price in many cases. While some decisions may always be most influenced by price, when consumers are able to benefit from time savings and convenience, their loyalty is likely to shift to whichever merchant makes their agent’s work the easiest. Brands accustomed to the current set of security and risk mitigation standards will quickly be introduced to a whole new set of protocols. For instance, payment networks such as Visa and Mastercard are insisting on a trust fabric that verifies agents, explains decisions and supports real‑time cancellation. This is critical in a fast-paced environment. Retailers will need to rethink some of what they currently have in place and approach it with an agentic mindset. This includes publishing post‑purchase status hooks such as shipping updates, estimated arrival times and exchange labels that agents can poll without scraping customer email confirmations. Policies also need to be machine readable. Everything that typically appears in the fine print, including refund windows, warranty terms and sustainability scores, must now be agent-friendly so the agent can justify its choices and make sure decisions align with the human buyer's requirements. Transparent recourse paths are also essential. That means building dispute APIs and providing clear human override options to build the transparency that agents need to recommend your brand over countless others. Related Article: AI Transparency and Ethics: Building Customer Trust in AI Systems Steps brands should take now to accommodate autonomous AI shoppers. With all of these potential opportunities and challenges introduced with agentic AI in e-commerce, there are many potential starting points. Let’s look at a few things that retailers can do in the months ahead to prepare. Start by getting your platform ready. Determine if your current checkout platform can already accept network-issued agent tokens. If it can’t, consider what it would take to make that happen. Next, get your products ready. Audit your product catalog to understand every attribute a human shopper can quickly identify. This will help clarify how AI agents will interpret your catalog. Plan ahead to smooth the journey for both agents and customers. Map the post-purchase path to identify where an agent might get stuck today and how those blockers could be removed. Finally, stay one step ahead of potential risks. Stay current on compliance and best practices, as this is a fast-moving space. The payments industry may be subject to shifting regulations and security best practices, and providers such as Visa and Mastercard are expected to formalize trust protocols soon. Retailers that take the next step to adopt agentic AI to complete purchases while reducing or eliminating friction within the process will emerge as winners in the next race to improve the buyer’s journey. Brands that hesitate may discover that future shopping carts are filled long before they even realize a bot has already walked through the (virtual) door.

May 21, 2025 16:17 ET | Source: Navitas Semiconductor Corporation Navitas Semiconductor Corporation TORRANCE, Calif., May 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Navitas Semiconductor (Nasdaq: NVTS), the industry leader in next-generation GaNFast™ gallium nitride (GaN) and GeneSiC™ silicon carbide (SiC) power semiconductors, today announced a collaboration with NVIDIA (Nasdaq: NVDA) on their next-generation 800 V HVDC architecture to support ‘Kyber’ rack-scale systems powering their GPUs, such as Rubin Ultra, enabled by GaNFast™ and GeneSiC™ power technologies. NVIDIA’s next generation of 800V DC architecture aims to establish high-efficiency, scalable power delivery for next-generation AI workloads, to ensure greater reliability, efficiency, and reduced infrastructure complexity. Today’s existing data center architecture uses traditional 54 V in-rack power distribution and is limited to a few hundred kilowatts (kW). Bulky copper busbars are required to transfer this low-voltage electricity from the rack-mounted power shelves to the compute trays. As power increases above 200 kW, this architecture runs into physical limits due to power density, copper requirements, and reduced system efficiency. Modern AI data centers require gigawatts (GW) of power for the increasing demand for AI computation. Nvidia’s approach is to directly convert the 13.8 kV AC grid power to 800 V HVDC at the data center perimeter using solid state transformers (SST) and industrial-grade rectifiers, eliminating several AC/DC and DC/DC conversion steps, maximizing efficiency and reliability. Due to the higher voltage level of 800 V HVDC, the thickness of copper wires can be reduced by up to 45%, due to I2R losses, where the same amount of power can be delivered with increased voltage and lower current. Using a traditional 54V DC system, over 200 kg of copper would be needed to power a 1MW rack, which is not sustainable for next-generation AI data centers with GW power demand. The 800V HVDC directly powers the IT racks (eliminating the need for additional AC-DC converters) and is converted by DC-DC converters to lower voltages, which will drive GPUs, such as the Rubin Ultra. Navitas is an established leader in AI data center solutions enabled by GaN and SiC technology. The high-power GaNSafe™ power ICs integrate control, drive, sensing, and critical protection features, enabling unprecedented reliability and robustness. GaNSafe is the world’s safest GaN with short-circuit protection (350ns max latency), 2kV ESD protection on all pins, elimination of negative gate drive, and programmable slew rate control. All these features are controlled with 4-pins, allowing the package to be treated like a discrete GaN FET, requiring no VCC pin. Additionally, Navitas offers a family of medium voltage (80-120V) GaN devices, which have been optimized for secondary side DC-DC conversion, delivering high-speed, high efficiency, and small footprint, for AI data centers PSUs with outputs of 48V-54V.

Title: Did WhatsApp really need Meta?

Time Published: 2025-05-21T18:41:02Z
Full Content:
Cofounder Brian Acton butted heads with Meta before his departure, but took the stand as part of its defense. Cofounder Brian Acton butted heads with Meta before his departure, but took the stand as part of its defense. by Lauren Feiner In its antitrust case against Meta, the US Federal Trade Commission is asking a judge to consider an alternate reality. In that world, the company never bought Instagram and WhatsApp. The two apps remained competitive with Facebook, developing features that competed for users’ attention. And that competition created a thriving ecosystem of social media apps where people can connect with their friends and family. Meta has spent the past several days — during which it’s begun lodging its case-in-chief in a Washington, DC, courthouse — building a counternarrative. In its telling of this alternate present, Instagram and WhatsApp are shadows of what they are in our world. They lacked the resources, expertise, and vision to become robust and valuable online platforms, let alone formidable competitors. And consumers are the ones who ultimately suffered. One of Meta’s key witnesses for this defense is WhatsApp cofounder Brian Acton, who was called on Tuesday to help make its case that WhatsApp users, just like Instagram ones, benefited from Meta’s acquisition. Acton was the second app founder to testify in the case, after Instagram cofounder Kevin Systrom delivered mostly blistering testimony against the company a few weeks ago. Acton’s time on the stand came off less acrimonious, though both Meta and the FTC scored some key points. Acton was a striking witness for Meta to call given his high-profile departure from the company in 2017. The cofounder left $800 million in unvested restricted stock units on the table after butting heads with top Meta executives over putting ads in WhatsApp (when an FTC attorney pointed out the stock would have been worth $4 billion today, he joked, “please don’t say that,” but reassured himself it would only be $2 billion after taxes). The next year, he publicly advocated for people to delete Facebook in the aftermath of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. Acton reaffirmed that he had absolutely no interest in building a feed into WhatsApp But Acton backed up some important claims Meta has been making throughout the trial. Meta has repeatedly argued that WhatsApp was unlikely to compete with Facebook in the social networking space, so it wasn’t just trying to take out a potential rival. Acton reaffirmed that he and cofounder Jan Koum had absolutely no interest in building social features like a feed into WhatsApp, or changing the company into an ad-supported business — even if their pre-acquisition investors wished they would. While the FTC has argued that WhatsApp could have succeeded on its own or with a different parent company, Acton said he and Koum rebuffed other offers, and felt that Meta’s infrastructure helped it skip over substantial work it would have had to do otherwise. On cross-examination, however, the FTC got some important admissions from Acton. Using Meta’s infrastructure might have helped it skip some steps, but Acton testified that WhatsApp didn’t actually migrate to Meta’s data centers to ward off outages — and WhatsApp had been highly capable of finding technical support for the app already. Instead, he said, he and Koum wanted to make sure Meta would continue operating the app even after they left. Far from being a bare-bones messaging app without Meta’s help, Acton testified that WhatsApp had already added several features before the acquisition like group messaging, video and audio messaging, and location sharing — with plans to add even more. WhatsApp was already growing incredibly fast prior to the acquisition, doubling in size every 12 to 18 months — that growth rate stayed pretty consistent even after Meta bought it. Acton was confident that even without Meta, WhatsApp would have grown from the more than 400 million monthly active users prior to the deal to one billion in about 18 months. This echoed testimony from Systrom that Instagram would likely still be successful without the sale. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified earlier in trial that he was surprised at how little interest WhatsApp’s founders had in building something larger than a “lifestyle company.” But while Acton reaffirmed his disdain for an ad-supported model that could pump up revenue, he conceded that he agreed to sell to Meta without securing a firm commitment against deploying ads, and he understood Meta’s offer price was likely based partly on plans to do so. That seemed to support the idea that the founders could have been open to monetizing their product more than they let on — potentially growing it into a rival for Meta. WhatsApp might have been an even better product — one that flourished in more markets with stronger privacy protections — without Meta’s stewardship, the FTC suggested. In a November 2014 email, it pointed out, a WhatsApp employee told Acton and Koum that executives at its new owner had “some reservation” about promoting the app in countries where Facebook Messenger was already a leader. Meta successfully pressured WhatsApp to change its privacy policy and terms of service in 2016 so that Facebook could capitalize on user data for its ads product (unless WhatsApp users opted out). And it pushed for a business version of the app, something Acton said he was “adamantly against,” fearing it would dilute WhatsApp’s end-to-end encryption. After Acton left, the product launched.

Title: Tariff Truce and Liquidity Fuel Bitcoin to $109,000 All-Time High — What’s Next for BTC?
URL: https://zycrypto.com/tariff-truce-and-liquidity-fuel-bitcoin-to-109000-all-time-high-whats-next-for-btc/
Time Published: 2025-05-21T17:45:31Z

Bitcoin price rallied to a new all-time high above $109,000 on May 21, propelled by a sudden thaw in global trade tensions and expectations of looser monetary policy. The cryptocurrency traded around $109,369 on late trading, extending a rally that lifted prices about 6% in the past week. This move follows a breakthrough above $100,000 earlier in May, as investors responded to signs that President Trump’s global tariff offensive might be easing. The immediate catalyst was a surprise 90-day “tariff truce” between the United States and China. On May 12, officials in Geneva announced a pause on new levies and sharp rollbacks of existing duties, slashing reciprocal tariffs by roughly 115 percentage points to about 10%. Global markets leaped on the news: stock futures and Asian equities jumped, and commodity prices rallied on hopes of a broad trade-war détente. Bitcoin investors also took notice. Analysts note that the tariff pause removed the risk of ‘sudden re‑escalation’, which had been weighing on risk appetite. In other words, as the trade conflict eased, risk assets like Bitcoin rallied without the overhang of fresh tariffs. Broader macroeconomic conditions have added fuel to the crypto rally. Central banks worldwide are signaling easier policy. In the U.S., futures markets are now priced at multiple rate cuts this year, and a weaker dollar has coincided with renewed growth in global money supply. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank has maintained an accommodative stance, and the Bank of Japan continues massive asset purchases, reinforcing the loose global liquidity backdrop. China’s central bank has also begun pumping cash into markets. Such ample liquidity typically lifts risk assets, and Bitcoin has benefited accordingly. At the same time, institutional investors have been pouring into crypto. Hedge funds and asset managers have funneled record sums into spot-Bitcoin ETFs and futures, betting on higher prices. Leading figures in the crypto industry have expressed firm bullish conviction. Former PayPal and Meta executive David Marcus tweeted, “the bull case for Bitcoin has never been stronger,” citing easier custody solutions at banks and competition from sovereign and corporate buyers. Changpeng Zhao, co-founder of Binance, echoed this optimism. Analysts even project Bitcoin could reach around $150,000 if regulatory conditions remain favorable. Looking ahead, analysts are divided on just how far Bitcoin can climb. Some have raised year-end targets above $130,000. Jamie Coutts of Real Vision warns that the relentless expansion of fiat money means Bitcoin “may push…above $132,000” by late 2025. Even major banks have revised their models: Standard Chartered’s crypto research team recently suggested that a $120,000 second-quarter price target might be “too low”. On the other hand, many caution that the rally could pause or correct if global liquidity peaks or regulators tighten. Bitcoin’s price historically follows four-year “halving” cycles tied to new coin issuance, and some forecasters see the current monetary easing lasting through 2025. Those forces could cool Bitcoin’s momentum if central banks eventually reverse course or inflation spikes. For now, however, the rare alignment of easing trade tensions and abundant liquidity, coupled with growing institutional adoption, has set the stage for one of crypto’s strongest rallies.

Despite retail stocks weighing down the market, European stocks were little changed on Wednesday. General stocks gains limited the losses as investors reacted to changes in US taxation policies. The pan-European STOXX 600 closed slightly lower, down 0.8 per cent, as Dublin saw a marginal day of trading. Dublin While fallers outnumbered risers, the Iseq All-Share index ended the session slightly up 25.31 or 0.22 per cent from its previous close, at 11,399.48, its highest ever close. There was a mixed performance in the banking sector. Bank of Ireland rose 0.89 per cent to €11.995, following on from a strong performance on Tuesday. Fellow banking stocks, Permanent TSB dropped 0.58 per cent and AIB Group fell 0.45 per cent. Defensive stocks also had a mixed day of trading. While Kerry Group added 0.67 per cent, rising to a share price of €97.35, fellow dairy giant Glanbia fell 0.24 per cent. Healthcare services group Uniphar saw a 1 per cent fall in its share price. Ryanair, which rose 5 per cent after publishing financial results on Monday, saw a third consecutive rise this week adding 0.63 per cent, reaching €23.85 per share. London The FTSE 100 was nearly flat with a 0.06 per cent gain, while the midcap FTSE 250 fell 0.7 per cent, as the inflation data triggered a slight wobble on the more domestically-focused index. Among blue-chips, sportswear retailer JD Sports’ shares were the worst hit, dropping 10.6 per cent after it warned that President Donald Trump’s tariffs may force the company to hike prices in the key market. SSE fell 2.4 per cent after the renewable energy generator cut its five-year investment plans by 15 per cent. Keeping losses in check, precious metal miners gained 3 per cent as gold prices rose for a third straight session and hit a one-week high. Fresnillo gained the most in the FTSE 100 with 4.2 per cent rise. Water utility Severn Trent shares gained 2.3 per cent after it projected a doubling of adjusted earnings per share between 2025 to 2028. Europe The European benchmark shed 0.8 per cent amid declines in luxury and retail stocks. JD Sports fell 10.6 per cent to the bottom of the STOXX 600 after posting a 2 per cent drop in first-quarter underlying sales and warned that higher prices in its key U.S. market could hit customer demand. LVMH, Hermes and Kering among others fell over 2 per cent after luxury group Chanel reported a 4.3 per cent drop in its comparable yearly sales. Tech shares helped to outweigh these losses, German chipmaker Infineon’s 2.3 per cent gain after it said it would work with Nvidia to develop chips for new power delivery systems inside artificial intelligence data centres provided a boost to the sector. The STOXX 600, however, has recovered from its April slump, and is trading less than 3 per cent away from its all-time highs. An index tracking defence stocks was up 0.5 per cent after Trump selected a design for the $175 billion Golden Dome missile defence shield on Tuesday. Morgan Stanley raised its view on the European banking sector to “attractive”, citing better earnings potential from continued yield steepening. The European banks index is among the top performing sectors this year. Swiss bank Julius Baer slid 4.9 per cent after reporting a 130 million Swiss franc ($156.4 million) charge from a credit portfolio review and replacing its chief risk officer. New York In a volatile session on Wall Street, the S & P500 had slipped with Treasury yields rising in reaction to the US President Donald Trump’s proposed tax-cut law during mid afternoon trading. Boosting the Nasdaq, Google-parent Alphabet recorded a jump, while Nvidia and Meta Platforms climbed saw stocks rise slightly. Nine of the 11 S&P sub-sectors traded lower, with Healthcare being the worst hit. UnitedHealth Group saw its shares fall, following a Guardian report said the healthcare conglomerate secretly paid nursing homes thousands in bonuses to help reduce hospital transfers for ailing residents. HSBC also downgraded the stock to “reduce” from “hold”. In earnings, retailer Target fell after slashing its annual forecast due to a pullback in discretionary spending. Wolfspeed had lost nearly 70 per cent during mid afternoon trading following a report that the semiconductor supplier was preparing to file for bankruptcy within weeks. Despite the losses, U.S. stocks have had a solid month so far. The S&P 500 has climbed more than 17 per cent from its April lows, when Trump’s reciprocal tariffs roiled global markets. On the back of bitcoin recording a fresh all-time high of $109,481.83 (€96,460.61) during the session, exchange operator Coinbase gained alongside crypto miners such as Riot Platforms. – Additional reporting by Reuters.

Title: China Market Update: Baidu, Full Truck & XPeng Q1 Earnings Results Reviewed

ByBrendan Ahern ByBrendan Ahern, Senior Contributor. CLN Baidu Search giant Baidu (9888 HK, BIDU), which has artificial intelligence ambitions, released its Q1 financial results after the Hong Kong close. Full Truck Alliance Full Truck Alliance (YMM US), a digital freight platform/Uber for truck drivers, reported Q1 results after the Hong Kong close. I hope management speaks to a Hong Kong secondary listing to mitigate a policy error surrounding U.S.-listed China ADRs. Xpeng Electric Vehicle maker XPeng (9868 HK, XPEV US) released Q1 financial results after the Hong Kong close today. Asian equities were broadly higher overnight, led by gains in Taiwan, while Japan and Thailand underperformed as a CNN report on an Israeli strike against Iran’s nuclear facilities drew global attention. Energy stocks rose in response to the news, alongside gains in precious metals and coal in both Hong Kong and Mainland China. Value stocks in Mainland China outperformed growth stocks, while Hong Kong growth stocks rebounded, seemingly dismissing concerns raised by the recent Financial Times article, “Top US state Republicans urge SEC to consider delisting Chinese companies.” The Financial Times article referenced a letter from 21 U.S. state Republican financial officers, which contained several inaccuracies and misstatements. Notably, the Financial Times did acknowledge that Chinese companies had received a clean bill of health from both the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. In meetings with several global financial institutions in Hong Kong, local sentiment was clear: the few remaining U.S.-listed Chinese companies without a Hong Kong listing are expected to re-list in the city. The timing of the letter coincided with Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited’s (CATL) Hong Kong initial public offering—the world’s largest so far this year—which, in previous years, would likely have taken place in New York. As a result, Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Limited (HKeX) rose 3.27%. CATL shares advanced another 10.19% in Hong Kong, with BYD Company Limited up 4.05%, Li Auto Inc. up 4.05%, and Geely Automobile Holdings Limited up 3.09%. Internet stocks also performed well, as Alibaba Group Holding Limited gained 1.15% after announcing a partnership with Meitu Inc., a provider of photo-editing and beautification applications with strong connections in the cosmetics industry. Meitu’s shares surged 18.98% on the news. The healthcare sector maintained positive momentum in both markets following yesterday’s licensing agreement between 3SBio Inc. and Pfizer Inc. Mainland investors purchased $182 million of Hong Kong-listed stocks via the Southbound Stock Connect. In policy news, eight Chinese government agencies, including the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), announced “Several Measures to Support the Financing of Small and Micro Enterprises.” Small businesses account for the majority of employment in Mainland China, and these measures are intended to ease access to loans and reduce financing costs. A Mainland media source reported the completion of the third version of the China-ASEAN Free Trade Zone agreement, though details remain limited. Despite yesterday’s Loan Prime Rate (LPR) cut, Mainland China equities did not see stronger gains, highlighting that restoring consumer confidence will take time. On a positive note, April tax revenue increased for the first time this year, signaling a tentative economic rebound.

Fair warning: this is the longest thing I've written on this newsletter. I do apologize. Soundtrack: EL-P - $4 Vic Listen to my podcast Better Offline. We have merch. Last week, Bloomberg profiled Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, revealing that he's either a liar or a specific kind of idiot. The article revealed that — assume we believe him, and this wasn’t merely a thinly-veiled advert for Microsoft’s AI tech — Copilot consumes Nadella’s life outside the office as well at work. None of these tasks are things that require you to use AI. You can read your messages on Outlook and Teams without having them summarized — and I’d argue that a well-written email is one that doesn’t require a summary. Podcasts are not there "to be chatted about" with an AI. Preparing for meetings isn't something that requires AI, nor is research, unless, of course, you don't really give a shit about the actual content of what you're reading or the message of what you're saying, just that you are "saying the right thing." To be clear, I am deeply unconvinced that Nadella actually runs his life in this way, but if he does, Microsoft’s board should fire him immediately. In any case, the article is rambling, cloying, and ignores Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman's documented history of abusing his workers. Ten custom agents that do what? What do you mean by "other tasks"? Why are these questions never asked? Is it because the reporters know they won't get an answer? Is it because the reporters are too polite to ask more probing questions, knowing that these anecdotes are likely entirely made up as a means to promote a flagging AI ecosystem that cost billions to construct, but doesn’t really seem to do anything, and the reporter in question doesn’t want to force Satya to build a bigger house of cards than he needs to. Or is it because we, as a society, do not want to look too closely at the powerful? Is it because we've handed our economy to men that get paid $79 million a year to do a job they can't seem to describe, and even that, they would sooner offload to a bunch of unreliable AI models than actually do? We live in the era of the symbolic executive, when "being good at stuff" matters far less than the appearance of doing stuff, where "what's useful" is dictated not by outputs or metrics that one can measure but rather the vibes passed between managers and executives that have worked their entire careers to escape the world of work. Our economy is run by people that don't participate in it and our tech companies are directed by people that don't experience the problems they allege to solve for their customers, as the modern executive is no longer a person with demands or responsibilities beyond their allegiance to shareholder value. I, however, believe the problem runs a little deeper than the economy, which is a symptom of a bigger, virulent, and treatment-resistant plague that has infected the minds of those currently twigging at the levers of power — and really, the only levers that actually matter. The incentives behind effectively everything we do have been broken by decades of neoliberal thinking, where the idea of a company — an entity created to do a thing in exchange for money —has been drained of all meaning beyond the continued domination and extraction of everything around it, focusing heavily on short-term gains and growth at all costs. In doing so, the definition of a “good business” has changed from one that makes good products at a fair price to a sustainable and loyal market, to one that can display the most stock price growth from quarter to quarter. This is the Rot Economy, which is a useful description for how tech companies have voluntarily degraded their core products in order to placate shareholders, transforming useful — and sometimes beloved — services into a hollow shell of their former selves as a means of expressing growth. But it’s worth noting that this transformation isn’t constrained to the tech industry, nor was it a phenomena that occurred when the tech industry entered its current VC-fuelled, publicly-traded incarnation. In The Shareholder Supremacy, I drew a line from an early 20th-century court ruling, to former General Electric CEO Jack Welch, to the current tech industry, but there’s one figure I didn’t pay as much attention to, and I regrettably now have to do so. Famed Chicago School economist (and dweller of Hell) Milton Friedman once argued in his 1970 doctrine that those who didn’t focus on shareholder value were “unwitting pup­pets of the intellectual forces that have been undermining the basis of a free society these past decades," and that any social responsibility — say, treating workers well, doing anything other than focus on shareholder value — is tantamount to an executive taxing his shareholders by "spending their money" on their own personal beliefs. Friedman was a fundamentalist when it came to unrestricted, unfettered capitalism, and this zealotry surpassed any sense of basic human morality — if he had any — at times. For example, in his book, Capitalism and Friedman, he argued that companies should be allowed to discriminate on racial grounds because the owner might suffer should they be required to hire an equally or better-qualified Black person. Bear in mind, this was written at the height of the civil rights movement, just six years before the assassination of Martin Luther King, and when America was rapidly waking up to the evils of racism and segregation (a process, I add, is ongoing and sadly not complete). This is a direct quote: Friedman was grotesque. I am not religious, but I hope Hell exists if only for him. The broader point I’m trying to make is that neoliberalism is inherently selfish, believing that the free market should reign supreme, bereft of government intervention, regulation or interference, thinking that somehow these terms will enable "freedom" rather than a kind of market-dominated quasi-dictatorship where our entire lives are dominated by the whims of the affluent, and that there is no institution that can possibly push back against them. Friedman himself makes the facile argument that economic freedom — which, he says, is synonymous with unfettered capitalism — is a necessary condition of unfettered political freedom. Obviously, that’s bollocks, although it’s an argument that’s proven persuasive with a certain class of people that are either intellectually or morally hollow (or both). Neoliberalism also represents a kind of modern-day feudalism, dividing society based on whether someone is a shareholder or not, with the former taking precedence and the latter seen as irrelevant at best, or disposable at worst. It’s curious that Friedman saw economic freedom — a state that is non-interventionist in economic matters — as essential for political freedom, while also failing to see equality as the same. I realize this is all very big and clunky, but I want you to understand how these incentives have fundamentally changed everything, and why they are responsible for the rot we see in our society and our workplaces. When your only incentive is shareholder value, and you raise shareholder value as a platonic ideal, everything else is secondary, including the customer you are selling something to. Friedman himself makes a moral case for discrimination, because shareholder value — in his example, the store owner — matters more than racial equality at its most basic level. When you care only about shareholder value, the only job you have is to promote further exploitation and dominance — not to have happy customers, not to make your company "a good place to work," not to make a good product, not to make a difference or contribute to anything other than further growth. While this is, to anyone with a vapor of an intellectual or moral dimension, absolutely fucking stupid, it’s an idea that’s proven depressingly endemic among the managerial elite, in part because it has entered the culture, and because it is hammered across in MBA classes and corporate training seminars. In simpler terms, modern business theory trains executives not to be good at something, or to make a company based on their particular skills, but to "find a market opportunity" and exploit it. The Chief Executive — who makes over 300 times more than their average worker — is no longer a leadership position, but a kind of figurehead measured on their ability to continually grow the market capitalization of their company. It is a position inherently defined by its lack of labor, the amorphousness of its purpose and its lack of any clear responsibility. While CEOs do get fired when things go badly, it's often after a prolonged period of decline and stagnancy, and almost always comes with some sort of payoff — and when I say "badly," I mean that growth has slowed to the point that even firing masses of people doesn't make things better. We have, as a society, reframed all business leadership — which is increasingly broad, consisting of all management from the C-suite down — to be the equivalent of a mall cop, a person that exists to make sure people are working without having any real accountability for the work themselves, or to even understand the work itself. When the leader of a company doesn't participate in or respect the production of the goods that enriches them, it creates a culture that enables similarly vacuous leaders on all levels. Management as a concept no longer means doing "work," but establishing cultures of dominance and value extraction. A CEO isn't measured on happy customers or even how good their revenue is today, but how good revenue might be tomorrow and whether those customers are paying them more. A "manager," much like a CEO, is no longer a position with any real responsibility — they're there to make sure you're working, to know enough about your work that they can sort of tell you what to do, but somehow the job of "telling you what to do" doesn't come with it any actual work, and the instructions don’t need to be useful or even meaningful. Decades of direct erosion of the very concept of leadership means that the people running companies have been selected not based on their actual efficacy — especially as the position became defined by its lack of actual production — but on whether they resemble what a manager or executive is meant to look like based on the work that somebody else did. That’s how someone like David Zaslav, a lawyer by trade and arguably the worst CEO in the entertainment industry, managed to become the head of Warner Brothers (that, and kissing up to Jack Welch, who he called a “big brother” that “picked him up like a friend”). It’s how Carly Fiorina — an MBA by trade — went on to become the head of HP, only to drive the company into a ditch where it stopped innovating, and largely missed the biggest opportunities of the early Internet era. The three CEOs that followed (Mark Hurd (who was ousted after fudging expense reports to send money to a love interest and still got tens of millions of dollars in severance), Leo Apotheker (who the New York Times suggests may have been worse than Fiorina), and Meg Whitman (famous for being a terrible CEO at HP and co-founding doomed video startup Quibi) similarly came from a non-tech background, and similarly did a shitty job, in part because they didn’t understand the company or the products or the customers. Management has, over the course of the past few decades, eroded the very fabric of corporate America, and I'd argue it’s done the same in multiple other western economies, too. I’d also argue that this kind of dumb management thinking also infected the highest echelons of politics across the world, and especially in the UK, my country of birth and where I lived until 2011, delivering the same kind of disastrous effects but at a macro level, as they impacted not a single corporate entity but the very institutions of the state. I’m not naive. I don’t think that the average politician is a salt-of-the-earth type, someone who did a normal job and then decided to enter politics. Especially not in the UK, where the trappings of class permeate everything, and we’re yet to shake off the noxious influence of the aristocracy and constitutionally-mandated hereditary privilege. Our political elite often comes from one of two universities (Oxford and Cambridge, the alma mater of 20% of current UK Members of Parliament) and a handful of fee-paying schools (like Eton, which is a hellmouth for the worst people to ever exist, and educated 20 of the UK’s 55 prime ministers). The UK has never been an egalitarian society. And yet, things have changed markedly in the past few decades.The difference between now and then is that the silver-spooned elite was, whether because they believed it or because it was politically expedient, not totally contemptuous of those at the bottom of the economic ladder. I was born in the midst of the Thatcher government, and my formative years were spent as British society tried to restructure itself after her reforms. Thatcher, famously, was an acolyte of the Friedman school of thought, and spent her nearly twelve years in office dismantling the state and pushing the culture towards an American-style individualism, once famously quipping that there was “no such thing as society.” She didn’t understand how things worked, but was nonetheless completely convinced of the power of the market to handle what was the functions of the state — from housing to energy and water. The end result of this political and cultural shift was, in the long run, disastrous. The UK has the smallest houses in the OECD, the smallest housing stock of any developed country, and some of the worst affordability. The privatization of the UK’s water infrastructure meant that money that would previously go towards infrastructure upgrades was, instead, funnelled to shareholders in the form of dividends. As a result, Britain is literally unable to process human waste and is actively dumping millions of liters of human sewage into its waterways and coastline. When Britain privatized its energy companies, the new management sold or closed the vast majority of its gas storage infrastructure. As a result, when the Ukraine War sparked, and natural gas prices surged, Britain had some of the smallest reserves of any country in Europe, and was forced to buy gas at the market prices — which were several times higher than their pre-war levels. I’m no fan of Thatcher, and like Friedman, I too wish hell exists, if only for the both of them. I wrote the above to emphasize the consequences of this clueless managerial thinking on a macro level — where the impacts aren’t just declining tech products or white-collar layoffs, but rather the emergence of generational crises in housing, energy, and the environment. These crises were obvious consequences of decisions made by someone whose belief in the free market was almost absolute, and whose fundamentalist beliefs surpassed the actual informed understanding of those working in energy, or housing, or water. As the legendary advertiser Stanley Pollitt once said, “bullshit baffles brains.” The sweeping changes we’ve seen, both in our economy and in our society, has led to an unprecedented, gilded age of bullshit where nothing matters, and things — things of actual substance — matter nothing. We live in a symbolic economy where we apply for jobs, writing CVs and cover letters to resemble a certain kind of hire, with our resume read by someone who doesn't do or understand our job, but yet is responsible for determining whether we’re worthy of going to the next step of the hiring process. All this so that we might get an interview with a manager or executive who will decide whether they think we can do it. We are managed by people whose job is implicitly not to do work, but oversee it. We are, as children (and young adults), encouraged to aspire to become a manager or executive, to "own our own business," to "have people that work for us," and the terms of our society are, by default, that management is not a role you work at, so much as a position you hold — a figurehead that passes the buck and makes far more of them than you do. This problem, I believe, has poisoned the fabric of almost every part of modern business, elevating people that don't do work to oversee companies that make things they don't understand, creating substrates of management that do not do anything but create further distance from actually doing a job. While some of you might automatically think I'm talking about Graeber's concept of Bullshit Jobs, this is far, far bigger. The system as it stands selects people at all levels of management specifically because they resemble the kind of specious, work-averse dullard that runs seemingly every company — a person built to go from meeting to meeting with the vague consternation that suggests they're "busy." As a result, the higher you get up in an organization, the further you get from the customer, the problem you've solving, and any of the actual work, and the higher up you get, the more power you have to change the conditions of the business. On some level, modern corporate power structures are a giant game of telephone where vibes beget further vibes, where managers only kind-of-sort-of understand what's going on, and the more vague one's understanding is, the more likely you are to lean toward what's good, or easy, or makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside. The system selects for people comfortable in these roles, creating org charts full of people that become harder and harder to justify other than "they've been here a while." They do not do "work" on the "product," and their answer as to why would be "what, am I meant to go down on the line and use a machine?" or "am I meant to call a customer and make a sale?" and the answer is yes, you lazy fucking piece of shit, you should do that once in a while, or at the very least go and watch or listen to somebody else do so, and do so regularly. But that's not what a manager does, right? Management isn't work, it's about thinking really hard and telling people what to do. It's about making the calls. It's about "managing people," and that can mean just about anything, but often means "who do I take credit from or pass blame to," because modern management has been stripped of all meaning other than continually reinforcing power structures for the next manager up. This system creates products for these people, because these people are more often than not the ones in power — they are your boss, your boss' boss, and their boss too. Big companies build products sold by specious executives or managers to other specious executives, and thus the products themselves stop resembling things that solve problems so much as they resemble a solution. After all, the person buying it — at least at the scale of a public company — isn’t necessarily the recipient of the final product, so they too are trained (and selected) to make calls based on vibes. I believe the scale of this problem is society-wide, and it is, at its core, a destruction of what it means to be a leader, and a valorization of selfishness, isolationist thinking, turning labor into a faceless resource, which naturally leads to seeing customers in an equally faceless way, their problems generalized, their pain points viewed as parts of a powerpoint rather than anything that your company earnestly tries to solve or even really thinks about. And that assumes that said pain points are even considered to begin with, or not ignored in favor of a fictitious and purely hypothetical pain point. People — be they the ones you're paying or paying you — become numbers. We have created and elevated an entirely new class of person, the nebulous "manager," and told decades-worth of children that's what they should aspire to, that the next step from doing a job is for us to tell other people to do a job, until we're able to one day tell those people how to do their job, with each rung on the corporate ladder further distancing ourselves from anything that interacts with reality. The real breaking point is fairly simple: the higher up you go at a company, the further you are from problems or purpose. Everything is abstract — the people that work for you, the people you work for, and even the tasks you do. We train people — from a young age! — to generalize and distance oneself from actual tasks, to aspire to doing managerial work, because managers are well-paid and "know what's going on," even if they haven't actually known what was going on for years, if they ever did so. This phenomenon has led to the stigmatization of blue-collar work (and the subsequent evisceration of practical trade and technical education across most of the developed world) in favor of universities. Society respects an MBA more than a plumber, even though the latter benefits society more — though I concede that both roles involve, on some level, shit, with the plumber unblocking it and the MBA spewing it. I believe this process has created a symbolic society — one where people are elevated not by any actual ability to do something or knowledge they may have, but by their ability to make the right noises and look the right way to get ahead. The power structures of modern society are run by business idiots — people that have learned enough to impress the people above them, because the business idiots have had power for decades. They have bred out true meritocracy or achievement or value-creation in favor of symbolic growth and superficial intelligence, because real work is hard, and there are so many of them in power they've all found a way to work together. I need you to understand how widespread this problem is, because it is why everything feels fucking wrong. Think of the Business Idiot as a kind of con artist, except the con has become the standard way of doing business for an alarmingly large part of society. The Business Idiot is the manager that doesn't seem to do anything but keeps being promoted, and the chief executive officer of a public company that says boring, specious nonsense about AI. They're the tenured professor that you wish would die, the administrator whose only job appears to be opening and closing their laptop, the consultant that can come up with a million reasons to charge you more money yet not one metric to judge their success by, the marketing executive that's worked exactly three years at every major cloud player but does not appear to have done anything, and the investor that invests "based on founders," but really means "guys that look at sound exactly like them." These people are present throughout the private and public sector, and our governments too, and they paradoxically do nothing of substance, but somehow damage everything they touch. This isn’t to say our public and private sector is entirely useless — just that these people have poisoned so many parts of our power structures that avoiding them is impossible. Our economy is oriented around them — made easier and more illogical for their benefit — because their literal only goal in life has been to take and use power. The Business Idiot is also an authoritarian, and will do whatever they need to — including harming the institution they work for, or those closest to them, like their co-workers or their community — as a means of avoiding true accountability or responsibility. Decades of neoliberalism has incentivized their rise, because when you incentivize society to become management — to "manage or run a company" rather than do something for a reason or purpose — you are incentivizing a kind of corporate narcissism, one that bleeds into whatever field the person goes into, be it public or private. We go to college as a means of getting a job after college using the grades we got in college, rendering many students desperate to get the best grades they can versus "learn" anything, because our economy is riddled with power structures controlled by people that don't know stuff and find it offensive when you remind them. Our society is in the thrall of dumb management, and functions as such. Every government, the top quarter of every org chart, features little Neros who, instead of battling the fire engulfing Rome, are sat in their palaces strumming an off-key version of “Wonderwall” on the lyre and grumbling about how the firefighters need to work harder, and maybe we could replace them with an LLM and a smart sprinkler system. Every institution keeps its core constituents and labor forces at arms-length, and effectively anything built at scale quickly becomes distanced from both the customer and laborer. This disconnection — or alienation — sits at the center of almost every problem I've ever talked about. Why would companies push generative AI in seemingly every part of their service, even though customers don't like it and it doesn't really work? It's simple: they neither know nor care what the customer wants, barely know how their businesses function, barely know what their products do, and barely understand what their workers are doing, meaning that generative AI feels magical, because it does an impression of somebody doing a job, which is an accurate way of describing how most executives and middle managers operate. Let me get a little more specific. An IBM study based on conversations with 2,000 global CEOs recently found that only 25% of AI initiatives have delivered their expected ROI over the last few years, and, worse still, "64% of CEOs surveyed acknowledge that the risk of falling behind drives investment in some technologies before they have a clear understanding of the value they bring to the organization." 50% of respondents also found that "the pace of recent investments has left their organization with disconnected, piecemeal technology," almost as if they don't know what they're doing and are just putting AI in stuff for no reason. Johnson & Johnson recently decided to "shift from broad generative AI experimentation to a focused approach on high-value use cases" according to the Wall Street Journal, adding that "only 10 to 15% of use cases were driving about 80% of the value." Their last two CEOs (Alex Gorsky and Joaquin Duato) both have MBAs, with current CEO Duato's previous ten years at Johnson & Johnson being "some sort of Chairman or Vice President," and the previous two CEOs (Alex Gorsky and William Weldon) were both pharmaceutical sales and marketing people. Fun fact about Alex Gorsky! During his first tenure at Johnson & Johnson he led marketing of products that deliberately underplayed some drugs' side effects and paid off the largest nursing home pharmacy in America to sell more drugs to old people. The term "executive" loosely refers to a person who moves around numbers and hopes for the best. The modern executive does not "lead," but prod, their managers hall monitors for organizations run predominantly by people that, by design, are entirely removed from the business itself even in roles like marketing and sales, where CMOs and VPs bark orders without really participating in the process. We talk eagerly about how young people in entry level jobs should "earn their stripes" by doing "grunt work," and that too is the neoliberal poison in the veins of our society, because, by definition, your very first experience of the workforce is working hard enough so that you don't have to work as hard. And anyway, the same managerial types who bitch about the entitlement and unrealistic expectations of young people are the same ones that also eviscerated the bottom rung of the career ladder — typically by offshoring many of these roles, or consolidating them into the responsibilities of their increasingly burned-out senior workers — or see AI as a way to eliminate what they see as an optional cost center, and not the future of their workforce. Society berated people for "quiet quitting," a ghastly euphemism for “doing the job as specified in your employment contract,” in 2022 because journalism is enthralled by the management class, and because the management class has so thoroughly rewritten the concept of what "labor" means that people got called lazy for literally doing their jobs. The middle manager brain doesn't see a worker as somebody hired and paid for a job, but as an asset that must provide a return. As a result, if another asset comes along that could potentially provide a bigger return — like an offshore worker, or an AI agent — that middle manager won’t hesitate to drop them. Artificial intelligence is the ultimate panacea for the Business Idiot — a tool that gives an impression of productivity with far more production than the Business Idiot themselves. The Information reported recently that ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott — the chief executive of a company with a market capitalization of over $200 billion, despite the fact that, like SalesForce, nobody really knows what it does — chose to push AI across his whole organization (both in product and in practice) based on the mental consideration I'd usually associate with a raven finding a shiny object: You'll notice that all of this is complete nonsense. What do you mean "efficiency"? What does that quote even mean? 110% of plan? What're you on about? Did you hit your head on something Bill? I'd wager Bill is concussion-free — and an example of a true Business Idiot — a person with incredible power and wealth that makes decisions not based on knowing stuff or caring about his customers, but on the latest shiny thing that makes him think "line go up." No, really, that's Bill McDermott's thing. Back in 2022, he said to Yahoo Finance the metaverse was "real" and that ServiceNow could help someone "create an e-mall in the metaverse" and have a futuristic store of some sort. One might wonder how ServiceNow provided that, and the answer is it didn't. I cannot find a single product that it’s offered that includes it. Bill, like any of these CEOs, doesn't really know stuff, or even do stuff, he just is. The corporate equivalent of a stain on a carpet that nobody really knows how it got there, but hasn’t been removed. The modern executive is symbolic, and the media has — due to the large amount of Business Idiots running these outlets and middle managers stuffed into the editorial class — been trained to never ask difficult questions, such as "what the fuck are you talking about, Bill?" or even the humble "what does that mean?" or "how would you do that?" or saying "I'm not sure I understand, would you mind explaining?" Perhaps the last part is the symptom of the overall problem. So many layers of editorial and managerial power are filled full of people that don't know anything, and there's never anyone crueler about ignorance than somebody that's ignorant themselves. Worse still, in many fields — journalism included — we are rarely rewarded for knowing things or being "right," but being right in the way that keeps the people with the keys from scraping them across our cars. We are, however, rewarded for saying the right thing at the right time, which more often than not means resembling our (white, male) superiors, speaking like our peers, and delivering results in the way that makes everybody feel happiest. A great example of our vibes-based society was back in October 2021, where a Washington Post article written by two Harvard professors rallied against remote work by citing a Microsoft-funded anti-remote study and quoting 130-year-old economist Alfred Marshall about how "workers gather in dense clusters," ignoring the fact that Marshall was so racist they've had to write papers about it, how excited he was about eugenics, or the fact he was writing about fucking factories. Remote work terrifies the Business Idiot, because it removes the performative layer that allowed them to stomp around and feel important, reducing their work to, well...work. Office culture is inherently heteronormative and white, and black women are less likely to be promoted by their managers, and continuing the existence of "The Office" is all about making sure The Business Idiot reigns supreme. Removing the ability for the managerial hall monitors to look at you and try and work out what you're doing without ever really helping is a big part of being a manager — and if you're a manager reading this and saying you don't do this, I challenge you to talk to another person that doesn't confirm your biases. The Business Idiot reigns supreme. Their existence holds up almost every public company, and remote work was the first time they willingly raised their heads. Google demanded employees return to the office in 2021 — but let one executive work remotely from New Zealand because absolutely none of the decisionmaking was done with people that actually do work. While we can (well, you can, I'm not interested) debate whether exclusively working remote is as productive, the Return To Office push was almost entirely done in two ways: The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, and many, many other outlets all fell for this crap because the Business Idiots have captured our media too, training even talented journalists to defer to power at every turn. When every power structure is stuffed full of do-nothing management types that have learned exactly as little as they need to as a means to get by, it's inevitable that journalism caters to them — specious, thoughtless reproductions of the powerful's ideas. Look at the coverage of AI, or the metaverse, or cryptocurrency, or Clubhouse. Look at how willingly reporters will accept narratives not based on practical experience or what the technology can do, but what the powerful (and the popular) are suddenly interested in. Every single tech bubble followed the same path, and that path was paved with flawed, deferential and specious journalism, from small blogs to the biggest mastheads. Look at how reporters talk to executives — not just the way they ask things (like Nilay Patel's 100+ word questions to Sundar Pichai in his abominable interview), but the things they accept them saying, and the willingness reporters have to just accept what they're told. Satya Nadella is the CEO of a company with a market capitalization of over $3 trillion. I have no idea how you, as a reporter, do not say "Satya, what the fuck? You're outsourcing most of your life to generative AI? That's insane!" or even "do you really do that?" and then asking further questions. But that would get you in trouble. The editorial class is the managerial class now, and has spent decades mentoring young reporters to not ask questions, to not push back, to believe that a big, strong, powerful company CEO would never mislead them. Kara Swisher's half-assed interviews are considered "daring" and "critical" because journalism has, at large, lost its teeth, breeding reporters rewarded for knowing a little bit about a few things and punishing those who ask too many questions or refuse to fall in line. The reason they don't want you to ask these questions is that the Business Idiot isn't big on answers. Editors that tell you not to push too hard are doing so because they know the executive likely won't have an answer. It isn't just about the PR person that trained them, but the fact that these men more often than not have only a glancing understanding of their underlying business. Yet in the same way that Business Idiots penetrated every other part of society, they eventually found their way to journalism. While we can (and should) scream at the disconnected idiots that ran Vice into the ground, the problem is everywhere, because the Business Idiots aren't just at the top, but infecting the power structures underlying every newsroom. While there are many really great editors, there are plenty more that barely understand the articles they edit, the stories they commission, or that make reporters pull punches for fear of advertiser blowback. That, and mentorship is dead across effectively all parts of society, meaning that most reporters (as with many jobs) learn by watching each other, which means they all make sure to not ask the rough questions, and not push too hard against the party/market/company messaging until everybody else does it. And under these conditions, Business Idiots thrive. The Business Idiot's reign is one of speciousness and shortcuts, of acquisition, of dominance and of theft. Mentoring people is something you do to pass on knowledge — it may make them grateful to you, but it ultimately, in the mind of a Business Idiot, creates a competitor or rival. Investing in talent, or worker conditions, or even really work itself would require you to know what you're talking about, or actually do work, which doesn't make sense when you're talking to a worker. They're the ones who're meant to work! You're there to manage them! Yet they keep talking back — asking questions about the work you want them to do, asking you to step in and help on something — and all of that's so annoying. Just know the stuff already! Get it done! I have to go to lunch and then go back out to another lunch! I believe this is the predominant mindset across most of the powerful, to the point that everything in the world is constructed to reaffirm their beliefs rather than follow any logical path. Our stock market is inherently illogical, driven not by whether a company is good or bad, but whether it can show growth, even if said growth is horrifically unprofitable, and I'd argue it's because the market has no idea how to make intelligent decisions, just complex ones that mean that you don't really need to understand the business so much as you understand the associated vibes of the industry. Friedman's influence and Reagan's policies have allowed our markets to be dominated by Business Idiocy, where a bad company can be a good stock because everybody (IE: other traders and the business press) likes how it looks, which allows the Business Idiots to continue making profit using illogical and partially-rigged market-making, with the business press helpfully pushing up their narratives. This also keeps regular people from accumulating too much wealth — if regular people could set the tone for the markets as "a company that makes something people like and people pay them for it and they make more money than they spend," that might make things a little too even. It doesn't matter that CoreWeave quite literally does not have enough money for its capital expenditures and lost over $300m in the last quarter because its year-over-year growth was 420%. It doesn't matter that it has October loan payments that will crush the life out of the company either. These narratives are fed to the media knowing that the media will print them, because thinking too hard about a stock would mean the Business Idiot had to think also, and that is not why they are in this business. The "AI trade" is the Business Idiot's nirvana — a fascination for a managerial class that long since gave up any kind of meaningful contribution to the bottom line, as moving away from the fundamental creation of value as a business naturally leads to the same kind of specious value that one finds from generative AI. I’m not even saying that there’s no returns, or that LLMs don’t do anything, or even that there’s no possible commercial use for generative AI. They just don’t do enough, almost by design, and we’re watching companies desperately try and contort them into something, anything that works, pretending so fucking hard they’ll stake their entire futures on the idea. Just fucking work, will you? Agentforce doesn’t make any money, it sucks, but god damn is Marc Benioff going to make you bear witness. Does it matter that Agentforce doesn't make Salesforce any money? No! Because Benioff and Salesforce have got rich selling to fellow Business Idiots who then shove Salesforce into their organization without thinking about who would use it or how they'd use it other than in the most general ways. Agentforce was — and is — a fundamentally boring and insane product, charging $2 a conversation for a chatbot that, to quote The Information, provides customers with "...incorrect answers — AI hallucinations — while testing how the software handles customer service queries." But this shit is catnip to the Business Idiot, because the Business Idiot ideally never has to deal with work, workers or customers. Generative AI doesn’t do enough to actually help us be better at our jobs, but it gives a good enough impression of something useful so that it can convince someone really stupid that doesn’t understand what you do that they don’t need you, sometimes. A generative output is a kind of generic, soulless version of production, one that resembles exactly how a know-nothing executive or manager would summarise your work. OpenAI's "Deep Research" wows professional Business Idiot Ezra Klein because he doesn't seem to realize that part of research is the research itself, not just the output, as you learn about stuff as you research a topic, allowing you to come to a conclusion. The concept of an "agent" is the erotic dream of the managerial sect — a worker that they can personally command to generate product that they can say is their own, all without ever having to know or do anything other than the bare minimum of keeping up appearances, which is the entirety of the Business Idiot's resume. And because the Business Idiot's career has been built on only knowing exactly enough to get by, they don't dig into Large Language Models any further than hammering away at ChatGPT and saying "we must put AI in everything now." Yet the real problem is that for every Business Idiot selling a product, there are many more that will buy it, which has worked in the past for Software as a Service (SaaS) companies that grew fat and happy hocking giant annual contracts and continual upsells, because CIOs and CTOs work for Business Idiot CEOs that demand that they "put AI in everything now," a nonsensical and desperate remit that's part growth-lust and part ignorance, borne of the fear that one gets when they're out of their depth. Look at every single institution installing some sort of ChatGPT integration, and then look for the Business Idiot. Perhaps it's Cal State University Chanceller Mildred Garcia, who claimed that giving everybody a ChatGPT subscription would "elevate...students' educational experience across all fields of study, empower [its] faculty's teaching and research, and help provide the highly educated workforce that will drive California's future AI-driven economy," a nonsensical series of words to justify a $16.9 million-a-year single-vendor no-bid contract to a product that is best known as either a shitty search engine or a way to cheat at college. In some ways, Sam Altman is the Business Idiot's antichrist, taking advantage of a society where the powerful rarely know much other than what they want to control or dominate. ChatGPT and other AI tools are, for the most part, sold based on what they might do in the future to people that will never really use them, and Altman has done well to manipulate, pester and terrify those in power with the idea that they might miss out on something. Does anyone know what it is? No, they don't, because the powerful are Business Idiots too, willing to accept anything that somebody brings along that makes them feel good, or bad in a way that they can make headlines with. In any case, Altman's whole Sloppenheimer motif has worked wonders on the Business Idiots in the markets and global governments that fear what artificial intelligence could do, even if they can't really define artificial intelligence, or what it could do, or what they're scared of. The fear of China's "rise in AI" is one partially based on sinophobia, and partially based on the fact that China has their own Business Idiots willing to shove hundreds of millions of dollars into data centers. Generative AI has created a reckoning between the Business Idiot and the rest of society, its forced adoption and proliferation providing a meager return for the massive investment of capital and the revulsion it causes in many people, not just in the Business Idiot's excitement in replacing them, but how wrong the Business Idiot is. While there are many people that dick around with ChatGPT, years since it launched we still can't find a clean way to say what it does or why it matters other than the fact that everybody agreed it did. The media, now piloted by Business Idiots, has found itself declawed, its reporters unprepared, unwilling and unsupported, the backbone torn out of most newsrooms for fear that being too critical is somehow "not being objective," despite the fact that what you choose to cover objectively is still subjective. Reporters still, to this day, as these companies burn billions of dollars to make an industry the size of the free-to-play gaming industry, refuse to say things that bluntly because "the cost of inference is coming down" and "these companies have some of the smartest people in the world." They ignore the truth as it sits in front of them — that the combined annual recurring revenue of The Information's comprehensive database of every generative AI company is less than $10 billion, or $4 billion if you remove Anthropic and OpenAI. ChatGPT's popularity is the ultimate Business Idiot success story — the "fastest growing product in Silicon Valley history" that didn't grow because it was useful, or good, or able to do anything in particular, but because a media controlled by Business Idiots decided it was "the next big thing" and started talking about it nonstop since November 2022, guaranteeing that everybody would try it, even if even to this day the company can't really explain what it is you're meant to use it for. Much like the Business Idiot themselves, ChatGPT doesn't need to do anything specific. It just needs to make the right sounds at the right times to impress people that barely care what it does other than make them feel futuristic. Real people — regular people, not Business Idiots, not middle managers, not executive coaches, not MBAs, not CEOs — have seen this for what it was early and often, but real people are seldom the ones with the keys, and the media — even the people writing good stuff — regularly fails to directly and clearly say what's going on. The media is scared of doing the wrong thing — of "getting in trouble" with someone for "misquoting them" or "misreading what they said" — and in a society where in-depth knowledge is subordinate to knowing enough catchphrases, the fight often doesn't feel worth it even with an editor's blessing. I also want to be clear that this goes far beyond money. Editors aren't just scared of advertisers being upset. They know that if narratives have to shift toward more critical, thoughtful coverage, they too will have to be more thoughtful and knowledgeable, which is rough when you are a Business Idiot and got there by editing the right people in a way that didn't help them in the slightest. Nothing about what I'm saying should suggest the Business Idiot is weak. In fact, Business Idiots are fully in control — we have too many managers, and our most powerful positions are valorized for not knowing stuff, for having a general view that can "take the big picture," not realizing that a big picture is usually made up of lots of little brush strokes. Yet there are, eventually, consequences for everything being controlled by Business Idiots. Our current society — an unfair, unjust one dominated by half-broken tech products that make their owners billions — is the real punishment wrought by growth, a brain drain in corporate society, one that leads it to doing illogical things and somehow making money. It doesn't make any fucking sense that generative AI got this big. The returns aren't there, the outcomes aren't there, and any sensible society would've put a gun to a ChatGPT and aggressively pulled the trigger. Instead it's the symbolic future of capitalism — one that celebrates mediocrity and costs billions of dollars, every human work it can consume, and the destruction of our planet, all because everybody has kind of agreed that this is what they're all doing, with nobody able to give a convincing explanation of what that even is. Generative AI is revolting both in how overstated its abilities are and in how it continually tests how low a standard someone will take for a product, both in its outputs and in the desperate companies trying to integrate it into everything, and its proliferation throughout society and organizations is already fundamentally harmful. We’re not just drowning in a sea of slop — we’re in a constant state of corporate AI beta tests, new “features” sprouting out of our products like new limbs that sometimes function normally but often attempt to strangle us. It’s unclear if companies forcing these products on us have contempt for us or simply don’t know what good looks like. Or perhaps it's both, with the Business Idiot resenting us for not scarfing down whatever they serve us, as that's what's worked before. They don't really understand their customers — they understand what a customer pays for and how a purchase is made, you know, like the leaders of banks and asset managers during the subprime mortgage crisis didn't really think about whether people could pay those mortgages, just that they needed a lot of them to put in a CDO. The Business Idiot's economy is one built for other Business Idiots. They can only make things that sell to companies that must always be in flux — which is the preferred environment of the Business Idiot, because if they're not perpetually starting new initiatives and jumping on new "innovations," they'd actually have to interact with the underlying production of the company. Does the software work? Sometimes! Do successful companies exist that sell like this? Sure! But look at today's software and tell me with a straight face that things feel good to use. And something like generative AI was inevitable: an industry claiming to change the world that never really does so, full of businesses that don’t function as businesses, full of flimflam and half-truths used to impress people who will likely never interact with it, or do so in only a passing way. By chasing out the people that actually build things in favour of the people that sell them, our economy is built on production puppetry — just like generative AI, and especially like ChatGPT. These people are antithetical to what’s good in the world, and their power deprives us of happiness, the ability to thrive, and honestly any true innovation. The Business Idiot thrives on alienation — on distancing themselves from the customer and the thing they consume, and in many ways from society itself. Mark Zuckerberg wants us to have fake friends, Sam Altman wants us to have fake colleagues, and an increasingly loud group of executives salivate at the idea of replacing us with a fake version of us that will make a shittier version of what we make for a customer that said executive doesn’t fucking care about. They’re building products for other people that don’t interact with the real world. We are no longer their customers, and so, we’re worth even less than before — which, as is the case in a world dominated by shareholder supremacy, not all that much. They do not exist to make us better — the Business Idiot doesn’t really care about the real world, or what you do, or who you are, or anything other than your contribution to their power and wealth. This is why so many squealing little middle managers look up to the Musks and Altmans of the world, because they see in them the same kind of specious corporate authoritarian, someone above work, and thinking, and knowledge. One of the most remarkable things about the Business Idiot is their near-invulnerability. Modern management is resource control, shifting blame away from the manager (who should hold responsibility. After all, if they don’t, why do they have that job?) onto the laborer, knowing that the organization and the media will back it up. While you may think I’m making a generalization, the 2021-2023 anti-remote work push in the media was grotesque proof of where the media’s true allegiance lies — the media happily manufactured consent for return-to-office mandates from large companies by framing remote work as some sort of destructive force, doing all they can to disguise how modern management has no fucking idea how the workplace actually works. These articles were effectively fan fiction for managers and bosses demanding we return to the office — ridiculous statements about how remote work “failed young people” (it didn’t) or how employees needed remote work more than their employers because “the chitchat, lunches and happy hours” are so important. Had any of those reporters spoken to an actual worker, they’d say that they value more time with their families, rather than the grind of a daily commute softened with the promise of an occasional company pizza party — which usually happens outside of the typical working hours, anyway. These articles rarely (if ever) cared about whether remote work was more productive, or that the disconnect appeared to be between managers and workers. It was, from the very beginning, about crushing the life out of a movement that gave workers more flexibility and mobility while suppressing managers’ ability to hide how little work they did. I give credit to CNBC in 2023 for saying the quiet part out loud — that “...the biggest disadvantage of remote work that employers cite is how difficult it is to observe and monitor employees” — because when you can’t do that, you have to (eugh!) actually know what they’re doing and understand their work. Yet higher up the chain, the invulnerability continues. CEOs may get fired — and more are getting fired than ever, although sadly not the ones we want — but always receive some sort of golden parachute payoff at the end before walking into another role at another organization doing exactly the same level of nothing. Yet before that happens, A CEO is allowed to pull basically every lever before they take a single ounce of accountability — laying people off, pay freezes, moving from salaried to contracted workers, closing down sites, cutting certain products, or even spending more fucking money. If you or I misallocated billions of dollars on stupid ideas we’d be fired. CEOs, somehow, get paid more. Let me give you an example. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that the “ultimate computer…is the mixed reality world” and that Microsoft would be “inventing new computers and new computing” in 2016, pushing his senior executives to tell reporters that Hololens was Microsoft’s next wave of computing in 2017, selling hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of headsets to the military in 2019, then debuting HoloLens 2 at BUILD 2019 only for the on-stage demo to break in realtime, calling for a referendum on capitalism in 2020, then saying he couldn’t overstate the breakthrough of the metaverse in 2021. Let’s see what he said about it (props to Preston Gralla of ComputerWorld for finding this): As Gralla notes, Nadella said Microsoft would be, “…beefing up development in projects such as its Mixed Reality Tool Kit MRTK, the virtual reality workspace project AltspaceVR (which it had bought back in 2017), its HoloLens virtual reality headset, and its industrial metaverse unit, among others,” before firing all 100% members of its industrial Metaverse core team along with those behind MRTK and shutting down AltSpace VR (which it acquired in 2017) in 2023, before discontinuing HoloLens 2 entirely in 2024. Nadella was transparently copying Meta and Mark Zuckerberg’s ridiculous “metaverse” play, and absolutely nothing happened to him as a result. The media — outlets like The Verge and independents like Ben Thompson — happily boosted the metaverse idea when it was announced and conveniently forgot it the second that Microsoft and Meta wanted to talk about AI (no, really, both The Verge and Ben Thompson were ready and waiting) without a second’s consideration about what was previously said. A true Business Idiot never admits wrongdoing, and the more powerful the Business Idiot is, the more likely there are power structures that exist to avoid them having to do so. The media, captured by other Business Idiots, has become poisoned by power, deferring to its whims and ideals and treating CEOs with more respect, dignity and intelligence than anyone that works for them. When a big company decides they want to “do AI,” the natural reaction is to ask “how?” and write down the answer rather than think about whether it’s possible or whether the company might profit (say, by increasing their shareholder price) by having whatever they say printed ad verbatim. These people aren’t challenged by the media, or their employees, because their employees are vulnerable all the time, and often encouraged to buy into whatever bullshit is du jour like hostages being held by a terrorist group that eventually fall victim to Stockholm syndrome. They’re only challenged by shareholders, who are agnostic about idiocy because it’s not core to value in any meaningful sense, as we’ve seen with crypto, the metaverse and AI, and shareholders will tolerate infinite levels of idiocy if it boosts the value of their holdings. It goes further too. 2021 saw the largest amount of venture capital invested in the last decade, a record-breaking $643 billion, with a remarkable $329.5 billion of that invested in the US alone. Some of the biggest deals include Amazon reseller aggregator Thrasio, which raised $1 billion in October 2021 and filed for bankruptcy in February 2025, cloud security company Lacework, which raised $525 million in January 2021 then $1.3 billion in October 2021 and was rumoured to be up for sale to Wiz, only for the deal to collapse, and autonomous car company Cruise, which raised $2.75 billion 2021 and was killed off in December 2024. The people who lose their livelihoods — those who took stock in lieu of cash compensation, and those who end up getting laid off at the end — are always workers, while people like Lacework co-CEO Jay Parikh (who oversaw “reckless spending” and “management dysfunction” according to The Information) can walk into highly-paid positions at companies like Microsoft, as he did in October 2024 a few months after a fire sale to cybersecurity Fortinet for around $200 million according to analysts. It doesn’t matter if you’re wrong, or if you run your company badly, because the Business Idiot is infallible, and judged too by fellow disconnected Business Idiots. In a just society, nobody would want to touch any of the C-suite that oversaw a company that handed out Nintendo Switches to literally anyone who booked a meeting (as with Lacework). Instead, the stank remains on the employees alone. It’s so easy, and perhaps inevitable, to feel a sense of nihilism about it all. Nothing matters. It’s all symbolic. Our world is filled with companies run by people who don’t interact with the business, and that raise money from venture capitalists that neither run businesses nor really have any experience doing so. And despite the fact that these people exist several abstractions from reality, the things that they do and the decisions they make impact us all. And it’s hard to imagine how to fix it. We live in a system of iniquity, dominated by people that do not interact with the real world who have created an entire system run by their fellow Business Idiots. The Rot Economy’s growth-at-all-costs mania is a symptom of the grander problem of shareholder supremacy, and the single-minded economic focus on shareholder value inevitably ends at an economy run by and for Business Idiots. There is a line, and it ends here — with layoffs, the destruction of our planet and our economy and our society, and a rising tide of human misery that nobody really knows where it comes from, and so, we don’t know who to blame, and for what. If our economy actually worked as a true meritocracy — where we didn’t have companies run by people who don’t use their products or understand how they’re made, and who hire similarly-specious people — these people would collapse under the pressure of having to know their ass from their earhole. Yet none of this would be possible without the enabling layers, and those layers are teeming with both Business Idiots and those unfortunate enough to have learned from them. The tech media has enabled every single bubble, without exception, accepting every single narrative fed to them by VCs and startups, with even critical reporters still accepting the lunacy of a company like OpenAI just because everybody else does too. Let’s be honest, when you remove all the money, our current tech industry is a disgrace. Our economy is held up by NVIDIA, a company that makes most of its money selling GPUs to other companies primarily so that they can start losing the money selling software that might eventually make them money, just not today. NVIDIA is defined by massive peaks and valleys, as it jumps on trends and bandwagons at the right time, despite knowing that these bandwagons always come to an abrupt halt. The other companies feature Tesla, a meme stock car company with a deteriorating brand and a chief executive famous for his divorces from both reality and multiple women along with a flagrant racism that may cost the company its life. A company that we are watching die in real time, with a stagnant line-up and actual fucking competition from companies that are spending big on innovation. In Europe and elsewhere, BYD is eating Tesla’s lunch, offering better products for half the price — and far less stigma. And this is just the first big Chinese automotive brand to go global. Others — like Chery — are enjoying rapid growth outside of China, because these cars are actually quite good and affordable, even when you factor in the impact of things like tariffs. Hey, remember when Tesla fired all the people in its charging network — despite that being one of the most profitable and valuable parts of the business? And then hired them back because it turns out they were actually useful? This is a good example of managerial alienation — decisions made by non-workers who don’t understand their customers, their businesses, or the work their employees do. And let’s not forget about the Cybertruck, a monstrosity both in how it looks and how it’s sold, and that’s illegal in the majority of developed countries because it is a death-trap for drivers and pedestrians alike. Oh, and that nobody actually wants, with Tesla sitting on a quarter’s worth of inventory that it can’t sell. Elsewhere is Meta, a collapsing social network with 99% of its revenue based on advertising to an increasingly-aged population and a monopoly so flagrantly abusive in its contempt for its customers that it’s at times difficult to call Instagram or Facebook social networks. Mark Zuckerberg had to admit to the Senate Judiciary Committee that people don’t use Facebook as a social network anymore. The reason why is because the platform is so fucking rotten, run by a company alienated from its user base, its decrepit product actively hostile to anybody trying to use it. And, more fundamentally, what’s the point of posting on Facebook if your friends won’t see it, because Meta’s algorithm decided it wouldn’t drive engagement? Meta is a monument to disconnection, a company that runs in counter to its own mission to connect people, run by Mark Zuckerberg, a man who hasn’t had a good idea since he stole it from the Winklevoss Brothers. The solution to all that ails him? Adding generative AI to every part of Meta, which…uh…was meant to do something other than burn $72 billion in capital expenditures in 2025, right? It isn’t clear what was meant to happen, but the Wall Street Journal reports that Meta’s AI chatbots are, and I quote, “empowered to engage in ‘romantic role-play’ that can turn explicit” — even with children. In a civil society, Zuckerberg would be ousted immediately for creating a pedophilic chatbot, — instead, four days after the story ran, everyone cheered Meta’s better-than-expected quarterly earnings. In Redmond, Microsoft sits atop multiple monopolies, using tariffs as a means to juice flailing Xbox revenue as it invests billions of dollars in OpenAI so that OpenAI can spend billions of dollars on cloud compute, losing billions more in the process, requiring Microsoft to invest further money to keep them alive. All because Microsoft wanted generative AI in Bing. What a fucking waste! While also raising the costs of its office suite — which it’s only able to hold a monopoly on because it acted so underhandedly in the 1990s. Amazon lumbers listlessly through life, its giant labor-abuse machine shipping things overnight at whatever cost necessary to crush the life out of any other source of commerce, its cloud services and storage arm, unsure who to copy next. Is it Microsoft? Is it Google? Who knows! But one analyst believes it’s making $5 billion in revenue from AI in 2025 — and spending $105 billion in capital expenditures. There are slot machines with a better ROI than this shit. Again, it’s a company that’s totally exploitative of its customers, no longer acting as a platform that helps people find the shit they need, but to direct them to the products that pay the most for prime advertising real-estate, no matter whether they are good or safe. Let’s be clear: Amazon’s recklessness will kill someone, if it hasn’t already. Then there’s the worst of them — Google. Most famous for its namesake, a search engine that it has juiced as hard as possible, and will continue to juice before the inevitable antitrust sentencing that would rob it of its power, along with the severance of its advertising monopoly. But don’t worry, Google also has a generative AI thing, for some reason, and no, you don’t have a choice about using it, because it’s now stapled onto Google Search and Google Assistant. At no point do any of these companies seem to be focused on making our lives better, or selling us any kind of real future. They exist to maintain the status quo, where cloud computing allows them to retain their various fiefdoms. They’re alienated from people. They’re alienated from workers. They’re alienated from their customers. They’re alienated from the world. They’re deeply antisocial and misanthropic — as demonstrated by Zuck’s moronic AI social network comments. And AI is a symptom of a reckoning of this stupidity and hubris. They cut, and cut, and stagnated. Their hope is a product that will be adopted by billions of imaginary customers and companies, and will allow them to cut further without becoming just a PO Box and a domain name. We have to recognize that what we’re seeing now with generative AI isn’t a fluke or a bug, but a feature of a system that’s rapacious and short-term by its very nature, and doesn’t define value as we do, because “value” gets defined by a faceless shareholder as “growth.” And this system can only exist with the contribution of the business idiot. These are the vanguard — the foot soldiers — of this system, and a key reason why everything is so terrible all the time, and why nothing seems to be getting better. Breaking from that status-quo would require a level of bravery that they don’t have — and perhaps isn’t possible in the current economic system. These people are powerful, and have big platforms. They’re people like Derek Thompson, famed co-author of the “abundance” agenda, who celebrates the idea of a fictitious version of ChatGPT that can entirely plan and execute a 5-year-old’s birthday party, or his co-author Ezra Klein, who, while recording a podcast where his researchers likely listened, talked proudly about replacing their work with OpenAI’s broken Deep Research product, because anything that can be outsourced must be, and all research is “looking at stuff that is relevant.” And really, that’s the most grotesque part about Business Idiots. They see every part of our lives as a series of inputs and outputs They boast about how many books they’ve read rather than the content of said books, about how many hours they work (even though they never, ever work that many), about high level they are in a video game they clearly don’t play, about the money they’ve raised and the scale they’ve raised it at, and about how expensive and fancy their kitchen gadgets are. Everything is dominance, acquisition, growth and possession over any lived experience, because their world is one where the journey doesn’t matter, because their journeys are riddled with privilege and the persecution of others in the pursuit of success. These people don’t want to automate work, they want to automate existence. They fantasize about hitting a button and something happening, because experiencing — living! — is beneath them, or at least your lives and your wants and your joy are. They don’t want to plan their kids’ birthday parties. They don’t want to research things. They don’t value culture or art or beauty. They want to skip to the end, hit fast-forward on anything, because human struggle is for the poor or unworthy. When you are steeped in privilege and/or have earned everything through a mixture of stolen labor and office pantomime, the idea of “effort” is always negative. The process of creation — or affection, of love, of kindness, of using time not just for an action or output — is disgusting to the Business Idiot, because those are times they could be focused on themselves, or some nebulous self-serving “vision” that is, when stripped back to its fundamental truth, is either moronic or malevolent. They don’t realise that you hire a worker for the worker’s work rather than just the work themselves, which is why they don’t see why it’s so insulting to outsource their interactions with human beings. You’ll notice these people never bring up examples of automating actual work — the mind-numbing grunt work that we all face in the workplace — because they neither know nor care what that is. Their “problems” are the things that frustrate them, like dealing with other people, or existing outside of the gilded circles of socialite fucks or plutocrats, or just things that are an inevitable facet of working life, like reading an email. Your son’s birthday party or a conflict with a friend can, indeed, be stressful, but these are not problems to be automated out. They are the struggles that make us human, the things that make us grow, the things that make us who we are, which isn’t a problem for anybody other than somebody who doesn’t believe they need to change in any way. It's both powerful and powerless at the same time — a nihilistic way of seeing our lives as a collection of events we accept or dismiss like a system prompt, the desperate pursuit of such efficient living that you barely feel a thing until you die. I’ve spent years writing about these people without giving them a name, because categorizing anything is difficult. I can’t tell you how long it took for me to synthesize the Rot Economy from the broader trends I saw in tech and elsewhere, how long it took for me to thread that particular needle, to identify the various threads that unified events that are otherwise separate and distinct. I am but one person. Everything you’ve read in my newsletter to this point has been something I’ve had to learn. Building an argument and turning it into words — often at the same time — that other people will read doesn’t come naturally to anyone. It’s something you have to deliberately work at. It’s imperfect. There are typos. These newsletters increase in length and breadth and have so many links, and I will never, ever change my process, because part of said process is learning, relearning, processing, getting pissed off, writing, rewriting, and so on and so forth. This process makes what I do possible, and the idea of having someone automate it disgusts me, not because I’m special or important, but because my work is not the result of me reading a bunch of links or writing a bunch of words. This piece is not just 13,000 words long — it’s the result of the 800,000 or more words I wrote before it, the hundreds of stories I’ve read in the past, the hours of conversations with friends and editors, years of accumulating knowledge and, yes, growing with the work itself. This is not something that you create through a summation of content vomited by an AI, but the chaotic histories of a human being mashed against the challenge of trying to process it. Anyone who believes otherwise is a fucking moron — or, better put, just another Business Idiot. Subscribe today. It's free. Please. Great! You’ve successfully signed up. Welcome back!

Fair warning: this is the longest thing I've written on this newsletter. I do apologize. Soundtrack: EL-P - $4 Vic Listen to my podcast Better Offline. We have merch. Last week, Bloomberg profiled Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, revealing that he's either a liar or a specific kind of idiot. The article revealed that — assume we believe him, and this wasn’t merely a thinly-veiled advert for Microsoft’s AI tech — Copilot consumes Nadella’s life outside the office as well at work. None of these tasks are things that require you to use AI. You can read your messages on Outlook and Teams without having them summarized — and I’d argue that a well-written email is one that doesn’t require a summary. Podcasts are not there "to be chatted about" with an AI. Preparing for meetings isn't something that requires AI, nor is research, unless, of course, you don't really give a shit about the actual content of what you're reading or the message of what you're saying, just that you are "saying the right thing." To be clear, I am deeply unconvinced that Nadella actually runs his life in this way, but if he does, Microsoft’s board should fire him immediately. In any case, the article is rambling, cloying, and ignores Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman's documented history of abusing his workers. Ten custom agents that do what? What do you mean by "other tasks"? Why are these questions never asked? Is it because the reporters know they won't get an answer? Is it because the reporters are too polite to ask more probing questions, knowing that these anecdotes are likely entirely made up as a means to promote a flagging AI ecosystem that cost billions to construct, but doesn’t really seem to do anything, and the reporter in question doesn’t want to force Satya to build a bigger house of cards than he needs to. Or is it because we, as a society, do not want to look too closely at the powerful? Is it because we've handed our economy to men that get paid $79 million a year to do a job they can't seem to describe, and even that, they would sooner offload to a bunch of unreliable AI models than actually do? We live in the era of the symbolic executive, when "being good at stuff" matters far less than the appearance of doing stuff, where "what's useful" is dictated not by outputs or metrics that one can measure but rather the vibes passed between managers and executives that have worked their entire careers to escape the world of work. Our economy is run by people that don't participate in it and our tech companies are directed by people that don't experience the problems they allege to solve for their customers, as the modern executive is no longer a person with demands or responsibilities beyond their allegiance to shareholder value. I, however, believe the problem runs a little deeper than the economy, which is a symptom of a bigger, virulent, and treatment-resistant plague that has infected the minds of those currently twigging at the levers of power — and really, the only levers that actually matter. The incentives behind effectively everything we do have been broken by decades of neoliberal thinking, where the idea of a company — an entity created to do a thing in exchange for money —has been drained of all meaning beyond the continued domination and extraction of everything around it, focusing heavily on short-term gains and growth at all costs. In doing so, the definition of a “good business” has changed from one that makes good products at a fair price to a sustainable and loyal market, to one that can display the most stock price growth from quarter to quarter. This is the Rot Economy, which is a useful description for how tech companies have voluntarily degraded their core products in order to placate shareholders, transforming useful — and sometimes beloved — services into a hollow shell of their former selves as a means of expressing growth. But it’s worth noting that this transformation isn’t constrained to the tech industry, nor was it a phenomena that occurred when the tech industry entered its current VC-fuelled, publicly-traded incarnation. In The Shareholder Supremacy, I drew a line from an early 20th-century court ruling, to former General Electric CEO Jack Welch, to the current tech industry, but there’s one figure I didn’t pay as much attention to, and I regrettably now have to do so. Famed Chicago School economist (and dweller of Hell) Milton Friedman once argued in his 1970 doctrine that those who didn’t focus on shareholder value were “unwitting pup­pets of the intellectual forces that have been undermining the basis of a free society these past decades," and that any social responsibility — say, treating workers well, doing anything other than focus on shareholder value — is tantamount to an executive taxing his shareholders by "spending their money" on their own personal beliefs. Friedman was a fundamentalist when it came to unrestricted, unfettered capitalism, and this zealotry surpassed any sense of basic human morality — if he had any — at times. For example, in his book, Capitalism and Friedman, he argued that companies should be allowed to discriminate on racial grounds because the owner might suffer should they be required to hire an equally or better-qualified Black person. Bear in mind, this was written at the height of the civil rights movement, just six years before the assassination of Martin Luther King, and when America was rapidly waking up to the evils of racism and segregation (a process, I add, is ongoing and sadly not complete). This is a direct quote: Friedman was grotesque. I am not religious, but I hope Hell exists if only for him. The broader point I’m trying to make is that neoliberalism is inherently selfish, believing that the free market should reign supreme, bereft of government intervention, regulation or interference, thinking that somehow these terms will enable "freedom" rather than a kind of market-dominated quasi-dictatorship where our entire lives are dominated by the whims of the affluent, and that there is no institution that can possibly push back against them. Friedman himself makes the facile argument that economic freedom — which, he says, is synonymous with unfettered capitalism — is a necessary condition of unfettered political freedom. Obviously, that’s bollocks, although it’s an argument that’s proven persuasive with a certain class of people that are either intellectually or morally hollow (or both). Neoliberalism also represents a kind of modern-day feudalism, dividing society based on whether someone is a shareholder or not, with the former taking precedence and the latter seen as irrelevant at best, or disposable at worst. It’s curious that Friedman saw economic freedom — a state that is non-interventionist in economic matters — as essential for political freedom, while also failing to see equality as the same. I realize this is all very big and clunky, but I want you to understand how these incentives have fundamentally changed everything, and why they are responsible for the rot we see in our society and our workplaces. When your only incentive is shareholder value, and you raise shareholder value as a platonic ideal, everything else is secondary, including the customer you are selling something to. Friedman himself makes a moral case for discrimination, because shareholder value — in his example, the store owner — matters more than racial equality at its most basic level. When you care only about shareholder value, the only job you have is to promote further exploitation and dominance — not to have happy customers, not to make your company "a good place to work," not to make a good product, not to make a difference or contribute to anything other than further growth. While this is, to anyone with a vapor of an intellectual or moral dimension, absolutely fucking stupid, it’s an idea that’s proven depressingly endemic among the managerial elite, in part because it has entered the culture, and because it is hammered across in MBA classes and corporate training seminars. In simpler terms, modern business theory trains executives not to be good at something, or to make a company based on their particular skills, but to "find a market opportunity" and exploit it. The Chief Executive — who makes over 300 times more than their average worker — is no longer a leadership position, but a kind of figurehead measured on their ability to continually grow the market capitalization of their company. It is a position inherently defined by its lack of labor, the amorphousness of its purpose and its lack of any clear responsibility. While CEOs do get fired when things go badly, it's often after a prolonged period of decline and stagnancy, and almost always comes with some sort of payoff — and when I say "badly," I mean that growth has slowed to the point that even firing masses of people doesn't make things better. We have, as a society, reframed all business leadership — which is increasingly broad, consisting of all management from the C-suite down — to be the equivalent of a mall cop, a person that exists to make sure people are working without having any real accountability for the work themselves, or to even understand the work itself. When the leader of a company doesn't participate in or respect the production of the goods that enriches them, it creates a culture that enables similarly vacuous leaders on all levels. Management as a concept no longer means doing "work," but establishing cultures of dominance and value extraction. A CEO isn't measured on happy customers or even how good their revenue is today, but how good revenue might be tomorrow and whether those customers are paying them more. A "manager," much like a CEO, is no longer a position with any real responsibility — they're there to make sure you're working, to know enough about your work that they can sort of tell you what to do, but somehow the job of "telling you what to do" doesn't come with it any actual work, and the instructions don’t need to be useful or even meaningful. Decades of direct erosion of the very concept of leadership means that the people running companies have been selected not based on their actual efficacy — especially as the position became defined by its lack of actual production — but on whether they resemble what a manager or executive is meant to look like based on the work that somebody else did. That’s how someone like David Zaslav, a lawyer by trade and arguably the worst CEO in the entertainment industry, managed to become the head of Warner Brothers (that, and kissing up to Jack Welch, who he called a “big brother” that “picked him up like a friend”). It’s how Carly Fiorina — an MBA by trade — went on to become the head of HP, only to drive the company into a ditch where it stopped innovating, and largely missed the biggest opportunities of the early Internet era. The three CEOs that followed (Mark Hurd (who was ousted after fudging expense reports to send money to a love interest and still got tens of millions of dollars in severance), Leo Apotheker (who the New York Times suggests may have been worse than Fiorina), and Meg Whitman (famous for being a terrible CEO at HP and co-founding doomed video startup Quibi) similarly came from a non-tech background, and similarly did a shitty job, in part because they didn’t understand the company or the products or the customers. Management has, over the course of the past few decades, eroded the very fabric of corporate America, and I'd argue it’s done the same in multiple other western economies, too. I’d also argue that this kind of dumb management thinking also infected the highest echelons of politics across the world, and especially in the UK, my country of birth and where I lived until 2011, delivering the same kind of disastrous effects but at a macro level, as they impacted not a single corporate entity but the very institutions of the state. I’m not naive. I don’t think that the average politician is a salt-of-the-earth type, someone who did a normal job and then decided to enter politics. Especially not in the UK, where the trappings of class permeate everything, and we’re yet to shake off the noxious influence of the aristocracy and constitutionally-mandated hereditary privilege. Our political elite often comes from one of two universities (Oxford and Cambridge, the alma mater of 20% of current UK Members of Parliament) and a handful of fee-paying schools (like Eton, which is a hellmouth for the worst people to ever exist, and educated 20 of the UK’s 55 prime ministers). The UK has never been an egalitarian society. And yet, things have changed markedly in the past few decades.The difference between now and then is that the silver-spooned elite was, whether because they believed it or because it was politically expedient, not totally contemptuous of those at the bottom of the economic ladder. I was born in the midst of the Thatcher government, and my formative years were spent as British society tried to restructure itself after her reforms. Thatcher, famously, was an acolyte of the Friedman school of thought, and spent her nearly twelve years in office dismantling the state and pushing the culture towards an American-style individualism, once famously quipping that there was “no such thing as society.” She didn’t understand how things worked, but was nonetheless completely convinced of the power of the market to handle what was the functions of the state — from housing to energy and water. The end result of this political and cultural shift was, in the long run, disastrous. The UK has the smallest houses in the OECD, the smallest housing stock of any developed country, and some of the worst affordability. The privatization of the UK’s water infrastructure meant that money that would previously go towards infrastructure upgrades was, instead, funnelled to shareholders in the form of dividends. As a result, Britain is literally unable to process human waste and is actively dumping millions of liters of human sewage into its waterways and coastline. When Britain privatized its energy companies, the new management sold or closed the vast majority of its gas storage infrastructure. As a result, when the Ukraine War sparked, and natural gas prices surged, Britain had some of the smallest reserves of any country in Europe, and was forced to buy gas at the market prices — which were several times higher than their pre-war levels. I’m no fan of Thatcher, and like Friedman, I too wish hell exists, if only for the both of them. I wrote the above to emphasize the consequences of this clueless managerial thinking on a macro level — where the impacts aren’t just declining tech products or white-collar layoffs, but rather the emergence of generational crises in housing, energy, and the environment. These crises were obvious consequences of decisions made by someone whose belief in the free market was almost absolute, and whose fundamentalist beliefs surpassed the actual informed understanding of those working in energy, or housing, or water. As the legendary advertiser Stanley Pollitt once said, “bullshit baffles brains.” The sweeping changes we’ve seen, both in our economy and in our society, has led to an unprecedented, gilded age of bullshit where nothing matters, and things — things of actual substance — matter nothing. We live in a symbolic economy where we apply for jobs, writing CVs and cover letters to resemble a certain kind of hire, with our resume read by someone who doesn't do or understand our job, but yet is responsible for determining whether we’re worthy of going to the next step of the hiring process. All this so that we might get an interview with a manager or executive who will decide whether they think we can do it. We are managed by people whose job is implicitly not to do work, but oversee it. We are, as children (and young adults), encouraged to aspire to become a manager or executive, to "own our own business," to "have people that work for us," and the terms of our society are, by default, that management is not a role you work at, so much as a position you hold — a figurehead that passes the buck and makes far more of them than you do. This problem, I believe, has poisoned the fabric of almost every part of modern business, elevating people that don't do work to oversee companies that make things they don't understand, creating substrates of management that do not do anything but create further distance from actually doing a job. While some of you might automatically think I'm talking about Graeber's concept of Bullshit Jobs, this is far, far bigger. The system as it stands selects people at all levels of management specifically because they resemble the kind of specious, work-averse dullard that runs seemingly every company — a person built to go from meeting to meeting with the vague consternation that suggests they're "busy." As a result, the higher you get up in an organization, the further you get from the customer, the problem you've solving, and any of the actual work, and the higher up you get, the more power you have to change the conditions of the business. On some level, modern corporate power structures are a giant game of telephone where vibes beget further vibes, where managers only kind-of-sort-of understand what's going on, and the more vague one's understanding is, the more likely you are to lean toward what's good, or easy, or makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside. The system selects for people comfortable in these roles, creating org charts full of people that become harder and harder to justify other than "they've been here a while." They do not do "work" on the "product," and their answer as to why would be "what, am I meant to go down on the line and use a machine?" or "am I meant to call a customer and make a sale?" and the answer is yes, you lazy fucking piece of shit, you should do that once in a while, or at the very least go and watch or listen to somebody else do so, and do so regularly. But that's not what a manager does, right? Management isn't work, it's about thinking really hard and telling people what to do. It's about making the calls. It's about "managing people," and that can mean just about anything, but often means "who do I take credit from or pass blame to," because modern management has been stripped of all meaning other than continually reinforcing power structures for the next manager up. This system creates products for these people, because these people are more often than not the ones in power — they are your boss, your boss' boss, and their boss too. Big companies build products sold by specious executives or managers to other specious executives, and thus the products themselves stop resembling things that solve problems so much as they resemble a solution. After all, the person buying it — at least at the scale of a public company — isn’t necessarily the recipient of the final product, so they too are trained (and selected) to make calls based on vibes. I believe the scale of this problem is society-wide, and it is, at its core, a destruction of what it means to be a leader, and a valorization of selfishness, isolationist thinking, turning labor into a faceless resource, which naturally leads to seeing customers in an equally faceless way, their problems generalized, their pain points viewed as parts of a powerpoint rather than anything that your company earnestly tries to solve or even really thinks about. And that assumes that said pain points are even considered to begin with, or not ignored in favor of a fictitious and purely hypothetical pain point. People — be they the ones you're paying or paying you — become numbers. We have created and elevated an entirely new class of person, the nebulous "manager," and told decades-worth of children that's what they should aspire to, that the next step from doing a job is for us to tell other people to do a job, until we're able to one day tell those people how to do their job, with each rung on the corporate ladder further distancing ourselves from anything that interacts with reality. The real breaking point is fairly simple: the higher up you go at a company, the further you are from problems or purpose. Everything is abstract — the people that work for you, the people you work for, and even the tasks you do. We train people — from a young age! — to generalize and distance oneself from actual tasks, to aspire to doing managerial work, because managers are well-paid and "know what's going on," even if they haven't actually known what was going on for years, if they ever did so. This phenomenon has led to the stigmatization of blue-collar work (and the subsequent evisceration of practical trade and technical education across most of the developed world) in favor of universities. Society respects an MBA more than a plumber, even though the latter benefits society more — though I concede that both roles involve, on some level, shit, with the plumber unblocking it and the MBA spewing it. I believe this process has created a symbolic society — one where people are elevated not by any actual ability to do something or knowledge they may have, but by their ability to make the right noises and look the right way to get ahead. The power structures of modern society are run by business idiots — people that have learned enough to impress the people above them, because the business idiots have had power for decades. They have bred out true meritocracy or achievement or value-creation in favor of symbolic growth and superficial intelligence, because real work is hard, and there are so many of them in power they've all found a way to work together. I need you to understand how widespread this problem is, because it is why everything feels fucking wrong. Think of the Business Idiot as a kind of con artist, except the con has become the standard way of doing business for an alarmingly large part of society. The Business Idiot is the manager that doesn't seem to do anything but keeps being promoted, and the chief executive officer of a public company that says boring, specious nonsense about AI. They're the tenured professor that you wish would die, the administrator whose only job appears to be opening and closing their laptop, the consultant that can come up with a million reasons to charge you more money yet not one metric to judge their success by, the marketing executive that's worked exactly three years at every major cloud player but does not appear to have done anything, and the investor that invests "based on founders," but really means "guys that look at sound exactly like them." These people are present throughout the private and public sector, and our governments too, and they paradoxically do nothing of substance, but somehow damage everything they touch. This isn’t to say our public and private sector is entirely useless — just that these people have poisoned so many parts of our power structures that avoiding them is impossible. Our economy is oriented around them — made easier and more illogical for their benefit — because their literal only goal in life has been to take and use power. The Business Idiot is also an authoritarian, and will do whatever they need to — including harming the institution they work for, or those closest to them, like their co-workers or their community — as a means of avoiding true accountability or responsibility. Decades of neoliberalism has incentivized their rise, because when you incentivize society to become management — to "manage or run a company" rather than do something for a reason or purpose — you are incentivizing a kind of corporate narcissism, one that bleeds into whatever field the person goes into, be it public or private. We go to college as a means of getting a job after college using the grades we got in college, rendering many students desperate to get the best grades they can versus "learn" anything, because our economy is riddled with power structures controlled by people that don't know stuff and find it offensive when you remind them. Our society is in the thrall of dumb management, and functions as such. Every government, the top quarter of every org chart, features little Neros who, instead of battling the fire engulfing Rome, are sat in their palaces strumming an off-key version of “Wonderwall” on the lyre and grumbling about how the firefighters need to work harder, and maybe we could replace them with an LLM and a smart sprinkler system. Every institution keeps its core constituents and labor forces at arms-length, and effectively anything built at scale quickly becomes distanced from both the customer and laborer. This disconnection — or alienation — sits at the center of almost every problem I've ever talked about. Why would companies push generative AI in seemingly every part of their service, even though customers don't like it and it doesn't really work? It's simple: they neither know nor care what the customer wants, barely know how their businesses function, barely know what their products do, and barely understand what their workers are doing, meaning that generative AI feels magical, because it does an impression of somebody doing a job, which is an accurate way of describing how most executives and middle managers operate. Let me get a little more specific. An IBM study based on conversations with 2,000 global CEOs recently found that only 25% of AI initiatives have delivered their expected ROI over the last few years, and, worse still, "64% of CEOs surveyed acknowledge that the risk of falling behind drives investment in some technologies before they have a clear understanding of the value they bring to the organization." 50% of respondents also found that "the pace of recent investments has left their organization with disconnected, piecemeal technology," almost as if they don't know what they're doing and are just putting AI in stuff for no reason. Johnson & Johnson recently decided to "shift from broad generative AI experimentation to a focused approach on high-value use cases" according to the Wall Street Journal, adding that "only 10 to 15% of use cases were driving about 80% of the value." Their last two CEOs (Alex Gorsky and Joaquin Duato) both have MBAs, with current CEO Duato's previous ten years at Johnson & Johnson being "some sort of Chairman or Vice President," and the previous two CEOs (Alex Gorsky and William Weldon) were both pharmaceutical sales and marketing people. Fun fact about Alex Gorsky! During his first tenure at Johnson & Johnson he led marketing of products that deliberately underplayed some drugs' side effects and paid off the largest nursing home pharmacy in America to sell more drugs to old people. The term "executive" loosely refers to a person who moves around numbers and hopes for the best. The modern executive does not "lead," but prod, their managers hall monitors for organizations run predominantly by people that, by design, are entirely removed from the business itself even in roles like marketing and sales, where CMOs and VPs bark orders without really participating in the process. We talk eagerly about how young people in entry level jobs should "earn their stripes" by doing "grunt work," and that too is the neoliberal poison in the veins of our society, because, by definition, your very first experience of the workforce is working hard enough so that you don't have to work as hard. And anyway, the same managerial types who bitch about the entitlement and unrealistic expectations of young people are the same ones that also eviscerated the bottom rung of the career ladder — typically by offshoring many of these roles, or consolidating them into the responsibilities of their increasingly burned-out senior workers — or see AI as a way to eliminate what they see as an optional cost center, and not the future of their workforce. Society berated people for "quiet quitting," a ghastly euphemism for “doing the job as specified in your employment contract,” in 2022 because journalism is enthralled by the management class, and because the management class has so thoroughly rewritten the concept of what "labor" means that people got called lazy for literally doing their jobs. The middle manager brain doesn't see a worker as somebody hired and paid for a job, but as an asset that must provide a return. As a result, if another asset comes along that could potentially provide a bigger return — like an offshore worker, or an AI agent — that middle manager won’t hesitate to drop them. Artificial intelligence is the ultimate panacea for the Business Idiot — a tool that gives an impression of productivity with far more production than the Business Idiot themselves. The Information reported recently that ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott — the chief executive of a company with a market capitalization of over $200 billion, despite the fact that, like SalesForce, nobody really knows what it does — chose to push AI across his whole organization (both in product and in practice) based on the mental consideration I'd usually associate with a raven finding a shiny object: You'll notice that all of this is complete nonsense. What do you mean "efficiency"? What does that quote even mean? 110% of plan? What're you on about? Did you hit your head on something Bill? I'd wager Bill is concussion-free — and an example of a true Business Idiot — a person with incredible power and wealth that makes decisions not based on knowing stuff or caring about his customers, but on the latest shiny thing that makes him think "line go up." No, really, that's Bill McDermott's thing. Back in 2022, he said to Yahoo Finance the metaverse was "real" and that ServiceNow could help someone "create an e-mall in the metaverse" and have a futuristic store of some sort. One might wonder how ServiceNow provided that, and the answer is it didn't. I cannot find a single product that it’s offered that includes it. Bill, like any of these CEOs, doesn't really know stuff, or even do stuff, he just is. The corporate equivalent of a stain on a carpet that nobody really knows how it got there, but hasn’t been removed. The modern executive is symbolic, and the media has — due to the large amount of Business Idiots running these outlets and middle managers stuffed into the editorial class — been trained to never ask difficult questions, such as "what the fuck are you talking about, Bill?" or even the humble "what does that mean?" or "how would you do that?" or saying "I'm not sure I understand, would you mind explaining?" Perhaps the last part is the symptom of the overall problem. So many layers of editorial and managerial power are filled full of people that don't know anything, and there's never anyone crueler about ignorance than somebody that's ignorant themselves. Worse still, in many fields — journalism included — we are rarely rewarded for knowing things or being "right," but being right in the way that keeps the people with the keys from scraping them across our cars. We are, however, rewarded for saying the right thing at the right time, which more often than not means resembling our (white, male) superiors, speaking like our peers, and delivering results in the way that makes everybody feel happiest. A great example of our vibes-based society was back in October 2021, where a Washington Post article written by two Harvard professors rallied against remote work by citing a Microsoft-funded anti-remote study and quoting 130-year-old economist Alfred Marshall about how "workers gather in dense clusters," ignoring the fact that Marshall was so racist they've had to write papers about it, how excited he was about eugenics, or the fact he was writing about fucking factories. Remote work terrifies the Business Idiot, because it removes the performative layer that allowed them to stomp around and feel important, reducing their work to, well...work. Office culture is inherently heteronormative and white, and black women are less likely to be promoted by their managers, and continuing the existence of "The Office" is all about making sure The Business Idiot reigns supreme. Removing the ability for the managerial hall monitors to look at you and try and work out what you're doing without ever really helping is a big part of being a manager — and if you're a manager reading this and saying you don't do this, I challenge you to talk to another person that doesn't confirm your biases. The Business Idiot reigns supreme. Their existence holds up almost every public company, and remote work was the first time they willingly raised their heads. Google demanded employees return to the office in 2021 — but let one executive work remotely from New Zealand because absolutely none of the decisionmaking was done with people that actually do work. While we can (well, you can, I'm not interested) debate whether exclusively working remote is as productive, the Return To Office push was almost entirely done in two ways: The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, and many, many other outlets all fell for this crap because the Business Idiots have captured our media too, training even talented journalists to defer to power at every turn. When every power structure is stuffed full of do-nothing management types that have learned exactly as little as they need to as a means to get by, it's inevitable that journalism caters to them — specious, thoughtless reproductions of the powerful's ideas. Look at the coverage of AI, or the metaverse, or cryptocurrency, or Clubhouse. Look at how willingly reporters will accept narratives not based on practical experience or what the technology can do, but what the powerful (and the popular) are suddenly interested in. Every single tech bubble followed the same path, and that path was paved with flawed, deferential and specious journalism, from small blogs to the biggest mastheads. Look at how reporters talk to executives — not just the way they ask things (like Nilay Patel's 100+ word questions to Sundar Pichai in his abominable interview), but the things they accept them saying, and the willingness reporters have to just accept what they're told. Satya Nadella is the CEO of a company with a market capitalization of over $3 trillion. I have no idea how you, as a reporter, do not say "Satya, what the fuck? You're outsourcing most of your life to generative AI? That's insane!" or even "do you really do that?" and then asking further questions. But that would get you in trouble. The editorial class is the managerial class now, and has spent decades mentoring young reporters to not ask questions, to not push back, to believe that a big, strong, powerful company CEO would never mislead them. Kara Swisher's half-assed interviews are considered "daring" and "critical" because journalism has, at large, lost its teeth, breeding reporters rewarded for knowing a little bit about a few things and punishing those who ask too many questions or refuse to fall in line. The reason they don't want you to ask these questions is that the Business Idiot isn't big on answers. Editors that tell you not to push too hard are doing so because they know the executive likely won't have an answer. It isn't just about the PR person that trained them, but the fact that these men more often than not have only a glancing understanding of their underlying business. Yet in the same way that Business Idiots penetrated every other part of society, they eventually found their way to journalism. While we can (and should) scream at the disconnected idiots that ran Vice into the ground, the problem is everywhere, because the Business Idiots aren't just at the top, but infecting the power structures underlying every newsroom. While there are many really great editors, there are plenty more that barely understand the articles they edit, the stories they commission, or that make reporters pull punches for fear of advertiser blowback. That, and mentorship is dead across effectively all parts of society, meaning that most reporters (as with many jobs) learn by watching each other, which means they all make sure to not ask the rough questions, and not push too hard against the party/market/company messaging until everybody else does it. And under these conditions, Business Idiots thrive. The Business Idiot's reign is one of speciousness and shortcuts, of acquisition, of dominance and of theft. Mentoring people is something you do to pass on knowledge — it may make them grateful to you, but it ultimately, in the mind of a Business Idiot, creates a competitor or rival. Investing in talent, or worker conditions, or even really work itself would require you to know what you're talking about, or actually do work, which doesn't make sense when you're talking to a worker. They're the ones who're meant to work! You're there to manage them! Yet they keep talking back — asking questions about the work you want them to do, asking you to step in and help on something — and all of that's so annoying. Just know the stuff already! Get it done! I have to go to lunch and then go back out to another lunch! I believe this is the predominant mindset across most of the powerful, to the point that everything in the world is constructed to reaffirm their beliefs rather than follow any logical path. Our stock market is inherently illogical, driven not by whether a company is good or bad, but whether it can show growth, even if said growth is horrifically unprofitable, and I'd argue it's because the market has no idea how to make intelligent decisions, just complex ones that mean that you don't really need to understand the business so much as you understand the associated vibes of the industry. Friedman's influence and Reagan's policies have allowed our markets to be dominated by Business Idiocy, where a bad company can be a good stock because everybody (IE: other traders and the business press) likes how it looks, which allows the Business Idiots to continue making profit using illogical and partially-rigged market-making, with the business press helpfully pushing up their narratives. This also keeps regular people from accumulating too much wealth — if regular people could set the tone for the markets as "a company that makes something people like and people pay them for it and they make more money than they spend," that might make things a little too even. It doesn't matter that CoreWeave quite literally does not have enough money for its capital expenditures and lost over $300m in the last quarter because its year-over-year growth was 420%. It doesn't matter that it has October loan payments that will crush the life out of the company either. These narratives are fed to the media knowing that the media will print them, because thinking too hard about a stock would mean the Business Idiot had to think also, and that is not why they are in this business. The "AI trade" is the Business Idiot's nirvana — a fascination for a managerial class that long since gave up any kind of meaningful contribution to the bottom line, as moving away from the fundamental creation of value as a business naturally leads to the same kind of specious value that one finds from generative AI. I’m not even saying that there’s no returns, or that LLMs don’t do anything, or even that there’s no possible commercial use for generative AI. They just don’t do enough, almost by design, and we’re watching companies desperately try and contort them into something, anything that works, pretending so fucking hard they’ll stake their entire futures on the idea. Just fucking work, will you? Agentforce doesn’t make any money, it sucks, but god damn is Marc Benioff going to make you bear witness. Does it matter that Agentforce doesn't make Salesforce any money? No! Because Benioff and Salesforce have got rich selling to fellow Business Idiots who then shove Salesforce into their organization without thinking about who would use it or how they'd use it other than in the most general ways. Agentforce was — and is — a fundamentally boring and insane product, charging $2 a conversation for a chatbot that, to quote The Information, provides customers with "...incorrect answers — AI hallucinations — while testing how the software handles customer service queries." But this shit is catnip to the Business Idiot, because the Business Idiot ideally never has to deal with work, workers or customers. Generative AI doesn’t do enough to actually help us be better at our jobs, but it gives a good enough impression of something useful so that it can convince someone really stupid that doesn’t understand what you do that they don’t need you, sometimes. A generative output is a kind of generic, soulless version of production, one that resembles exactly how a know-nothing executive or manager would summarise your work. OpenAI's "Deep Research" wows professional Business Idiot Ezra Klein because he doesn't seem to realize that part of research is the research itself, not just the output, as you learn about stuff as you research a topic, allowing you to come to a conclusion. The concept of an "agent" is the erotic dream of the managerial sect — a worker that they can personally command to generate product that they can say is their own, all without ever having to know or do anything other than the bare minimum of keeping up appearances, which is the entirety of the Business Idiot's resume. And because the Business Idiot's career has been built on only knowing exactly enough to get by, they don't dig into Large Language Models any further than hammering away at ChatGPT and saying "we must put AI in everything now." Yet the real problem is that for every Business Idiot selling a product, there are many more that will buy it, which has worked in the past for Software as a Service (SaaS) companies that grew fat and happy hocking giant annual contracts and continual upsells, because CIOs and CTOs work for Business Idiot CEOs that demand that they "put AI in everything now," a nonsensical and desperate remit that's part growth-lust and part ignorance, borne of the fear that one gets when they're out of their depth. Look at every single institution installing some sort of ChatGPT integration, and then look for the Business Idiot. Perhaps it's Cal State University Chanceller Mildred Garcia, who claimed that giving everybody a ChatGPT subscription would "elevate...students' educational experience across all fields of study, empower [its] faculty's teaching and research, and help provide the highly educated workforce that will drive California's future AI-driven economy," a nonsensical series of words to justify a $16.9 million-a-year single-vendor no-bid contract to a product that is best known as either a shitty search engine or a way to cheat at college. In some ways, Sam Altman is the Business Idiot's antichrist, taking advantage of a society where the powerful rarely know much other than what they want to control or dominate. ChatGPT and other AI tools are, for the most part, sold based on what they might do in the future to people that will never really use them, and Altman has done well to manipulate, pester and terrify those in power with the idea that they might miss out on something. Does anyone know what it is? No, they don't, because the powerful are Business Idiots too, willing to accept anything that somebody brings along that makes them feel good, or bad in a way that they can make headlines with. In any case, Altman's whole Sloppenheimer motif has worked wonders on the Business Idiots in the markets and global governments that fear what artificial intelligence could do, even if they can't really define artificial intelligence, or what it could do, or what they're scared of. The fear of China's "rise in AI" is one partially based on sinophobia, and partially based on the fact that China has their own Business Idiots willing to shove hundreds of millions of dollars into data centers. Generative AI has created a reckoning between the Business Idiot and the rest of society, its forced adoption and proliferation providing a meager return for the massive investment of capital and the revulsion it causes in many people, not just in the Business Idiot's excitement in replacing them, but how wrong the Business Idiot is. While there are many people that dick around with ChatGPT, years since it launched we still can't find a clean way to say what it does or why it matters other than the fact that everybody agreed it did. The media, now piloted by Business Idiots, has found itself declawed, its reporters unprepared, unwilling and unsupported, the backbone torn out of most newsrooms for fear that being too critical is somehow "not being objective," despite the fact that what you choose to cover objectively is still subjective. Reporters still, to this day, as these companies burn billions of dollars to make an industry the size of the free-to-play gaming industry, refuse to say things that bluntly because "the cost of inference is coming down" and "these companies have some of the smartest people in the world." They ignore the truth as it sits in front of them — that the combined annual recurring revenue of The Information's comprehensive database of every generative AI company is less than $10 billion, or $4 billion if you remove Anthropic and OpenAI. ChatGPT's popularity is the ultimate Business Idiot success story — the "fastest growing product in Silicon Valley history" that didn't grow because it was useful, or good, or able to do anything in particular, but because a media controlled by Business Idiots decided it was "the next big thing" and started talking about it nonstop since November 2022, guaranteeing that everybody would try it, even if even to this day the company can't really explain what it is you're meant to use it for. Much like the Business Idiot themselves, ChatGPT doesn't need to do anything specific. It just needs to make the right sounds at the right times to impress people that barely care what it does other than make them feel futuristic. Real people — regular people, not Business Idiots, not middle managers, not executive coaches, not MBAs, not CEOs — have seen this for what it was early and often, but real people are seldom the ones with the keys, and the media — even the people writing good stuff — regularly fails to directly and clearly say what's going on. The media is scared of doing the wrong thing — of "getting in trouble" with someone for "misquoting them" or "misreading what they said" — and in a society where in-depth knowledge is subordinate to knowing enough catchphrases, the fight often doesn't feel worth it even with an editor's blessing. I also want to be clear that this goes far beyond money. Editors aren't just scared of advertisers being upset. They know that if narratives have to shift toward more critical, thoughtful coverage, they too will have to be more thoughtful and knowledgeable, which is rough when you are a Business Idiot and got there by editing the right people in a way that didn't help them in the slightest. Nothing about what I'm saying should suggest the Business Idiot is weak. In fact, Business Idiots are fully in control — we have too many managers, and our most powerful positions are valorized for not knowing stuff, for having a general view that can "take the big picture," not realizing that a big picture is usually made up of lots of little brush strokes. Yet there are, eventually, consequences for everything being controlled by Business Idiots. Our current society — an unfair, unjust one dominated by half-broken tech products that make their owners billions — is the real punishment wrought by growth, a brain drain in corporate society, one that leads it to doing illogical things and somehow making money. It doesn't make any fucking sense that generative AI got this big. The returns aren't there, the outcomes aren't there, and any sensible society would've put a gun to a ChatGPT and aggressively pulled the trigger. Instead it's the symbolic future of capitalism — one that celebrates mediocrity and costs billions of dollars, every human work it can consume, and the destruction of our planet, all because everybody has kind of agreed that this is what they're all doing, with nobody able to give a convincing explanation of what that even is. Generative AI is revolting both in how overstated its abilities are and in how it continually tests how low a standard someone will take for a product, both in its outputs and in the desperate companies trying to integrate it into everything, and its proliferation throughout society and organizations is already fundamentally harmful. We’re not just drowning in a sea of slop — we’re in a constant state of corporate AI beta tests, new “features” sprouting out of our products like new limbs that sometimes function normally but often attempt to strangle us. It’s unclear if companies forcing these products on us have contempt for us or simply don’t know what good looks like. Or perhaps it's both, with the Business Idiot resenting us for not scarfing down whatever they serve us, as that's what's worked before. They don't really understand their customers — they understand what a customer pays for and how a purchase is made, you know, like the leaders of banks and asset managers during the subprime mortgage crisis didn't really think about whether people could pay those mortgages, just that they needed a lot of them to put in a CDO. The Business Idiot's economy is one built for other Business Idiots. They can only make things that sell to companies that must always be in flux — which is the preferred environment of the Business Idiot, because if they're not perpetually starting new initiatives and jumping on new "innovations," they'd actually have to interact with the underlying production of the company. Does the software work? Sometimes! Do successful companies exist that sell like this? Sure! But look at today's software and tell me with a straight face that things feel good to use. And something like generative AI was inevitable: an industry claiming to change the world that never really does so, full of businesses that don’t function as businesses, full of flimflam and half-truths used to impress people who will likely never interact with it, or do so in only a passing way. By chasing out the people that actually build things in favour of the people that sell them, our economy is built on production puppetry — just like generative AI, and especially like ChatGPT. These people are antithetical to what’s good in the world, and their power deprives us of happiness, the ability to thrive, and honestly any true innovation. The Business Idiot thrives on alienation — on distancing themselves from the customer and the thing they consume, and in many ways from society itself. Mark Zuckerberg wants us to have fake friends, Sam Altman wants us to have fake colleagues, and an increasingly loud group of executives salivate at the idea of replacing us with a fake version of us that will make a shittier version of what we make for a customer that said executive doesn’t fucking care about. They’re building products for other people that don’t interact with the real world. We are no longer their customers, and so, we’re worth even less than before — which, as is the case in a world dominated by shareholder supremacy, not all that much. They do not exist to make us better — the Business Idiot doesn’t really care about the real world, or what you do, or who you are, or anything other than your contribution to their power and wealth. This is why so many squealing little middle managers look up to the Musks and Altmans of the world, because they see in them the same kind of specious corporate authoritarian, someone above work, and thinking, and knowledge. One of the most remarkable things about the Business Idiot is their near-invulnerability. Modern management is resource control, shifting blame away from the manager (who should hold responsibility. After all, if they don’t, why do they have that job?) onto the laborer, knowing that the organization and the media will back it up. While you may think I’m making a generalization, the 2021-2023 anti-remote work push in the media was grotesque proof of where the media’s true allegiance lies — the media happily manufactured consent for return-to-office mandates from large companies by framing remote work as some sort of destructive force, doing all they can to disguise how modern management has no fucking idea how the workplace actually works. These articles were effectively fan fiction for managers and bosses demanding we return to the office — ridiculous statements about how remote work “failed young people” (it didn’t) or how employees needed remote work more than their employers because “the chitchat, lunches and happy hours” are so important. Had any of those reporters spoken to an actual worker, they’d say that they value more time with their families, rather than the grind of a daily commute softened with the promise of an occasional company pizza party — which usually happens outside of the typical working hours, anyway. These articles rarely (if ever) cared about whether remote work was more productive, or that the disconnect appeared to be between managers and workers. It was, from the very beginning, about crushing the life out of a movement that gave workers more flexibility and mobility while suppressing managers’ ability to hide how little work they did. I give credit to CNBC in 2023 for saying the quiet part out loud — that “...the biggest disadvantage of remote work that employers cite is how difficult it is to observe and monitor employees” — because when you can’t do that, you have to (eugh!) actually know what they’re doing and understand their work. Yet higher up the chain, the invulnerability continues. CEOs may get fired — and more are getting fired than ever, although sadly not the ones we want — but always receive some sort of golden parachute payoff at the end before walking into another role at another organization doing exactly the same level of nothing. Yet before that happens, A CEO is allowed to pull basically every lever before they take a single ounce of accountability — laying people off, pay freezes, moving from salaried to contracted workers, closing down sites, cutting certain products, or even spending more fucking money. If you or I misallocated billions of dollars on stupid ideas we’d be fired. CEOs, somehow, get paid more. Let me give you an example. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that the “ultimate computer…is the mixed reality world” and that Microsoft would be “inventing new computers and new computing” in 2016, pushing his senior executives to tell reporters that Hololens was Microsoft’s next wave of computing in 2017, selling hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of headsets to the military in 2019, then debuting HoloLens 2 at BUILD 2019 only for the on-stage demo to break in realtime, calling for a referendum on capitalism in 2020, then saying he couldn’t overstate the breakthrough of the metaverse in 2021. Let’s see what he said about it (props to Preston Gralla of ComputerWorld for finding this): As Gralla notes, Nadella said Microsoft would be, “…beefing up development in projects such as its Mixed Reality Tool Kit MRTK, the virtual reality workspace project AltspaceVR (which it had bought back in 2017), its HoloLens virtual reality headset, and its industrial metaverse unit, among others,” before firing all 100% members of its industrial Metaverse core team along with those behind MRTK and shutting down AltSpace VR (which it acquired in 2017) in 2023, before discontinuing HoloLens 2 entirely in 2024. Nadella was transparently copying Meta and Mark Zuckerberg’s ridiculous “metaverse” play, and absolutely nothing happened to him as a result. The media — outlets like The Verge and independents like Ben Thompson — happily boosted the metaverse idea when it was announced and conveniently forgot it the second that Microsoft and Meta wanted to talk about AI (no, really, both The Verge and Ben Thompson were ready and waiting) without a second’s consideration about what was previously said. A true Business Idiot never admits wrongdoing, and the more powerful the Business Idiot is, the more likely there are power structures that exist to avoid them having to do so. The media, captured by other Business Idiots, has become poisoned by power, deferring to its whims and ideals and treating CEOs with more respect, dignity and intelligence than anyone that works for them. When a big company decides they want to “do AI,” the natural reaction is to ask “how?” and write down the answer rather than think about whether it’s possible or whether the company might profit (say, by increasing their shareholder price) by having whatever they say printed ad verbatim. These people aren’t challenged by the media, or their employees, because their employees are vulnerable all the time, and often encouraged to buy into whatever bullshit is du jour like hostages being held by a terrorist group that eventually fall victim to Stockholm syndrome. They’re only challenged by shareholders, who are agnostic about idiocy because it’s not core to value in any meaningful sense, as we’ve seen with crypto, the metaverse and AI, and shareholders will tolerate infinite levels of idiocy if it boosts the value of their holdings. It goes further too. 2021 saw the largest amount of venture capital invested in the last decade, a record-breaking $643 billion, with a remarkable $329.5 billion of that invested in the US alone. Some of the biggest deals include Amazon reseller aggregator Thrasio, which raised $1 billion in October 2021 and filed for bankruptcy in February 2025, cloud security company Lacework, which raised $525 million in January 2021 then $1.3 billion in October 2021 and was rumoured to be up for sale to Wiz, only for the deal to collapse, and autonomous car company Cruise, which raised $2.75 billion 2021 and was killed off in December 2024. The people who lose their livelihoods — those who took stock in lieu of cash compensation, and those who end up getting laid off at the end — are always workers, while people like Lacework co-CEO Jay Parikh (who oversaw “reckless spending” and “management dysfunction” according to The Information) can walk into highly-paid positions at companies like Microsoft, as he did in October 2024 a few months after a fire sale to cybersecurity Fortinet for around $200 million according to analysts. It doesn’t matter if you’re wrong, or if you run your company badly, because the Business Idiot is infallible, and judged too by fellow disconnected Business Idiots. In a just society, nobody would want to touch any of the C-suite that oversaw a company that handed out Nintendo Switches to literally anyone who booked a meeting (as with Lacework). Instead, the stank remains on the employees alone. It’s so easy, and perhaps inevitable, to feel a sense of nihilism about it all. Nothing matters. It’s all symbolic. Our world is filled with companies run by people who don’t interact with the business, and that raise money from venture capitalists that neither run businesses nor really have any experience doing so. And despite the fact that these people exist several abstractions from reality, the things that they do and the decisions they make impact us all. And it’s hard to imagine how to fix it. We live in a system of iniquity, dominated by people that do not interact with the real world who have created an entire system run by their fellow Business Idiots. The Rot Economy’s growth-at-all-costs mania is a symptom of the grander problem of shareholder supremacy, and the single-minded economic focus on shareholder value inevitably ends at an economy run by and for Business Idiots. There is a line, and it ends here — with layoffs, the destruction of our planet and our economy and our society, and a rising tide of human misery that nobody really knows where it comes from, and so, we don’t know who to blame, and for what. If our economy actually worked as a true meritocracy — where we didn’t have companies run by people who don’t use their products or understand how they’re made, and who hire similarly-specious people — these people would collapse under the pressure of having to know their ass from their earhole. Yet none of this would be possible without the enabling layers, and those layers are teeming with both Business Idiots and those unfortunate enough to have learned from them. The tech media has enabled every single bubble, without exception, accepting every single narrative fed to them by VCs and startups, with even critical reporters still accepting the lunacy of a company like OpenAI just because everybody else does too. Let’s be honest, when you remove all the money, our current tech industry is a disgrace. Our economy is held up by NVIDIA, a company that makes most of its money selling GPUs to other companies primarily so that they can start losing the money selling software that might eventually make them money, just not today. NVIDIA is defined by massive peaks and valleys, as it jumps on trends and bandwagons at the right time, despite knowing that these bandwagons always come to an abrupt halt. The other companies feature Tesla, a meme stock car company with a deteriorating brand and a chief executive famous for his divorces from both reality and multiple women along with a flagrant racism that may cost the company its life. A company that we are watching die in real time, with a stagnant line-up and actual fucking competition from companies that are spending big on innovation. In Europe and elsewhere, BYD is eating Tesla’s lunch, offering better products for half the price — and far less stigma. And this is just the first big Chinese automotive brand to go global. Others — like Chery — are enjoying rapid growth outside of China, because these cars are actually quite good and affordable, even when you factor in the impact of things like tariffs. Hey, remember when Tesla fired all the people in its charging network — despite that being one of the most profitable and valuable parts of the business? And then hired them back because it turns out they were actually useful? This is a good example of managerial alienation — decisions made by non-workers who don’t understand their customers, their businesses, or the work their employees do. And let’s not forget about the Cybertruck, a monstrosity both in how it looks and how it’s sold, and that’s illegal in the majority of developed countries because it is a death-trap for drivers and pedestrians alike. Oh, and that nobody actually wants, with Tesla sitting on a quarter’s worth of inventory that it can’t sell. Elsewhere is Meta, a collapsing social network with 99% of its revenue based on advertising to an increasingly-aged population and a monopoly so flagrantly abusive in its contempt for its customers that it’s at times difficult to call Instagram or Facebook social networks. Mark Zuckerberg had to admit to the Senate Judiciary Committee that people don’t use Facebook as a social network anymore. The reason why is because the platform is so fucking rotten, run by a company alienated from its user base, its decrepit product actively hostile to anybody trying to use it. And, more fundamentally, what’s the point of posting on Facebook if your friends won’t see it, because Meta’s algorithm decided it wouldn’t drive engagement? Meta is a monument to disconnection, a company that runs in counter to its own mission to connect people, run by Mark Zuckerberg, a man who hasn’t had a good idea since he stole it from the Winklevoss Brothers. The solution to all that ails him? Adding generative AI to every part of Meta, which…uh…was meant to do something other than burn $72 billion in capital expenditures in 2025, right? It isn’t clear what was meant to happen, but the Wall Street Journal reports that Meta’s AI chatbots are, and I quote, “empowered to engage in ‘romantic role-play’ that can turn explicit” — even with children. In a civil society, Zuckerberg would be ousted immediately for creating a pedophilic chatbot, — instead, four days after the story ran, everyone cheered Meta’s better-than-expected quarterly earnings. In Redmond, Microsoft sits atop multiple monopolies, using tariffs as a means to juice flailing Xbox revenue as it invests billions of dollars in OpenAI so that OpenAI can spend billions of dollars on cloud compute, losing billions more in the process, requiring Microsoft to invest further money to keep them alive. All because Microsoft wanted generative AI in Bing. What a fucking waste! While also raising the costs of its office suite — which it’s only able to hold a monopoly on because it acted so underhandedly in the 1990s. Amazon lumbers listlessly through life, its giant labor-abuse machine shipping things overnight at whatever cost necessary to crush the life out of any other source of commerce, its cloud services and storage arm, unsure who to copy next. Is it Microsoft? Is it Google? Who knows! But one analyst believes it’s making $5 billion in revenue from AI in 2025 — and spending $105 billion in capital expenditures. There are slot machines with a better ROI than this shit. Again, it’s a company that’s totally exploitative of its customers, no longer acting as a platform that helps people find the shit they need, but to direct them to the products that pay the most for prime advertising real-estate, no matter whether they are good or safe. Let’s be clear: Amazon’s recklessness will kill someone, if it hasn’t already. Then there’s the worst of them — Google. Most famous for its namesake, a search engine that it has juiced as hard as possible, and will continue to juice before the inevitable antitrust sentencing that would rob it of its power, along with the severance of its advertising monopoly. But don’t worry, Google also has a generative AI thing, for some reason, and no, you don’t have a choice about using it, because it’s now stapled onto Google Search and Google Assistant. At no point do any of these companies seem to be focused on making our lives better, or selling us any kind of real future. They exist to maintain the status quo, where cloud computing allows them to retain their various fiefdoms. They’re alienated from people. They’re alienated from workers. They’re alienated from their customers. They’re alienated from the world. They’re deeply antisocial and misanthropic — as demonstrated by Zuck’s moronic AI social network comments. And AI is a symptom of a reckoning of this stupidity and hubris. They cut, and cut, and stagnated. Their hope is a product that will be adopted by billions of imaginary customers and companies, and will allow them to cut further without becoming just a PO Box and a domain name. We have to recognize that what we’re seeing now with generative AI isn’t a fluke or a bug, but a feature of a system that’s rapacious and short-term by its very nature, and doesn’t define value as we do, because “value” gets defined by a faceless shareholder as “growth.” And this system can only exist with the contribution of the business idiot. These are the vanguard — the foot soldiers — of this system, and a key reason why everything is so terrible all the time, and why nothing seems to be getting better. Breaking from that status-quo would require a level of bravery that they don’t have — and perhaps isn’t possible in the current economic system. These people are powerful, and have big platforms. They’re people like Derek Thompson, famed co-author of the “abundance” agenda, who celebrates the idea of a fictitious version of ChatGPT that can entirely plan and execute a 5-year-old’s birthday party, or his co-author Ezra Klein, who, while recording a podcast where his researchers likely listened, talked proudly about replacing their work with OpenAI’s broken Deep Research product, because anything that can be outsourced must be, and all research is “looking at stuff that is relevant.” And really, that’s the most grotesque part about Business Idiots. They see every part of our lives as a series of inputs and outputs They boast about how many books they’ve read rather than the content of said books, about how many hours they work (even though they never, ever work that many), about high level they are in a video game they clearly don’t play, about the money they’ve raised and the scale they’ve raised it at, and about how expensive and fancy their kitchen gadgets are. Everything is dominance, acquisition, growth and possession over any lived experience, because their world is one where the journey doesn’t matter, because their journeys are riddled with privilege and the persecution of others in the pursuit of success. These people don’t want to automate work, they want to automate existence. They fantasize about hitting a button and something happening, because experiencing — living! — is beneath them, or at least your lives and your wants and your joy are. They don’t want to plan their kids’ birthday parties. They don’t want to research things. They don’t value culture or art or beauty. They want to skip to the end, hit fast-forward on anything, because human struggle is for the poor or unworthy. When you are steeped in privilege and/or have earned everything through a mixture of stolen labor and office pantomime, the idea of “effort” is always negative. The process of creation — or affection, of love, of kindness, of using time not just for an action or output — is disgusting to the Business Idiot, because those are times they could be focused on themselves, or some nebulous self-serving “vision” that is, when stripped back to its fundamental truth, is either moronic or malevolent. They don’t realise that you hire a worker for the worker’s work rather than just the work themselves, which is why they don’t see why it’s so insulting to outsource their interactions with human beings. You’ll notice these people never bring up examples of automating actual work — the mind-numbing grunt work that we all face in the workplace — because they neither know nor care what that is. Their “problems” are the things that frustrate them, like dealing with other people, or existing outside of the gilded circles of socialite fucks or plutocrats, or just things that are an inevitable facet of working life, like reading an email. Your son’s birthday party or a conflict with a friend can, indeed, be stressful, but these are not problems to be automated out. They are the struggles that make us human, the things that make us grow, the things that make us who we are, which isn’t a problem for anybody other than somebody who doesn’t believe they need to change in any way. It's both powerful and powerless at the same time — a nihilistic way of seeing our lives as a collection of events we accept or dismiss like a system prompt, the desperate pursuit of such efficient living that you barely feel a thing until you die. I’ve spent years writing about these people without giving them a name, because categorizing anything is difficult. I can’t tell you how long it took for me to synthesize the Rot Economy from the broader trends I saw in tech and elsewhere, how long it took for me to thread that particular needle, to identify the various threads that unified events that are otherwise separate and distinct. I am but one person. Everything you’ve read in my newsletter to this point has been something I’ve had to learn. Building an argument and turning it into words — often at the same time — that other people will read doesn’t come naturally to anyone. It’s something you have to deliberately work at. It’s imperfect. There are typos. These newsletters increase in length and breadth and have so many links, and I will never, ever change my process, because part of said process is learning, relearning, processing, getting pissed off, writing, rewriting, and so on and so forth. This process makes what I do possible, and the idea of having someone automate it disgusts me, not because I’m special or important, but because my work is not the result of me reading a bunch of links or writing a bunch of words. This piece is not just 13,000 words long — it’s the result of the 800,000 or more words I wrote before it, the hundreds of stories I’ve read in the past, the hours of conversations with friends and editors, years of accumulating knowledge and, yes, growing with the work itself. This is not something that you create through a summation of content vomited by an AI, but the chaotic histories of a human being mashed against the challenge of trying to process it.

Title: Bitcoin just hit a new record after a long crypto slump

Bitcoin rose to a new record high on Wednesday, surpassing the previous high it hit earlier this year. The world’s leading cryptocurrency hit a peak of $109,359.59 Wednesday morning, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Its previous high-water mark came on President Donald Trump’s inauguration day in January. Like many other cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin suffered through a prolonged slump in the months between, falling as low as $75,000 in March. Its price has climbed steadily ever since and is up 16% so far in May. The rally comes as crypto becomes more accepted by U.S. regulatory bodies and the broader financial world. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon announced Monday that its customers will soon be able to buy Bitcoin through the bank. JPMorgan’s blockchain platform, Kinexys, conducted a test transaction on a public blockchain for the first time last week. On Tuesday, the Senate voted to advance the GENIUS Act stablecoin regulation bill, which would create the U.S.’ first regulatory framework for stablecoins. Trump has said he wants crypto regulation ready to sign by the time Congress takes its August recess.

In August, Morgan Stanley (MS) began allowing its financial advisors to pitch spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to certain clients. Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick told CNBC in January that the bank is looking for ways to get more involved in the crypto market.

Bitcoin BTC$108,898.25 became the world’s fifth-largest asset after hitting a new all-time high on Wednesday, which pushed its market cap to $2.16 trillion. Though the crypto’s price consolidated lower after hitting a high of $109,400, its market cap passed Amazon (AMZN), which stands at $2.15 trillion. Bitcoin is up 16.44% year-to-date while shares of the online retailer are down about 8% over the same period. It is currently trading at $108,954. Gold is the largest asset, by far, standing at a $22 trillion market cap, followed by Microsoft (MSFT), NVIDIA (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL) which stand at $3.1 trillion to $3.4 trillion respectively. As a result of the surge in bitcoin’s price since the win of U.S. President Donald Trump, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) recently became the fifth-largest exchange-traded fund (ETF) by inflows this year as it took in roughly $9 billion from investors, according to data from Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.

May 21, 2025 12:00 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, May 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming July 11, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV) common stock between April 18, 2024, and October 16, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR ELEVANCE INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On July 17, 2024, Elevance disclosed that it was “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population, including in outpatient home health, radiology, durable medical equipment, as well as some elective procedures.” On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $32.21, or 5.8%, to close at $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024, thereby injuring investors. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance released its third quarter 2024 financial results, missing EPS consensus estimates by 13.7% “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Additionally, the Company lowered its EPS guidance for 2024 by 11.3%. On this news, Elevance’s stock price fell $52.61, or 10.6%, to close at $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024, thereby injuring investors further. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) sicker patients with higher acuity tended to remain on Medicaid after redetermination, leading to higher per-patient costs; (2) this increase in cost was occurring at a rate that was not adequately reflected in Elevance's rate negotiations with the states or in its financial guidance for 2024; and (3) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Elevance common stock during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than July 11, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Title: Is The Grow a Garden Beanstalk Better Than The Candy Blossom?

This Grow a Garden Beanstalks guide tells you if this prismatic plant is the next best Candy Blossom, including its buying price, stock rotation chances, profits, and more! Should you save your money, or splash some cash on this rare seed? Find out in this guide! Start playing Grow a Garden on Roblox. Find out how the Beanstalk fares against other seeds in our Tier List. Or, find out when to check for its stock in our Grow a Garden Stock Guide. The Beanstalk is the first Prismatic rarity seed sold by the merchant on the main island. This puts this plant on quite a pedestal to impress players and make them filthy rich, given it has a 0.0005% restock chance every 5 minutes, and costs an expensive 10,000,000$ to buy a single seed. This seed costs just as much as the event Candy Blossom, which many players (myself included) missed out on. So is the Beanstalk just as profitable? The Beanstalk grows tall and is multi-harvest, meaning you don’t lose the original plant when you collect it, unlike Bamboo, Mushrooms, etc. An unmutated, average-sized Beanstalk typically fetches for 15-30k cash. It also produces multiple growth points from one stem, and since it grows upwards, it tends not to take up too much garden space. This makes them an excellent crop to harvest and very profitable! To really get your money’s worth, I recommend not collecting any fully grown Beanstalks for a while until they’ve had the chance to develop mutations. In short, yes, the Beanstalk is likely just as profitable as the Candy Blossom, making this plant meta! The Grow a Garden Discord Server has a channel dedicated to stock rotations, so you won’t miss out next time the Beanstalk makes a shop appearance. Or, you could buy it for Robux, but where is the fun in that? Copyright 2025 Droid Gamers Inc. - All Rights Reserved. - Privacy Policy

Title: One of Liberation Day's biggest losers is hitting record highs and crossing a key technical level as hedge funds jump in
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/liberation-day-industrials-stock-market-rally-trade-war-record-high-2025-5
Time Published: 2025-05-21T15:50:57Z
Full Content:
Industrials were one of the biggest losers of the Liberation Day stock market sell-off, but they've since made an impressive comeback. The sector hit record highs at the start of the week after plunging over 20% in April. Since 1990, only two other periods have seen this level of price appreciation: immediately after the Great Financial Crisis and the pandemic. Industrials are one of the most tariff-exposed areas of the economy. Companies in the sector often rely heavily on global trade and have thin margins that can be easily disturbed by import and export costs. The sector includes companies like GE Aerospace, Boeing, and Uber Technologies. Increased confidence in the economy and trade negotiations, combined with strong performances from aerospace and defense stocks, helped carry the rally. Trump's recent announcement of a $175 billion investment into the Golden Dome missile defense system is also looking like a promising tailwind for the sector. Industrials is the first sector to break record highs after Liberation Day. Institutional investors are buying into the rally, adding more fuel. According to Bank of America, for the week ending May 16, hedge fund net purchases of industrial stocks were at their highest level since 2008. Additionally, 65% of the sector's stocks are trading above their 200-day moving averages, indicating that more stocks are participating in the rally, according to Adam Turnquist, the chief technical strategist at LPL Financial. While "sector breadth has notably improved," it's still lower than what it was during previous record highs, Turnquist points out. When the sector was previously trading at all-time highs in late 2024, 80 to 90% of stocks were trading above their 200-day moving average. The percentage of stocks in the sector hitting 52-week highs is also still low, at just shy of 9% this week. LPL Financial remains neutral on the sector, but Turnquist acknowledges that the technical setup is constructive for a continuing rally — and could point to cyclical stocks becoming leaders in the overall stock market recovery.

Title: INVESTOR REMINDER: Berger Montague Notifies Elevance Health (NYSE: ELV) Investors of a Class Action Lawsuit and Deadline

May 21, 2025 11:44 ET | Source: Berger Montague Berger Montague PHILADELPHIA, May 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Berger Montague PC advises investors that a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (“Elevance” or the “Company”) (NYSE: ELV) on behalf of purchasers of Elevance securities between April 18, 2024 through October 16, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investor Deadline: Investors who purchased or acquired Elevance securities during the Class Period may, no later than JULY 11, 2025, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class. To learn your rights, CLICK HERE. Elevance, based in Indianapolis, Ind., is a healthcare company that, among other things, provides health insurance plans to a variety of markets, including contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits for eligible beneficiaries. States regularly conduct an eligibility review to “redetermine” whether Medicaid beneficiaries still qualify for coverage. According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, Defendants represented to investors that they were closely monitoring cost trends associated with the “redetermination” process and that the premium rates Elevance was negotiating with states were sufficient to address the cost profiles. Defendants acknowledged rising Medicaid expenses, yet assured investors that this was adequately reflected in the Company’s guidance for the year. In truth, however, the redeterminations were causing the utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members to rise significantly, as the members being removed from Medicaid programs were, on average, healthier than those who remained eligible for the programs. This shift was not adequately reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The truth began to emerge on July 17, 2024, when the Company revealed that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid.” In response to this disclosure, the price of Elevance common stock declined by $32.21 per share, or 5.8%, to a closing price of $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Finally, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its financial results for Q3 2024, revealing that the Company had missed earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations for Q3 by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Further, Elevance lowered EPS guidance for 2024 from $37.20 to $33.00, or 11.3%, as it expected these Medicaid issues to continue. These disclosures caused the price of Elevance common stock to decline by another $52.61 per share, or 10.6%, to a closing price of $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024. To learn your rights or for more information, CLICK HERE or please contact Berger Montague: Andrew Abramowitz at aabramowitz@bm.net or (215) 875-3015, or Peter Hamner at phamner@bm.net. A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation. The lead plaintiff is usually the investor or small group of investors who have the largest financial interest and who are also adequate and typical of the proposed class of investors. The lead plaintiff selects counsel to represent the lead plaintiff and the class and these attorneys, if approved by the court, are lead or class counsel. Your ability to share in any recovery is not, however, affected by the decision whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff. Communicating with any counsel is not necessary to participate or share in any recovery achieved in this case. Any member of the purported class may move the Court to serve as a lead plaintiff through counsel of his/her choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an inactive class member. Berger Montague, with offices in Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Delaware, Washington, D.C., San Diego, San Francisco and Chicago, has been a pioneer in securities class action litigation since its founding in 1970.

May 21, 2025 10:30 ET | Source: Lava for Good Lava for Good New York, May 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NEW YORK, NY - May 21, 2024 - Lava for Good, Adweek's 2024 Podcast Network of the Year, today announced the launch of Absolute, Season 1: Taser Incorporated, the first story in a bold new investigative series that examines how extreme corporate power reshapes American institutions and our everyday lives. Hosted by accomplished writer, director, and journalist Nick Berardini, Absolute, Season 1: Taser Incorporated is a story about unchecked power that threads several storylines into one epic tale of relentless ambition, a utopian vision, and the collision between technology and humanity in the realm of modern law enforcement. Berardini has spent over a decade investigating the history and rise of the Taser and the company behind it, and with Absolute, Season 1: Taser Incorporated, he left no stone unturned. Taser International, now known as Axon Enterprises, is the 800-pound gorilla in the paramilitary police equipment industry. It is led by its charismatic CEO and co-founder, Rick Smith — a man with a Star Trek obsession and an ambitious, altruistic vision of a world without killing. As Smith’s Taser became the ultimate alternative weapon for police, his company became an integral supplier to police across the nation, as presidents from both parties poured millions of taxpayer dollars into the promise of a non-lethal alternative to firearms. But as stories of deaths and serious injuries began to emerge, Taser’s legal and publicity strategy seemingly turned to blaming police for misuse and victims for health issues rather than focusing on potential flaws in the product itself.Berardini’s documentary film, Killing Them Safely—a searing investigation into police weaponry and accountability—premiered in World Competition at the Tribeca Film Festival and was produced by Academy Award winner Glen Zipper and Sundance fellow James Goncalves. The film was later acquired by IFC/Sundance Selects and licensed by Netflix and Hulu, earning critical acclaim in Vanity Fair, Newsweek, The Los Angeles Times, Forbes, and The Guardian. "America loves the story of a hungry entrepreneur with a dream," said Berardini. "But when that ambition goes unchecked and success comes at any cost, we must examine the true price being paid — and by whom.” Jason Flom, co-founder and CEO of Lava for Good, commented, "With this terrific debut season of our new Absolute series, we're expanding our investigative focus to examine how increasingly militarized, high-tech policing supplied by powerful private enterprise impacts the criminal legal system in America. This series exemplifies Lava for Good’s commitment to stories that challenge listeners to question the systems we take for granted."Lava for Good is the network behind award-winning series including Wrongful Conviction and Bone Valley, both of which have been credited with contributing to real-world outcomes, from exonerations and paroles to legislative change. Lava’s work is distinguished by fearless reporting, deep investigative rigor, and a commitment to centering stories that are too often overlooked. Absolute, Season 1: Taser Incorporated launches May 21 on all major podcast platforms. Episodes 1, 2, and 3 will be available to binge on May 21, with episodes 4, 5, and 6 following on June 4 — exclusively on Lava for Good+ on Apple Podcasts.

Title: Nvidia CEO calls Biden's AI chip curbs on China 'a failure' and praises Trump's changes

U.S. efforts to curtail China’s access to advanced artificial intelligence chips have backfired, Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang said Wednesday, adding that the Biden administration’s export restrictions didn’t slow China’s AI ambitions — they accelerated them. Speaking to reporters at the Computex tech conference in Taipei, Huang said years of U.S. restrictions on AI chip exports were a strategic misfire that cost Nvidia billions and handed Chinese rivals a powerful incentive to innovate. “All in all, the export control was a failure,” Huang said. “The local companies are very talented and very determined, and the export controls gave them the spirit, the energy, and the government support to accelerate their development.” Nvidia, which was once dominant in China with a market share approaching 95% at the start of the Biden administration, now holds just 50%, Huang said. The company has been forced to write off “billions of dollars” in revenue after repeated rounds of U.S. export controls blocked sales of its most advanced chips — even models designed to comply with restrictions. Huang endorsed President Donald Trump’s recent rescinding of the Biden administration’s AI diffusion rule, which would have imposed country-based limits on chip exports — most notably China, due to national security concerns. “President Trump realizes that it’s exactly the wrong goal,” Huang said. “If the United States wants to stay in the lead, and if we would like the rest of the world to build on American technology, then we have to maximize AI diffusion, maximize the speed.” The Trump administration has paved the way for a series of multibillion-dollar chip sales agreements across the Gulf region, which one analyst said was a “watershed moment” for Big Tech. Huang accompanied Trump to the Middle East earlier this month, where Nvidia inked deals to supply its top-tier GPUs to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar. Huang made it clear, however, that Nvidia still sees China as too important to ignore. Last month, he visited Beijing and met with top Beijing officials and the founder of AI firm DeepSeek to discuss chips that could avoid triggering U.S. sanctions, according to The Financial Times. “China has a vibrant technology ecosystem, and it’s very important to realize that China has 50% of the world’s AI researchers, and China is incredibly good at software,” Huang said. “AI researchers are still doing AI research in China. If they don’t have enough Nvidia, they will use their own.” And that’s already happening. Chinese chipmaker Huawei’s domestically produced Ascend chips (which remain less capable than Nvidia’s) are being installed in data centers under state guidance. Washington recently warned that companies using Huawei chips could face penalties under U.S. law, sparking fierce pushback from Beijing and a warning that enforcement of such measures could violate Chinese law — potentially putting a halt to the progress the two countries have made recently in trade talks. For now, Nvidia is navigating a geopolitical minefield. It hasn’t gotten everything it wanted from Trump — the company recently took a $5.5 billion hit related to U.S. limits on Nvidia’s H20 chips to China. But Huang’s perspective is clear: Isolating China hasn’t worked, and only a pragmatic, globally inclusive strategy will keep the U.S. — and companies such as Nvidia — at the front of the AI race. “America is not the only provider of AI technology,” Huang said.

May 21, 2025 08:46 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, May 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that its missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Title: Target’s problems are escalating | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Target was already facing a very public revolt from some of its most loyal customers. Now it’s warning about tariffs. The company said Wednesday that sales fell last quarter, driven in part by customer backlash to Target’s reversal on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs. Target also cut its guidance as President Donald Trump’s tariffs push up costs for the company. Target’s sales at stores open for at least a year tumbled 3.8% last quarter. Fewer customers visited Target and spent less when they shopped. Target also cut its financial outlook, a sign Target’s problems won’t go away quickly. The company expects sales to decline by low single-digits this year. The company announced that it established a multi-year “Enterprise Acceleration Office” to speed up growth plans, and it reshuffled its executive team. “We faced several additional headwinds this quarter, including five consecutive months of declining consumer confidence, uncertainty regarding the impact of potential tariffs, and the reaction to the updates we shared on (DEI) in January,” Target CEO Brian Cornell said on a call with analysts Wednesday. Cornell warned of “massive potential costs” from tariffs, but said the retailer could offset them by diversifying suppliers, adjusting products – and hiking prices, if necessary. “We have many levers to use in mitigating the impact of tariffs and price is the very last resort,” he said. Target’s stock (TGT) dropped 7% during pre-market trading Wednesday. Target’s stock has declined 37% over the past year. Cornell acknowledged in a recent email to staff that it has been “a tough few months” between the retail economy “headlines, social media and conversations that may have left you wondering,” the Minnesota Star Tribune reported. (Target confirmed the email to CNN.) Cornell said Target’s culture and commitment to staff has not changed. “I recognize that silence from us has created uncertainty, so I want to be very clear: We are still the Target you know and believe in,” Cornell said. Boycotts over Target’s DEI reversal hurt Target’s business. On January 24, days into Donald Trump’s presidency, Target announced it was eliminating hiring goals for minority employees, ending an executive committee focused on racial justice and making other changes to its diversity initiatives. Target said it had a new strategy called “Belonging at the Bullseye” and the company remained committed to “creating a sense of belonging for our team, guests and communities.” Target also stressed the need for “staying in step with the evolving external landscape.” But the decision angered supporters of diversity and inclusion policies, who felt blindsided by Target. Target had been a champion of diversity initiatives and LGBTQ rights. Customers online protested Target’s decision and Anne and Lucy Dayton, the daughters of one of Target’s co-founders, called the company’s actions “a betrayal.” Target faced a 40-day consumer boycott during Lent led by Rev. Jamal Bryant, a prominent Atlanta-area megachurch pastor, over its DEI rollback. Protestors picketed outside Target headquarters in Minneapolis and other Black leaders such as Rev. Al Sharpton supported boycott efforts. Target came under more pressure than other companies that rolled back DEI policies because Target had gone further in its DEI efforts, and it has a more progressive base of customers than those competitors. On CNN on Wednesday evening, Bryant said that though Target was the first business targeted, it wouldn’t be the last. He said he is aware of more than 17 companies that have rolled back DEI initiatives. “Another company is going to be coming on the radar the next couple of weeks,” he said. Target was a leading advocate for DEI programs in the business world in the years after George Floyd was murdered by police in the company’s home city of Minneapolis in 2020. Target also spent years building a public reputation as a progressive employer on LGBTQ issues. Tariffs and a consumer slowdown put even more pressure on Target. The chain stocks more nonessential merchandise compared to competitors such as Walmart (WMT) and Costco (COST). More than half of Target’s merchandise is discretionary and is at risk as consumers reign in spending. Around 50% of Target’s products are also imported from overseas, including an estimated 25% from China, leaving Target in a “challenging position,” Steven Shemesh, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note Wednesday. Tariffs may force Target to either absorb added costs, hurting its profit, or raise prices on consumers. Home Depot said Tuesday that it plans to keep most of its prices stable, despite Trump’s tariffs driving costs up. But tariffs may cause Home Depot to increase prices on select items and eliminate some product lines entirely. Walmart said last week that Trump’s tariffs are “too high” and it will raise prices on some items, prompting an angry response from Trump. “Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain,” Trump said over the weekend. “Between Walmart and China they should, as is said, “EAT THE TARIFFS,” and not charge valued customers ANYTHING. I’ll be watching, and so will your customers!!!” CNN’s Ramishah Maruf contributed to this story. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: This Billionaire Immigrant Is Racing Elon Musk To Connect Your Phone From Space
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2025/05/21/this-billionaire-immigrant-is-racing-elon-musk-to-connect-your-phone-from-space/

ByAlex Knapp ByAlex Knapp, Forbes Staff. Last September, a crowd of seasoned spectators gathered at Cape Canaveral, Florida, to watch as SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket took flight for the 373rd time. But it wasn’t carrying yet another of Elon Musk’s Starlink satellites to join the 7,100-plus he has already circling Earth. Onboard instead were five satellites from AST SpaceMobile, a tiny Starlink rival that SpaceX has derided as a “meme stock” in regulatory filings with the federal government. Each was equipped with a 700-square-foot antenna that would unfold in orbit, an early step in establishing a network AST hopes will someday best the incumbent mocking it. The size of these antennas—and the even larger 2,400-square-foot version that will succeed them—are key to CEO and founder Abel Avellan’s plan to win a new market: satellite internet beamed directly to your phone. In contrast to SpaceX, which uses thousands of satellites to connect residences, businesses, vehicles and even the White House to the internet, AST’s super-large antennas should give it global coverage with just 90 satellites. The company plans to launch 60 into orbit by the end of 2026. Jamel Toppin for Forbes The goal is to keep cellphones connected when out of range of a tower. You’d be able to make calls even when hiking in a remote area or from a boat miles offshore. Until recently, that required expensive satellite phones with special hardware. “Our vision is to provide connectivity without disadvantage to wherever people are located,” says Avellan, 54. This isn’t Starlink’s main business: Its $12.3 billion in revenue largely comes from providing internet to fixed-base stations attached to homes and businesses, not mobile phones. Nor is it the vision of Jeff Bezos’ Project Kuiper, a direct Starlink competitor, which launched the first 27 of a planned 3,200-plus satellites in late April. But Starlink isn’t totally ignoring the phone business. It’s currently in beta testing with T-Mobile to let users text on their phones via Starlink when they don’t have any bars, giving it an early lead over AST. It also has thousands of satellites, to AST’s five, and Musk’s insider status with the Trump administration could prove important in the heavily regulated telecom business. Starlink’s staggering $350 billion valuation dwarfs Midland, Texas–based AST’s market cap (it went public in April 2021 via a special purpose acquisition company) of around $8.7 billion. Still, AST has a shot at the emerging market for a satellite-based mobile cell plan, with a potentially substantial payoff. The big opportunity is not off-grid connectivity for Europeans and North Americans but providing internet to the more than 2.6 billion people, largely in the developing world, who struggle to get online at all. Most of them can’t afford Starlink. A basic base station starts at $350; then it’s around $80 per month for residential Wi-Fi. AST’s pricing is still largely theoretical, but the startup hopes it can deliver for just a few extra dollars a month on a cellphone bill. That’s a compelling proposition. When it comes to broadband, “the cheapest and most efficient way is through your phone,” Avellan says. Skipping out on building new cell towers entirely could mean major cost savings for the telecoms companies as well, if they can offer satellite internet in markets that don’t yet justify that investment. Deutsche Bank (which is not an AST investor) estimates that the company’s revenues could top $370 million in 2026 once its commercial service is up and running, and surpass $5 billion by 2030—with far less capital expenditure than Starlink will need to keep launching thousands of satellites. The big obstacle for both companies is the basic physics of satellite communication: namely, that you need a direct line of sight from a satellite to your phone to get a signal. Starlink, Project Kuiper and multiple Chinese firms plan to tackle this by flooding the zone with thousands of small, cheap satellites in low Earth orbit, which hop signals between them to maintain steady connections with ground-based dishes. The antenna in your phone is a lot smaller, making it harder to get bandwidth to do more than text. But AST’s satellites are outfitted with antennas at least 50 times the size of Starlink’s. It’s a tricky feat of engineering—the centimeters-thick antennas require assembly in clean rooms to be securely packed into satellites at launch; then they’re carefully unfolded again in orbit. It’s much more complicated than a Starlink satellite, and each AST satellite costs about $21 million compared to around $1.2 million to build each Starlink bird. But the result is true broadband connectivity. AST’s five satellites have successfully made video calls with phones on Verizon, Vodafone, Rakuten and AT&T networks. AST’s have a longer lifespan, too, requiring replacement every 10 years compared to five to seven years for Starlink. AST’s big antennas make broadband-to-cellphone connections easier to pull off, says John Baras, a University of Maryland aerospace engineering professor, because they cover a much larger area and are designed to deliver a signal to devices in motion. Starlink has a bigger challenge making its system work for phones, he says, because it was envisioned as a way to deliver internet to fixed stations on the ground—not to mobile phones that by definition move around. “Starlink is going to have problems,” he says. SpaceX did not respond to a comment request. JR Wilson, VP of towers and roaming at AT&T, a major AST investor, compares the tech race between Starlink and AST to the home-video race of the 1980s. “Beta came out first, but it didn’t have some of the same qualities as VHS,” he explained, recalling Sony’s ill-starred format which, despite delivering a better picture, failed because of its high price and short recording times. AT&T plans to start offering satellite connectivity using AST’s service once it has more satellites in orbit next year. AST currently has deals with dozens of other telecom providers around the world, including Vodafone, Rakuten and Verizon (all investors), offering potential access to around 3 billion subscribers. Partnering with big telecoms offers loads of advantages, says Mike Crawford, an analyst at Los Angeles–based B. Riley Securities. By avoiding the home satellite internet market that Starlink dominates, AST doesn’t have to spend money to attract subscribers or build costly ground infrastructure—its partners have already done that. Plus, it avoids going head-to-head with giant legacy telecoms. Avellan knows the ins and outs of the industry. Born in Venezuela, he studied engineering before starting his career at the Swedish telecom giant Ericsson. He founded his first company, Emer­ging Markets Communications, “with $50,000 and a pregnant wife” in 2000, he says, to provide satellite communication services to Africa and the Middle East, as well as cruise and cargo ships. He sold it to satellite company Global Eagle in 2016 for $550 million and used some of the proceeds to found AST the following year. After launching its first demonstration satellite in 2019, AST raised $110 million from Vodafone, Rakuten, AT&T and VC shops like London-based Shift Ventures. In 2021, it went public through a SPAC backed by private equity firm New Providence, raising an additional $462 million. The company’s stock has more than doubled since then, making Avellan, who owns about 25% of it, worth some $2.1 billion. In March, AST and Voda­fone announced plans for a joint venture spin-out company to offer AST’s satellite connectivity to mobile operators in Europe and Africa. PATRICK WELSH FOR FORBES By John Buckingham For a more grounded play on soaring demand for connectivity, wireless communications and broadcast tower REIT American Tower should continue to benefit from mobile data proliferation and 5G deployments, while an expan­ding data center segment positions it to profit from the rise of hybrid IT and AI workloads. Meanwhile, shareholders are rewarded with a 3.3% dividend yield to go along with handsome capital appreciation potential from a conservative “picks-and-shovels” terrestrial player in the tech gold rush. Moody’s just awarded the company’s strong balance sheet, citing AMT’s lea­ding position in the global wireless infrastructure market, predic­table revenue and income, consistently solid fixed charge coverage and excellent liquidity (it’s also an investor in AST). John Buckingham is a principal of AFAM Capital and editor of The Prudent Speculator. These partnerships also unlock the parts of the radio spectrum that make communications between satellites and phones possible, which are primarily owned by legacy telecoms. Assu­ming regulators greenlight these deals—including a crucial lease from Ligado Networks for a frequency that would give AST’s data the equivalent of 4G speeds—its satellites will be able to offer coverage globally. SpaceX can offer only text right now, although obviously that could change. With far fewer partnerships, Starlink is “cash-rich but spectrum-poor,” according to Crawford, the B. Riley analyst. That’s not surprising, given Musk’s ruthless approach to business. “SpaceX famously partners with people to the point that they can extract what they want from you, and then they stomp on your face, right?” industry analyst Chris Quilty says. Still, Musk’s deep connections to the Trump administration could present an existential challenge to AST’s burgeoning business. It’s clear Musk’s company views AST as a threat. SpaceX has already taken it to the mat over an array of regulatory issues governed by the FCC: spectrum access, space junk, blocking astronomical observations. Those FCC filings are also where SpaceX dismissed AST as a “meme stock.” It has a point: While shares in AST have gained a total of 172% since it went public, the stock has been on a tear since last May, jumping more than 1,000% at its peak. The company still has virtually no revenue to support its multi­billion-dollar market cap; in 2024, AST spent $300 million but brought in only about $4 million in revenue due entirely to a contract with the Space Defense Agency to build military satellite communications infrastructure. And like all meme stocks, it has a flock of ardent believers online. AST’s investment community on Reddit has more than 30,000 active subscribers. When the company invited its retail investors to attend the September launch of its satellites, nearly 1,000 showed up. “People are enthusiastic about the prospect that no matter where you live or work, you can have broadband,” Avellan says of the attention. “If at the same time they can make money by investing and following what we do? Even better.”

Title: Google unveils AI upgrades at I/O conference amid search challenges

The I/O conference in Mountain View, California, has adopted a tone of increased urgency since the rise of generative AI posed a fresh threat to Google's longtime stronghold of organizing and retrieving information on the internet. In recent months, Google has become more aggressive in asserting it has caught up to competitors after appearing flat-footed upon the release of Microsoft-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT. Top executives including CEO Sundar Pichai have often cited the pole position of its Gemini class of AI models on public leaderboards, ahead of top models from competitors including OpenAI and Meta. Google and Xreal debut Aura AR Glasses to rival Meta’s Orion plan Pichai said at the conference: "Over and over, we've been able to deliver the best models at the most effective price point." The Gemini app now has more than 400 million monthly active users, Pichai said. The Alphabet chief also announced other advancements showcasing AI, including an update to the company's Google Meet video conferencing software that would translate meetings between English and Spanish in real time. And Pichai showcased Google Beam, hardware that makes video chats feel like they are taking place in person, in partnership with HP and based on Google's Project Starline. At the same time, with consumer use of AI chatbots maturing, investors will be tracking the degree to which Google is aggressive in disrupting its search advertising business line, which accounted for the majority of the company's $350 billion in 2024 revenue. Earlier this month, Alphabet stock lost $150 billion in market value in one day after an Apple executive testified during one of Google's antitrust cases that AI offerings had caused a decline in searches on Apple's Safari Web browser for the first time. In turn, some analysts reassessed how to measure Google's dominant search market share, which has for years hovered around 90% by traditional metrics. A Bernstein analyst note this month placed the figure at 65% to 70% when accounting for usage of AI chatbots. Wells Fargo analysts estimated that Google's market share could fall to less than 50% in five years. The analysts cited a behavioral shift drawing consumers toward AI chatbots where they once used traditional search engines. Google's market position could be further rocked by the outcome of legal challenges, in particular a pair of antitrust cases brought by the Justice Department, which is seeking the forced sale of parts of the tech giant including its Chrome browser. Investment in AI accounts for most of Alphabet's $75 billion in forecasted capital expenditures this year, a dramatic uptick from the $52.5 billion in 2024 spending that the company reported. In April, Pichai reiterated those spending plans despite market uncertainty around tariffs. Google has injected more AI into its core search engine over the past two years, primarily through AI Overviews, generative AI summaries that are increasingly appearing atop the traditional hyperlinks to relevant webpages, and AI Mode, an experimental version that leverages AI more intensively to answer complex queries. Tuesday's announcements will likely include further updates to search as well as Google's effort to deliver a "universal AI agent." At last year's conference, the company teased Project Astra, a prototype tool that can talk to users about anything captured on their smartphone camera in real time. The company began experimenting with inserting ads into AI Overviews last May, though it has avoided any radical changes that would rock the boat. Meanwhile, Google is expanding other revenue streams to monetize AI. Last week, the company told Reuters its Google One consumer subscription service had crossed 150 million subscribers helped by "millions" of customers who signed up for a $19.99 per month plan with access to AI capabilities unavailable for most free users.

Title: Uber Launches Exchangeable Bond Deal Featuring Rare Structure
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/news/investment-tracker/2025/uber-launches-exchangeable-bond-deal-featuring-rare-structure/
Time Published: 2025-05-21T00:33:33Z
Full Content:
A $1.2 billion exchangeable bond deal announced last week by Uber Technologies reportedly features a rare structure that is appealing to investors and to Uber. The deal is tied to Uber’s shares in self-driving truck firm Aurora Innovation and includes bonds that turn into equity if the stock exceeds a set price after a set period, Bloomberg reported Tuesday (May 20). The deal allows investors to participate in the upside of Aurora’s business while limiting the downside, as they could end up with a valuable stake if the price of the shares rises above the conversion threshold, while they can get paid back the par value of the bond at maturity if the stock drops, according to the report. For Uber, the deal provided favorable terms that included zero coupon and a conversion premium above the marketed range, the report said. Uber retains some upside and can defer tax on the gains. Only about 6% of total U.S. convertible debt over the past five years has had an exchangeable bond structure, but that share may increase among companies with solid credit and adequate stakes in other companies, the report said. Uber announced its plans for a private placement of exchangeable senior notes in a May 13 press release. It announced the pricing of the offering in another press release on the same day. “Uber intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, which may include strategic investments, although Uber has not designated any specific uses at this time,” the company said in the first release. Aurora is developing self-driving systems for commercial vehicles like trucks and plans to deploy driverless trucks at scale. When announcing the company’s first quarter results on May 8, Aurora Innovation Co-Founder and CEO Chris Urmson noted that its self-driving trucks are now hauling commercial freight on Texas roads. “We are the first company to operate commercial driverless heavy-duty trucks on public roads,” Urmson said in a press release. “From here we’ll focus on proving the promise of the technology, increasing the value of our product for customers and ultimately becoming an essential partner in the freight industry.” This Week in AI: The Agentic Web, AI-Native Devices and Search Tools Trump Threatens to Raise Tariffs on Apple and European Union The Digital Asset Primer: Why Equity Markets Are Being Tokenized Report: SBA Staffing Cuts Reduce Service to Entrepreneurs We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Crazy-Good Ticket Deal for Disneyland’s 70th!

Time Published: 2025-05-20T23:39:15Z

Disney has released a new deal for Disneyland & California Adventure admission that beats the current general public 70th Anniversary discount, and offers a ‘fully loaded’ Park Hopper ticket with Lightning Lane Multi-Pass & more for a crazy-good price. Here are dates & details about the special offer, plus comparisons to other past & present ticket promos, an assessment of the value proposition, and more. For a limited time, guests can save ~$180 per person (!!!) on the purchase of a 3-Day Disneyland Park Hopper Ticket with Lightning Lane Multi Pass for only $150 per day. This special offer is valid for admission from May 20, 2025 through December 19, 2025, meaning it’s not just good for the summer of Disneyland’s 70th Anniversary, but also Halloween and Christmas! This ticket is $449.99 for all ages, and is a fully-loaded three-day Disneyland ticket with the Park Hopper option and LLMP. A standard multi-day Disneyland ticket with the same add-ons would cost $601 directly from Disney. Even the current 3-Day Disneyland Anniversary Ticket Deal costs $546 with the Park Hopper and Lightning Lane Multi Pass, making this fully-loaded deal ~$100 off that discounted price in an apples to apples comparison. As an added bonus, this new 70th deal includes a $30 Disney Dining Gift Card that can be used throughout Disneyland Resort! Of course, that assumes you want the Park Hopper and Lightning Lane Multi-Pass add-ons, and that you will eat a meal of food in the parks. It also assumes you want to visit Disneyland and DCA for three days, as opposed to longer. The 4-day version of the general public anniversary deal–which is the one Disneyland has been “pushing” guests towards by virtue of its superior per day pricing–costs $400 total or only $100 per day, making that the better deal if you’re looking for bottom-dollar pricing. However, that is very obviously not an apples to apples comparison. Once you include the Park Hopper and Lightning Lane Multi-Pass add-ons, the 4-Day Disneyland Anniversary Ticket Deal costs $623, or $155.75 per day. This ticket deal still comes in below that, at $150 per day (and again, includes that bonus $30 dining card). Of course, there’s a catch (isn’t there always?). This $449 fully-loaded Disneyland ticket deal is only available at Costco, while supplies last. Moreover, it’s only being sold in-store in select West Coast markets throughout California, as well as stores in Oregon and Washington. At present, it’s not available at stores in Arizona, Nevada, Utah, or beyond. (It comes up on an inventory check as either “sold out” or “no match found.”) We paid a visit to our local Costco in Orange County, where there’s a huge display and a total stock of 200 of these discounted Disneyland tickets. There was also a Costco employee lingering around the display, offering her “pitch” for the special offer. I kinda felt like Ron Swanson as she broke things down for me, but I politely bit my tongue and quietly listened to the spiel, which was mostly accurate-ish! Here’s the fine print on the Costco Disneyland 70th Anniversary Ticket Deal: Tickets valid for use beginning May 20, 2025 and expire December 19, 2025. Tickets may be used on nonconsecutive days. A ticket must be used by the same person on all days. Each ticket is valid for three (3) days of admission to both Disneyland Park and Disney California Adventure Park, including visits to both Parks on the same day. Each day of use constitutes one full day of use. Tickets are nonrefundable, may not be sold or transferred for commercial use and exclude activities/events separately priced. Offer may not be combined with other ticket discounts or promotions. Subject to restrictions and change or cancellation without notice. To enter a park, both a theme park reservation and a valid ticket for the same park on the same date are required. Check park availability by visiting disneytraveltradeinfo.com/dlrcalendar prior to purchase. Theme park reservations are limited, subject to availability, and are not guaranteed. Guests with a Park Hopper ticket must make a park reservation for the first theme park they wish to visit to begin their day; then they can cross over and switch between parks on the same day after 11:00 AM (subject to availability). The ability to visit the other park will be subject to that park’s capacity limitations, operational hours, closures and other restrictions, and is not guaranteed. One (1) $30 Disney Dining Card for each 3-Day Park Hopper Ticket purchased. Value of Disney Dining Card may not be applied toward the ticket price. Disney Dining Card is nonrefundable and redeemable only for food and beverages at participating locations within the Disneyland Resort, Walt Disney World Resort and other Disney Resorts located in the U.S. Certain parks, attractions, services, experiences and offerings may be modified, limited in availability or unavailable, and are subject to restrictions, and change or cancellation without notice. Park admission and offerings are not guaranteed. Select shows, performances, and experiences, including parades and nighttime spectaculars, will temporarily pause to make way for seasonal entertainment offerings, then resume at later dates. Check entertainment schedules before visiting. If the new Costco Disneyland Anniversary Ticket Offer isn’t for you due to travel dates or because you need longer duration tickets, see our 2025 Discount Disneyland Ticket Buying Guide for additional recommendations. There are a few notable details about this Costco ticket deal to which we want to draw your attention. First, this special offer does not have a “fuse,” which means you can use the first admission this summer for the 70th kickoff, once again between August and October for Halloween Time (see our Guide to Halloween Time at Disneyland), and then one final visit during Holiday Time at Disneyland (see our Guide to Christmas at Disneyland). Those are just examples–you could do all three days next week, during our favorite week of the year, or from December 17-19, 2025. Second, this Costco ticket deal has a longer eligibility window than we’ve seen for any ticket deal in recent memory. And by “recent memory,” I mean since 2016 when we started tracking these discounts. (It was back then that Costco offered a special DCA-only Annual Pass. Unsurprisingly, it was cheaper than this–but almost everything was a decade ago!) It’s unprecedented for a ticket deal like this to cover summer, Halloween and Christmas. It’s also unprecedented for a discount to encompass several popular holidays without blockouts. Fall Break/Columbus Day, Halloween, Veterans Day, and Thanksgiving are all fair game. You can use this through the third week in December, right before peak Christmas week crowds descend upon Disneyland. For reference, the current Disneyland Anniversary Ticket offer runs now through August 14, 2025. Given the early end of that offer (coupled with this Costco deal), we wouldn’t be surprised to see a special offer for late August through December 2025–but we also wouldn’t be surprised if it’s targeted at Californians, more expensive than this, or doesn’t cover all of these dates. Finally, it’s unclear whether this Costco deal is pulling park reservations from the same “bucket” as the new Disneyland Anniversary Ticket Offer or from regular full-price park tickets. Our assumption is the 70th promo. This is exactly how Magic Keys already work, as well as other recent ticket promos. So it’s really nothing new. Nevertheless, it’s important to understand because these ticket deals are popular–they always are, and that’s even when they’re just for California residents. This is more akin to last summer’s general public ticket deal, but being rolled out at the start of Disneyland’s 70th Anniversary. It thus stands to reason that this deal will be bought by a higher percentage of guests, meaning more people in this “pool” competing for the same reservations. As Disney warns, some dates are going to be difficult to book–even when availability is wide open for other ticket types. The good news is that Disneyland does reallocate reservation availability as demand dictates; the bad news is that they aren’t very good at it, and it can be very hit or miss (requiring a strong refresh game). Anyway, just bringing this to your attention because we know some people gloss over the terms and conditions, viewing that as CYA legal language that has no real bearing on the deal. Here, that’s only partially true. The way this new Disneyland Anniversary Ticket Offer works with park reservations is a typical legal disclaimer to avoid (another) lawsuit, but it’s also crucial for you to understand so you don’t end up with tickets you can’t use. The biggest impediments to this Disneyland 70th Anniversary Ticket Deal at Costco will presumably be a membership to the big-box warehouse store. If you’re more of a Sam’s Club house, this does you no good. Even if you are a Costco member, you might have issues purchasing this if you live outside of California, Washington or Oregon since it’s in-store only. When we asked an employee, they did indicate that inventory was limited and their store had received an initial stock of 200 tickets. They were unsure if the deal would be restocked, or if this was it–and it was over once it sold out. Waiting until you arrive in California for your vacation to buy these discounted tickets at Costco is a gamble. Not only because they might already be sold out, but because park reservations are required and those might be gone. If you’re a Costco member living on the West Coast and this special offer is available at your local store, this deal is pretty much a no-brainer. But if not, you might want to consider the current general public deal instead. As a reminder, the general public Disneyland 70th Anniversary Ticket Deal is available now through August 14, 2025. You can purchase tickets directly from Disney or buy this deal via Get Away Today with even greater savings. Here’s a pricing breakdown and other important details… 3-Day, 1-Park Per Day Ticket for $120 Per Day 4-Day, 1-Park Per Day Ticket for $100 Per Day In a normal year, there are two main types of ticket deals. There’s the summer one, which has morphed from a Golden State deal for all Californians to a general public discount in the last two years. Historically, the summer deal with the wider eligibility pool costs more. Before that, there’s the winter and spring special offer–which ran this year until May 15, 2025–that’s only available to Southern California residents. Disneyland has done this consistently for at least the last decade. It’s the much more established and longstanding deal–the summer discount is more recent addition during the post-reopening era. This year’s version of that SoCal resident deal is the best we’ve seen in a while, and is actually better than last year–and significantly so. It offers discount admission for as low as $67 per day on select days with the purchase of a 3-day, 1-park per day ticket. That deal beats this Costco in terms of bottom line price (which we assume matters to at least some degree if you’re in the market for discounted tickets), but not on an apples to apples basis once accounting for Park Hopping and Lightning Lane Multi-Pass. Since this Costco Disneyland 70th Anniversary Ticket Deal is unlike anything that came before it, I’m just going to share special offer ticket prices from the last several years and let them speak for themselves… 2025 SoCal Resident Winter & Spring Ticket Deal Prices: 2024 All Guest Summer & Fall Ticket Deal Prices: 2024 SoCal Resident Winter & Spring Ticket Deal Prices: 2023 California Resident Summer & Fall Ticket Deal Prices: 2023 SoCal Resident Winter & Spring Ticket Deal Prices: 2022 California Resident Summer & Fall Ticket Deal Prices: 2022 SoCal Resident Winter & Spring Ticket Deal Prices: 2021 California Resident Disneyland Ticket Deal Prices: 2020 SoCal Resident Disneyland Ticket Deal Prices: 2019 SoCal Resident Disneyland Ticket Deal Prices: 2018 SoCal Resident Disneyland Ticket Deal Prices: 2017 SoCal Resident Disneyland Ticket Deal Prices: 2016 SoCal Resident Disneyland Ticket Deal Prices: Ultimately, this Costco Disneyland 70th Anniversary Ticket Deal is a crazy-good deal if you’re at least semi-local and wanting to make a few visits to Disneyland and Disney California Adventure for the 70th Anniversary, Halloween, and Christmas. (For recommendations on when to do DLR, see our list of the Best & Worst Weeks to Visit Disneyland in 2025 & 2026.) That’s especially true if you want or need all of the bells and whistles on your admission, as this degree of discount is unprecedented in the last decade or so. What amounts to around $180 off per ticket is a tremendous savings, even if it does require buying the fully-loaded option with all of the add-ons. If you want longer duration tickets, live outside the West Coast, aren’t a Costco member, or are more concerned with getting the bottom-dollar price, there are better alternatives for you. Regardless, it’s great to see a discount that’s this aggressive, and better that what Disney is offering directly. This is surprising to see right as the 70th starts, and suggests that more deals are in the pipeline! Planning a Southern California vacation?

Hearing your feedback–even when you disagree with us–is both interesting to us and helpful to other readers, so please share your thoughts below in the comments! My new bride and I got ours at Costco yesterday. They still had some stock. Can’t believe this deal. $450 per ticket – $30 for Dining – $105 for LLMP =$315 for 3 days of park hopper = $105 per day of park hopping, valid on weekends. INSANE DEAL. We would have bought dining, LLMP, and park hopping anyway. And we would have used the tickets on weekends anyway. Going to go for my bday in August for 2 days, then probably a Christmastime visit in early December. Thanks for the tip, I was about to spend $1858 for 4 x 2 day tix with park hopper and LL so not only do I save some money, but get an extra day for future use and $120 in dining gift cards. The first Costco I went to was already sold out (this was yesterday and evening) but that store was able to locate other stores nearby that still had some. They only got 100 of them. Thanks for sharing your experience! It’s interesting to me that some stores received such little inventory–really curious as to whether this will be restocked, or if it’s gone-gone once it sells out. If the latter, this deal will be dead by Memorial Day. Confirming that at least 1 Costco in WA was restocked today. This is two years in a row where I’ve scrambled to buy tickets from reputable third party companies when price hikes are announced only to see much, much better deals come later on (last year was WDW but this time it’s DLR.) Regrets. Is there any strategy on *when* to buy tickets? After this happening two years in a row, I think I’m going to avoid the price hike rush and just put off purchasing as long as I can…I think. “Is there any strategy on *when* to buy tickets?” Up until the last two years, the optimal strategy was buying before the price increase. And at least for Disneyland, Get Away Today would match future prices if there was a discount that was better. (That’s not going to happen here, as this deal is not direct-from-Disney.) The smart approach is still buying pre-price increase IMO. But clearly, it’s not always going to work out to be the lowest price on all tickets. Does anyone know about who is allowed to use the purchased tickets? My wife and I who live in Pennyslyvania are planning to visit our California friend. If she picks up the Costco deal for herself and us, would we be able to use it if we are not the original purchaser or Costco members? There’s no residency restriction! What you’re describing would work perfectly fine! I am so disappointed that these are only offered in person. We have a trip planned for June with 6 of us for 3 days and this deal would save us over $700. I can’t take the gamble that they (and park reservations ) would be available when we land and I don’t know that I could trust sending someone over $2500 to get us some. Unfortunately we’ll just have to go through Disney and spend the extra $700 that could have helped elsewhere. Roberta, your Costco app has an option to search the inventory in your local warehouse. I would try that on all the Costco‘s within a 50 mile radius of you. It shouldn’t take longer than 10 minutes, and some posters below are saying they have seen the tickets in non-West Coast Costco‘s. I found these at Costco in Boise so at least some Idaho stores are also included. I think it’s really important to highlight the non-consecutive restriction more. I asked a friend in CA to buy for me and luckily I caught it before he bought because I’d have to add an extra night onto my trip to make it work and other people with short trips might not realize. From the way I read it, nonconsecutive is an option, rather than a restriction. That is, it says you “may” use it on nonconsecutive days (and spread them out however works for you). It doesn’t say “must” be used on nonconsecutive days, meaning you have no other option. Ah I think you’re right Lori. Thanks for catching that for me!! This is such a great deal! Hoping they are still available when I can get up to Oregon to buy one. Question: Can these be upgraded to a 4 day, 5 day, etc.? I’ve upgraded before when buying tickets from Get Away Today or others, and it’s never been a problem. I’d love to take advantage of the 4 day Anniversary deal, but we’re not going until the first week of December! (Thanks for the rec on that one Tom, looking forward to the cooler weather and low crowds!) This is an ABSURDLY good deal. Hope Costco doesn’t run out before we can get over there!! No weekend blackouts? Includes LLMP? Comes with a random $30 gift card? Valid from MAY TO DECEMBER?! The only possible downside is reservation availability, but as long as you book in advance ur chilling. It really is! Our parents don’t necessarily “need” Park Hoppers or LLMP when they come out to visit, but we’re still debating getting this over the current ticket deal for them. The big thing for us is the December expiration–visiting once this summer, once in October, and once in early December would be fantastic. I just purchased tickets for DL for this June and was shocked at this price savings, $300 less than what I just paid, but then didn’t feel quite as bad when I read the details. What a fantastic deal if you happen to live in CA! Wow. This is an amazing deal. I wish they’d make it available across the country because this is about $10 less than I paid for a 2-day Park Hopper with Lightning Lane Multi Pass ticket through Get Away Today for a trip in March and that obviously didn’t include the dining credit. One element that made last summer’s deal so much better was that it also included kid’s prices equivalent to the 50% off tickets offered in the Winter off-season. That made it easily the best publicly available deal in recent memory. This deal is definitely aggressive and I appreciate it. I don’t think we’re going to get a trip in this year, but if deals keep being this good it’s at least a little more likely. Thanks Tom!!!

Title: Upfronts 2025 Takeaways & Report Card: Amazon and Netflix Return Strong, Scripted Programming Purged on Broadcast
URL: https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/upfronts-2025-takeaways-report-card-amazon-netflix-nbcu-fox-1236405146/

Music always plays a large role at the annual TV upfronts, as media buyers, journalists, execs and other attendees are ushered in and out of these showcases to loud playlists — often spun by celebrity DJs. But this year, one number heard throughout the week came with a hefty dose of irony: Doechii’s popular track “Anxiety.”In the song, Doechii sings about how her anxiety “keep on trying me / My anxiety, can’t shake it off of me.” Perhaps a bit too on the nose for the media congloms to be piping into Radio City Music Hall, the Hammerstein Ballroom and other upfronts venues. After all, no matter how hard media execs try to spin that things are fine — that’s hardly the case: Production is down, budgets keep getting slashed and studios like Paramount Global (still awaiting news on its Skydance merger) continue to be the subject of speculation about their ultimate survival.Anxiety rules this business, and yet, the show must go on. Last week NBCUniversal, Fox, Disney, Amazon, Warner Bros. Discovery, Netflix and YouTube all promoted their broad portfolios, with varying degrees of success.Live sports are clearly still the driving factor in the conglomerates’ programming strategies, and movies are part of upfronts now. A decline in scripted programming on the broadcast networks’ fall schedules is a telling sign that the TV business continues to evolve, with some of the biggest scripted bets of next season (like “The Office” follow-up “The Paper”) going to streaming instead of the traditional Big 4.By the end of upfronts week, attendees heard so many competing pitches for their ad dollars that it was hard to keep the messages straight. But here are some of Variety’s biggest takeaways from the 2025 upfronts. Related Stories VIP+ Can Live Music Break More Records in 2025? Q1 Results Are Inconclusive What Recession? Popular on Variety It’s an undeniable fact: The entertainment business is in roughfinancial shape. Like the rest of the country, media companies have been affected by President Trump’s tariffs and general economic upheaval. The Peak TV era, marked by blank checks for massive tentpole productions, is over. Earnings have taken a hit. Layoffs have impacted thousands. Everyone is on the hunt for more cost-effective programming. Of course, you’d get very little sense of that had you attended the upfronts. Save for a scant few passing mentions, you’d have no idea that Hollywood is facing these economic choppy times.Martin Short told the audience at Disney’s presentation that “there’s no tariffs on standing ovations,” earning a guffaw, while one Fox exec at the Manhattan Center told the crowd, “The winds of change continue to sweep through our industry and our economy.”That’s about it for mentions of anything to do with the economy this upfronts week. Understandably, media companies don’t want to scare advertisers with lots of doom and gloom. Much of TV is about escapism, after all. But completely ignoring reality is not the best policy either.Scripted Purge on Broadcast Scripted programming took a big hit on the broadcast networks this upfronts season. With the release of the fall schedules, nearly all of the major broadcasters have shifted their focus to unscripted programming and sports.The numbers don’t lie: ABC will have only five hours of scripted programming a week in the fall. Fox will have four. NBC canceled five scripted shows, with virtually no pilots in the works to replace them. CBS was the only network that committed heavily to more scripted shows, but even those were mostly spinoffs (sorry, “universe expansions”). Those included “Sheriff Country,” “Boston Blue,” “CIA” and “Y: Marshals.”Scripted shows cost more to make, and the broadcast networks aren’t drawing nearly as many customers as streamers. And there was never any doubt NBC was going to eventize the return of NBA coverage on the network.But if there’s one thing broadcast can do well, it’s weekly procedurals and broad comedies. Both formats continue to be popular, but the networks don’t seem in any rush to find the next big show.One thing’s for sure — the nostalgia reboot/revival wave has officially crashed. NBC axed “Suits LA” after just one season, despite the original show’s massive streaming success. The network also canceled the “Night Court” follow-up with Melissa Rauch and John Larroquette after three seasons, even though it started out strong in the ratings. Maybe it’s time for some original ideas to get their time in the spotlight? What’s in a Name? Whomever media companies are paying to come up with the names for new platforms deserves either a raise or a demotion. A major theme of the upfronts was branding or rebranding (or re-re-branding, in one case) with names that lacked creativity.Among the top stories of the week, Warner Bros. Discovery revealed that Max would be known as HBO Max … again. Two years after the David Zaslav regime dropped the HBO part of its streaming service’s name, HBO boss Casey Bloys announced onstage that “HBO Max” was back — earning a wide range of reactions, from laughter to applause. It could have been worse. They could have gone with Max+.Meanwhile, Disney unveiled its ESPN streaming service, which will be called … ESPN. The streamer will offer an unlimited plan that includes all ESPN networks and ESPN broadcasts on ABC for $30 a month. The irony is, that’s more than is currently offered on ESPN+. As Jimmy Kimmel put it during his annual upfront roast, “The plus is now, in many ways, a minus.”Finally there is Versant, the spinoff of NBC-Universal that will house cable brands like USA Network, Syfy, E!, CNBC and MSNBC. Aside from the fact that no one can tell you what “Versant” means, the name lacks the pop of SpinCo, the moniker the company used before someone landed on its official name.“We Come to This Place for Ad Sales” It’s official — movies are as much a part of upfronts as TV. While upfronts were once exclusively about television shows, feature films now play a major role in media company pitches to advertisers.NBCUniversal, for the second year in a row, spent a lot of time talking up “Wicked” and its sequel, “Wicked: For Good.” Donna Langley, chairman, NBCUniversal Entertainment & Studios, and director Jon M. Chu both took the stage to hype the sequel and reveal trailers and a musical special coming to NBC. Not only that, but ad sales chief Mark Marshall made his entrance from the rafters dressed in a Glinda-inspired pink suit.Amazon’s upfront featured appearances by John Cena, Jason Momoa, Dave Bautista and Arnold Schwarzenegger, who talked up their upcoming films with Prime Video. Courtenay Valenti, Amazon’s head of theatrical and streaming film, hit the stage to delve into the film slate. She talked about Amazon’s “Thomas Crown Affair” reboot with Michael B. Jordan — with Jordan himself coming out to reveal a series spinoff of the “Creed” film franchise.Over at the Warner Bros. Discovery upfront, the company devoted a big portion of its presentation to James Gunn and Peter Safran, co-heads of DC Studios. In fairness, that included DC TV shows like “Peacemaker” Season 2 and the upcoming “Lanterns,” but it also had Gunn, Safran and Shaquille O’Neal revealing a brand-new trailer for Gunn’s “Superman” movie.While companies are all about showing off their entire portfolios to advertisers, it’s still jarring to see that TV is only a portion of the upfronts experience now. Sports, Sports, Sports Sports programming has always been a major factor at the upfronts, but never more so than now. Linear TV still has the edge when it comes to live sports, and outlets like NBC are making the most of that. The broadcaster made its 11- year deal for NBA and WNBA rights a central part of its upfront, bringing out multiple current stars and revealing that Michael Jordan will be part of the network’s basketball coverage.Other traditional TV outlets, in an effort to stave off live sports gains made by streamers, have gone all in not just on major players like the NFL, the NBA and the NHL, but also on basically any sports rights deal they can get their hands on. College-level sports of all kinds and smaller leagues got their time in the spotlight. But streamers made their sports presence felt more than ever. YouTube will livestream an NFL game for free in 2025. Amazon and Netflix announced major games for “Thursday Night Football” and the Christmas Day doubleheader, respectively. Netflix got NFL commissioner Roger Goodell onstage (in a Santa coat, no less) to announce the 2025 Christmas surprise.Of course, not all the sports moments were highlight reel-worthy. At Fox’s presentation, Tom Brady somehow missed an easy pass to Rob Gronkowski, with the ball sailing into the crowd, while Blake Griffin got smoked in a Pop-a-Shot shoot-off against former NFL star Ryan Fitzpatrick Upfronts Report Card Amazon Grade: ABest star moment: Jamie Lee Curtis and Arnold Schwarzenegger going off scriptBest pitch: Michael B.

But the company had a lot to promote (including fan favorites BravoCon and “Wicked”), and shout-out to Mark Marshall for risking his life with his flying entrance. Netflix Grade: ABest star moment: Jerry Jones going way off scriptBest pitch: Jude Law and Jason Bateman teasing “Black Rabbit”Best use of music: “Thunderstruck” featuring the Dallas Cowboys cheerleadersWorst use of jargon: “Our biggest titles … are not just shows anymore. They’re vibes.”Biggest bet on a show: “Stranger Things” final season Netflix put on a much heftier showcase of its new and returning offerings than it did last year. The presentation ran barely 80 minutes, but packed in a ton of info and news. Warner Bros. Discovery Grade: B-Best star moment: Conan O’Brien frantically pitching the NEO ad platformBest pitch: Conan O’Brien frantically pitching the NEO ad platformBest use of music: Guns N’ Roses’ “Patience” in the “Task” trailerWorst use of jargon: “We believe HBO Max far better represents our current consumer proposition.”Biggest bet on a show: “Dancing With Sharks” (yes, that’s a real show) Warner Bros. Discovery was doing well at first, but its event went on too long. Maybe Tony Shalhoub didn’t need to hype his bread show? This upfront also definitely lacked the razzle-dazzle and star power of years past. YouTube Grade: B-Best star moment: Lady Gaga’s rollicking five-song setBest pitch: Creator Brittany Broski saying her BroskiReport podcast channel has “1 million subscribers who never hit the ‘Skip ad’ button”Best use of music: Chappell Roan’s “Pink Pony Club” as CEO Neal Mohan’s walk-on songWorst use of jargon: “Culture,” as in YouTube is “the epicenter of culture” YouTube had only one major piece of content news to share: Its rights deal with the NFL to livestream a free game in the 2025 season. They did a good job of showcasing new ad formats, creators and marketing results. And Gaga’s performance brought down the house.

"AI is now infrastructure, and this infrastructure—just like the internet, just like electricity—needs factories," Huang told the audience. "You apply energy in, and it produces something incredibly valuable: tokens." The company introduced the idea of these data centers as new "AI factories," reimagining their purpose as facilities specifically optimized for artificial intelligence workloads. As a first step toward significant expansion, Nvidia announced NVLink Fusion, opening its "interconnect" technology to other manufacturers. This system enables customers to integrate processors from other companies alongside Nvidia's GPUs. "A tectonic shift is underway: for the first time in decades, data centers must be fundamentally rearchitected—AI is being fused into every computing platform," Huang said in an official press release. "NVLink Fusion opens Nvidia's AI platform and rich ecosystem for partners to build specialized AI infrastructures." This development is particularly significant as it provides developers with more hardware choices, even from third-party providers, for training their models. Companies can now build semi-custom AI systems tailored to specific workloads, optimizing for cost, performance, or specific architectural advantages. Partners including MediaTek, Marvell, Alchip Technologies, Astera Labs, Synopsys, and Cadence are among the first to adopt this technology. Another important development, announced separately from Computex, is that Nvidia expanded its partnership with Neocloud providers. Such providers focus almost exclusively on renting high-end GPUs, such as NVIDIA’s H100, H200, A100, and upcoming Blackwell chips, for AI-specific workloads like training large language models (LLMs), computer vision, and inference. Some of these new “cloud partners” include CoreWeave, Nebius, Crusoe, and Lambda. As part of its vision of establishing “sovereign AI” development, the company announced partnerships with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to develop massive infrastructure for AI training and deployment, mainly driven as part of Trump’s chip accords. The market has responded positively to these announcements, with Nvidia's stock growing almost 60% since its dip on April 7. On Monday, though, the stock was relatively stable—as it has been for the last 4 days—going from $132.39 to $135.35. NVDA finished Tuesday's trading day just below the $135 mark. Nvidia also emphasized that NVLink enables compatibility between Qualcomm processors and Nvidia GPUs. This could lead to AI computers featuring energy-efficient CPUs paired with Nvidia's high-performance GPUs, or even mobile hardware with Nvidia GPUs for faster inference and enhanced gaming experiences. The company also revealed plans for a new local headquarters called Nvidia Constellation in Taipei's Beitou Shilin Science Park. Nvidia is also expanding to Taiwan, where the company plans to expand its quantum operations. For individual developers, Nvidia introduced DGX Spark, a compact AI workstation built by partners including ASUS, Dell, and MSI. Powered by the GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip, it offers 1,000 AI TOPS with 128GB memory, supporting models up to 200 billion parameters. Just for context, Nvidia’s most powerful consumer GPU, the RTX 5090 packs up to 32GB of memory, and starts at $2,499. "Direct descendants of the DGX-1 system that ignited the AI revolution, DGX Spark and DGX Station are created from the ground up to power the next generation of AI research and development," Huang noted. Reservations for the DGX Spark start at $3,999 per unit. Addressing concerns about AI's impact on employment, Huang presented a different perspective. Rather than causing a job crisis, he sees AI as the solution to an impending workforce shortage. "We'll have a shortage of workers by 2030—about 30 to 50 million people short. It's actually limiting the world's ability to grow," Huang said. "Now we have these digital agents that can work with us. One-hundred percent of Nvidia software engineers now have digital agents working with them to help develop better code more productively." Looking further into the future: "The reason why humanoid robotics are so important is because it is the only form of robot that can be deployed almost anywhere," he said, adding that “this whole new industry is going to expose us to giant opportunities ahead."

Title: Elon Musk Intends To Spend “A Couple Of Days” At The White House Every Few Weeks, Denies Any Immediate Plans To Merge Tesla And xAI, Declares That NVIDIA GPUs Are “Still Better Than What We Make”

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Elon Musk has been the center of the media landscape for the past few hours, courtesy of the near-constant trickling of tantalizing soundbites. Now, the world's richest person has set the proverbial tongues wagging by expressly stating that his political engagements with the Trump White House will continue. ELON INTERVIEW AT QATAR FORUM – FULL VERSION Here's the full interview with Elon Musk at the Qatar Economic Forum a few minutes ago. Timestamps: 0:44 A typical week for Elon1:40 Tesla’s situation has already turned around3:55 Elon's compensation important to control Tesla… pic.twitter.com/G3SxPgBEdP — ELON CLIPS (@ElonClipsX) May 20, 2025 Elon Musk recently gave an expansive interview on the sidelines of the Qatar Economic Forum. Interestingly, Musk conveyed a sense of optimism around Tesla's demand equation, asserting that the EV giant has "already turned around," with lingering weakness reserved for Europe alone. Bear in mind that Tesla sales declined around 10 percent year-over-year in Q1 2025, as the launch of a refreshed version of Model Y idled factory capacity for retooling, and Musk's political role at the White House prompted a partisan backlash. Meanwhile, in Europe, Musk's emphatic support for the far-right AfD in the recent German elections also led to widespread calls for a boycott. ELON MUSK: PLANS TO BE AT THE WHITE HOUSE COUPLE OF DAYS EVERY FEW WEEKS — Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) May 20, 2025 Now, additional soundbites from Elon Musk are adding oxygen to the ongoing media frenzy. First, Musk has stated that he still intends to spend "a couple of days" at the White House "every few weeks." This goes against the impression that Musk had conveyed during the Q1 2025 Tesla earnings call, where he implied that his DOGE work was "mostly done." ELON MUSK: DOESN'T CURRENTLY HAVE PLANS TO MERGE TESLA, XAI MERGING TESLA AND XAI NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION, WOULD NEED SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL — Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) May 20, 2025 Next, while not completely ruling out the possibility, Elon Musk has denied the presence of any immediate plans to merge Tesla with xAI. This comes as xAI recently acquired the social media platform X in an all-stock deal that valued the former at $80 billion and the latter at $33 billion, inclusive of $12 billion in liabilities. This meant that the deal bestowed a gross valuation of $45 billion on X before factoring in its debt load of $12 billion. ELON MUSK: EXPECTS TO BUY 'A LOT' OF NEXT-GENERATION GPUS FROM $NVDA, $AMD; “NVIDIA IS STILL BETTER THAN WHAT WE MAKE” — Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) May 20, 2025 Finally, in a nod to NVIDIA's continuing dominance in the AI silicon arena, Elon Musk has declared he expects to buy "a lot" of GPUs from NVIDIA and AMD, going on to note that NVIDIA's offerings are "still better than what we make" in what is an allusion to Tesla's in-house ASICs.

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily The new format, called Diamond & Pearls, officially launches May 29 in Delray Beach, Fla. Senior Editor, Retail David’s Bridal Inc., seeking to lift its image and widen its appeal to a higher-income audience, has launched a new retail format called Diamonds & Pearls. “It’s a boutique concept, with a curated and tech-enhanced experience blending affordable luxury and couture with a refined, elevated environment,” said Elina Vilk, president and chief business officer of David’s Bridal, in an interview. “Today’s brides are looking for more than a dress. They are looking for an immersive, shopping experience.” With the opening of the 3,500-square-foot Diamonds & Pearls at 9097 West Atlantic Avenue, Suite 104 in Delray Beach, Fla., “We saw an opportunity to reimagine the bridal journey through innovation, curation and style,” Vilk said. The official opening is May 29, though there’s already been a few “soft opening” days to get out any kinks. Related Articles Fashion Features Brides Like '90s-style Wedding Gowns, Brown Flowers and Lace-like Nails, Pinterest Says Designer and Luxury Giambattista Valli Won a Bridal Award in Barcelona Compared with the 193 David’s Bridal stores around the country, and their no-frills, moderate price presentations, Diamonds & Pearls takes a contemporary and personalized approach for the brides, bridesmaids and special occasion categories contained in a smaller space. It still has some of the same selections as David’s Bridal, with approximately one-third of the stock keeping units typically found in a traditional David’s Bridal store, but is curated to the most trending styles and silhouettes. There are also some exclusive designer offerings, from Viola Chan and Marchesa, as well as David Bridal’s signature lines such as Galina Signature, Oleg Cassini and Melissa Sweet, among other labels. Chan will work with clients on a custom design, either in person or through virtual calls. In addition, appointments can be arranged with personal stylists, Champagne is served, walk-ins are welcomed as well and trunk shows are planned. You May Also Like Inside the shop, interactive digital touchscreens powered by Shopify POS provide clients access to David Bridal’s full inventory of dresses, accessories and shoes. “Internally, we are calling it the store of the future,” Vilk said. The future may bring additional Diamonds & Pearls stores, as the company is close to signing another lease on the Northeast Coast. But before green-lighting an expansion of Diamonds & Pearls, Vilk and her team will analyze the performance of the first store for the next four or five months. “We are ‘test and learn’ people,” Vilk said. “We want to see how this store goes, but we anticipate this will be a big part of our strategy next year.” There’s been “so much demand” for the kind of bridal shopping experience Diamonds & Pearls provides. Prices start at $400 to $500, average just over $2,000, and go as high as $6,000 or $7,000 for a custom couture gown, Vilk said. “We are way more affordable than many bridal boutiques,” she said, suggesting other boutiques typically average out with a $4,000 to $5,000 price point. The launch of Diamonds & Pearls reflects David’s Bridal’s rebuilding efforts after going in and out of bankruptcy two times in the last seven years, in 2018 and 2023, leading to the sale of the company to asset manager Cion Investment. (“Diamonds and Pearls” is also the name of a 1991 Prince album.) “We’re actually doing pretty well,” Vilk said when asked how the business is currently performing. “We are completely changing the strategy and driving innovation with concepts like Diamonds & Pearls, becoming more asset-light and taking a tech-forward approach.” Vilk said David’s Bridal is rebuilding its wedding planning service, started a retail media company in January, and is looking at new AI tools. “Gen Z brides are tech-forward. They don’t start their journey in the store anymore. She’ll browse online first, then see it on social media,” said Vilk, a former Hootsuite, Meta, PayPal and Visa executive. “And she wants affordable luxury.” Sign up for WWD news straight to your inbox every day Get all the top news stories and alerts straight to your inbox.

Noom will start offering smaller doses of compounded Wegovy (NVO), the blockbuster weight-loss drug, as the digital health company continues to adapt to the growing demand for affordable weight-loss solutions and a changing market. Reuters (TRI) reported that Noom is rolling out personalized doses of its semaglutide drug to help patients manage their weight while minimizing side effects (such as nausea) that are a common concern with full doses of the drug. Smaller doses can also help patients cut down on costs. Wegovy can cost upward of $349 for a 2.5-milligram vial. Meanwhile, Noom’s compounded semaglutide, offered through a telehealth model, allows patients to access the treatment at a fraction of the cost, starting at $149 for the first month. Taking smaller doses of the medication has become popular due to the drugs’ expense and side effects, but Noom told Reuters that its goal isn’t to capitalize on the microdosing trend but rather to provide a more manageable and effective weight-loss solution, tailored to individual patient needs. In a recent blog post, CEO Geoff Cook wrote that Noom’s GLP-1 RX Program with Smart Dose can address gaps “to provide a personalized, behaviorally integrated approach for patients who need it.” Members who are prescribed a program with Noom’s SmartDose may start at a lower than commercially available dose and move their dosage up at a personalized pace based on individual response. Users will continue to adjust their dose through frequent check-ins to ensure the treatment is working best for them. According to Reuters, Noom’s personalized approach could start with half of the standard 0.25-milligram starter dose of Wegovy and gradually increase to around half of the FDA-approved maximum dose of 2.4 milligrams over a 20-week period. Noom has been offering the SmartDose program to patients clinically indicated since February. The move comes as demand for weight-loss medications such as Wegovy has surged, driven by their ability to help patients potentially lose up to 20% of their body weight. The FDA is moving to rein in unapproved compounded versions of semaglutide-based drugs such as Wegovy. These versions were temporarily permitted during shortages, but that exemption ends May 22. Noom, however, is betting its personalized prescribing model will still comply with FDA rules, which allow compounding for individual patients under specific conditions. “There is a personalized — and there has always been a personalized — exception,” Cook, the company’s CEO, told Reuters. Noom’s bet on smaller doses of its weight-loss drug comes as recent figures suggest the drug market may be seeing signs of slowing growth. Sales of Wegovy reached approximately 17.36 billion Danish kroner (about $2.64 billion) in Q1 2025, reflecting a 19% year-over-year increase — but also a 13% quarter-over-quarter decline, indicating potential signs of market stagnation. And the CEO of Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk just stepped down after the company’s stock dropped 50% in a year. Competition has intensified, with Eli Lilly’s (LLY) Zepbound and its coming GLP-1 pill adding pressure to the market for weight-loss drugs. Alongside these contenders, compounded alternatives to semaglutide are flooding the market, further complicating the landscape.

Title: Don't call it a comeback: Why Goldman sees the downtrodden Magnificent 7 roaring back to beat the market

The stock market's tech titans stumbled in the first quarter, but 2025 will still be another winning year for the Magnificent Seven, Goldman Sachs said. In a recent note, chief equity strategist David Kostin projected that the mega-cap tech cohort will once again outperform the rest of the S&P 500 in 2025, extending a streak of stellar gains to a third straight year. "We continue to expect that superior earnings growth will drive the Magnificent 7 to outperform the S&P 493 in 2025, but by a smaller magnitude than in recent years," Kostin wrote. "The share price outperformance of the Magnificent 7 has been tied to their earnings growth outperformance." It's a take that might seem contradictory to what's transpired so far this year, as trade policy, AI disruptions, and antitrust moves have muddled the outlook for Big Tech. The group, which includes Nvidia, Tesla, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Apple, is down 5% year-to-date, trailing the 4% gain achieved by the broader index. Some big banks, such as Morgan Stanley, have called on investors to reduce tech exposure. Ye, despite the slump so far, Kostin noted that mega-cap tech demonstrated earnings outperformance in the first quarter. In 2025, earnings-per-share growth has surged 28% for the Mag Seven, handily outpacing 9% for the S&P 493. "This magnitude of surprise was the largest since the 2Q 2021 reporting season when the Magnificent 7 beat earnings estimates by 27%," the bank wrote. "Partly as a result of strong 1Q results, consensus 2025 earnings estimates for the Magnificent 7 are roughly in line with where they began the year." What's more, the top tech stocks are now trading at a discounted valuation, resulting from narrowing earnings growth compared to previous years. "The relative valuation is the lowest it's been in the last two years," Kostin told Bloomberg TV. "From a starting point of entry, it's actually looking somewhat more attractive at these levels."

Title: Ulta Stock Catches Oppenheimer's Eye Ahead of Earnings Release Next Week

Ulta (ULTA) shares are in the midst of a glow-up. The cosmetic company is attracting attention from investors, with analysts saying consumers are less likely to cut back on beauty purchases during tough economic times. Oppenheimer is one of the latest investment advisory groups to make this case ahead of Ulta’s earnings release slated for next week. Oppenheimer maintained its “outperform” rating of Ulta Tuesday and raised its target price to $465, which is 11% above the average target price among analysts who follow Ulta and were polled by Visible Alpha. Oppenheimer said Ulta appears poised to meet its financial targets and may benefit from limited exposure to tariffs and potential closures of Kohl’s (KSS) stores, which stock products from Sephora, a cosmetics company owned by LVMH Moët Hennessy. “We are encouraged by the strategic direction of the company under new CEO Kecia Steelman and are focused on management's execution of key digital priorities in the coming quarters to sustain the company's competitive position vs. [Amazon] AMZN, [Walmart] WMT, and others,” Oppenheimer said. The cosmetic company’s stock has shot up about 36% since mid-March when better-than-expected earnings and fresh leadership helped reverse a months-long decline. This puts shares at $420.50—or more than 8% above where they were a year ago. Wall Street is looking for a roughly 0.2% year-over-year increase in comparable store sales when Ulta shares its first-quarter results on May 29. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha expect profit of $267.3 million on net sales of $2.79 billion. A year ago, Ulta reported net income of $313.1 million on sales of $2.73 billion.

More AI Can we still call ourselves contrarians if we buy into “mainstream” trends like the stunning growth of artificial intelligence? Of course we can. Today we’re going to do just that. But of course we’re not picking up obvious names like Nvidia (NVDA). Instead we’re looking to an 8%-paying fund I see having even more upside than the “go-to” AI stocks everyone else is buying. The technique we’re going to use here is a very underappreciated concept called “oblique investing.” Sounds a bit dry, I know, but it’s anything but. The idea here is, roughly speaking, to invest in big forces driving the market and shifting the economy over the foreseeable future. Obvious, right? There’s more here, though, because, of course, doing this directly by investing in the trend itself means you’ll likely overpay, since the market has already picked up on it. So instead, we’re going to look to stocks (and funds) that are well-positioned to ride the trend higher but aren’t the obvious names in their sectors. It’s best to look at this through an example: In the mid-2010s, technology’s rise to dominance over other sectors was a clear trend. So anyone who bought the “big three” semiconductor stocks—Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel (INTC)—would have easily beaten the S&P 500 on average. NVDA Total Returns As we can see, big gains from AMD (in blue) and Nvidia (in purple) more than offset losses on Intel (in green). However, back then, buying Nvidia, which was best known for making graphics cards for gamers, seemed like a losing move compared to Intel, which made the CPUs in almost every computer. Even Apple (AAPL) had switched to Intel processors. In other words, the “obvious” investment in the future did not play out, while the closely related, but not directly plausible—or “oblique,” if you will—story did play out. Fast-forward to today and we’re looking at another trend in the process of rewriting tech—and many aspects of society as a whole: AI. Here too, Nvidia is the major player, with its chips powering the AI trend, much like Intel’s chips powered the rise of tech more generally in the 2010s. Thanks first to its gains from powering the tech sector and then to its AI dominance, Nvidia has grown to become the second-largest stock in the S&P 500. The numbers are staggering: Over the last 10 years, Nvidia went from being 0.063% of the S&P 500 to 5.8% now. And as I write this, following the tariff selloff, investors are starting to turn back to the story of U.S. economic growth driven by, you guessed it, technology such as AI. And so Nvidia is starting to recover, but its ceiling is much lower than it was in the past. It’s already risen some 25,000%+ in the last 10 years, and another 25,000%+ gain over the next decade is simply not in the cards. Where does that leave us? Obviously, we want to invest in AI’s ongoing growth, but we don’t want to get into a crowded trade. That brings me to a closed-end fund (CEF) called the Virtus Artificial Intelligence & Technology Opportunities Fund (AIO), which we once held in my CEF Insider service. CEFs are, of course, wildly underappreciated. So, to say AIO is “oblique” compared to Nvidia might be the king of understatements. Nonetheless, this 8%-yielding fund (more on the payout in a moment) does hold Nvidia. So, we get some exposure to the company’s ongoing growth (which will continue, even if it doesn’t hit those 25,000% gains of the past). We’re getting the other “usual suspects” in AI, too, including Meta Platforms (META). But the real key to AIO’s “oblique” appeal is that it also holds firms that benefit by using AI in their day-to-day businesses, like drug maker Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY), insurer Progressive Corp. (PGR) and heavy-equipment maker Deere & Co. (DE). Firms like these are key to profitable AI investing because it’s likely to be the users of this tech—not the providers—that reap the biggest profits from it. While it’s best known for its chatbot, AI leader OpenAI also has many enterprise clients, including John Deere. In short, Deere uses AI to make its products more efficient, such as its herbicide spray, which uses fewer chemicals than competitors’ offerings. That results in healthier, cheaper products, said Justin Rose, Deere’s president of lifecycle solutions, supply management and customer success, in his recent conversation with OpenAI. (If you’re into farming, the entire interview is worth reading.) Of course, these are far from obvious cases of AI integration, so they’re not priced into stocks like Deere yet, and that is exactly why AIO is holding them. Same goes for Progressive using AI to lower its marketing costs and Eli Lilly using AI to discover new drugs. AIO is collecting these “hidden” AI plays for investors to hold for the long haul. Finally, there’s that 8% dividend, which has held steady since AIO’s launch. Investors have picked up a couple of nice special dividends, too. AIO Dividend This, by the way, is yet another benefit of “oblique” CEFs: high (and often monthly paid) dividends you have zero hope of getting from a mainstream tech name like Nvidia.

Title: The Travel Stocks Congress Loves to Trade

Photo Credit: Dozen of lawmakers and their spouses have traded stocks in travel companies. Wikimedia Commons / David Maiolo More than three dozen lawmakers and their spouses have traded stocks in travel companies — even as they oversee and regulate them. Members of Congress help shape the future of the travel industry — and some are personally investing in it, too. A Skift analysis of congressional financial disclosures reveals that more than three dozen lawmakers and their spouses have traded stocks in airlines, hotel chains, cruise companies, and travel tech firms. In all, federal lawmakers and their spouses have made nearly 600 individual travel industry-related stock trades since the 2021-2022 congressional session, congressional financial records indicate. Taken together, the purchases and sales are worth well into the millions of dollars. Shares of Marriott International, Airbnb, Uber, Hilton Worldwide, and Booking Holdings rank among the most frequently traded common stocks by members of Congress and their spouses. Members of Congress are legally allowed to buy and sell individual stocks as long as they don’t violate the anti-insider trading provisions of the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012, known as the STOCK Act. They must disclose their trades within 45 days. Dozens of members of Congress have violated these disclosure rules in the past decade. And a growing number of elected Republicans and Democrats alike want to limit or ban trading individual stocks. Even some of Congress’ most prolific travel stock traders tell Skift that they’re rethinking their investment strategies or have recently stopped trading individual stocks. “The travel and tourism industry is affected by tax implications, subsidies, lots of decisions,” said Dylan Hedtler-Gaudette, director of government affairs for the nonprofit and nonpartisan Project on Government Oversight. “Lawmakers can pass a stock ban … they could just invest in broad-based mutual funds right now.” Here is Skift’s company-by-company assessment of which federal lawmakers are trading travel and tourism industry stocks: In all, eight members of Congress disclosed making recent Booking Holdings stock trades within their immediate families, including Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) and Reps. Jefferson Shreve (R-Ind.), Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), Dan Newhouse (D-Wash.), Bill Keating (D-Mass.), Diana Harshbarger (R-Tenn.) and Michael McCaul (R-Texas). A Skift analysis reveals that more than three dozen U.S. lawmakers and their spouses have made nearly 600 stock trades in travel industry companies since 2021, including airlines, hotels, cruise lines, and travel tech firms. The most frequently traded stocks include Booking Holdings, Marriott, Airbnb, Hilton, Uber, and Boeing. While members are legally permitted to trade stocks if they follow disclosure rules under the STOCK Act, many have violated these requirements, fueling bipartisan efforts to ban or further restrict individual stock trading by members of Congress. Lawmakers often cite the use of third-party managers or blind trusts to avoid conflicts of interest, but the practice continues to raise ethical concerns.

A total of 358,737 applications were received this year—down from over 480,000 last year—making it the lowest since FY22, which saw 308,613 applications. The H-1B visa, long touted as a critical gateway for Indian IT professionals and tech talent globally, is witnessing a decline in demand. Industry analysts attribute the decline to a combination of factors, including: stricter US immigration policies which include the newly introduced “Catch-and-Revoke” policy, which mandates immediate visa cancellation for any foreign national (including those on H-1B, student visas, or other categories) found to have violated any US law even once; a significant hike in visa registration fees; the Trump administration’s “America First” and MAGA (Make America Great Again) agenda; and widespread workforce downsizing by global tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google. During Trump’s previous tenure, denial rates for H-1B petitions rose sharply due to stricter eligibility criteria, increased site visits, and additional documentation requirements, said Neeti Sharma, CEO, TeamLease Digital. Even post his presidency tenure, the lingering effects of these policies, along with the anticipation of a possible return to similar measures, have contributed to ongoing uncertainty. This has made companies wary of investing time and resources in H-1B applications that may face higher chances of rejection or delays, she explained. Further compounding the issue are regulatory and procedural changes to the H-1B registration process. In January, USCIS increased the H-1B visa registration fee from $10 to $215, a move that would impact startups and small firms, which are now more cautious in nominating candidates, shared Mamta Shekhawat, Founder of Gradding.com, a study abroad platform. Moreover, the shift to beneficiary-driven selection- where each candidate is counted only once regardless of the number of employers petitioning, has effectively curbed duplicate applications and attempts to game the lottery system, she added. The broader slowdown in the IT sector is another major factor. Many tech giants implemented significant staff reductions through FY24 and FY25, impacting hiring pipelines. “As companies tighten budgets, many are prioritising local hiring and internal mobility over international recruitment,” said Sharma. “Employers are being more cautious in their hiring practices, especially when it comes to foreign workers.” Additionally, the rising costs and regulatory complexity of sponsoring H-1B visas have prompted companies to be more selective. As a result, applications are increasingly being filed only for highly specialised roles or project-based needs. Further, the shift to remote work has lessened the immediate need for on-site international talent, says Varun Singh, MD, XIPHIAS Immigration. While the current trend shows a decline, the demand for skilled foreign workers remains high. For FY2026, USCIS received over 343,000 eligible H-1B registrations against a cap of 85,000, indicating sustained interest, shared Singh. However, Sharma noted that the impact of restrictive policies is not limited to H-1B visas. Similar trends are being observed across other work visa categories. “The L-1 and O-1 programs continue to see slower demand due to compliance challenges and cost considerations. Student visas (F-1) remain stable, but changes to related programs like OPT and H-4 EAD are being closely monitored,” she said. Overall, companies are cautious across all work visa categories, with hiring largely focused on immediate needs rather than long-term projections. Looking ahead, the outlook for H-1B visa applications remains uncertain. Sharma cautioned that the downward trend could continue if restrictive policies remain in place. “If the economic climate improves and there’s a shift toward more open immigration policies, we could see a rebound in H-1B applications,” she said.

On Thursday, I had to hop on a video call for a friend's YouTube channel back in India. Without fuss, I set up shop in the echo-chic cafe at my local IKEA. Unlimited coffee, free WiFi and a great background. What more could one ask for? Turns out I am not alone in this lifestyle choice. According to a 2023 survey by office design firm Octra, as many as 62% of UK professionals say they prefer working from places like cafes, libraries and even lush public parks. That's right, more than half of us have ditched cubicles for cappuccinos. As for me, I write a regular column for NDTV and have no office to speak of. I work out of a cosy little cafe tucked inside my apartment complex. The cafe owner is Kurdish, though she looks English, and her waiters are all English, too. If you turned this place into an office, it could easily pass for a UN outpost, as her customers come from every corner of the world. My productivity thrives on the aroma of Arrabiata and crushed cappuccinos. But I envy the next-door neighbours in a gleaming 40-storey tower. They have got a swanky coworking floor complete with WiFi, free-flowing coffee and designer sofas to boot. This is the world I belong to now, and after nearly 30 years boxed into office walls, it feels liberating. It's the same world millions of others turn to when they want to get their office work done, spark a little creativity or just log in to yet another video call. The return-to-office (RTO) vs. work-from-home (WFH) debate is currently tearing through the corporate world - including in India. What was once seen as a pandemic-era workaround - hybrid and remote work - has now become a lifestyle cornerstone for millions of workers around the world. People have grown so comfortable working from home that they have normalised dressing professionally only for the camera - formal on top, pyjama or shorts below. But just when we thought this was the new normal, the suits are staging a comeback. Big names like Amazon, Uber, SAP, JPMorgan Chase and Nike have sounded the bugle. Employees are being called back to the office - sometimes for as many as five full days a week. According to a 2023 survey by KPMG, a whopping 83% of CEOs globally say they expect a full return to in-office work within the next three years. The corporate justification rests on the usual mantras: collaboration, innovation and culture. In India, where the tech sector gamely followed Silicon Valley into work-from-home (WFH), there is growing pressure to follow it right back into the office - just like its Silicon Valley big brother. But the socio-economic implications are wildly different. Remote work helped Indians escape overpriced urban rentals, opened doors for women and gave countless workers a shot at a better work-life balance. Undoing all that could feel like taking away the ladder just as people were halfway up. And what about the gig economy? It thrives on flexibility, but some experts believe it now stands to take a hit if rigid office culture returns. Are we really going to ask a freelance coder in Coimbatore to relocate just to be supervised by someone who still doesn't fully grasp how GitHub works? Having said that, I must add that some Indian firms are navigating the middle path with surprising agility. From tier-2 cities offering coworking hubs to IT majors experimenting with three-day office weeks, there's an effort to make hybrid work culturally and structurally viable. The key, as always, will be to avoid copying Silicon Valley blindly - and instead adapt global trends to local realities. Globally, there appears to be an employee pushback. An SAP manager in Vancouver told this writer that he believes he brings in more moolah for the company working remotely than he would from a cubicle. At his workplace, a hybrid setup has been in place for over a year. "It's there, but it's not enforced with an iron fist - at least not yet. That said, there's a quiet worry in the background: will this suddenly flip into a rigid policy or worse, be used as a pretext for layoffs?" Sure, he admits some roles genuinely benefit from in-person teamwork - think fast-paced brainstorming, creative sessions or problem-solving marathons. But the vast majority of jobs, he says, can be done just as well -- if not better -- from a remote setup. "Personally, I was relieved that the old, rigid office routine was behind me. It offered a more flexible, common-sense approach -- come in when needed, stay home when it makes more sense. It's a win-win that respects both business needs and personal sanity." To be honest, working remotely wasn't exactly a revolutionary idea even before Covid-19 came along. Virtual collaboration was already baked into the system at many companies with footprints in multiple countries. Ask a veteran techie in Bengaluru, and he would tell you that his company's operation ran 24/7 with its teams scattered across time zones. So, working remotely was a necessity, not a luxury. Today, it's a global culture. The tech world was the forerunner, and now, it has engulfed all sectors. Let's look at some facts: 52% of hybrid workers say they're more productive. Another 64% claim it's a better use of their time. And 85% say they're happier doing it. So if you're hitting your targets while also walking your dog, maybe we don't need to panic? Bosses are worried about “fauxductivity” - that quaint buzzword for pretending to work while doing laundry, picking up groceries, etc. And sure, some people are doing household chores and simultaneously dialling into office calls. Research does back some of these concerns: a 2022 study by Microsoft found that 49% of remote workers admitted to doing non-work activities during work hours, like running errands or doing household chores. RTO supporters argue that bringing everyone back to the office ensures fairness, especially for on-site workers in roles that simply can't be done remotely. They also claim it strengthens workplace culture and improves transparency. Fair points. But critics push back, saying that culture isn't brewed in the office kitchen. It's built on trust, purpose and leaders who don't micromanage employees like headmasters. And nothing erodes that trust faster than treating adults like teenagers skipping class. On the flip side, hybrid workers consistently report lower stress levels, with 85% saying flexible arrangements have boosted their job satisfaction. Burnout drops, motivation rises, and people still deliver results - all without the need to badge-swipe or sit in traffic. Still, those advocating for a full return insist that in-person work fosters accountability, clearer communication and a shared sense of purpose. So the question is, if people are meeting or even exceeding their targets, why obsess over where they sit while doing it? RTO mandates aren't just morale-busters for many. They come with a hefty price tag. A UK-wide study from Gensler, the global architecture and design firm, estimates that maintaining office space can cost companies upwards of £7,700 (Rs 8.7 lakh) per employee annually. Add to that the human cost: according to a report by Owl Labs, nearly 40% of remote professionals say they would consider quitting if forced to return to the office full time. And it's not an empty threat. A University of Chicago study found that companies mandating a full RTO saw a significant loss of senior talent. Many seasoned professionals - the institutional memory of any organisation so to speak - opted to jump ship to more flexible employers. This talent drain not only affects productivity but also leaves junior staff without mentors, further hurting long-term performance. The RTO hardliners also ignore one crucial truth, that presenteeism doesn't equal productivity. Just because someone is warming a chair doesn't mean they are contributing meaningfully. In fact, rigid attendance policies often lead to disengagement. Today's workforce craves autonomy - the ability to decide how and where they work best. Sir Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology at Manchester Business School, was quoted in a report saying: "If you micromanage, you won't get productivity gains and you won't attract the next generation." So what's the smarter route? Flexible work structures that prioritise output over optics. Companies that embrace hybrid and remote models tend to save significantly on real estate. That money can be redirected into people-centric initiatives, such as training programmes or wellness initiatives. It could be reinvested in better tech. And hold on, RTO hardliners. Even a halfway decent coffee machine might spark more creativity than those rickety old vending machines that cough up lukewarm sludge in the name of an office. There's a deeper cultural win. When companies trust employees to work on their terms, it builds loyalty. It signals respect. It says: we care more about what you achieve than where you do it from. Of course, flexibility doesn't mean free-for-all. It requires structure, clear expectations and regular communication. It also means designing hybrid systems that allow for meaningful in-person collaboration without turning it into a commute-heavy hamster wheel. Some of the most forward-thinking companies are leading the way here. Airbnb, for instance, allows staff to work from anywhere permanently. Spotify offers a "Work From Anywhere" programme. Remote work isn't a trend; it's a tectonic shift. And while return-to-office policies may work for certain industries or roles, a one-size-fits-all approach is unlikely to stick in the long run. For many of us, the pandemic rewired not just our routines, but our expectations. We discovered new ways to work, live and balance the two. Flexibility is no longer a perk - it's a baseline requirement. In the end, the big irony is that Silicon Valley sold us the dream of working from anywhere - now it wants everyone back at their desks. Well, they have got the dough, they have got the clout, their wishes might just prevail. As for me, I am writing this very column from my favourite cafe, fuelled by Illy coffee and a quiet corner. The work gets done - often more smoothly than it ever did under fluorescent lights and the hum of a tired vending machine. Over to you, dear readers. (Syed Zubair Ahmed is a London-based senior Indian journalist with three decades of experience with the Western media) Disclaimer: These are the personal opinions of the author While we establish a new normal of military deterrence between India and Pakistan, we seem to have forgotten that our most valuable allies have to be the people themselves. Tim Cook is likely bothered more about what shareholders and analysts think of the way he manages his company's huge cash pile - estimated at well over $300 billion - than an oddball statement from Trump about moving all production to America. The US' federal debt is a staggering $36 trillion and its debt-to-GDP ratio is among the highest in the world; as of 2025 only seven countries owed more money than they earned. The tragedy of Piku is that in the effort to raise a feminist daughter, Bhashkor inadvertently created a woman who cannot separate agency from obligation. She has the freedom to walk away, but no inner permission to exercise it. The problem of Nagaland and the northeastern states stems from an aggressive China that has, over the years, waged a non-conventional war against India directly and indirectly, using Myanmar. A Qatari official told CNN the plane would be a 'gift to the Pentagon', a 'government-to-government transaction' that will then be 'donated' to Trump's presidential library. On February 20, 2025, Alnur Mussayev, who claimed to be a KGB officer, made the most fantastic of Facebook posts - that in 1987 Russia recruited a then 40-year-old Donald Trump as an 'intelligence asset'. On board the rocket was EOS-9, designed to provide continuous and reliable remote sensing data for operational applications across various sectors. For its sheer optics, Trump's Gulf tour was quite over the top, with his three hydrocarbon-rich hosts going overboard in offering him mega-deals. Israel's ongoing military offensive in Gaza has entered its most intense phase yet with the expansion of Operation Gideon's Chariot.

Business A Google logo is seen at a company research facility in Mountain View, California, U.S., May 13, 2025. REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo MOUNTAIN VIEW, California :Alphabet's Google said on Tuesday it would put artificial intelligence into the hands of more Web surfers while teasing a $249.99-a-month subscription for its AI power users, its latest effort to fend off growing competition from startups like OpenAI. Google unveiled the plans amid a flurry of demos that included new smart glasses during its annual I/O conference in Mountain View, California, which has adopted a tone of increased urgency since the rise of generative AI challenged the tech company's longtime stronghold of organizing and retrieving information on the internet. In recent months, Google has become more aggressive in asserting it has caught up to competitors after appearing flat-footed upon the release of Microsoft-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT in 2022. On Tuesday, it further laid out a vision for Google Search that lets consumers ask virtually anything, from simple queries to complex research questions, from analyzing what a smartphone camera sees to fetching an event ticket to buy. Google likewise said it aims to build AI that is personal and proactive, whether phoning a store for users or sending students a practice test generated on the fly.

Loading CEO Sundar Pichai said at the conference that Alphabet would build such AI with the cost in mind as well. "Over and over, we've been able to deliver the best models at the most effective price point," he said.Google's AI assistant Gemini app now has more than 400 million monthly active users, Pichai said.In a major update, the company said consumers across the United States now can switch Google Search into “AI Mode.” Showcased in March as an experiment open to test users, the feature dispenses with the Web’s standard fare in favor of computer-generated answers for complicated queries.Google also announced an “AI Ultra Plan,” which for $249.99 monthly provides users with higher limits on AI and early access to experimental tools like Project Mariner, an internet browser extension that can automate keystrokes and mouse clicks, and Deep Think, a version of its top-shelf Gemini model that is more capable of reasoning through complicated tasks.The price is comparable to $200 monthly plans from AI model developers OpenAI and Anthropic, underscoring how companies are exploring ways to pay for the exorbitant price tag of AI development. Google's new plan also includes 30 terabytes of cloud storage and an ad-free YouTube subscription.Google already offers other subscription options, including a $19.99-per-month service with access to some AI capabilities unavailable for most free users and cheaper plans with additional cloud storage. Last week, the company told Reuters it had signed up more than 150 million subscribers across those plans.Pichai told reporters that the rise of generative AI was not at the full expense of online search.This “feels very far from a zero-sum moment,” said Pichai. “The kind of use cases we are serving in search is dramatically expanding” because of AI.Alphabet shares closed 1.5 per cent lower at $165.32 on Tuesday. RETURN TO GLASSESGoogle made a return to a bumpy effort years ago around smart glasses, demonstrating frames with its new Android XR software. Since its early efforts, rival Meta Platforms has brought its own glasses with AI to market.On stage, two Google officials had a conversation in different languages while the glasses typed up translations for them, viewed through the frames' lenses.Gemini, meanwhile, answered queries about one of the wearer's surroundings as she walked around Mountain View's Shoreline Amphitheater.An XR headset being developed in partnership with Samsung will launch later this year, an official said. Google also announced new partnerships with glasses designers Warby Parker and Gentle Monster to develop headsets with Android XR.SEARCH PRESSURESEarlier this month, Alphabet stock lost $150 billion in market value in one day after an Apple executive testified during one of Google's antitrust cases that AI offerings had caused a decline in searches on Apple's Safari Web browser for the first time.In turn, some analysts reassessed how to measure Google's dominant search market share, with one estimate stating it could fall to less than 50 per cent from around 90 per cent in five years. The analysts cited a behavioral shift drawing consumers toward AI chatbots where they once used traditional search engines.However, Robby Stein, an executive on the search team, in an interview said allowing users to answer more challenging questions through AI could enable "new opportunities to create hyper-relevant, useful advertising." Ads make up the majority of Google's revenue.Investment in AI accounts for most of Alphabet's $75 billion in forecasted capital expenditures this year, a dramatic uptick from the $52.5 billion in 2024 spending that the company reported.Tuesday's announcements included further updates to Google's work to deliver a "universal AI agent," which can perform tasks on someone’s behalf without additional prompting.In a number of demos, Google drew on capabilities developed in a testing ground it has called Project Astra to show off what its latest AI could do.These included pointing a smartphone camera at a written invitation and having AI add the event to a user’s calendar.Google also presented a new AI model called Veo 3 that generates video and audio to create more realistic film snippets for creators.

Title: Companies Are Planning to Build Factories In America. Are Trump's Tariffs Working?

Big manufacturing investments are coming to the U.S. as tariffs threaten supply chains and production. Trump has said restoring U.S. manufacturing is one of his primary goals with tariffs. In recent months, several companies have announced they are building new facilities or expanding production in the U.S. as Trump's trade policies have imposed new barriers to imports. Last month, Swiss drugmaker Roche said it was putting $50 billion into expanding its U.S. footprint, though it did not explicitly cite tariffs as the reason. However, Trump has said he is planning to impose a tariff of 25% on all pharmaceutical imports to encourage companies to locate factories in the U.S. Several other pharmaceutical companies, including Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Eli Lilly (LLY), and Novartis (NVS), also said they were spending billions to expand production in the U.S. Other companies that have announced expansions include: On top of that, multiple companies said they were considering expanding U.S.-based production in light of Trump's tariffs. It's still too early to tell if those announcements add up to a manufacturing renaissance spurred by the tariffs.Many manufacturers were already looking to expand U.S. production in an effort to simplify supply lines and avoid a repeat of the logistical headaches of 2020, when COVID-19 shutdowns wreaked havoc on the production and transportation of various goods.In March and before the bulk of tariffs were announced, U.S. companies spent money on building factories at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $234 billion, nearly triple the $79 billion in February 2020, according to the Census Bureau. Economists doubted that the tariffs would result in a large-scale return of manufacturing jobs to the U.S., though many predicted that they could create at least some jobs.Goldman Sachs, for instance, predicted that the tariffs would lead to the creation of about 100,000 new jobs in manufacturing in the U.S. At the same time, however, they estimated the import taxes would cost 500,000 jobs. Tariffs come with some downsides for U.S. manufacturers, even as they protect some companies from foreign competition: firms that import parts or materials pay higher prices, and companies that export products are hurt by foreign retaliation to U.S. trade barriers, for instance.Some companies have already reportedly announced layoffs related to the tariffs, including Mack Trucks and Volvo.

Title: Bargain butter brings in the crowds

Bicerra By Susan Edmunds and Louise Ternouth of RNZ It was organised chaos this week at Costco when another delivery of butter arrived. This butter is not just any butter - while the other supermarkets are selling a 500g slab for up to $10, Costco's butter is $9.99 for a kilogram. Jody Middleton was among the crowd waiting to stock up on Monday. "I have to say most people were pretty polite about it," she said. "We all knew what we were there for, Costco staff came out and had a chat before they even opened the door, answering questions." She said it was worthwhile braving the crowds. She buys 12 boxes of butter to last her bakery a week. If she bought her butter elsewhere it would have cost more than $800 more. "Compared to Woolworths, it's a saving of $838 for my business in a week." Butter prices have increased significantly over the past year. Stats NZ data showed last week that butter prices were up 65.3 percent in the 12 months to April. Costco butter gets snapped up almost as soon as it arrives on the shelves, and one Taranaki man is making the 750km return trip to get it. Kaleb Halverson decided to start making the trip from New Plymouth to Auckland to deliver Costco's 1kg blocks of butter at $9.99 to customers across the Taranaki region. He only had a few orders at first, but they kept rolling in. 'Butter Boy' Kaleb Halverson loads up on the 1kg blocks on his round trips to Costco in Auckland. Photo: Supplied Halverson makes the trip every few weeks, with the next trip set for May 29, and he told Checkpoint the idea started out as an idea from his mum. "After she made a trip up [to Costco] herself and came back and just thought why not get groceries from there and bring them back for everyone else." He brings back everything the store has to offer, but said butter is definitely top of the list. "It's our hot item at the moment every order has butter." Other popular products are cleaning products and snacks. At the moment he is just servicing the Taranaki region with orders made through his website. Halverson does the orders on top of his full-time job, so the 10-hour round trip is done all on a day off. "We wake up at 4am, pack the car with a bunch of chilly bins, drive up four and a-half hours. "We go and we buy what people have ordered, spend quite a few hours in Costco looking for everything, pack the car and just head back." While he has only done a few trips so far, on the last one he brought back 160 blocks of butter, storing it in chilly bins and chilly bags. Now renting a van, Kaleb said they can do 300 blocks with a limit of 15 blocks per customer and a fee of $2 a block which makes it $12 a kg. He said they were losing out on money on their last trip, so they had upped the service fee from $10 to $40 to cover the cost of petrol and van hire. Halverson told Checkpoint it was still economical for customers to beat the rising cost of supermarket groceries. "It seems to be worth it for people because we've got quite a few orders. "It's unaffordable at the moment just everything here." Kaleb said he would likely have to leave even earlier for his next trip to Costco, as customers were queueing to get their hands on the $9.99 1kg block before the store even opened. Rob Hamlin, a senior lecturer at Otago University, said it was not a price that any retailer supplied by Fonterra could match. Photo: Supplied/John Paul R. Bicerra "The price charged by Costco for packed and processed New Zealand butter at retail is only marginally more than the current price being achieved by Fonterra at auction for its unprocessed milk solids as a bulk unprocessed export commodity." The butter is supplied by Westland Milk Products, which is owned by Yili Group. He said butter was either a "whopping" loss leader for Costco or Yili was trying to undercut the market. Costco declined a request for comment and Westland did not respond. Retail consultant Chris Wilkinson of First Retail Group said Costco knew it had to have a pricing advantage to maintain its value proposition for shoppers. "So achieve that through a pack size that no other retailer offers, and by making a little margin off a lot of volume. "Also, as a global retailer they will be one of the world's largest purchasers of dairy product which will afford them better deals than any Australasian retailer could hope for. They are trading on the world market." He said the pack size was probably not ideal for many households. "And the fact that you still have to spend your $70 to get your membership each year… all these things need to be considered." Chris Schulz, a senior investigative journalist at Consumer NZ, said it looked likely that the Costco butter was a loss leader. "The retailer's Facebook page is flooded with people speculating when the butter might be back on shelves, debating when to visit, and showing off when they do get it. "With butter costing at least $17 per kilo elsewhere else, Costco's pricing makes them look like the 'good guys' in contrast to our supermarket duopoly. Once they're in store, I'm sure many people are picking up roast chickens, cheese, and giant tubs of biscuits too." Fonterra said it could not comment on the pricing models of other retailers and consistent rises in global dairy commodity prices, could lead to an increase in the wholesale price of products like butter and cheese. "We are committed to keeping prices as low as possible, but they may sometimes need to be adjusted to reflect the increased costs." SUBSCRIBER SUBSCRIBER SUBSCRIBER SUBSCRIBER SUBSCRIBER SUBSCRIBER

Forged in collaboration with founding contributors CoreWeave, Google Cloud, IBM Research and NVIDIA and joined by industry leaders AMD, Cisco, Hugging Face, Intel, Lambda and Mistral AI and university supporters at the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Chicago, the project aims to make production generative AI as omnipresent as Linux Red Hat, the world's leading provider of open source solutions, today announced the launch of llm-d, a new open source project that answers the most crucial need of generative AI’s (gen AI) future: Inference at scale. Tapping breakthrough inference technologies for gen AI at scale, llm-d is powered by a native Kubernetes architecture, vLLM-based distributed inference and intelligent AI-aware network routing, empowering robust, large language model (LLM) inference clouds to meet the most demanding production service-level objectives (SLOs). Icon-Red_Hat-Media_and_documents-Quotemark_Open-B-Red-RGBBy tapping the innovation of vLLM and the proven capabilities of Kubernetes, llm-d paves the way for distributed, scalable and high-performing AI inference across the expanded hybrid cloud, supporting any model, any accelerator, on any cloud environment and helping realize a vision of limitless AI potential. By tapping the innovation of vLLM and the proven capabilities of Kubernetes, llm-d paves the way for distributed, scalable and high-performing AI inference across the expanded hybrid cloud, supporting any model, any accelerator, on any cloud environment and helping realize a vision of limitless AI potential. Brian Stevens senior vice president and AI CTO, Red Hat While training remains vital, the true impact of gen AI hinges on more efficient and scalable inference - the engine that transforms AI models into actionable insights and user experiences. According to Gartner, “By 2028, as the market matures, more than 80% of data center workload accelerators will be specifically deployed for inference as opposed to training use.1” This underscores that the future of gen AI lies in the ability to execute. The escalating resource demands of increasingly sophisticated and larger reasoning models limits the viability of centralized inference and threatens to bottleneck AI innovation with prohibitive costs and crippling latency. Red Hat and its industry partners are directly confronting this challenge with llm-d, a visionary project that amplifies the power of vLLM to transcend single-server limitations and unlock production at scale for AI inference. Using the proven orchestration prowess of Kubernetes, llm-d integrates advanced inference capabilities into existing enterprise IT infrastructures. This unified platform empowers IT teams to meet the diverse serving demands of business-critical workloads, all while deploying innovative techniques to maximize efficiency and dramatically minimize the total cost of ownership (TCO) associated with high-performance AI accelerators. llm-d delivers a powerful suite of innovations, highlighted by: This new open source project has already garnered the support of a formidable coalition of leading gen AI model providers, AI accelerator pioneers, and premier AI cloud platforms. CoreWeave, Google Cloud, IBM Research and NVIDIA are founding contributors, with AMD, Cisco, Hugging Face, Intel, Lambda and Mistral AI as partners, underscoring the industry’s deep collaboration to architect the future of large-scale LLM serving. The llm-d community is further joined by founding supporters at the Sky Computing Lab at the University of California, originators of vLLM, and the LMCache Lab at the University of Chicago, originators of LMCache. Rooted in its unwavering commitment to open collaboration, Red Hat recognizes the critical importance of vibrant and accessible communities in the rapidly evolving landscape of gen AI inference. Red Hat will actively champion the growth of the llm-d community, fostering an inclusive environment for new members and fueling its continued evolution. The future of AI must be defined by limitless opportunity, not constrained by infrastructure silos. Red Hat sees a horizon where organizations can deploy any model, on any accelerator, across any cloud, delivering an exceptional, more consistent user experience without exorbitant costs. To unlock the true potential of gen AI investments, enterprises require a universal inference platform - a standard for more seamless, high-performance AI innovation, both today and in the years to come. Just as Red Hat pioneered the open enterprise by transforming Linux into the bedrock of modern IT, the company is now poised to architect the future of AI inference. vLLM’s potential is that of a linchpin for standardized gen AI inference, and Red Hat is committed to building a thriving ecosystem around not just the vLLM community but also llm-d for distributed inference at scale. The vision is clear: regardless of the AI model or the underlying accelerator or the deployment environment, Red Hat intends to make vLLM the definitive open standard for inference across the new hybrid cloud. Join the Red Hat Summit keynotes to hear the latest from Red Hat executives, customers and partners: Brian Stevens, senior vice president and AI CTO, Red Hat “The launch of the llm-d community, backed by a vanguard of AI leaders, marks a pivotal moment in addressing the need for scalable gen AI inference, a crucial obstacle that must be overcome to enable broader enterprise AI adoption.

Title: NVIDIA "AI Factories" -- More Than Clever Marketing?

NVIDIA (NVDA) founder and CEO Jensen Huang gave the opening keynote at the annual Computex conference in his home country of Taiwan on Monday.It was another special moment for a small nation with stunning technological prowess in electronics and semiconductors. He said it was his 30th such visit and he was proud to acknowledge his parents in the audience.Jensen opened the event describing his strong relationships with Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), Foxconn Hon Hai, and dozens of other Taiwanese tech companies and partners. And he closed with a dramatic new video showing NVIDIA’s Santa Clara office “launching” into space and landing in Taiwan.The big reveal was NVIDIA Constellation, a brand new Taiwan office for NVIDIA’s growing Taiwan workforce.Huang emphasized that the work Taiwanese companies are doing has changed the world. He thanked NVIDIA’s ecosystem partners and described the industry’s opportunity as “extraordinary” and “once in a lifetime.”“We are in fact creating a whole new industry to support AI factories, AI agents, and robotics, with one architecture,” he said.Jensen took the stage at a packed Taipei Music Center Monday to kick off COMPUTEX 2025, a week-long event of technology speakers, demos, and workshops.As usual with his keynotes, NVIDIA kick-started the event with 7 press releases and 11 separate blogs on new innovations, products, and partnerships.But I want to highlight the one major theme from Jensen's talk that many investors still find hard to grasp: what exactly is an AI factory?The Path to Improving Humanity's ReachSince Huang revealed his "AI Factory" roadmap at CES earlier this year, he has clearly laid out the steps from Generative AI, to Agentic AI, to Physical AI.The simplest way to describe why NVIDIA now talks about "AI Factories" is to understand what supercomputers with large clusters of GPUs used to be called a decade ago: "massively parallel architectures."I made my first vlog about this technology in March of 2017 titled "Get Your MPA in Deep Learning." Back then, it seemed the innovations couldn't move any faster, even as IBM and Salesforce were bringing Watson and Einstein together using NVIDIA technologies.This has been one of the key features of GPUs that they could be combined by the thousands to do what they do best: compute simultaneously, or "in parallel," without the constraints and bottlenecks of traditional CPU computing.As the technology and its speed have accelerated by 1,000x and new use cases across science, engineering, medicine, energy, and commerce are discovered every day, building the “MPAs” faster, for wider availability to more enterprises, has become the bottleneck.The human appetite for turning data into knowledge -- and then into useful intelligence -- has grown exponentially now that we see what can be done to improve life for more people at a pace we never imagined, from curing cancer and resolving global conflict to solving poverty and pollution.All of these “intelligence” possibilities are only constrained by our physical systems, the datacenters that can be upgraded by NVIDIA GPU dynamics, to solve all these problems at lightning speed. It's why Oracle (ORCL) CEO Larry Ellison mused last year "We have 162 datacenters... we'd like to have 1,000 to 2,000 more."The Robots (and their Agents) Are ComingAnd this is not a stretch when you imagine the AI infrastructure required to train and operate millions of autonomous vehicles and robots. Jensen believes that robotics will be the next multi-trillion-dollar industry.When Isaac GR00T was unveiled last year as the next generation platform for training humanoid robots using synthetic data, I was once again in awe of Jensen’s long-term vision. Companies like BMW were already using Omniverse “digital twins” to simulate new factory operations, so it only made sense that robots could be trained on synthetic data to make them safe, reliable, and affordable before they ever get near real humans.In Taipei, Huang introduced new tools to speed the development of humanoid robots: the Isaac GR00T-Dreams blueprint will help generate synthetic training data using Omniverse and Cosmos platforms to create neural trajectories, enabling robots to adapt to new environments and tasks.The cross-over here between “agentic AI” and “physical AI” is mind-blowing. Agents are “essentially digital robots,” Huang said, able to “perceive, understand and plan.” To speed up the development of physical robots, the industry needs to train robots in a simulated environment. And NVIDIA has partnered with DeepMind and Disney to build Newton, the world’s most advanced physics training engine for robotics.AI as Electricity X the InternetHere's how the master described the situation himself last night..."AI is now infrastructure, and this infrastructure, just like the internet, just like electricity, needs factories,” Huang said. “These factories are essentially what we build today.”"They’re not data centers of the past. These AI data centers, if you will, are improperly described. They are, in fact, AI factories. You apply energy to it, and it produces something incredibly valuable, and these things are called tokens.”I admit, "tokens" sounds sort of boring and soulless. But they are simply the units of data and information that can be combined exponentially to create new knowledge and intelligent solutions. And when enterprises have NVIDIA power tools like the GB200 NVLink72 exascale supercomputer, they will be creating, combining, and transforming tokens at higher bandwidths than the entire Internet operates.Jensen took some noted pleasure in explaining that math last night when he showed off the NVLink “spine” and said “This moves more traffic than the entire Internet." NVIDIA also announced DGX Cloud Lepton, a global GPU compute marketplace connecting developers to over 10,000 GPUs via partners like CoreWeave (CRWV), Foxconn, and SoftBank. It supports on-demand and long-term compute needs for agentic and physical AI applications for companies and research labs that need access to the power tools without investing heavy capital in their own infrastructure.And yes, Jensen has a vested interest in promoting the AI revolution because it sells more GPUs.But if you think about the world-changing power of AI as just like electricity or the Internet, you realize that if NVIDIA stumbled tomorrow, a thousand other companies would fill the void to capture the potential of what is unfolding in what I call the 5th Industrial Revolution.Recall that it took only a century to go from widespread electricity to the ubiquitous iPhone.Now, by harnessing AI factories, we are about to witness centuries of change in only a decade. And that innovation will add trillions of dollars in productivity, solutions, and intelligence to the global economy every year.Kevin Cook has been intensely following NVIDIA innovations since 2016. He runs the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio where the AI revolution is always the center of discussion -- when he’s not talking about Bitcoin.

The last day of trading for the ETF on NASDAQ Stock Market will be June 20, 2025. The last day creation orders will be accepted for the ETF will be June 18, 2025. Investors may sell their shares of the ETF until market close on June 20, 2025. Shares of the ETF will no longer trade on NASDAQ Stock Market after market close on June 20, 2025, and will be subsequently delisted. The final distribution to shareholders of the ETF is expected to occur on or about June 23, 2025. When the ETF commences the liquidation of its portfolio, it may hold cash and securities that may not be consistent with the ETF’s investment objectives and strategies. At the time the liquidation of the ETF is complete, the ETF shares will be individually redeemed. For shareholders that still hold shares of the ETF as of June 20, 2025, shares will be automatically redeemed for cash at the net asset value as of close of business on that date, which will reflect the costs of closing the ETF. Shareholders will generally recognize a capital gain or loss on the redemptions. The ETF may or may not pay one or more dividends or other distributions prior to or along with the redemption payments. About GraniteShares GraniteShares is an independent ETF issuer headquartered in New York City. GraniteShares will continue to offer the following leveraged single stock ETFs: In addition, GraniteShares’ ETF suite includes the following ETFs: Contact Information:William Rhind, CEO GraniteShares Inc +1 646 876 5049 william.rhind@graniteshares.com Important Information Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the GraniteShares funds (the “Funds”) carefully before investing. For a prospectus or summary prospectus with this and other information about the Funds, please call (844) 476 8747, or visit the website at www.graniteshares.com.

There can be no assurance that an active trading market for shares in a Fund will develop or be maintained. Shares may trade above or below NAV. Brokerage commissions will apply. Fund Risks Multiple funds have a limited operating history of less than a year and risks associated with a new fund. The Leveraged and Daily Inverse Funds are not suitable for all investors. The investment program of the funds is speculative, entails substantial risks and include asset classes and investment techniques not employed by most ETFs and mutual funds. Investments in the ETFs are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged (2X) or daily inverse (-1X and -2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The funds do not directly invest in the underlying stock. The Funds seek daily inverse or leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. Each Fund with “Long” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the respective long leveraged multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each a Leveraged Long Fund). Each Fund with “Short” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the inverse (or opposite) multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each an Inverse Fund). Investors should note that the Long Leveraged Funds and the Daily Inverse Funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives and daily inverse investment objectives (respectively), which means that the fund is riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage and inverse strategies because the fund magnifies the performance of their underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect a Funds' return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security. For the Leveraged Long Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. For the Daily Inverse Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from -100% and 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance decreases over a period longer than a single day. Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the ETF. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns. An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund is non-diversified and includes risks associated with the Fund concentrating its investments in a particular industry, sector, or geographic region which can result in increased volatility. The use of derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps are subject to market risks that may cause their price to fluctuate over time. Risks of the Fund include Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk, Inverse Risk, Market Risk, Counterparty Risk, Rebalancing Risk, Intra-Day Investment Risk, Daily Index Correlation Risk, Other Investment Companies (including ETFs) Risk, and risks specific to the securities of the Underlying Stock and the sector in which it operates. These and other risks can be found in the prospectus. Investing in physical commodities, including through commodity-linked derivative instruments such as Commodity Futures, Commodity Swaps, as well as other commodity-linked instruments, is speculative and can be extremely volatile and may not be suitable for all investors. Market prices of commodities may fluctuate rapidly based on numerous factors, including: changes in supply and demand relationships (whether actual, perceived, anticipated, unanticipated or unrealized); weather; agriculture; trade; domestic and foreign political and economic events and policies; diseases; pestilence; technological developments; currency exchange rate fluctuations; and monetary and other governmental policies, action and inaction. A liquid secondary market may not exist for the types of commodity-linked derivative instruments the Fund buys, which may make it difficult for the Fund to sell them at an acceptable price. The Fund is new with no operating history. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Fund will grow to or maintain an economically viable size, in which case it could ultimately liquidate. Derivatives may be more sensitive to changes in market conditions and may amplify risks and losses. This information is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy shares of any Funds to any person in any jurisdiction in which an offer, solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. Please consult your tax advisor about the tax consequences of an investment in Fund shares, including the possible application of foreign, state, and local tax laws. You could lose money by investing in the ETFs. There can be no assurance that the investment objective of the Funds will be achieved.

Investments in the ETFs are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged (2X) or daily inverse (-1X and -2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The funds do not directly invest in the underlying stock. The Funds seek daily inverse or leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. Each Fund with “Long” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the respective long leveraged multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each a Leveraged Long Fund). Each Fund with “Short” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the inverse (or opposite) multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each an Inverse Fund). Investors should note that the Long Leveraged Funds and the Daily Inverse Funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives and daily inverse investment objectives (respectively), which means that the fund is riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage and inverse strategies because the fund magnifies the performance of their underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect a Funds' return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security. For the Leveraged Long Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. For the Daily Inverse Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from -100% and 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance decreases over a period longer than a single day. Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the ETF. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns. An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund is non-diversified and includes risks associated with the Fund concentrating its investments in a particular industry, sector, or geographic region which can result in increased volatility. The use of derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps are subject to market risks that may cause their price to fluctuate over time. Risks of the Fund include Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk, Inverse Risk, Market Risk, Counterparty Risk, Rebalancing Risk, Intra-Day Investment Risk, Daily Index Correlation Risk, Other Investment Companies (including ETFs) Risk, and risks specific to the securities of the Underlying Stock and the sector in which it operates. These and other risks can be found in the prospectus. Investing in physical commodities, including through commodity-linked derivative instruments such as Commodity Futures, Commodity Swaps, as well as other commodity-linked instruments, is speculative and can be extremely volatile and may not be suitable for all investors. Market prices of commodities may fluctuate rapidly based on numerous factors, including: changes in supply and demand relationships (whether actual, perceived, anticipated, unanticipated or unrealized); weather; agriculture; trade; domestic and foreign political and economic events and policies; diseases; pestilence; technological developments; currency exchange rate fluctuations; and monetary and other governmental policies, action and inaction. A liquid secondary market may not exist for the types of commodity-linked derivative instruments the Fund buys, which may make it difficult for the Fund to sell them at an acceptable price. The Fund is new with no operating history. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Fund will grow to or maintain an economically viable size, in which case it could ultimately liquidate. Derivatives may be more sensitive to changes in market conditions and may amplify risks and losses. This information is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy shares of any Funds to any person in any jurisdiction in which an offer, solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.

Title: NVIDIA "AI Factories" -- More Than Clever Marketing?

NVIDIA (NVDA) founder and CEO Jensen Huang gave the opening keynote at the annual Computex conference in his home country of Taiwan on Monday.It was another special moment for a small nation with stunning technological prowess in electronics and semiconductors. He said it was his 30th such visit and he was proud to acknowledge his parents in the audience.Jensen opened the event describing his strong relationships with Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), Foxconn Hon Hai, and dozens of other Taiwanese tech companies and partners. And he closed with a dramatic new video showing NVIDIA’s Santa Clara office “launching” into space and landing in Taiwan.The big reveal was NVIDIA Constellation, a brand new Taiwan office for NVIDIA’s growing Taiwan workforce.Huang emphasized that the work Taiwanese companies are doing has changed the world. He thanked NVIDIA’s ecosystem partners and described the industry’s opportunity as “extraordinary” and “once in a lifetime.”“We are in fact creating a whole new industry to support AI factories, AI agents, and robotics, with one architecture,” he said.Jensen took the stage at a packed Taipei Music Center Monday to kick off COMPUTEX 2025, a week-long event of technology speakers, demos, and workshops.As usual with his keynotes, NVIDIA kick-started the event with 7 press releases and 11 separate blogs on new innovations, products, and partnerships.But I want to highlight the one major theme from Jensen's talk that many investors still find hard to grasp: what exactly is an AI factory?The Path to Improving Humanity's ReachSince Huang revealed his "AI Factory" roadmap at CES earlier this year, he has clearly laid out the steps from Generative AI, to Agentic AI, to Physical AI.The simplest way to describe why NVIDIA now talks about "AI Factories" is to understand what supercomputers with large clusters of GPUs used to be called a decade ago: "massively parallel architectures."I made my first vlog about this technology in March of 2017 titled "Get Your MPA in Deep Learning." Back then, it seemed the innovations couldn't move any faster, even as IBM and Salesforce were bringing Watson and Einstein together using NVIDIA technologies.This has been one of the key features of GPUs that they could be combined by the thousands to do what they do best: compute simultaneously, or "in parallel," without the constraints and bottlenecks of traditional CPU computing.As the technology and its speed have accelerated by 1,000x and new use cases across science, engineering, medicine, energy, and commerce are discovered every day, building the “MPAs” faster, for wider availability to more enterprises, has become the bottleneck.The human appetite for turning data into knowledge -- and then into useful intelligence -- has grown exponentially now that we see what can be done to improve life for more people at a pace we never imagined, from curing cancer and resolving global conflict to solving poverty and pollution.All of these “intelligence” possibilities are only constrained by our physical systems, the datacenters that can be upgraded by NVIDIA GPU dynamics, to solve all these problems at lightning speed. It's why Oracle (ORCL) CEO Larry Ellison mused last year "We have 162 datacenters... we'd like to have 1,000 to 2,000 more."The Robots (and their Agents) Are ComingAnd this is not a stretch when you imagine the AI infrastructure required to train and operate millions of autonomous vehicles and robots. Jensen believes that robotics will be the next multi-trillion-dollar industry.When Isaac GR00T was unveiled last year as the next generation platform for training humanoid robots using synthetic data, I was once again in awe of Jensen’s long-term vision. Companies like BMW were already using Omniverse “digital twins” to simulate new factory operations, so it only made sense that robots could be trained on synthetic data to make them safe, reliable, and affordable before they ever get near real humans.In Taipei, Huang introduced new tools to speed the development of humanoid robots: the Isaac GR00T-Dreams blueprint will help generate synthetic training data using Omniverse and Cosmos platforms to create neural trajectories, enabling robots to adapt to new environments and tasks.The cross-over here between “agentic AI” and “physical AI” is mind-blowing. Agents are “essentially digital robots,” Huang said, able to “perceive, understand and plan.” To speed up the development of physical robots, the industry needs to train robots in a simulated environment. And NVIDIA has partnered with DeepMind and Disney to build Newton, the world’s most advanced physics training engine for robotics.AI as Electricity X the InternetHere's how the master described the situation himself last night..."AI is now infrastructure, and this infrastructure, just like the internet, just like electricity, needs factories,” Huang said. “These factories are essentially what we build today.”"They’re not data centers of the past. These AI data centers, if you will, are improperly described. They are, in fact, AI factories. You apply energy to it, and it produces something incredibly valuable, and these things are called tokens.”I admit, "tokens" sounds sort of boring and soulless. But they are simply the units of data and information that can be combined exponentially to create new knowledge and intelligent solutions. And when enterprises have NVIDIA power tools like the GB200 NVLink72 exascale supercomputer, they will be creating, combining, and transforming tokens at higher bandwidths than the entire Internet operates.Jensen took some noted pleasure in explaining that math last night when he showed off the NVLink “spine” and said “This moves more traffic than the entire Internet." NVIDIA also announced DGX Cloud Lepton, a global GPU compute marketplace connecting developers to over 10,000 GPUs via partners like CoreWeave (CRWV), Foxconn, and SoftBank. It supports on-demand and long-term compute needs for agentic and physical AI applications for companies and research labs that need access to the power tools without investing heavy capital in their own infrastructure.And yes, Jensen has a vested interest in promoting the AI revolution because it sells more GPUs.But if you think about the world-changing power of AI as just like electricity or the Internet, you realize that if NVIDIA stumbled tomorrow, a thousand other companies would fill the void to capture the potential of what is unfolding in what I call the 5th Industrial Revolution.Recall that it took only a century to go from widespread electricity to the ubiquitous iPhone.Now, by harnessing AI factories, we are about to witness centuries of change in only a decade. And that innovation will add trillions of dollars in productivity, solutions, and intelligence to the global economy every year.Kevin Cook has been intensely following NVIDIA innovations since 2016. He runs the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio where the AI revolution is always the center of discussion -- when he’s not talking about Bitcoin. Just released: Experts distill 7 elite stocks from the current list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buys. They deem these tickers "Most Likely for Early Price Pops." Since 1988, the full list has beaten the market more than 2X over with an average gain of +23.0% per year. So be sure to give these hand picked 7 your immediate attention.

U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in the Oval Office at the White House on May 6, 2025 in Washington, DC. President Donald Trump recently attacked Walmart, the biggest private sector employer in the United States and the largest retailer in the world. Douglas McMillon, CEO of Walmart warned that the Trump Administration’s tariffs could drive cost increases. In response, President Donald Trump took to social media. “Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain. Walmart made BILLIONS OF DOLLARS last year, far more than expected,” seethed the President. “Between Walmart and China they should, as is said, ‘EAT THE TARIFFS,’ and not charge valued customers ANYTHING. I’ll be watching, and so will your customers!!!” Advertisement Advertisement The rebuke comes the very same week that Trump chided revered Apple CEO Tim Cook for manufacturing in India and is merely the latest in a long line of attacks on some of America’s most iconic businesses. So far during his second term, Trump has lashed out at companies such as Amazon, Bank of America, and Boeing. And organizations including AT&T, Harley-Davidson, and Merck have not been immune to Trump’s wrath. However, business leaders are yet to collectively, and definitively, stand up to him. Many completely non-political CEOs saw their firms suffer Trump-initiated stock plunges as they made prudent decisions on how to guide their companies around reckless universal trade sanctions. As Trump’s tariff tantrums threaten to plunge the American economy off a cliff—amidst significant price increases, large layoffs, plummeting business and consumer confidence, and frozen capital investments across industries—CEOs know they need to speak truth to power. But we’ve heard from dozens of Fortune 100 CEOs that they are having a hard time breaking through to President Trump, and conveying the very real dangers facing their businesses, their shareholders, their employees, and their communities. Furthermore, even though 90% of CEOs agree that tariffs are backfiring, they are fearful that if they speak out on their own, they will turn into the next targets of a capricious, vindictive President—as Walmart found out the hard way. Trump fears collective action, and relies on pitting rivals against one another through a divide-and-conquer approach. When business groups stand by in passive inaction when individual CEOs get pummeled, they cede the moral and strategic imperative to Trump’s impulsive whims—ultimately leaving business leaders twisting in the wind. Some trade groups, such as the Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, and the Chamber of Progress—along with other specialized industry groups from the automotive sector to the pharmaceutical industry—have tried to pick up the pieces. However, there are many who wonder why the Business Roundtable, a D.C.-based lobbying firm and association of more than 200 leading CEOs, seems to be missing in action. Indeed, why have they not played a greater role in catalyzing collective action beyond putting out perfunctory statements and purported behind-the-scenes lobbying? This muted response follows other high-profile disappointments from the Business Roundtable in the Trump era, including during his first term. In August 2017, following Trump’s horrifying defense of neo-Nazis who attacked peaceful counterdemonstrators at a rally in Charlottesville, Va., the American business community stood together. The highly-regarded CEO of Merck, Ken Frazier led the charge. In his resignation letter he wrote, “As C.E.O. of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.” The son of a well-read custodian, Frazier grew up in North Philadelphia and became one of few black Fortune 500 chief executives. Trump predictably attacked him, which immediately backfired. Over the next several days, CEOs who had once shunned politics came to Frazier’s vocal defense, including the heads of Walmart, Intel, BlackRock, and IBM. When Frazier exited the President’s Business Advisory Group, he set off a high-profile stampede of exits. Frazier’s peer CEOs walked out in solidarity, triggering the disbanding of the two of President Trump's business advisory councils: the Manufacturing Council and the Strategy and Policy Forum. At the time, many CEOs were frustrated that the Business Roundtable remained relatively passive—especially amidst an era of perceived antitrust politicization, with Trump deputies holding up the Time Warner-AT&T deal on specious grounds for 18 months. Similarly, when in November 2020, President Trump refused to acknowledge his electoral defeat, 22 CEOs, frustrated with inaction by the Business Roundtable, asked me to convene an immediate Zoom call for 100 of the nation’s largest CEOs. All showed up—from pharma to finance, advertising to airlines, consumer goods to consulting. During this “Chamber of Conscience” meeting, these business leaders stood up for the importance of certified elections and also certified the truth—meeting for four sessions through the presidential transition under the banner of Business Leaders for National Unity. That silence of the Business Roundtable is a far cry from why it was created. I personally knew the highly engaged, politically diverse founding generation of Business Roundtable members—ranging from Reginald Jones of GE, Clifton Garvin of Exxon, Irving Shapiro of DuPont, George Weyerhaeuser of his eponymous timberland firm, Al Casey of American Airlines, Roger Smith of GM, Jim Burke of Johnson & Johnson, and Roy Vagelos of Merck—and they set up the Business Roundtable explicitly as a vehicle for collective action for CEOs to tackle public policy issues. As Trump attacks our nation’s most iconic enterprises, the Business Roundtable needs to return to its founding principles, purpose, and moral clarity so that CEOs are not left dangling in the wind all alone and defenseless while Trump picks them off individually. CEOs grappling with how to break through to a mercurial President as they watch their enterprises and the broader economy teeter off the ledge know there is strength in collective action—lest they become Trump’s next target. © 2025 TIME USA, LLC.

Title: AI and Work (Some Predictions)

Time Published: 2025-05-19T17:41:52Z
Full Content:
One of the main topics of this newsletter is the quest to cultivate sustainable and meaningful work in a digital age. Given this objective, it’s hard to avoid confronting the furiously disruptive potentials of AI. I’ve been spending a lot time in recent years, in my roles as a digital theorist and technology journalist, researching and writing about this topic, so it occurred to me that it might be useful to capture in one place all of my current thoughts about the intersection of AI and work. The obvious caveat applies: these predictions will shift — perhaps even substantially — as this inherently unpredictable sector continues to evolve. But here’s my current best stab at what’s going on now, what’s coming soon, and what’s likely just hype. Let’s get to it… When generative AI made its show-stopping debut a few years ago, the smart money was on text production becoming the first killer app. For example, business users, it was thought, would soon outsource much of the tedious communication that makes up their day — meeting summaries, email, reports — into AI tools. A fair amount of this is happening, especially when it comes to lengthy utilitarian communication where the quality doesn’t matter much. I recently attended a men’s retreat, for example, and it was clear that the organizer had used ChatGPT to create the final email summarizing the weekend schedule. And why not? It got the job done and saved some time. It’s becoming increasingly clear, however, that for most people the act of writing in their daily lives isn’t a major problem that needs to be solved, which is capping the predicted ubiquity of this use case. (A survey of internet users found that only around 5.4% had used ChatGPT to help write emails and letters. And this includes the many who maybe experimented with this capability once or twice before moving on.) The application that has instead leaped ahead to become the most exciting and popular use of these tools is smart search. If you have a question, instead of turning to Google you can query a new version of ChatGPT or Claude. These models can search the web to gather information, but unlike a traditional search engine, they can also process the information they find and summarize for you only what you care about. Want the information presented in a particular format, like a spreadsheet or a chart? A high-end model like GPT-4o can do this for you as well, saving even more extra steps. Smart search has become the first killer app of the generative AI era because, like any good killer app, it takes an activity most people already do all the time — typing search queries into web sites — and provides a substantially, almost magically better experience. This feels similar to electronic spreadsheets conquering paper ledger books or email immediately replacing voice mail and fax. I would estimate that around 90% of the examples I see online right now from people exclaiming over the potential of AI are people conducting smart searches. This behavioral shift is appearing in the data. A recent survey conducted by Future found that 27% of US-based respondents had used AI tools such as ChatGPT instead of a traditional search engine. From an economic perspective, this shift matters. Earlier this month, the stock price for Alphabet, the parent company for Google, fell after an Apple executive revealed that Google searches through the Safari web browser had decreased over the previous two months, likely due to the increased use of AI tools. Keep in mind, web search is a massive business, with Google earning over $175 billion from search ads in 2023 alone. In my opinion, becoming the new Google Search is likely the best bet for a company like OpenAI to achieve profitability, even if it’s not as sexy as creating AGI or automating all of knowledge work (more on these applications later). The other major success story for generative AI at the moment is computer programming. Individuals with only rudimentary knowledge of programming languages can now produce usable prototypes of simple applications using tools like ChatGPT, and somewhat more advanced projects with AI-enhanced agent-style helpers like Roo Code. This can be really useful for quickly creating tools for personal use or seeking to create a proof-of-concept for a future product. The tech incubator Y Combinator, for example, made waves when they reported that a quarter of the start-ups in their Winter 2025 batch generated 95% or more of their product’s codebases using AI. How far can this automated coding take us? An academic computer scientist named Judah Diament recently went viral for noting that the ability for novice users to create simple applications isn’t new. There have been systems dedicated to this purpose for over four decades, from HyperCard to VisualBasic to Flash. As he elaborates: “And, of course, they all broke down when anything slightly complicated or unusual needs to be done (as required by every real, financially viable software product or service).” This observation created major backlash — as does most expressions of AI skepticism these days — but Diament isn’t wrong. Despite recent hyperbolic statements by tech leaders, many professional programmers aren’t particularly worried that their jobs can be replicated by language model queries, as so much of what they do is experience-based architecture design and debugging, which are unrelated skills for which we currently have no viable AI solution. Software developers do, however, use AI heavily: not to produce their code from scratch, but instead as helper utilities. Tools like GitHub’s Copilot are integrated directly into the environments in which these developers already work, and make it much simpler to look up obscure library or AI calls, or spit out tedious boilerplate code. The productivity gains here are notable. Programming without help from AI is rapidly becoming increasingly rare. Language model-based AI systems can respond to prompts in pretty amazing ways. But if we focus only on outputs, we underestimate another major source of these models’ value: their ability to understand human language. This so-called natural language processing ability is poised to transform how we use software. There is a push at the moment, for example, led by Microsoft and its Copilot product (not to be confused with GitHub Copilot), to use AI models to provide natural language interfaces to popular software. Instead of learning complicated sequences of clicks and settings to accomplish a task in these programs, you’ll be able to simply ask for what you need; e.g., “Hey Copilot, can you remove all rows from this spreadsheet where the dollar amount in column C is less than $10 dollars then sort everything that remains by the names in Column A? Also, the font is too small, make it somewhat larger.” Enabling novice users to access to expert-level features in existing software will aggregate into huge productivity gains. As a bonus, the models required to understand these commands don’t have to be nearly as massive and complicated as the current cutting-edge models that the big AI companies use to show off their technology. Indeed, they might be small enough to run locally on devices, making them vastly cheaper and more efficient to operate. Don’t sleep on this use case. Like smart search, it’s also not as sexy as AGI or full automation, but I’m increasingly convinced that within the next half-decade or so, informally-articulated commands are going to emerge as one of the dominate interfaces to the world of computation. One of the more attention-catching storylines surrounding AI at the moment is the imminent arrival of so-called agents which will automate more and more of our daily work, especially in the knowledge sectors once believed to be immune from machine encroachment. Recent reports imply that agents are a major part of OpenAI’s revenue strategy for the near future. The company imagines business customers paying up to $20,000 a month for access to specialized bots that can perform key professional tasks. It’s the projection of this trend that led Elon Musk to recently quip: “If you want to do a job that’s kinda like a hobby, you can do a job. But otherwise, AI and the robots will provide any goods and services that you want.” But progress in creating these agents has recently slowed. To understand why requires a brief snapshot of the current state of generative AI technology… Not long ago, there was a belief in so-called scaling laws that argued, roughly speaking, that as you continued to increase the size of language models, their abilities would continue to rapidly increase. For a while this proved true: GPT-2 was much better than the original GPT, GPT-3 was much better than GPT-2, and GPT-4 was a big improvement on GPT-3. The hope was that by continuing to scale these models, you’d eventually get to a system so smart and capable that it would achieve something like AGI, and could be used as the foundation for software agents to automate basically any conceivable task. More recently, however, these scaling laws have begun to falter. Companies continue to invest massive amounts of capital in building bigger models, trained on ever-more GPUs crunching ever-larger data sets, but the performance of these models stopped leaping forward as much as they had in the past. This is why the long-anticipated GPT-5 has not yet been released, and why, just last week, Meta announced they were delaying the release of their newest, biggest model, as its capabilities were deemed insufficiently better than its predecessor. In response to the collapse of the scaling laws, the industry has increasingly turned its attention in another direction: tuning existing models using reinforcement learning. Say, for example, you want to make a model that is particularly good at math. You pay a bunch of math PhDs $100 an hour to come up with a lot of math problems with step-by-step solutions. You then take an existing model, like GPT-4, and feed it these problems one-by-one, using reinforcement learning techniques to tell it exactly where it’s getting certain steps in its answers right or wrong. Over time, this tuned model will get better at solving this specific type of problem. This technique is why OpenAI is now releasing multiple, confusingly-named models, each seemingly optimized for different specialties. These are the result of distinct tunings. They would have preferred, of course, to simply produce a GPT-5 model that could do well on all of these tasks, but that hasn’t worked out as they hoped. This tuning approach will continue to develop interesting tools, but it will be much more piecemeal and hit-or-miss than what was anticipated when we still believed in scaling laws. Part of the difficulty is that this approach depends on finding the right data for each task you want to tackle. Certain problems, like math, computer programming, and logical reasoning, are well-suited for tuning as they can be described by pairs of prompts and correct answers. But this is not the case for many other business activities, which can be esoteric and bespoke to a given context. This means many useful activities will remain un-automatable by language model agents into the foreseeable future. I once said that the real Turing Test for our current age is an AI system that can successfully empty my email inbox, a goal that requires the mastery of any number of complicated tasks. Unfortunately for all of us, this is not a test we’re poised to see passed any time soon. The Free Press recently published an article titled “AI Will Change What it Means to Be Human. Are We Ready?”. It summarized a common sentiment that has been feverishly promoted by Silicon Valley in recent years: that AI is on the cusp of changing everything in unfathomably disruptive ways. As the article argues: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman asserted in a recent talk that GPT-5 will be smarter than all of us. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei described the powerful AI systems to come as “a country of geniuses in a data center.” These are not radical predictions. They are nearly here. But here’s the thing: these are radical predictions. Many companies tried to build the equivalent of the proposed GPT-5 and found that continuing to scale up the size of their models isn’t yielding the desired results. As described above, they’re left tuning the models they already have for specific tasks that are well-described by synthetic data sets. This can produce cool demos and products, but it’s not a route to a singular “genius” system that’s smarter than humans in some general sense. Indeed, if you look closer at the rhetoric of the AI prophets in recent months, you’ll see a creeping awareness that, in a post-scaling law world, they no longer have a convincing story for how their predictions will manifest. A recent Nick Bostrom video, for example, which (true to character) predicts Superintelligence might happen in less than two years (!), adds the caveat that this outcome will require key “unlocks” from the industry, which is code for we don’t know how to build systems that achieve this goal, but, hey, maybe someone will figure it out! (The AI centrist Gary Marcus subsequently mocked Bostrom by tweeting: “for all we know, we could be just one unlock and 3-6 weeks away from levitation, interstellar travel, immortality, or room temperature superconductors, or perhaps even all four!”) Similarly, if you look closer at AI 2027, the splashy new doomsday manifesto which argues that AI might eliminate humanity as early as 2030, you won’t find a specific account of what type of system might be capable of such feats of tyrannical brilliance. The authors instead sidestep the issue by claiming that within the next year or so, the language models we’re tuning to solve computer programming tasks will somehow come up with, on their own, code that implements breakthrough new AI technology that mere humans cannot understand. This is an incredible claim. (What sort of synthetic data set do they imagine being able to train a language model to crack the secrets of human-level intelligence?) It’s the technological equivalent of looking at the Wright Brother’s Flyer in 1903 and thinking, “well, if they could figure this out so quickly, we should have space travel cracked by the end of the decade.” The current energized narratives around AGI and Superintelligence seem to be fueled by a convergence of three factors: (1) the fact that scaling laws did apply for the first few generations of language models, making it easy and logical to imagine them continuing to apply up the exponential curve of capabilities in the years ahead; (2) demos of models tuned to do well on specific written tests, which we tend to intuitively associate with intelligence; and (3) tech leaders pounding furiously on the drums of sensationalism, knowing they’re rarely held to account on their predictions. But here’s the reality: We are not currently on a trajectory to genius systems. We might figure this out in the future, but the “unlocks” required will be sufficiently numerous and slow to master that we’ll likely have plenty of clear signals and warning along the way. So, we’re not out of the woods on these issues, but at the same time, humanity is not going to be eliminated by the machines in 2030 either. In the meantime, the breakthroughs that are happening, especially in the world of work, should be both exciting and worrisome enough on their own for now. Let’s grapple with those first. #### For more of my thoughts on AI, check out my New Yorker archive and my podcast (in recent months, I often discuss AI in the third act of the show). For more on my thoughts on technology and work more generally, check out my recent books on the topic: Slow Productivity, A World Without Email, and Deep Work. I agree with natural language commands to be an awesome use-case that people are sleeping on! I have two examples of messing around with ai where I realized if they just got a little bit better at this, it would change everything. First, ai can already identify information in photos. I uploaded a picture of myself to ChatGPT and it started describing how I look. That was a neat trick. But once you can upload screenshots and it can read, transcribe, or act on every piece of information in the photo? Hey here is a screenshot of my spreadsheet, tell me how to fix it. Hey here is a screenshot of a web design that I like, please convert it into code for me. Second, using Cursor.ai IDE, I can ask the agents how to use the program and where things are in the program and of course it can write code, save files, delete files, make directories, prompt commands, and be a search engine all in one. I didn’t know where some of the stuff in the program was and it just told me where it was. I didn’t know how everything worked in the program and it just told me how it works. And then of course it also codes and makes commands for everything I ask. So imagine a future where in every single program you use on the computer, you can quickly screenshot it and ask how to do something or how to fix something and it tells you exactly how to do it, or just does it for you. Now I feel like all the talk about real agents is kind of hyped up? Like just because my IDE can do IDE tasks for me people seem to think agents are going to do my taxes for me and answer all my emails for me automatically. But I think that’s kind of just a dream. “Agent” seems to just be the new term for a long complicated process that had been automated. But I bet instead of the “agent” figuring all that out for itself, it’s going to happen the old fashioned way, where a bunch of engineers work very hard to automate a task. You know, like we’ve been doing for decades already. The photo analysis example is a great one. I think of that as part of the general idea of a super search, where now, the sources for its answer isn’t just the web, but also other things, like photos, or files on your local machine, etc. Sort of like a Google for everything which is, it seems to me, likely where the bulk of the money is actually waiting in the AI race. I agree that superintelligence in 2030 is very unlikely, and it’s good to communicate that. But I think superintelligence in 2040 is totally in the territory of “maybe, maybe not, who knows”, and by not emphasizing or mentioning that, you’re burying the lede. Anything that humans, and groups of humans, and societies of humans, can do, can also be done by code running on chips. After all, the human brain is a machine that runs an algorithm. No one knows the algorithm, but as soon as someone figures it out, they could run it on chips, like any other algorithm. Then we’d get AIs that can autonomously found and run billion-dollar companies, that can invent science and technology and language from scratch, and all the other crazy sci-fi-sounding stuff. And there could be hundreds of millions of such AIs, thinking much faster than humans, etc. Why do I say that “superintelligence by 2040” is in “maybe, maybe not, who knows” territory? Well, LLMs didn’t exist as recently as 2018. The entirety of deep learning was a backwater as recently as 2012. You can say that LLMs are not on the path to superintelligence, and as it happens, I’ll agree with you. But 15 years is evidently more than enough time for the AI research community to have pivoted to something entirely different and poured billions of dollars, and tens of thousands of person-years, into polishing and optimizing it. As an analogy, suppose a giant fleet of alien ships were definitely due to arrive on Earth at some point, but we didn’t know when, and 15-40 years seemed like a reasonable guess. But some people were going around saying the aliens would definitely arrive in <5 years. Then it would be good to correct those people! But it would be bad to imply that therefore we shouldn’t be thinking about and preparing for the alien invasion right now. The death of Moore’s Law (measuring transistors) was the birth of LLM scaling / virtual quantity (measuring virtual parameters). The death of LLM scaling / virtual quantity will be virtual quality. The manifestation of the thing that is manifesting has been going on for 70+ years and there have been dozens of barriers that were said to be impassible, but the manifestation has always found a new thing. Now that the manifestation has manifested the ability to create PhD’s out of thin air to work for its manifestation, now is when you are going to doubt it ?? Humanity is a small thing, and the physical universe is a shallow one. Now some wave from a bigger pond is washing into ours. Sadhguru has a nice take on this current affair https://youtu.be/uGwKU1jaDsY?si=J29PtlB8BuB8iTnx&t=2525 What I am most anxious to see play out is how the next generation of youth engage with Ai tools. The kids who are under 12 today, how will they perform in a world of automation having never known anything other than Ai ubiquity? As a parallel example, take social media. When Facebook launched, a generation of Xennials and first-wave Millennials initially used it as a tool to complement their pre-existing social lives (think wall posts and group events). In other words, when a generation of people with pre-established social skills adopt a new comms tech/device, they see it as complementary to their social world. They lived through the transition. It’s not until later that we see Gen Z struggling with social media, struggling to establish social skills through the devices and platforms. Why? Because Gen Z didn’t grow up in a world without them. They didn’t understand that those social apps were never meant to create social skills and connections, but only to complement the skills and connections you already had. So going back to Ai, many of the people adopting Ai tools and praising their capabilities–those people already had critical thinking skills and domain expertise in the first place! They are using it to complement their pre-existing work! What is completely unpredictable is how the untrained, unknowledgeable generation of youth coming up next will be able to perform in a world in which whatever skills and knowledge they manage to pick up in school are basically deemed low value because, well, “Ai can already do that”.

Title: The 6 Groceries Smart Meal Planners Always Buy in Bulk
URL: https://www.cnet.com/home/kitchen-and-household/the-6-groceries-smart-meal-planners-always-buy-in-bulk/

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement We asked experts about the best foods to stock up on to save money and trips to the supermarket. We spoke with a meal planning expert to find out which foods are smartest to buy in bulk. Grocery prices continue to be a major concern for many Americans. A recent survey by CNET confirms that rising food costs remain the top source of sticker shock—and I can relate. Over time, we've explored various strategies to stretch your grocery budget, from using food-saving apps like Flashfood, to comparing name brands versus store brands, and even asking whether shopping at Trader Joe's really saves money. Another tried-and-true strategy? Buying in bulk. Stocking up on everyday staples at warehouse stores like Costco can lead to significant savings. In fact, after crunching the numbers, I found that the average person could potentially save around $1,000 a year by buying in bulk. But bulk shopping isn't always simple. You'll need to think about storage space, shelf life and whether you'll actually use what you buy. As Mary Ann Kelley, the meal planning expert behind AddSaltandServe, puts it: "Shoppers can ask themselves three questions: A great deal isn't a deal if you end up throwing half of it away. Read more: Here's What an Expert Told Me About Food Expiration Dates Accepting that bulk shopping is generally a financially savvy move, and given the considerations posed above, I asked a few shopping and meal prepping experts what the best foods are to buy in bulk. Here they are: Beans are packed with protein and they're the perfect candidates to buy in bulk. "Canned beans are a pantry staple and a smart bulk purchase, thanks to their long shelf life and affordability at warehouse stores," says Kristen Markel, the bulk shopping expert behind Warehouse Wanderer. Beans also are incredibly versatile for food prep, as they can fit into just about any meal, including dessert. (Black bean brownies are worth your time.) Plus they have real staying power. "Properly stored in a cool, dark place, canned beans can last up to five years," says Markel. An eight-pack of canned beans at Costco retails for about $8, bringing the cost per can to under a dollar, and the cost per serving to about 30 cents. If you've got the time and wherewithal for dried beans, the savings are even bigger. A 10-pound bag of black beans costs around $18, for a cost per serving of less than 25 cents. If freezer space allows, fish is far more affordable when you buy in bulk. Meat and seafood in the freezer section are often frozen right after harvesting, so they can still be very high in quality. You can also process proteins bought fresh and freeze them yourself, and either way certain types of meat and seafood can stay in your freezer for up to a year. (This FoodKeeper app from the US Department of Health and Human Services is a handy guide to how long you can store various foods.) "Shoppers can often find bulk-packaged fresh and frozen meat at a better price, or they may stock up on bulk amounts of normal packages of meat when they are on sale," says Kelley. It's possible to have a bulk shopping mindset even if you don't have access to a traditional bulk store. "Meat bought in bulk at a good price can be frozen as is, but shoppers can also save space -- and make dinner prep less stressful -- by cooking meats ahead that will be used later in cooked form in recipes. For instance, shoppers can cook bulk packages of ground beef or chicken when they bring them home, and then they can use the cooked meat for recipes like tacos, chili, and chicken soup." Butter is more shelf-stable than most people think, making it a good candidate for buying in bulk. We typically think primarily of the pantry or freezer when it comes to buying in bulk, but "don't overlook dairy, especially butter," says Markel. "Butter freezes beautifully and can last up to a year in the freezer." Costco's Kirkland Signature butter is considered one of its most economical offerings among fans, around $18 (in my region) for 4 pounds, which doesn't come with an overwhelming space requirement in the freezer. At my nearest grocery store, the same amount of butter costs twice that much. Boxed pasta lasts for up to two years. Boxed pasta may require some storage space, but if you're able to bulk up on it, it has the longevity to make it worthwhile. "Dry pasta is another bulk-buy winner, with an unopened shelf life of up to two years," says Markel. "For even longer storage, consider vacuum-sealing pasta to maintain freshness well beyond its typical expiration." (Here are the best vacuum sealers we've tested.) Eight pounds of Barilla penne cost $13 at Costco, which results in a savings of over a dollar per pound compared with buying individual boxes at my local supermarket. Italian American families, or carb lovers, take note. Not all spices are good to buy in bulk, but whole peppercorns keep their pep for a while. Items with the highest prices per ounce can be prime candidates for bulk shopping, on a case-by-case basis depending on longevity. "Specialty items that cost significantly less on sale can be worth buying in bulk, but only if they will be used," says Kelley. "A good example of this is expensive spices that might be used frequently, like quality black peppercorns," she says. Other specialty items that can be pricey but can be stockpiled when they're on sale include saffron, tinned fish and even caviar -- which can actually be frozen when unopened and kept for up to a year. If you want to get the most bang for your buck, buy paper towels and other household products in bulk. So long as you're bulk shopping, here's a bonus nonfood item. "Paper products are among the items that are less expensive to buy in bulk packaging, especially toilet paper and paper towels," says Kelley." "Since paper products do not need to be stored in a climate controlled area, utility spaces, attics and other unfinished spaces are fine for storage, making it easier to make room for them." If you have a paper towel dependency, as I do, consider a 12-pack of Kirkland paper towels for $23, versus single rolls that can be as much as $3 and up.

Title: AvalonBay braces for signs of trouble in DC rental market

Let Multifamily Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. CEO Ben Schall also said the softness in the REIT’s expansion markets could provide opportunities to add assets. On AvalonBay Communities' first-quarter earnings call earlier this month, CEO Ben Schall wasted little time before addressing some of the volatility in the current economy. “Recognizing that we are in a period of heightened uncertainty regarding the impact of policy actions on the broader economy, I want to start by emphasizing that we are very well positioned, given our portfolio makeup, our unique set of strategic capabilities and our preeminent balance sheet, to continue to deliver superior earnings growth for shareholders,” Schall said on the REIT’s earnings call. AVB, whose home is in the Washington, D.C., suburb of Arlington, Virginia, has a bird’s-eye view of the localized impacts of the Trump administration's policies, specifically those limiting federal funding and mandating government layoffs. AVB Chief Operating Officer Sean Breslin said the D.C. Metro area continues to perform as expected, and occupancy and availability align with last year's levels. Lease breaks have also fallen year over year over the previous few months. But there are some signs of trouble. “Over the last few months, we've started to hear from prospects and residents about the level of uncertainty in the job market, but to date, the velocity of activity and pricing in the region has not been impacted,” Breslin said. “About 12% of our resident base is employed by the government, so we're certainly monitoring the pace of leasing, renewal acceptance and other metrics very closely.” AVB covered more than just its home market in its earnings release and call. Here’s more on what’s happening in its established and expansion regions. AVB is projecting that new deliveries will fall to 80 basis points of existing stock in 2026, which is roughly 45,000 units across its coastal established markets, according to Schall. That level of new deliveries hasn’t been seen in 20 years. “Our established regions are benefiting from several tailwinds, including strong occupancy and very limited new deliveries this year and in 2026, which should support healthy pricing power,” Schall said. In Seattle, return-to-office mandates from Amazon, Microsoft and others; relatively strong job growth; and limited new supply in suburban markets have helped AVB. The REIT’s properties are more than 96% occupied across the Northern California region, which is about 50 basis points higher than last year. “Northern California, specifically San Jose and San Francisco, continues to improve and at a pace that's slightly ahead of our original expectations,” Breslin said. “Performance in San Jose picked up at the end of last year, but San Francisco really started to gain momentum at the beginning of this year.” As other REITs have noted, Los Angeles is more challenging. While the metro’s availability and occupancy are in line with last year's, according to Breslin, AVB’s year-to-date asking rent growth is below historical norms at just 3%. “We'll need to see better job growth in LA, which has been weak recently, to experience stronger performance throughout the remainder of this year,” Breslin said. Unlike its established regions, supply continues to be a concern in AVB’s coastal markets. “While we are pleased with the portfolios we have curated in our expansion regions, we do expect these markets to continue to face operating softness until deliveries decline and market occupancies rebuild,” Schall said. “On the flip side, this softness provides opportunities as we execute on our longer-term portfolio optimization goals, selectively increasing our allocation to our chosen expansion regions.” In Q1, AVB announced it acquired eight properties in Texas from entities associated with Little Rock, Arkansas-based owner BSR Real Estate Investment Trust. The deal closed last week. “These are all relatively simple walk-up garden assets in suburban submarkets in our target geographies,” Matthew Birenbaum, AvalonBay’s chief investment officer, said on the earnings call. “And that doesn't happen all that often. So, mostly what we've done until this point has been buying kind of one-offs, and that's still kind of the base case assumption.” Like other trades, AVB sold assets from its established regions and redeployed that capital to the expansion regions in the Texas deals. SOURCE: AvalonBay “You think about where rents in these markets have traveled over the last three years,” Breslin said. “You look at the basis at which we can enter these markets and the Texas transaction being a good example of that at $230,000 a door, and we're thinking about long-term both earnings and value creation.” AVB will also continue to grow from developments with $3 billion of projects match funded and construction costs substantially locked in. “As these projects lease up this year and next, they will produce a meaningful incremental stream of earnings that is unique to AvalonBay,” Schall said.

Title: Nvidia isn’t just building AI chips — it’s building an AI-powered world
URL: https://qz.com/nvidia-computex-2025-jensen-huang-ai-taiwan-dgx-spark-1851781267
Time Published: 2025-05-19T15:28:00Z
Full Content:
If you missed Nvidia’s (NVDA) keynote at Computex 2025, here’s the short version: AI is no longer just a tool — it’s the infrastructure of the future. Robots, desktops, smart cities, physics engines, and even national computing grids — all of it, Nvidia says, will be built on artificial intelligence. Speaking in Taipei at Asia’s largest electronics expo, CEO Jensen Huang laid out a sweeping vision of the company’s future — one where Nvidia isn’t just enabling AI, it’s helping build a world run by it. Leading the announcements was the DGX Spark, a compact AI supercomputer built for individual developers, researchers, and students. Think of it as a desktop-sized version of Nvidia’s massive Blackwell-based systems, with enough power to train and fine-tune large AI models locally — no cloud access required. It’s the plug-and-play engine for what Huang called “AI-native” users — those who want high-performance AI development at their fingertips. Major OEMs such as Dell (DELL), ASUS, Lenovo, MSI, and Gigabyte are already lined up to offer Spark systems tailored for different segments of the market. That’s just one node in Nvidia’s broader push toward what Huang calls “AI factories” — purpose-built computing environments where massive amounts of data are processed and AI-based systems are created, refined, and deployed. To support this expansive vision, Nvidia launched something Huang said was “very special” and “one incredible ingredient” that has been missing: NVLink Fusion, an initiative that allows its GPUs to work seamlessly with third-party CPUs and custom AI chips. That means companies such as Qualcomm (QCOM), Fujitsu, Marvell (MRVL), and Alchip Technologies can plug into Nvidia’s ecosystem — a notable shift for a company long known for its tightly integrated stacks. “I’ll let all of our partners price it for themselves, but one thing’s for sure: Everybody can have one for Christmas,” Huang said. But this wasn’t just a cloud-computing conversation. It was one about bringing AI into the physical world. Nvidia doubled down on “physical AI” — the idea that machines should understand and interact with the laws of the real world. Huang talked about Isaac Groot N1 (announced in March), which is a foundational model for robotics that gives humanoid robots the ability to reason, plan, and perceive their surroundings. “The age of generalist robotics has arrived with breakthroughs in mechatronics, physical AI, and embedded computing — just in time as labor shortages limit worldwide industrial growth,” Huang said. One challenge in robotics today is data scarcity, especially high-quality, physical interaction data. Nvidia hopes to answer this problem with Cosmos, a photorealistic simulator that creates synthetic data by observing human behavior in virtual environments. Isaac Groot N1, combined with Cosmos, means developers could now create massive amounts of training data in virtual worlds before rolling out systems in the real one. Developers can now use Groot Dreams — a tool built on Cosmos — to create “future world states,” Huang said, by prompting the model with new tasks and images. This makes it possible to simulate millions of training scenarios before deploying robots in the real world. To help ground those dreams in physical reality, Nvidia will use the recently announced Newton, an open-source physics engine built in collaboration with Google DeepMind (GOOGL) and Disney Research (DIS) that will be open sourced in July. It’s designed to help AI systems understand real-world dynamics such as gravity, collisions, and torque — bridging the gap between code and physical context. “It’s incredible what it can do,” Huang said. “It’s completely GPU accelerated. It’s differentiable, so you could learn from experience. It is incredibly high fidelity.” Meanwhile, Nvidia is planting deeper roots in Asia with Nvidia Constellation, a new AI-focused hub in Taipei’s Beitou Shilin Science Park. It’s a strategic play — tapping into Taiwan’s world-class semiconductor ecosystem while deepening Nvidia’s presence in the global AI supply chain. Taipei’s mayor, Chiang Wan-an, attended Huang’s keynote and later told reporters that the city fully supports Nvidia’s plans and is ready to offer whatever help is needed. One of the most strategically significant announcements came near the close of Huang’s keynote: a joint effort to build a national AI supercomputer in Taiwan. Nvidia will partner with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) (TSMC), Foxconn, and the Taiwanese government to create a cutting-edge AI system for the island. This project aims to integrate AI deeply into urban infrastructure, transforming cities such as Taipei into smart ecosystems powered by advanced computing. The initiative underscores Nvidia’s goal of embedding AI — and thus, its products — into the fabric of daily life, from autonomous vehicles to intelligent public services. Huang’s overall message was unmistakable: AI is no longer just software. It’s infrastructure. It’s automation. It’s everywhere. And Nvidia wants to not only build just the silicon — it wants to build but the systems, the software, and the global footprint to power it all.

May 19, 2025 08:42 ET | Source: Bleichmar Fonti & Auld Bleichmar Fonti & Auld NEW YORK, May 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws. If you invested in Elevance you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/elevance-health-inc. Investors have until July 11, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Elevance common stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and is captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-0092. Why was Elevance Sued for Securities Fraud? Elevance provides health insurance plans. This includes contracting with states to administer Medicaid benefits. States routinely review Medicaid eligibility, but during COVID, the federal government paused this process. The pause ended in 2023, and states resumed redetermining Medicaid eligibility. During the relevant period, Elevance represented that it was closely monitoring the cost trends associated with the redetermination process and that the rates Elevance was negotiating were sufficient to address the risk profiles of those patients staying on Medicaid. As alleged, in truth, the redeterminations caused a significant increase in the acuity and utilization of Elevance’s Medicaid members. What’s more, the shift occurred to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance’s rate negotiations or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed On July 17, 2024, Elevance stated that it was now “expecting second-half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $32.21 per share, or nearly 6%, from $553.14 per share on July 16, 2024, to $520.93 per share on July 17, 2024. Then, on October 17, 2024, Elevance announced its Q3 2024 financial results, revealing that its missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” On this news, the price of Elevance stock declined $52.61 per share, or nearly 11%, from $496.96 per share on October 16, 2024, to $444.35 per share on October 17, 2024.

Title: Big Tech's great flattening is happening because it's out of options

Welcome back! In case you missed it, our new newsletter, Tech Memo, written by the great Alistair Barr, launched on Friday. Check out the first edition here. And if you aren't already, subscribe here. In today's big story, we're looking at Big Tech's obsession with cutting out middle managers and flattening their orgs. What's on deck Markets: When companies like Facebook and Zillow IPO, they turn to this man Tech: How one of the hottest coding startups almost died. Business: Gen Z is turning to blue-collar jobs. But first, no longer stuck in the middle. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Technology can quickly become outdated, but it's a job title in tech that's an endangered species: the middle manager. Big Tech is flattening its ranks to thin out layers of management in a bid to reduce bureaucracy, writes Emma Cosgrove, Tim Paradis, Eugene Kim, and Ashley Stewart. Middle managers have had to keep their heads on a swivel for a while. At the end of last year, BI's workplace expert Aki Ito detailed Corporate America falling out of love with the role. But the tech industry has taken the trend into overdrive, as is often the case. From Microsoft to Intel and Amazon, companies are shedding managers to make themselves as quick and lean as possible. The biggest immediate impact of flattening orgs is managers overseeing more workers. Some argue that will limit micromanagement. Others say you'll burn out the managers who are left behind. Big Tech is willing to take its chances, though. As Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said last fall: "I hate bureaucracy." "The goal again is to allow us to have higher ownership and to move more quickly," Jassy added. Big Tech's middle-management purge speaks to a larger trend: Let the stars shine and get rid of anyone else. Part of tech companies' efficiency push is to identify top performers and weed out underachievers. With that approach, you could argue there is less of a need for managers. No weak links in the chain means managers don't have to do as much hand-holding. Get out of the way and let your top performers do what they do best. This isn't a foolproof strategy, though. Someone being extremely capable at their job doesn't always correlate with them being an easy employee to manage. In fact, sometimes the opposite can be true. But what other options do these tech giants have? The pressure from startups like OpenAI and Anthropic is undeniable. Their smaller size also gives them a massive leg up to move quickly. And when it comes to AI, speed is the name of the game. Meanwhile, middle managers seem to only be slowing companies down. 1. Trump's "Big, beautiful bill" could cause some big chaos. Market pros say the president's tax bill would add $4 trillion to the US deficit, stoking mayhem in the bond market. That means another Trump vs. bond market showdown could be headed our way. 2. Bankers tell startups wanting to go public: "Go, go, go." Startups like Hinge Health put their IPO plans on hold when Trump introduced sweeping tariffs. Now that the stock market has recovered, bankers are telling companies to go public while they still can. 3. This "hick from Ohio" is a big deal for IPOs. Pat Healy could be the forefather of getting stock exchanges to compete for the right to get a company to list with them. From free Davos advertising to NFL star appearances, here's how Healy lands companies major marketing perks. 1. "Appstinence" is a virtue. Raised in the age of the smartphone, a growing cohort of people, mostly millennials and Gen Zers, are opting for dumb tech instead. As the evidence of our collective phone addiction adds up, even tech lovers are embracing the digital detox movement. 2. How Silicon Valley's favorite startup came back from the edge of disaster. StackBlitz was at death's door when Anthropic released its AI model Sonnet 3.5 in 2024. That led StackBlitz to create Bolt.new, a product that could write code based on prompts written in English — and the company's gold mine. BI's Alistair Barr has the full story. 3. Is AI coming for teachers? Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn thinks so. On a recent podcast appearance, he told venture capitalist Sarah Guo that schools will still be necessary in an AI-driven future — but mostly just for childcare. He thinks AI will do the actual teaching. 1. Gen Z is dyeing white collars blue. The cost of college is skyrocketing, and the white-collar job market is unstable. That's led many young people to turn to trades instead, which can offer six-figure salaries and have a high demand for workers. 2. Selling a merger to Trump? MAGA-ify it. Cable giant Charter is merging with Cox, posing a bigger rival for Comcast. The merger still needs the green light from the Trump administration, and it seems like Charter is leaning into pro-American rhetoric to get it, BI's Peter Kafka writes. 3. LA investor Jessica Mah is in a legal battle with DGV investor Justin Caldbeck and two ex-employees. In a lawsuit, Mah has accused Caldbeck of sexually harassing her, which he denies. The lawsuits against Mah, meanwhile, accuse her of misusing company funds, harassment, and age discrimination, BI's Rob Price reports.

Title: US-Sino AI Rivalry Enters ‘Competitive Coexistence’ After Tariff Truce

ByVivian Toh ByVivian Toh, Contributor. The U.S. and China strike a 90-day tariff agreement. (Photo by Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty ... More Images) Wall Street and Shanghai markets may have cheered the U.S.-China tariff détente, but beneath the surface optimism lies a profound strategic recalibration of the world’s most consequential technological rivalry. The May 12 agreement, a 90-day suspension of escalating tariffs, has seen U.S. duties on Chinese imports plummet dramatically, from an aggressive 145% down to a more moderate 30%, while China reciprocated by reducing tariffs on American goods from 125% to 10%. This temporary peace, however, signals not an end to hostilities but a new phase defined by careful maneuvering and intense strategic rivalry, aptly termed "competitive coexistence." Influential Chinese commentator Ren Yi, widely known as Chairman Rabbit, encapsulated Beijing’s view by describing the tariff truce as a "beautiful counterattack." In a widely circulated WeChat post, Ren portrayed the agreement as a pragmatic victory against the Trump administration’s "impulsive paper-tiger tactics," underscoring China's long-term strategic acumen and disciplined approach in contrast to America's more reactive stance. His narrative resonated deeply with domestic Chinese audiences, reflecting Beijing’s confidence in its strategic positioning amid ongoing geopolitical tensions. Yet, beyond political narratives, global financial markets have demonstrated notable resilience. After the initial tariff announcement on April 9 triggered widespread anxiety, markets had already begun to recalibrate expectations by the time the two nations officially announced the truce. From April 9 to May 12, technology stocks notably benefited from investor confidence in the resilience and adaptability of major firms. Alibaba led the charge with a remarkable 25.5% rise in its share price, followed closely by Tencent with a 17.3% increase and Baidu’s 13.3% gain. U.S. tech giants also shared in the relief rally: Meta’s shares surged by 9.2% and Apple’s by 6%, although Alphabet’s stock experienced a modest decline, reflecting lingering investor concerns about its international regulatory exposure and vulnerabilities in key global markets. Share price of U.S. and China tech giants before and after the tariff truce. This market adjustment represents more than mere optimism — it highlights a deeper shift in investor psychology. Geopolitical tensions are no longer seen as isolated threats but strategic inflection points demanding corporate agility and adaptability. Investors increasingly expect firms to navigate geopolitical uncertainties effectively, turning potential disruptions into opportunities for strategic recalibration. Central to this recalibration is the intense race for artificial intelligence dominance. American companies like Meta and Microsoft are vigorously expanding AI capabilities through advanced cloud services, partnerships and product innovations. Meta's strong growth reflects increasing demand for its AI-powered ad tools and content creation services, which have significantly enhanced user targeting and engagement. Microsoft, meanwhile, continues to integrate OpenAI’s cutting-edge technologies into its Azure cloud platform, seeking to set global standards in enterprise AI solutions. Chinese tech giants are equally aggressive, accelerating development of self-contained AI ecosystems in response to tightening U.S. restrictions, including export controls on advanced AI chips and critical technologies. Tencent, for instance, reported robust financial results in Q1 2025, with revenues climbing 13% year-on-year to RMB 180 billion ($25.1 billion). This growth was fueled primarily by its Value-Added Services segment, including blockbuster games such as Honour of Kings and Delta Force, as well as AI-driven marketing enhancements on platforms like Weixin Search. Despite substantial investments in AI, Tencent managed an 18% rise in operating profits to RMB 69.3 billion ($9.7 billion), underlining its capacity to balance strategic investments with profitability. Meanwhile, China’s strategic pivot toward domestic technological innovation has been particularly evident in AI infrastructure development. Initiatives like Baidu’s PaddlePaddle and Alibaba’s ModelScope illustrate a determined push to build sovereign technological stacks capable of competing independently of foreign technologies. The broader geopolitical context, especially U.S. export controls and the rescinding of the Biden-era AI Diffusion Rule — replaced with targeted restrictions — has galvanized China’s resolve to innovate autonomously. The strategic realignment also underscores broader shifts in global supply chains, with U.S. companies actively diversifying manufacturing and production away from China to hedge against future geopolitical shocks. Apple epitomizes this approach through its accelerated expansion in alternative manufacturing hubs like India and Vietnam — a strategy known as “China+1.” However, despite these tactical shifts, China’s entrenched role in global manufacturing, bolstered by its extensive supplier networks, skilled workforce and manufacturing efficiencies, renders complete decoupling unrealistic and economically disruptive. Capital and talent flows have similarly been reshaped by geopolitical tensions. Chinese firms now face increasing obstacles when attempting to access foreign investment or public markets. Heightened scrutiny of researchers’ visas and the politicization of academic collaborations have further complicated talent acquisition. Nevertheless, both China and the U.S. continue to significantly ramp up domestic investments. The U.S. CHIPS and Science Act channels substantial federal funds into semiconductor and AI research, aiming to safeguard technological leadership. China mirrors these efforts with extensive initiatives bolstering technology zones, intensifying public-private partnerships and prioritizing STEM education nationwide. The resulting environment is one of strategic caution combined with sustained competitive aggression — a delicate equilibrium captured by the term "competitive coexistence." Companies must adeptly navigate a dual reality of collaboration and competition, reflecting a fragmented yet interconnected global technology landscape. In this new paradigm, the defining contest between the U.S. and China transcends tariff skirmishes. Instead, the battlefield extends to innovation, scalability and influence over international technological standards. This truce thus provides not only temporary economic relief but also a moment of clarity, spotlighting the relentless drive of both superpowers toward long-term technological supremacy. The markets, now more accustomed to such dynamics, perceive geopolitical frictions as persistent realities that demand continuous strategic foresight and adaptability.

Title: Why META Stock Is A Prime Choice In The AI Boom

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CANADA - 2025/05/18: In this photo illustration, the Meta AI logo is seen displayed on a smartphone ... More screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Question: Why pay a premium of 35 times earnings for Microsoft stock when Meta stock is available at 25 times earnings? This seems particularly questionable when considering the following three key factors: Meta isn't exactly a safe haven investment. To illustrate this, consider how Meta's stock has reacted during past market shocks: it experienced a significant 77% decline during the 2022 inflation shock, compared to a peak-to-trough drop of only 25% for the S&P 500. Similarly, during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Meta’s stock fell by 35%, while the S&P 500 saw a comparable decline of 34%. These instances suggest that Meta is not a particularly "safe" stock. Also, see Buy or Sell Meta Stock. Furthermore, it has already seen substantial gains this year, rising 7%, and a remarkable 32% in just one month, climbing from around $485 on April 21st to $640 currently. On the other hand, for a more balanced perspective, consider the Trefis High Quality strategy, which has outperformed the market with over 91% returns since its inception, as demonstrated in the HQ performance metrics. Confident in the long-term potential of the AI revolution? Meta Platforms presents a compelling investment opportunity due to its unique position. Unlike companies solely focused on AI development, Meta integrates AI across its massive and growing user base. The daily active people (DAP) across Meta's family of apps have grown by an impressive 16%, from 2.95 billion in 2022 to 3.43 billion currently. This vast engagement provides a distinct advantage in monetizing AI advancements through enhanced advertising, content recommendations, and overall user experience. A substantial portion of the company's revenue is directly generated from ad sales on its key platforms: Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, making AI-driven improvements in ad targeting and delivery particularly impactful. Supported by significant investments in AI research and development, and leveraging this unparalleled global social media network, Meta is strategically positioned to capitalize on AI growth, regardless of the dominant technologies that emerge. Despite its compelling advantages, investing in Meta is not without risks. A key concern is the potential for earnings to fall short of expectations or for sales growth to decelerate from 22% in the past year to a possible 15% in the near future. This slowdown could be driven by broader economic headwinds, where businesses might reduce advertising expenditures to preserve capital, particularly in the event of slowing economic growth or a recession. Furthermore, unforeseen or unexpected shocks could negatively impact the stock’s performance. Consequently, investors should be prepared for the possibility of significant declines, potentially reaching 50% or more. Selling during such downturns could be detrimental to long-term returns. Instead of reacting impulsively, consider consulting a financial advisor with experience navigating multiple bear markets. They can provide insights into strategies like the Trefis HQ strategy and other prudent approaches to potentially capitalize on market downturns. Remember, substantial wealth can be generated in such environments by maintaining a rational perspective. Considering these factors, if you are a long-term investor with a 3-to-5-year horizon and a buy-and-hold strategy, Meta could present an interesting entry point at its current valuation, even after its recent price increase.

Title: Hired-Hand Billionaires 2025: These 48 Executives Got Rich Working For Others
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdurot/2025/05/19/hired-hand-billionaires-2025-these-48-executives-got-rich-working-for-others/

ByMatt Durot ByMatt Durot, Forbes Staff. Most billionaires got rich by building businesses or inheriting big bucks from someone who did. Yet a small but growing group of current and former American executives have managed to amass three-comma fortunes as very well-paid employees. Altogether, Forbes found a record 48 of these hired-hand billionaires in 2025, up from 29 a year ago. And that count is sure to keep climbing thanks to soaring share prices and sky-high executive pay packages. The average annual compensation of the ten highest-paid CEOs in America shot up more than sevenfold from $46 million per year in 2010 to a peak of $330 million per year in 2021, according to data firm Equilar. Most Americans build their wealth through a salary or hourly wage, but top execs are often paid in stock options and other share awards that vest over several years and are often tied to performance. And that’s increasingly the case, with the average equity component of CEO pay packages growing from 54% in 2012 to 66% in 2023, per executive compensation consulting firm Semler Brossy. That’s helped the best-paid CEOs in the U.S. keep getting richer, even as the average pay of the top ten chief executives has actually fallen post-Covid, to a still-enviable $125 million per year in 2023, the most recent year for which full data is available. Because the stock market has continued to climb, with the S&P 500 up nearly 370% since 2010 and nearly 25% since 2021, the value of the shares many of these executives were awarded in the past has skyrocketed, helping the rich get richer and making more companies big enough to birth non-founder billionaires than ever before. Back in 2010, only seven of America’s 403 billionaires were hired-hands, accounting for just 2% of the country’s richest people. That included six former executives who are also on this year’s list: Steve Ballmer of Microsoft and Eric Schmidt of Google, the two richest hired-hands by far today, as well as Jeff Skoll and Meg Whitman of eBay, John Brown of medical equipment maker Stryker and Hamilton “Tony” James of Blackstone. (The seventh, former Cisco CEO John Morgridge, has since fallen from the billionaire ranks.) Fifteen years later, hired-hand billionaires are still relatively rare, but their numbers have increased at a rate that outpaces the incredible growth of America’s three-comma club overall, suggesting that the ten-figure fortunes minted by these current and former non-founder executives aren’t just the result of a rising tide lifting all boats. Today, 5% of America’s nearly 900 billionaires are hired-hands, up from 4% when Forbes last counted them in February 2024, when there were nearly 760 U.S. billionaires. There are 18 newcomers in this year’s group, including Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, FICO CEO William Lansing, SpaceX president and chief operating officer Gwynne Shotwell, former Tesla chief technology officer JB Straubel, longtime Nvidia director Harvey Jones and Howard Lutnick, who left his role as chairman and CEO of financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald to become President Trump’s secretary of commerce in February. AMD CEO Lisa Su is the only hired-hand on last year’s list who failed to make the cut this year, as shares of the chipmaker she runs have cratered by nearly 30% over the past 12 months. Meanwhile, early Uber employee Ryan Graves and Bob Muglia, the former CEO of cloud-based database software firm Snowflake, have regained their billionaire status and returned to this year’s ranking after failing to make the 2024 list of hired-hands. Here are a few of the most notable newcomers on this year’s hired-hands list (net worths are as of May 13, 2025): Born and raised in Russia, Shikin joined marketing software and mobile game maker AppLovin as vice president of engineering when the company was founded in 2012. He was promoted to chief technology officer in 2020 and helped take the company public a year later. Shikin owes a big chunk of his fortune to a performance-based share award he was granted in 2023 that could only be fully unlocked if AppLovin’s stock price soared sixfold in five years. The company hit that once unfathomable goal by the third quarter of 2024, and the company’s market capitalization has skyrocketed by another 370% since to $125 billion, amid a frenzy for anything remotely AI-adjacent. Shikin owns a nearly 1% stake in AppLovin between his stock and options that is worth $1.6 billion. He is one of eight AppLovin billionaires, including fellow hired-hand Herald Chen. Winkelried joined Goldman Sachs in 1982 and rose to president and co-chief operating officer in 2006, alongside President Trump’s future chief economic advisor, Gary Cohn. When Winkelried retired three years later, he walked away with 1.5 million Goldman shares that would be worth nearly $900 million today with the bank’s shares soaring nearly sixfold since the end of March 2009, plus options to acquire another 1.1 million shares (though Forbes assumes that Winkelried likely diversified his holdings along the way, and a spokesperson declined to comment on his net worth). He came out of retirement in 2015 to become co-CEO of TPG alongside the private equity giant’s billionaire cofounder Jim Coulter. Winkelried was promoted to sole CEO in 2021, when Coulter stepped back into his current role as executive chair, and the pair helped take TPG public in 2022 with the firm’s other billionaire cofounder David Bonderman (d. December 2024). TPG’s stock has soared by more than 50% since the IPO, and the 5% stake Winkelried has earned so far for his 10 years of service to the firm is now worth more than $950 million. Culp joined Danaher, the industrial conglomerate founded by billionaire brothers Mitchell and Steven Rales, in 1990 and rose to president and CEO in 2001. By the time he retired 14 years later, Culp had helped boost the company’s stock price by more than 500% and netted nearly $230 million (before taxes) exercising options and selling the resulting stock along the way. That left him with 1.7 million split-adjusted shares that would be worth nearly $350 million today with Danaher’s stock up more than 200% since, plus options to acquire another 2.9 million split-adjusted shares (though Forbes assumes that Culp likely diversified his holdings along the way, and his spokespeople did not respond to a request for comment on his net worth). He came out of retirement in 2018 to lead the turnaround of troubled General Electric as chairman and CEO. He has broken up the bloated conglomerate into three separate public companies after spinning off its healthcare business as GE HealthCare in 2023 and its energy business as GE Vernova in 2024. Shares of the original company, now known as GE Aerospace, have nearly quadrupled since Culp took over as CEO, earning him shares of all three companies that are worth more than $400 million combined. After nearly a decade at Google, Arora left for Japanese investment giant Softbank in 2014, where he was promoted to president and chief operating officer a year later and touted as the likely successor to the firm’s billionaire founder Masayoshi Son. Things didn’t go as planned, and Arora resigned from his executive roles in 2016, though he remained at the company as an advisor for another year. He ended up cashing out at least $360 million (before tax) during his short stint at Softbank between his lucrative pay package and resignation agreement. He spent a year angel investing, then joined cybersecurity company Palo Alto Networks as chairman and CEO in 2018. The firm, which was founded by an Israeli-American entrepreneur named Nir Zuk, who now serves as chief technology officer, in 2005 has seen its stock price soar nearly sixfold since Arora took over, making both him and Zuk billionaires. Arora has netted nearly $800 million (before taxes) exercising options and selling the resulting shares over the past two and a half years, leaving him with stock and options worth another $340 million. Brown is the longest-serving CEO of Motorola after the firm’s cofounder Paul Galvin (d. 1959) and his son Bob Galvin (d. 2011). Brown joined Motorola in 2003 and was promoted to chief executive in 2008. He spun off the company’s struggling legacy smartphone business as a separate public company called Motorola Mobility in 2011, and the Razr maker was acquired by Google for $12.5 billion a year later. (It’s now part of Lenovo.) Then, through a series of more than 50 acquisitions, Brown has transformed the company now known as Motorola Solutions into a nearly $70 billion (market capitalization) behemoth in the market for mission-critical public safety communications, 911 command center solutions and video security. The firm’s stock has soared more than sixfold since Brown took over, and he’s netted more than $700 million (before taxes) exercising options and selling shares along the way. He still owns Motorola Solutions stock and options worth a further $600 million. Baratta and Chae are two of five hired-hand billionaires from Blackstone, the nearly $180 billion (market capitalization) alternative asset management giant cofounded by billionaires Stephen Schwarzman and Pete Peterson (d. 2018). Baratta joined Blackstone in 1998 and moved to London in 2001 to help build the firm’s European private equity business. He has served as global head of private equity since 2012. Chae joined Blackstone in 1997 and ran its international private equity business before being promoted to chief financial officer in 2015 and vice chairman in January. Blackstone’s stock is up nearly 15% over the past year, and Baratta and Chae each own shares worth nearly $1 billion. With Microsoft stock at an all-time high, the software giant’s chairman and CEO is a billionaire for the first time. Nadella joined the tech giant in 1992 and rose to CEO in 2014, when America’s richest hired-hand billionaire, Steve Ballmer, retired that year. Nadella was named chairman in 2021, replacing veteran tech exec and investor John Thompson, who had assumed the role from Microsoft’s billionaire cofounder Bill Gates in 2014. Nadella has made Microsoft a major player in the AI boom, investing more than $10 billion in OpenAI since 2019 and leading the development of Microsoft’s own suite of AI-powered tools called CoPilot. He owns just 0.01% of the $3.4 trillion (market capitalization) company’s stock, but that’s just enough to make him a billionaire—when combined with his more than $600 million in (pretax) share sales.

May 19, 2025 05:20 ET | Source: Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP SAN DIEGO, May 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The law firm of Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP announces that the Elevance Health class action lawsuit – captioned Miller v. Elevance Health, Inc., No. 25-cv-00923 (S.D. Ind.) – seeks to represent purchasers of Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE: ELV) common stock and charges Elevance Health as well as certain of Elevance Health’s executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the Elevance Health class action lawsuit, please provide your information here: https://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-elevance-health-inc-class-action-lawsuit-elv.html You can also contact attorneys J.C. Sanchez or Jennifer N. Caringal of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at info@rgrdlaw.com. Lead plaintiff motions for the Elevance Health class action lawsuit must be filed with the court no later than July 11, 2025. CASE ALLEGATIONS: Elevance Health operates as a health benefits company. Among other things, the cost of providing health benefits to members is driven by the level of care a patient requires, often referred to as “acuity,” and the members’ utilization of the health benefits, according to the complaint. The Elevance Health class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the class period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Medicaid redeterminations were causing the acuity and utilization of Elevance Health’s Medicaid members to rise significantly, as the members being removed from Medicaid programs were, on average, healthier than those who remained eligible for the programs; and (ii) this shift was occurring to a degree that was not reflected in Elevance Health’s rate negotiations with the states or in its financial guidance for 2024. The Elevance Health class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 17, 2024, Elevance Health revealed that it was now “expecting second half utilization to increase in Medicaid” and that it was “seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population, including in outpatient home health, radiology, durable medical equipment as well as some elective procedures.” On this news, the price of Elevance Health stock fell nearly 6%, according to the complaint. Then, on October 17, 2024, the Elevance Health class action lawsuit further alleges that Elevance Health announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2024, revealing that Elevance Health had missed consensus earnings per share (“EPS”) expectations for the quarter by $1.33, or 13.7%, “due to elevated medical costs in [its] Medicaid business.” Elevance Health further revealed that it was lowering EPS guidance for 2024 from $37.20 to $33.00, or 11.3%, as it expected these Medicaid issues to continue, according to the complaint. The Elevance Health class action lawsuit alleges that on this news, the price of Elevance Health stock fell nearly 11%. THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired Elevance Health common stock during the class period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the Elevance Health class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the Elevance Health class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the Elevance Health class action lawsuit.

Title: CE 100 Index Jumps 5% as Shopify Gets a Post-Earnings Bump; Payment Brands Rally

A rally across all market indices, as China-focused tariffs were reduced, helped lift the CE 100 Index 5% higher in a week that saw almost all pillars advance, with the exception of the “Be Well” segment. In the Shop vertical, up 7%, Shopify surged 20.3% to take the lead among gainers for the week. Shopify’s first-quarter earnings results showed double-digit growth in gross merchandise volumes (GMV) and a continued movement toward streamlined checkout online and further inroads made in offline commerce. “It’s still early to assess the full impact of the current trade environment,” Shopify President Harley Finkelstein said on the conference call with analysts. He added that “We’re, of course, monitoring for potential slowdowns, but our data through April shows little evidence of that.” The company’s earnings results noted that revenues were up 27% to $2.4 billion; GMV surged 22% to $74.8 billion. Offline GMV increased 23% and B2B GMV delivered triple-digit growth, up 109% from the year-ago first quarter, Finkelstein said. Tencent took the Pay and Be Paid segment up 6.9%. In its own quarterly report, Tencent’s CEO noted that its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities had “contributed tangibly” to its gaming and advertising businesses. Revenue was up 13% year over year to 180 billion yuan ($25 billion). “We also stepped up our spending on new AI opportunities, such as the Yuanbao application and AI in Weixin,” CEO Ma Huateng said, referring to the company’s super app. Domestic Games revenues were 42.9 billion yuan, representing a 24% year-over-year increase from last year. Tencent shares were 18% higher. Also within the payments sphere, Affirm’s stock gained 13.2%. Affirm is partnering with Costco to offer online shoppers the option to pay over time for transactions. Customers, if approved, will be able to select monthly Affirm payment plans when shopping on Costco’s website. Also within the payments pantheon, PayPal’s stock was up 2.7%. The company’s shares rose in the wake of news that AI search company Perplexity has launched a partnership with PayPal. The collaboration will see Perplexity use PayPal to power agentic commerce on its Perplexity Pro platform. Beginning this summer, U.S. consumers can check out instantly using PayPal or Venmo when they ask Perplexity to look for products, book travel or purchase tickets, per the announcement. As for the payment networks themselves, Visa and Mastercard gained a respective 3.6% and 2.6%. As detailed by PYMNTS, a group of trade associations representing European retailers reportedly asked the European Commission to take action against Mastercard and Visa under European Union antitrust rules, alleging that the companies charge high fees and don’t provide transparency on those fees. In a letter, the associations also called for price controls on interchange fees, transparency and nondiscriminatory obligations for International Card Schemes, and a tool for regulators to scrutinize ICSs’ actions. A Visa spokesperson told PYMNTS the firm’s fees reflect the value of its services, adding: “This includes extremely high levels of security and fraud prevention, near-perfect operational resilience and reliability, and a wide range of consumer protections and high-quality, innovative products and services that serve consumer and merchant needs.” The Be Well segment was the only decliner, slipping 1.1% as United Healthcare plunged 23%. As reported by The Wall Street Journal, the Justice Department is investigating UnitedHealth Group for possible criminal Medicare fraud related to its Medicare Advantage business.

Title: Legendary investor Ron Baron shares the early contrarian lesson that's helped him return 1,843% over 22 years
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/ron-baron-shares-the-first-investing-lesson-he-ever-learned-2025-5
Time Published: 2025-05-19T08:00:02Z
Full Content:
It's hard to imagine Ron Baron, the billionaire founder of Baron Capital, knowing little about investing. Baron is one of the most successful investors of his time, amassing more than $41 billion in assets under management since 1982. His Baron Partners Fund (BPTRX) is up 1,843% since launching in May 2003, trouncing the S&P 500's 536% return and beating 99% of similar funds over the last 5-, 10-, and 15-year periods, according to Morningstar data. But like all of us, he was once a beginner, too. After studying chemistry and then attending law school, Baron finally decided he wanted to work in finance. With no job offer, he moved into a friend's basement in New Jersey until he could find work. His engineer parents weren't happy. But his uncle bought him a copy of Joseph E. Granville's "A Strategy Of Daily Stock Market Timing For Maximum Profit." Reading it, Baron learned his first major lesson about investing: taking a contrarian approach to prevailing market consensus can pay off. "What made sense in this book, which was not intuitive, was that when news was really bad, you're supposed to invest, you're supposed to buy things," Baron told the Economic Club of New York on May 13. "And when news was really good, you're supposed to sell things." Essentially, don't chase returns on the back end of rallies when all the good news is already priced in. It's time-tested advice that many investing legends espouse. Warren Buffett's famous mantra was to "be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful." Sir John Templeton wrote: "Bull markets are born on pessimism, grow on skepticism, mature on optimism, and die on euphoria. The time of maximum pessimism is the best time to buy, and the time of maximum optimism is the best time to sell." Investor sentiment has been all over the place in recent weeks. After President Donald Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs announcement, investors became exceptionally bearish on stocks. A month ago, CNN's Fear and Greed Index was in "Extreme Fear" territory. But the outlook has improved as Trump has started to back off from his trade war. Right now, "Greed" is the dominant feeling among investors. Today, Baron is uber-bullish on Tesla, saying he believes its share price will grow 10x from current levels. The stock makes up 35% of his Baron Partners Fund. While Baron doesn't trade short-term macro developments, instead betting on companies he thinks will outperform over the long term, he still applies the lesson he learned early in his career by being ahead of the consensus on the stocks he buys and seeing future outcomes that no one else sees. "It's about being the opposite of what everyone else says," he said. And when things are going awry in markets and the economy, Baron stays cool and thinks about the big picture. "I just figure like John Lennon that in the long run, everything's going to work out. And if it doesn't work out, it's not the end yet," he said. "Sooner or later, everything works out. Man causes problems and then fixes the problems." Where Big Tech secrets go public — unfiltered in your inbox weekly. Sign up chevron down icon An icon in the shape of an angle pointing down. Jump to

Title: Baxter & Bailey bring The Design Laundry to Barcelona

With humour, honesty and a few disaster stories, Baxter & Bailey's OFFF talk celebrated the messy side of creativity and why embracing mistakes might be the best design tool of all. With humour, honesty and a few disaster stories, Baxter & Bailey's OFFF talk celebrated the messy side of creativity and why embracing mistakes might be the best design tool of all. Baxter & Bailey could've taken the safe route for their Friday evening talk at OFFF. They could've showcased slick work for the Royal Parks, the Royal Mail, or the London Soundtrack Festival. Instead, they pulled back the curtain on what really goes on behind the pristine curtain of the design industry, revealing a tangle of mistakes, mishaps and moments of pure chaos. "We live in a world where everything we see is finished, polished and presented, which can be quite a daunting prospect for young designers entering the industry," they explained. "It's a nice reminder that even the most experienced designers mess up sometimes." With that, Matt and Dom launched into an hour of confession, comedy, and collective therapy. It was an airing of creative dirty laundry, shared in the spirit of learning and laughter. Baxter & Bailey started with their own biggest fumbles, warming the crowd up for what was to come. Dom kicked things off with a tale from a night train journey in Russia en route to a crucial pitch for a telecoms giant. Sharing a cabin with a snoring stranger called Constantin from Moscow, he awoke to find his roommate enjoying breakfast in nothing but his pants. In the panic to flee, Dom left his carefully crafted presentation boards on the train. "What I learnt from that mistake was: even if you wake up and the first thing you see is an old Russian man's crotch, keep cool, don't panic and remember what you're doing," Dom told the crowd. Matt followed with a story from a concept presentation a decade ago. Just a few minutes in, the client's top boss entered the boardroom, watched in silence… then stood up, gave a thumbs down, and stuck out his tongue with a rude noise of disapproval. "I still cringe every time I hear that story," said Dom. The pair soon revealed they weren't alone in their confessions. Before the talk, they'd floated the idea to British design legend Rian Hughes, who not only approved but offered his own disaster story. On screen, Rian recalled his first job interview at a Camden agency. Lost, rain-soaked, and 45 minutes late, he finally arrived with his portfolio strapped to a trolley. As he lifted it onto the table, he noticed something brown on his sleeve and realised he'd rolled the trolley through dog poo. One side of his portfolio was covered, and so was the director's mahogany table (not to mention the stench). "Despite this auspicious beginning, I got the job," said Rian. "But I don't recommend it as an interview technique – and the job was shit anyway. I lasted three months." With proof of concept secured, Baxter & Bailey launched The Design Laundry, a growing archive of creative calamities submitted by designers across the industry. The idea is that people share their worst moments, get them out in the open, and maybe learn something in the process. Here are just a few they aired at OFFF. Jamie Ellul, founder of Supple Studio, joined in from the remote countryside to share his cautionary tale. Early in his solo career, he landed a job designing a brochure for an accountancy firm. "I think it might have actually looked worse than it did in the beginning when I was finished," Jamie admitted. He sent the final artwork to print, then forwarded the printer's quote to the client before hopping on a train. Following weeks of radio silence, the client finally replied: 'Hi Jamie, I've been wondering how to respond to your email, having seen your note to the printer below on the email chain'. That note read: 'Please don't judge me—this is the shittest thing I've ever designed'. Cue laughter from the crowd – and a lesson in double-checking email chains. As Matt and Dom pointed out, email fails were the most common type of submission. We've all been there. Next up: Francis Jackson, formerly of MetaDesign and OPX and now a psychotherapist, shared her story in a letter. Years ago, she worked with The King's Trust on a beautifully designed book promoting the value of art in the built environment, Art in the Public Environment. The problem was that a glaring typo was revealed by none other than the King of England himself after hundreds of printed copies went out across the country. What the front cover actually said was: 'Art in the Pubic Realm'. When the King was handed a copy while visiting the offices, he swiftly returned it, eyebrows raised. I'm sure Francis was hoping for the ground to open up beneath her at that moment! Daljit Singh, co-founder of pioneering digital agency Digit, appeared onscreen in sunglasses, mid-holiday, to recount a transatlantic disaster. After landing in the UK from New York in 2007, Daljit got a message: Gene Simmons (yes, from KISS) wanted to meet him. Being a huge fan, he turned around, caught the next flight back, and headed straight to the hotel. But as he flew, doubt crept in, and he asked himself: could it be a prank? He'd played an elaborate hoax on his friend Simon not too long ago, so when told to ask for "Simon Smith" at reception (apparently Gene's alias), his suspicions grew. Still, he went upstairs, knocked on the door, and shouted, "Simon, come out, you massive tosser." None other than Gene Simmons opened the door. "You English guys have got such strange senses of humour," he said, before ushering Daljit in. The meeting lasted three awkward minutes. They didn't get the job. After airing these disasters, Matt and Dom returned to each story to highlight the learning points. Jamie reminded us to treat every job (and every email) with care. Francis' typo showed that even major mistakes fade with time. Daljit's story offered a reminder not to let doubt derail bold decisions. The laundry pile grew with more stories, laughs, and stains, and the pair could've gone all night. Luckily, this won't be the last spin cycle for The Design Laundry. Dom and Matt are bringing the idea to future events and inviting more submissions through their website. Because if creativity is a messy process, there's no shame in airing a little dirty laundry.
