ByBill Stone, Contributor. Worse-than-expected job growth on Friday sent the S&P 500 lower after reaching a closing high on Thursday. Employment grew by just 22,000 nonfarm jobs, which was below expectations. Previous data was revised slightly lower, though only by 21,000, compared to the massive downward revision last month. The household survey data were solid, with a gain of 288,000 jobs following a decline of 260,000 jobs the previous month. The household survey research series, which aligns with the payroll report criteria, increased by 781,000. The significant increase in the research series is merely little more than a slight reversal of the 753,000 decline from the previous month. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.3% from 4.2%. This increase in unemployment was mainly due to relatively positive reasons, with job gains of 288,000 in the household survey and an increase of 436,000 in the labor force. The underemployment rate is a broader measure of unemployment, which includes “unemployed people, plus everyone marginally attached to the workforce, plus all people employed part-time for economic reasons.” The underemployment rate is 1.5 percentage points above the December 2022 low, while the unemployment rate has risen 0.9 percentage points from its low. The underemployment rate can serve as a leading indicator of unemployment, reflecting the growing slack in the labor market. Wage growth was below expectations at 3.7% year-over-year, down from 3.9% last month. The average workweek hours held steady at 34.2, just above the five-year low of 34.1 in January, which was depressed by weather and the LA fires. Monitoring the employment-to-population ratio among prime-age individuals, aged 25 to 54, should signal when concern about the unemployment rate is warranted. The three-month average of the prime-age employment-to-population ratio has been teetering around the current level, but the labor market has remained resilient. It should be monitored closely, but it has been able to maintain a steady level so far and improved fractionally this month. Initial weekly filings for unemployment benefits remain benign. However, continuing claims for benefits are above the lows, indicating some slowdown in people being rehired after losing their jobs. The Sahm Rule states that a recession begins when the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate rises by 0.5 percentage points or more relative to its low during the previous 12 months. The three-month average of the US unemployment rate is 4.23%, well below the 4.51% Sahm Rule trigger. The Sahm Rule has had an unblemished historical record of predicting recessions. However, its perfection is in jeopardy since the rule was triggered in July and September 2024 with no economic contraction yet in sight. Another useful predictor of recessions has been earnings growth, as a recession is typically associated with a year-over-year decline in corporate profits. For this analysis, the NIPA corporate profits are used rather than S&P 500 earnings. NIPA data includes all US companies, including both public and private entities, as well as small companies and S corporations. For the second quarter of 2025, NIPA profits grew by 4.3% year-over-year, which remains positive but looks to be decelerating. Notably, S&P 500 earnings grew at a 12% year-over-year pace; however, much of that rapid growth was driven by technology and artificial intelligence-related companies. Therefore, NIPA provides a better window into the overall economy. Following the weaker jobs data, markets expect three 25-basis-point (0.25%) Fed cuts in 2025. The softer labor market has made a 25-basis-point cut at the Federal Reserve’s September 17 meeting a virtual certainty. Bottom line: Following the shockingly large downward revision last month, this month’s jobs report makes it clear that the labor market has been softening and is teetering on the edge. These facts will not escape the Fed’s notice, so a September rate cut is now a fait accompli following the release of the monthly payrolls report last week. The S&P 500 reached an all-time high during the week but declined fractionally on Friday following the release of the jobs report. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed primarily due to a favorable legal outcome for Alphabet and enthusiasm about Elon Musk’s ambitious Tesla performance targets. As the threat of recession has waned, as illustrated by the lower betting odds of recession, stocks have rallied to new highs. At the early April stock lows, the massive US tariffs announced on Liberation Day sent the betting odds of recession soaring to 65%. As the tariff threat eased and some progress was made on trade agreements, stocks have recovered sharply. Though the recession odds rose intra-week, the betting odds held steady week-over-week. There are only four companies in the S&P 500 scheduled to report earnings, but Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe (ADBE) are certainly notable. Producer (PPI) and consumer inflation (CPI) rates for August are scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday respectively. While a higher-than-expected PPI report would garner attention, the CPI will be more critical, as the extent to which price increases, including those from tariffs, reach consumers is the crucial variable. CPI is expected to rise year-over-year to 2.9% from 2.7%. The consensus forecast is consistent with the estimates from the Cleveland Fed, so this result is unlikely to hinder the September rate cut. A hot set of inflation reports would likely decrease the number of rate cuts expected in 2025, rather than endangering the September move. Despite the slight decline on Friday, stocks are still pricing in low odds of recession and forecasting that the Fed will begin rate cuts soon enough for this to remain a soft spot in the labor market rather than a full-fledged downturn. The bond market is less sure of the Fed’s success, with corporate bond spreads widening to levels last seen during the build-up to the tariff worries earlier in the year. While conditions should be monitored closely, there is currently little evidence of an impending recession. However, as noted, some storm clouds are on the horizon that could shift the economy in that direction.

Title: Take the nuclear option: Let Mamdani win the mayoral race so NYC can start over from scratch
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/09/06/business/let-zohran-mamdani-win-the-mayoral-race-so-nyc-can-start-over-from-scratch/
Time Published: 2025-09-07T01:33:08Z
Full Content:
As alarm bells ring over the New York City mayoral race, an odd sentiment is starting to gain traction across the business community: Just give up. Just sit tight and let the ill-equipped Maoist Zohran Mamdani win in November. Let him unleash his creepy, dogmatic socialist policies on the masses to teach them valuable lessons — both economic and cultural — about wokeness and progressivism, and more broadly its stranglehold on the Democratic Party. I’m starting to agree. Let the city sink into the abyss. Let Mamdani’s policies force out business and prod more upper- and middle-class residents to flee. Let the city declare bankruptcy — which will happen if Mamdani gets his way. We can then start from scratch. Detroit did it and the last time I was there, its downtown was pristine. Plus, we’re headed there anyway, right? Why not expedite the process and teach people who think leftism works that it doesn’t — particularly when you chase out all the non-leftists who pay the bills. To be clear, New York City isn’t Detroit. Sure, there’s diversification, businesses moving operations to Texas and Florida, but for all the work-from-home doom-and-gloom talk about New York City real estate, Jamie Dimon’s JPMorgan is still headquartered in Midtown. Goldman Sachs remains on the West Side. BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, is in Hudson Yards. NYU Langone is here, built through the grit of legendary financier Ken Langone, with world prestige and a quality of care to match. (I can personally attest to the latter.) The best restaurants are here: Try getting a table at ­Elio’s, Sistina or Rao’s. It’s still a cultural mecca, the home of Broadway, The Met and some great museums. For all our issues, New York City with a GDP of around $1.3 trillion has an economy bigger than many countries. We are also saddled, of course, with an insane political class. Zohran Mamdani might be honest in his Marxism, maybe boyishly naive in explaining the benefits of government-run grocery stores that have failed everywhere they were tried. (See most recently Kansas City.) But in this state, he is no outlier. He is emblematic of one-party rule, a fellow traveler in New York’s leftist Democratic Party that has brainwashed voters into believing we need massive regulation that impedes business formation. Ditto for rent control that creates housing shortages, lax policing (do you really feel safe on the streets of Manhattan, particularly at night?), high taxes (the reason so many people are leaving) and a fracking ban that continues to deprive economically depressed upstate regions. Dems have ditched New York’s melting pot in favor of woke and hostile tribalism. The largest concentration of Jews outside Israel, right here in New York City, must now accept daily harassment over leftists’ warped interpretation of history. And we must embrace ­unions, like the clown car that runs the school system. Consider: Sleepy Joe Biden’s immigration policies opened the floodgates for millions of migrants to come to this country. Sign up to receive On The Money by Charlie Gasparino in your inbox every Thursday. Please provide a valid email address. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Never miss a story. Many settled here in New York City, were housed in fancy hotels, and yet since 2020 NYC has witnessed a net out-migration of around 400,000 people. Put another way, a city’s worth of taxpayers left and was replaced by the world’s poor who are tapping into the city’s generous welfare state. Operationally, Andrew Cuomo could be a good mayor. He knows how to run things on both the state and national level. Yet consider his ill-fated last years as governor: He was forced to cave to the left on every issue, banned fracking, raised taxes and couldn’t tame the size of government. Could Eric Adams stand up to those clowns if he were to win — and not drop out as people now believe he will? He hasn’t so far. Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa, the crime-fighting activist founder of the Guardian Angels, is tough as nails and, when you sit with him, very coherent on policy. Yet if through a stroke of divine intervention he were to be elected, he would be outnumbered 1,000 to 1. He needs the state Legislature to create reform on taxes and other issues, and that’s where the mini-Mamdanis reside. There and the New York City Council, which is a mini-politburo. That’s why I am now leaning ­toward the nuclear option. Let Mamdani win — and prove to New Yorkers and Americans once and for all that there’s a reason communism failed in the Soviet Union, and that the apparatchiks in China have embraced the free market to survive.

The latest Amazon Kindle software update, which includes all the new accessibility features, has been a resounding success. However, there are always a few bugs that need to be addressed. The 15.8.4 update causes the screen to flicker constantly, but this issue can be resolved with a reboot. Multiple popups appear, blank and without any text. Sideloaded books had invalid ASIN numbers, but this issue has been resolved with a new Calibre update issued on September 5th. The update also has errors with borrowing e-books from the Kindle Unlimited program. Many of the books that users want to download are not downloading properly. The only way to fix this issue is to factory reset the Kindle, which will obviously delete all your content, including sideloaded books. Obviously, users should not have to go to these great lengths to use their Kindle as they normally would. Software updates have been causing more problems for the past couple of years, causing more problems than they solve. This started in 2022 when Amazon switched its programming language from JavaScript to React Native. This happened right after the new home screen experience was rolled out. Instead of your library being on the home screen, it now features page after page of recommendations and Amazon trying to sell you more Kindle Books. Firmware updates have been steadily deteriorating after the programming change. Still, they reached a breaking point every year since Amazon conducted layoffs of Kindle executives, engineers, programmers, and the book recommendations team. Hundreds of people left during those years, and dozens more did so due to the increased workload, but their pay remained the same. A few people in the Kindle division told me last month that morale is at an all-time low and Amazon simply doesn’t really care about Fire Tablets, Kindles, and Fire TV boxes anymore.

What was once met with skepticism and doubt is now universally accepted at the highest level. Despite the resistance, eventually everyone understands Bitcoin. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. It may take a minute to get to grips with magic internet money, but once you see the scarcity, durability, and predictability, it somehow all falls into place. From Jamie Dimon to Donald Trump, eventually everyone understands Bitcoin. Anthony Pompliano summed it up best, against an image of some high-profile personalities, including Donald Trump, Jamie Dimon, and Jerome Powell, who have changed their tune on the number-one coin. He said: “Eventually everyone understands bitcoin.” In the beginning, the idea of a decentralized digital currency was met with skepticism, derision, and sometimes outright hostility. Yet, as the years have passed, some of the world’s most influential voices from Wall Street to Washington have changed their tunes, making Bitcoin’s journey from a fringe obsession to a mainstream asset nothing short of historic. Take Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase. In 2017, he called Bitcoin a “fraud,” threatened to fire employees who traded it, and warned of government crackdowns. Fast-forward to the present, JPMorgan offers Bitcoin exposure to clients and Dimon regularly attends crypto panels. He’s critical of specifics, but his institution is deeply entrenched in blockchain finance. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink went from calling Bitcoin “an index of money laundering” to overseeing the world’s largest asset manager issuing a Bitcoin ETF and publicly referring to it as “digital gold.” Fink’s pivot stunned markets and signaled a shift in how legacy finance regards the new digital economy. Jerome Powell, Chair of the Federal Reserve, was also skeptical about crypto for years. Yet under his watch, the Fed now closely monitors Bitcoin, citing its relevance to global markets and even a “competitor to gold.” Donald Trump once dismissed Bitcoin as being highly volatile and based on thin air. But by 2024, Trump was reportedly courting crypto donors and acknowledging Bitcoin’s increasing significance, reflecting the asset’s growing political clout.

Before 2020, Saylor publicly doubted Bitcoin’s longevity, calling its days “numbered” as far back as 2013. Now, his company MicroStrategy holds more BTC than any other publicly traded firm (over 636,000 coins) and Saylor has personally become its most famous evangelist. And Mark Cuban spent years calling Bitcoin no different from bananas and raising doubts about its utility. Today, he’s an active participant in the crypto and NFT ecosystems, holding Bitcoin and advising blockchain companies. In other words? Eventually, everyone understands Bitcoin. If the world’s biggest names can change their minds, so can entire governments. According to the Visual Capitalist, the United States is now the largest holder of Bitcoin, with China following closely. These holdings are often the result of law enforcement seizures or strategic mining, but the fact remains: global governments hold thousands (sometimes hundreds of thousands) of bitcoins, quietly shifting from outright bans to accumulation and research. Bitcoin’s path to mainstream acceptance has been paved with resistance and then recognition. Whether driven by economic imperatives, technological curiosity, or simply the fear of missing out, figures like Jamie Dimon and Donald Trump have finally come to the same realization: Bitcoin is here, and it is inevitable; even governments now hold Bitcoin as part of their strategic reserves. What was once met with skepticism and doubt is now universally accepted at the highest level, proving Pompliano right that, despite the resistance, eventually everyone understands Bitcoin.

Title: The Banks and the Unbanked: Blockchain’s Biggest Beneficiaries Sit at Both Ends of the Financial Spectrum

Capital markets are in flux. As evolving monetary policy casts a spotlight on a fragmented global economy, the stability of infrastructure for borderless transactions with digital assets stands out as a superior alternative to the traditional system. Blockchain is a viable solution to many of today’s financial challenges. Uniquely, its clearest beneficiaries are two distinctly different groups: financial institutions and the 1.4 billion people who are unbanked. The former gains next-generation speed and scalability while the latter benefits from newfound accessibility and equity. Our charge as builders of this industry, if we want to actualize blockchain’s full potential, is to account for the needs of both. While the financially marginalized have long sought solutions in bleeding-edge tech, the legacy world is just beginning to get the appeal. "We have to be thinking about how we leverage [blockchain] in our environment," said Franklin Templeton CEO Jenny Johnson recently, discussing how costs in asset management are up 80% in the last decade, while revenues are down 15%. Franklin Templeton's breakthrough illustrates this institutional awakening. Their first-ever tokenized money market fund reduces transaction costs from $1 to less than a penny – for an institution managing $1.7 trillion, the efficiency gains are transformative. But this institutional adoption does more than cut costs; it validates the infrastructure that can serve both boardrooms and the billions still excluded from traditional finance. The same blockchain rails enabling Franklin Templeton's efficiency gains can deliver $50 remittances from Dubai to the Philippines in seconds rather than several business days. The technology removes friction, whether you're settling $100 million in tokenized assets or sending $100 to family abroad. Major institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity and JPMorgan are proving blockchain's institutional viability at unprecedented scale. Aid organizations, such as the United Nations Refugee Agency, are simultaneously demonstrating its humanitarian potential, distributing assistance directly to those in need without traditional intermediaries. These parallel developments reflect blockchain's unique capacity to serve both efficiency and equity. The institutional momentum creates crucial infrastructure benefits for everyone. When major financial players invest in blockchain networks, they strengthen the rails that underbanked populations can also access. When regulatory frameworks emerge to support institutional adoption, they create legal clarity that benefits all users. Consider the numbers that drive both institutional interest and human need. Global transaction banking generates nearly $1.4 trillion in annual revenue, yet operational inefficiencies cost an estimated 8-10% of that revenue. For institutions, blockchain technology offers clear solutions to these challenges. For the unbanked, the stakes are different but equally compelling. Remittances – which exceeded $900 billion globally in 2024 – carry average fees of 6.62% worldwide, with some corridors reaching 10% or more. Working families lose billions annually to these costs. When a domestic worker sends $500 home, losing $50 to fees represents not inefficiency but genuine hardship. The convergence becomes clear: the same technology solving institutional inefficiencies can address human exclusion from the financial system. Blockchain networks processing transactions for fractions of a penny with 3-5 second settlement times serve both institutional treasuries and individual remittances equally well. Real-world stress tests prove blockchain's dual utility. In Argentina, where inflation reached 236.7% by late 2024, both institutions and individuals are embracing digital assets out of necessity. Data shows 61.8% of Argentina's crypto transactions now involve stablecoins — not as speculation, but as economic survival tools preserving purchasing power against peso devaluation. This crisis-driven adoption reveals blockchain's fundamental value proposition: removing dependence on fragile intermediaries and national monetary systems. Whether you're a fund manager hedging institutional exposure or a family protecting savings, the infrastructure provides the same essential service: stable, borderless value transfer. The infrastructure exists. Modern blockchain networks have processed tens of billions of operations, serving millions of accounts worldwide. The technology handles institutional scale while remaining accessible to individual users. But actualizing blockchain's full potential requires intentional design for both audiences. This means building interfaces sophisticated enough for institutional treasury management yet simple enough for first-time users. It means creating compliance frameworks that satisfy regulatory requirements while preserving accessibility for underserved populations. Success requires partnerships spanning both worlds – working with established financial institutions to build robust infrastructure while partnering with mobile money operators, community organizations, and fintech companies serving underbanked populations. The goal isn't choosing between efficiency and equity, but achieving both simultaneously. Blockchain's unique promise lies precisely in its ability to serve these seemingly different constituencies with the same fundamental infrastructure. The networks enabling pension funds to tokenize assets can help farmers access credit. The rails facilitating institutional settlement can deliver humanitarian aid directly to refugees. As builders, our responsibility extends beyond technological capability to purposeful implementation. We must ensure that institutional adoption strengthens rather than supplants financial inclusion efforts. We must design systems that leverage institutional resources to extend access rather than create new barriers. The infrastructure for borderless, frictionless value transfer is ready. The regulatory frameworks are evolving. The institutional adoption is accelerating. Our success will be measured not just by efficiency gains in existing systems, but by how many people we bring into economic participation for the first time. The choice we make today determines whether blockchain becomes another tool serving the already-served or the bridge finally connecting everyone to the global economy. Both institutions and the unbanked are counting on us to get this right.

Title: Perfect Competition Will Crush AI Profits
URL: https://dailyreckoning.com/perfect-competition-will-crush-ai-profits/
Time Published: 2025-09-06T14:30:01Z
Full Content:
By Dan Amoss PostedSeptember 6, 2025 Today’s AI investment craze suffers from the same flawed assumptions that sparked past bubbles. Without a course correction, the U.S. economy faces a self-inflicted bust. In the mid-2000s, Wall Street’s best and brightest were packaging subprime loans into complex securities and assuring the world they were safe. Regulators nodded. Rating agencies blessed them. Investors snapped them up. Few asked the obvious question: What if the assumptions behind these instruments are wrong? Today, a similar blind spot is spreading through the economy – not through mortgages, but through artificial intelligence (AI). Everyone from Big Tech giants to startup founders, institutional investors, and Washington policymakers is convinced that artificial intelligence is a revolutionary technology, and that big capital expenditures (capex) today will lead to countless industrywide profits in the future. But there’s a problem: Demand in value-added, real-world applications is unlikely to be large enough to justify all this investment. The demand that AI promoters constantly highlight is drawn from Large language model (LLM) training sessions and queries – neither of which is associated with much sustainable, real-world revenue. Much of the revenue being booked in this ecosystem ultimately comes from a limited pool of venture capital (VC) funds. A recent story from The Information estimated that these LLM companies generate roughly $18.5 billion in annualized revenue. Ironically, The Information was trying to rebut the claims from an MIT Media Lab report that concluded 95% of businesses are seeing no return on AI pilot projects. It’s ironic because $18.5 billion in annualized revenue is peanuts relative to the astonishingly large amount of capital poured into these companies. The revenue streams in the chart above are also not very valuable because LLM companies are not showing positive operating leverage. Plenty of evidence indicates that costs scale alongside revenue at LLM companies. Heavy users burn lots of electricity and shorten Nvidia chips’ lives in their usage of the models. And free users will just switch to a competing LLM if ever required to pay a subscription fee. Today’s AI investment mania has two key blind spots: the fallacy of composition and adverse selection. Let’s break those down. The fallacy of composition is the mistaken belief that what’s true for one player is true for all. If one company like Microsoft makes money selling AI products, then investors assume the entire AI sector will do the same. But that’s not how competitive markets work. In fact, success in a competitive market often comes at the expense of rivals. There can be winners, but not everyone can win. This fallacy infected the telecom boom of the late 1990s. Just because one broadband provider had profitable demand didn’t mean every fiber-optic network was worth building. Billions were spent laying cables that no one would use for another decade. Then there’s adverse selection. In insurance, this happens when sick people are more likely to buy health insurance than healthy people, leading to losses for the insurer that doesn’t attract enough healthy customers. In AI, something similar is unfolding: the heaviest users of AI chatbots and tools – those demanding the most computing resources – are often not paying enough in subscription fees to cover their costs to the LLM provider. The casual users, who make up the vast majority, may never convert to paying customers. This undermines the very business model these companies are betting on. What happens when the market discovers this? You get a doom loop: companies overspend on infrastructure, hoping for future demand that never materializes, while investors keep piling in – until someone finally notices the emperor is minimally clothed. There’s a popular narrative that the so-called “Magnificent 7” (Microsoft, Google, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla) will capture most of the economic value created by AI. But history suggests otherwise. In past tech revolutions, the biggest winners weren’t always the biggest companies. The advent of the internet helped millions of small and mid-sized businesses gain customers and compete globally. Low-cost e-commerce tools like Shopify and advertising platforms like Google and Facebook gave them the reach they never had before. Similarly, it’s possible that AI’s biggest beneficiaries won’t be the firms building the models, but the dentists, restaurant owners, and local manufacturers who use those tools to accelerate mundane processes and serve customers better. The irony? While these SMBs (small- and medium-sized businesses) benefit, the AI platforms enabling them may struggle to get paid. If Google’s new Veo video model helps a dentist craft a great local ad, will that dentist pay Google more? One of the most dangerous assumptions in AI capex is that these platforms will enjoy pricing power – meaning they can charge enough to cover their costs and then some. But look closely, and this assumption crumbles. The AI chatbot market looks a lot like perfect competition, a textbook term for markets where many providers offer nearly identical products, and prices fall toward the cost of production. Unlike the broadband boom of the 2000s, where companies had to rip up streets to lay wires and customers had few broadband alternatives, switching from one AI model to another takes a few clicks. If you’re a free user of ChatGPT, and it suddenly costs $20 a month to use it at all, but Claude or Gemini is free and just as good, nothing is stopping you from switching. That’s the nightmare scenario for the AI providers: they’ve built massive infrastructure assuming recurring subscription revenue, but the customer base may have no loyalty and little willingness to pay. It’s like investing billions into oil wells only to find out your oil sells for $10 a barrel instead of $70. In a healthy economy, production and consumption communicate constantly. If a company builds something useful, customers respond by buying it. If they overbuild, inventories pile up and prices fall, sending a signal to slow down. AI infrastructure, by contrast, is being built largely on faith. Companies are scaling up compute power without clear signs of sustainable demand. Unlike oil and gas, where prices adjust second-by-second, AI companies operate in a fog. They release tools, collect usage stats, and hope that paid conversions will follow. But hope is not a business model. In fact, today’s AI leaders resemble 2006-era banks more than healthy, feedback-driven enterprises. They’re in an unhealthy relationship with venture capital (VC) firms that need higher and higher valuation “marks” to justify their fees. VC firms don’t want transparency about customer conversion rates, churn, or operating losses that scale with revenue. That would kill the narrative before the VCs can cash out in IPOs to the public market. Meanwhile, China is asking a much more grounded question: How can we use AI to make real-world industries more efficient? Companies like DeepSeek are building AI tools designed to solve narrow problems in energy, logistics, and manufacturing. That’s closer to how the human brain works – selectively activating regions based on the task at hand. And it’s proving to be more effective than trying to create superintelligence in a box. While U.S. Big Tech chases lofty visions of artificial general intelligence (AGI) – often undefined and possibly unachievable – China is deploying AI in practical ways that produce results. To compete, the U.S. must start asking more rigorous questions: What is AI actually for? Who pays for it? And how does it improve the lives of average Americans? If there’s one place where AI hype is meeting hard reality, it’s software engineering. Veteran developer Carl Brown, in an interview with Ed Zitron, shredded the idea that large language models (LLMs) will replace human coders anytime soon. He explained how writing code is only a small part of the job. The real work is long-term thinking, fixing bugs, and figuring out what the software should do. AI tools can crank out lines of code fast. But they often do it sloppily, duplicating functions and ignoring best practices. The result is software that’s harder to maintain, easier to hack, and more prone to crashing. Brown compared AI code to “vibe coding,” which is typing something into a chatbot and hoping it works. That might be fine for a one-time prototype, but it’s a recipe for disaster in a software program that’s meant to last. Worse still, managers – who assume AI is miraculous because they hear about it so much on CNBC – don’t understand programming. These managers are using AI to justify layoffs or to demand unrealistic productivity increases from their teams. This may create a generation of junior engineers who never learn to code properly because they’re relying on tools that don’t understand the long game of software development. It’s often claimed that software is the most natural market for AI to disrupt. However, Carl Brown’s view, plus dozens of other examples, confirm that in real-world stress tests, AI misses too many things, or hallucinates too often, to be considered a revolutionary technology trend. So, in the months ahead, we’re likely to see more hints that Big Tech companies are tapping the brakes on Nvidia chip orders. They’ll do this to avoid an accelerating decline in their free cash flows – a trend that’s already looking scary. For example, see this projection from BofA Global Research. It shows capital spending as a percentage of operating cash flow at the companies building hyperscale data centers. A recession or a bust in venture capital funding for AI LLM companies (like OpenAI) could drive operating cash flow lower. That would make the BofA chart surge higher than they project in the dotted lines. And higher capex relative to cash flow means free cash flow would dive toward zero. To avoid that scenario, hyperscale data center operators would cut AI chip orders. Editor’s note: Members of Strategic Intelligence Pro can access Dan’s full report, including the stock pick, here.

Title: ROSEN, RECOGNIZED INVESTOR COUNSEL, Encourages Novo Nordisk A/S Investors to Secure Counsel Before Important Deadline in Securities Class Action - NVO

September 06, 2025 10:12 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Sept. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important September 30, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s growth potential. Notably, Novo Nordisk’s asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood that such patients would switch to Novo Nordisk’s branded alternatives. Further, defendants greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise, Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

Title: Larry Fink Ascends to WEF Throne: BlackRock’s Puppet Master Takes Command of the Globalist Enslavement Machine

Editor Empire Whatfinger In a chilling development that exposes the deepening tentacles of the globalist elite, the World Economic Forum (WEF) has elevated BlackRock CEO Larry Fink to the position of interim co-chairman of its board, alongside André Hoffmann of Roche. This move, announced on August 15, 2025, comes hot on the heels of an internal investigation that conveniently cleared WEF founder Klaus Schwab of any “material wrongdoing” despite swirling allegations of financial and ethical misconduct. Fink, the architect of BlackRock’s $11 trillion empire that dominates everything from housing markets to corporate boardrooms, now sits at the helm of an organization long accused of plotting humanity’s subjugation under the guise of “sustainable development” and the infamous “Great Reset.” For years, patriots and truth-seekers have warned about the WEF’s sinister agenda: a technocratic dystopia where the masses own nothing, eat bugs, and live as digital serfs in smart cities monitored by AI overlords. Reminder – Larry Fink admits the quiet part out loud: “You have to force behaviors.” BlackRock’s CEO—WEF darling & architect of the ESG regime—spells out the real agenda: Social engineering by corporate coercion. No “incremental change.” No organic diversity. Just top-down mandates, dictating who gets hired, promoted, or funded based on race, gender, & ideological compliance. This isn’t “stakeholder capitalism.” It’s elite-driven control. And if you resist? You’ll “be impacted.” The organization’s ties to depopulation schemes—echoing the eerie Georgia Guidestones’ call for reducing the world’s population to a mere 500 million—have fueled conspiracies that the elite view billions of us as expendable “useless eaters.” Now, with Fink in charge, these fears are no longer fringe theories but a glaring reality. As one X user aptly put it, “The evil of the WEF that wants all of mankind enslaved, and reduced to 500 million people world-wide, guess who is now their leader? BlackRock’s Larry Fink.” Klaus Schwab’s reign at the WEF has been a masterclass in elite manipulation. Founded in 1971, the Davos cabal has masqueraded as a “platform for public-private cooperation” while pushing policies that erode national sovereignty and empower unelected bureaucrats. Schwab’s “stakeholder capitalism”—a euphemism for corporate fascism—has been championed by figures like Fink, who led the U.S. Business Roundtable in 2019 to redefine corporate purpose around this very ideology. But beneath the polished speeches lies a darker truth: allegations of harassment, financial impropriety, and a toxic culture that led to Schwab’s ousting. The WEF’s board, stacked with globalist heavyweights like Al Gore, Christine Lagarde, and now Fink himself, held an emergency meeting to whitewash these claims, declaring only “minor irregularities.” Even Schwab’s wife Hilde was implicated, yet the elite protect their own, ensuring the agenda marches on uninterrupted. Fink’s ascension is no accident; it’s the culmination of BlackRock’s insidious influence. As CEO of the world’s largest asset manager, Fink controls stakes in virtually every major corporation, wielding Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria as a weapon to enforce woke policies and climate hysteria. Critics have blasted ESG as a “social credit system for corporations,” forcing companies to prioritize globalist goals over American interests. BlackRock’s push into housing markets, buying up single-family homes en masse, aligns perfectly with the WEF’s “you’ll own nothing and be happy” mantra—renting from corporate overlords while the elite hoard wealth. And let’s not forget Fink’s cozy ties to governments: during the COVID-19 scam, BlackRock advised central banks on bailouts, facilitating the greatest wealth transfer in history from Main Street to Wall Street. The depopulation angle is where the conspiracy turns truly diabolical. Fink has openly mused about “substituting humans for machines” in countries with declining populations, a chilling endorsement of automation that renders billions obsolete.This dovetails with WEF-linked narratives on “decarbonization requiring depopulation,” where climate zealots like Bill Gates and the elite push for fewer people to “save the planet.” The Great Reset, unveiled in 2020, isn’t about recovery—it’s a blueprint for control, leveraging pandemics, climate scares, and economic chaos to impose digital IDs, CBDCs, and universal basic income as chains on the masses. Fink’s BlackRock has funneled billions into “green” initiatives, profiting from the destruction of fossil fuels while ordinary folks face skyrocketing energy costs. Conspiratorial voices have long connected the dots: BlackRock’s infiltration of governments, from advising Zelenskyy on Ukraine’s reconstruction to schmoozing with leftist leaders like UK’s Keir Starmer and Australia’s Anthony Albanese. Starmer, a WEF acolyte, has slashed winter fuel payments for millions while releasing prisoners early—policies that reek of Agenda 2030’s disdain for the working class. In Canada, WEF darling Mark Carney eyes the premiership, promising more climate tyranny and CBDCs. These puppets serve Fink’s vision: a world where BlackRock owns the assets, the WEF sets the rules, and humanity is culled to sustainable levels. Patriots are sounding the alarm. One X post warns, “They are bringing out the big guns…. They don’t think the patriots will try to bring the WEF down with the head of world investments as their leader.” Another declares the WEF a “terrorist organization,” echoing calls to classify it as such. Fink’s critics point to his “forced behavior” tactics, using finance to alter government policies without democratic accountability. Even in the face of backlash—states like Florida ditching BlackRock over ESG extremism—Fink doubles down, complaining that criticism has become “personal and ugly.” The WEF’s “Young Global Leaders” program has churned out compliant tyrants like Justin Trudeau and Emmanuel Macron, all marching to the tune of Fink’s orchestra. With Fink now co-chairing, expect accelerated pushes for bio-engineering humans to be allergic to meat, mandatory vaccines, and surveillance states—all in the name of “climate action.” As one truth-seeker notes, “Billionaire Larry Fink is an extinctionist, an eugenicist and a misanthrope like Bill Gates… They share a desire to reduce the world population from around 8 Billion down to 500 million.” This isn’t just about economics; it’s spiritual warfare against freedom-loving people. The elite’s blueprint—exposed in leaks and admissions—aims to enslave us through debt, dependency, and division. But resistance is growing. From Trump supporters to everyday Americans, the call is clear: dismantle the WEF, audit BlackRock, and reclaim sovereignty. As Fink and his cronies plot in Davos shadows, patriots must unite to expose and defeat this cabal before it’s too late. The fight for humanity’s soul is on—will you own nothing, or own the truth?

Nick Lichtenberg is Fortune Intelligence editor and was formerly Fortune's executive editor of global news. Deutsche Bank analysts have been watching Amazon Prime, it seems. Specifically, the “breakout” show of the summer, “The Summer I Turned Pretty.” In the AI sphere, analysts Adrian Cox and Stefan Abrudan wrote, it was the summer AI “turned ugly,” with several emerging themes that will set the course for the final quarter of the year. Paramount among them: The rising fear over whether AI has driven Big Tech stocks into the kind of frothy territory that precedes a sharp drop. The AI news cycle of the summer captured themes including the challenge of starting a career, the importance of technology in the China/U.S. trade war, and mounting anxiety about the impact of the technology. But in terms of finance and investing, Deutsche Bank sees markets “on edge” and hoping for a soft landing amid bubble fears. In part, it blames tech CEOs for egging on the market with overpromises, leading to inflated hopes and dreams, many spurred on by tech leaders’ overpromises. It also sees a major impact from the venture capital space, boosting startups’ valuations, and from the lawyers who are very busy filing lawsuits for all kinds of AI players. It’s ugly out there. But the market is actually “more sober” in many ways than the situation from the late 1990s, the German bank argues. Still, Wall Street is not Main Street, and Deutsche Bank notes troubling math about the data centers sprouting up on the outskirts of your town. Specifically, the bank flags a back-of-the-envelope analysis from hedge fund Praetorian Capital that suggests hyperscalers’ massive data center investments could be setting up the market for negative returns, echoing past cycles of “capital destruction.” AI has captured the market’s imagination, with Cox and Abrudan noting, “it’s clear there is a lot of hype.” Web searches for AI are 10 times as high as they ever were for crypto, the bank said, citing Google Trends data, while it also finds that S&P 500 companies mentioned “AI” over 3,300 times in their earnings calls this past quarter. Stock valuations overall have soared alongside the “Magnificent Seven” tech firms, which collectively comprise a third of the S&P 500’s market cap. (The most magnificent: Nvidia, now the world’s most valuable company at a market cap exceeding $4 trillion.) Yet Deutsche Bank points out that today’s top tech players have healthier balance sheets and more resilient business models than the high flyers of the dotcom era. By most ratios, the bank said, valuations “still look more sober than those for hot stocks at the height of the dot-com bubble,” when the Nasdaq more than tripled in less than 18 months to March 2000, then lost 75% of its value by late 2002. By price-to-earnings ratio, Alphabet and Meta are in the mid-20x range, while Amazon and Microsoft trade in the mid-30x range. By comparison, Cisco surpassed 200x during the dotcom bubble, and even Microsoft reached 80x. Nvidia is “only” 50x, Deutsche Bank noted. Despite the relative restraint in share prices, AI’s real risk may be lurking away from its stock-market valuations, in the economics of its infrastructure. Deutsche Bank cites a blog post by Praetorian Capital “that has been doing the rounds.” The post in “Kuppy’s Korner,” named for the fund’s CEO Harris “Kuppy” Kupperman, estimates that hyperscalers’ total data-center spending for 2025 could hit $400 billion, and the bank notes that is roughly the size of the GDP of Malaysia or Egypt. The problem, according to the hedge fund, is that the data centers will depreciate by roughly $40 billion per year, while they currently generate no more than $20 billion of annual revenue. How is that supposed to work? “Now, remember, revenue today is running at $15 to $20 billion,” the blog post says, explaining that revenue needs to grow at least tenfold just to cover the depreciation. Even assuming future margins rise to 25%, the blog post estimates that the sector would require a stunning $160 billion in annual revenue from the AI powered by those data centers just to break even on depreciation—and nearly $480 billion to deliver a modest 20% return on invested capital. For context, even giants like Netflix and Microsoft Office 365 at their peaks brought in less than a fraction of that figure. Even at that level, “you’d need $480 billion of AI revenue to hit your target return … $480 billion is a LOT of revenue for guys like me who don’t even pay a monthly fee today for the product.” Going from $20 billion to $480 billion could take a long time, if ever, is the implication, and sometime before the big AI platforms reach those levels, their earnings, and presumably their shares, could take a hit. Deutsche Bank itself isn’t as pessimistic. The bank notes that the data-center buildout is producing a greatly reduced cost for each use of an AI model, as startups are reaching “meaningful scale in cloud consumption.” Also, consumer AI such as ChatGPT and Gemini is growing fast, with OpenAI saying in August that ChatGPT had over 700 million weekly users, plus 5 million paying business users, up from 3 million three months earlier. The cost to query an AI model (subsidized by the venture capital sector, to be sure) has fallen by around 99.7% in the two years since the launch of ChatGPT and is still headed downward. Praetorian Capital draws two historical parallels to the current situation: the dotcom era’s fiber buildout, which led to the bankruptcy of Global Crossing, and the more recent capital bust of shale oil. In each case, the underlying technology is real and transformative—but overzealous spending with little regard for returns could leave investors holding the bag if progress stalls. The “arms race” mentality now gripping the hyperscalers’ massive capex buildout mirrors the capital intensity of those past crises, and as Praetorian notes, “even the MAG7 will not be immune” if shareholder patience runs out. Per Kuppy’s Korner, “the megacap tech names are forced to lever up to keep buying chips, after having outrun their own cash flows; or they give up on the arms race, writing off the past few years of capex … Like many things in finance, it’s all pretty obvious where this will end up, it’s the timing that’s the hard part.” This cycle, Deutsche Bank argues, is being sustained by robust earnings and more conservative valuations than the dotcom era, but “periodic corrections are welcome, releasing some steam from the system and guarding against complacency.” If revenue growth fails to keep up with depreciation and replacement needs, investors may force a harsh reckoning—one characterized not by spectacular innovation but by a slow realization of negative returns. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Analyst Forecasts XRP To Stage Amazon-Like Rally To $200

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. XRP has drawn plenty of comparisons over the past few months, but one analyst believes the best way to understand its future is to look at Amazon’s past. Nick Anderson, better known as BULLRUNNERS on the social media platform X, says XRP is going through the same kind of consolidation Amazon faced in 2010, and it still has the potential to rally to $200. The key difference, however, is the patience investors will need before this rally can happen. XRP’s price action in the past seven days has been highlighted by a trading range between $2.8 and $2.9. The cryptocurrency now seems stuck within this range, but it has managed to hold above $2.8 for the meantime. Interestingly, Anderson likened this consolidation move to a similar retest of a previous high by the Amazon stock (AMZN) back in 2010. In his post, Anderson highlighted how Amazon stock spent roughly 3,800 days consolidating after the dot-com crash before finally breaking past its previous high and entering a meteoric run. However, before entering into this meteoric run, it consolidated for a few months in 2010 just after breaking above its previous high during the dot-com bubble. According to Anderson, XRP’s current structure is tracing out a massive cup and handle that mirrors this exact Amazon stock setup, with the cryptocurrency now using past highs as support in the same way Amazon did. Just as Amazon transformed once it cleared resistance, Anderson believes XRP could follow a similar breakout trajectory that could eventually push its price above $100, and possibly as high as $200. In his assessment, Anderson noted that this predicted rally to $200 might take many years to come to fruition. Comparing today’s price of around $2.80 to Amazon’s $5 launch point before its monumental rally, this would probably be the best time for XRP investors to accumulate for the long term. For younger investors, holding XRP for the next 10 to 15 years could prove transformative, with as little as 10,000 XRP amounting to $1 million in value if the cryptocurrency eventually climbs to $100. Despite his long-term forecast, Anderson is more cautious about what XRP might achieve this cycle. He stated that while a push to $100 in the near term would be “absolutely insane”, a more realistic target for this bull run could lie between $5 and $30. After that, he expects another correction to set in before the rally resumes sometime around the end of the decade. Anderson also left room for a more explosive scenario, noting that XRP could deliver what he called a “giga rally” if liquidity rushes into the market faster than expected. This is based on the growing anticipation around the adoption of ISO 20022 by the US Federal Reserve. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.81.

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. A market on a precipice. That’s the vibe around stocks right now, and I’m guessing you’ve felt it, too. On the one hand, the S&P 500 is up 14% in the past year, a very solid performance (and for the record, I see more gains ahead). Yet volatility has returned, and it feels like we could be on the verge of another selloff. So what do we do right now? We’re going to look at a closed-end fund (CEF) that profits from short-term volatility. In fact, this one harnesses the energy that choppy markets throw off and “converts” it to a hefty dividend stream. The result? This CEF takes the low-yielding (mainly) tech stocks in the NASDAQ 100 (average yield: 0.5%) and bumps that up to a solid 7.8% dividend. But I’m getting a bit ahead of myself. Before we go further, let me touch on why I feel that, over the long term, more gains are ahead for US stocks. For one, the value of long-term bonds has dropped, showing that investors still have a healthy appetite for risk, selling, as they are, some of the safest investments out there. Stocks (particularly tech stocks) are the obvious destination for these investors. At the same time, the stock market is backed up by the US economy’s continued strong growth. What’s important is what’s going on after the effects of inflation. In real terms, US GDP growth in 2025 has been around 2% on a year-over-year basis. It’s a solid clip that’s topped expectations, with many economists predicting less than 1% growth. Then there’s the most current economic estimate we have, the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow indicator, which shows growth accelerating, spiking to over 3% in the third quarter. What’s behind this expansion? AI, for one: Investments in the tech will hit $400 billion this year, up 60% from 2024—and they’re still growing fast. It’s clear that AI, whatever we may think about it, is a boon to the economy, and the momentum is not letting up. Of course, in the short term, investors will fret, which is why any downturns are buying opportunities. But what can we do now, with stocks having tempered their recent gains and before we see the next significant drop? This is where that CEF I mentioned earlier comes in: It sells call options, or the right for buyers to purchase its holdings at a fixed price and a fixed date in the future. It then uses that cash to fuel its 7.8% payout. It’s a nice dividend play while we wait for the next selloff to put stocks—and the “pure” equity-focused CEFs I prefer for the long run—back on sale. Tech stocks are perfect for covered-call selling because they’re sensitive to the kinds of panic selloffs we’re likely to see as AI optimism ebbs and flows, with an ebbing of sentiment seemingly around the corner. (For the record, though, in the long run, I see Big Tech’s AI investments as likely to be worth it—the productivity gains the technology offers are just too great.) The go-to covered-call fund here is the Nuveen NASDAQ 100 Dynamic Overwrite Fund (QQQX). Since it owns the NASDAQ 100, its portfolio is a who’s-who of companies driving the AI boom. NVIDIA (NVDA) is its biggest holding, at nearly 10% of the portfolio, followed by Microsoft (MSFT). The NASDAQ is up 90% over the last three years, while the S&P 500 is up just 63%, showing how much money there is to be made in investing in tech over the long term. But as you’ve no doubt noticed, the NASDAQ’s volatility is always higher, and can spike in times of panic, like what we saw during the April “tariff tantrum.” In short: Buying the NASDAQ is great, but you need nerves of steel while you hold it. That’s where QQQX comes in, “translating” that volatility into a regular quarterly dividend that gives investors that 7.8% income stream. That by itself is why QQQX is a strong candidate when market jitters push up volatility. But there’s another: QQQX is especially cheap now. Over the last decade, QQQX has had an average discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio) of 1.7%. It’s now 7.7%, and it was even lower in the last few months, averaging about 10% throughout 2024 and the first few months of this year. Why is it a bit narrower now? Because investors are realizing that QQQX’s investments continue to appreciate, as does its ability to boost dividends. Those strengths should help its discount to move toward par, where it traded in the 2010s. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Serious U.S. Dollar Fed Warning Issued As Bitcoin Mounts $24 Trillion Gold Price Challenge

ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin has surged this year, topping $124,000 per bitcoin in August as a growing crisis at the Federal Reserve takes a surprising turn. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market The bitcoin price has doubled since this time last year—with some now predicting bitcoin is on the brink of a $84 trillion shock—with the massive $4 trillion rally causing some of the world’s biggest celebrities to jump on the crypto bandwagon. Now, as the new crypto gold rush forges what could be the new “Rockefellers or Rothschilds,” Goldman Sachs analysts have warned the U.S. dollar’s global reserve-currency status could be eaten away by gold—just as bitcoin comes for its safe-haven asset crown. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run “A scenario where Fed independence is damaged would likely lead to higher inflation, lower stock and long-dated bond prices, and an erosion of the dollar’s reserve-currency status,” Goldman analysts including Samantha Dart wrote in a note to clients seen by Bloomberg. “In contrast, gold is a store of value that doesn’t rely on institutional trust.” Trump has been ramping up his war of words against the Federal Reserve this year, attacking Fed chair Jerome Powell as economists warn of a looming dollar disaster. Trump has threatened to fire Powell and tried to remove Fed governor Lisa Cook, sparking fears over the future of the Fed’s independence from the White House. Dart predicted the gold price could surge to $5,000 an ounce if U.S. president Donald Trump’s war on the Fed causes global investors to lose confidence in bonds, stocks, and the dollar, with only a small shift from the massive Treasuries market into bullion enough to trigger outsized gains. “As a result, gold remains our highest-conviction long recommendation in the commodities space," Dart wrote, adding, “we estimate that if 1% of the privately owned U.S. Treasury market were to flow into gold, the gold price would rise to nearly $5,000/[troy ounce], assuming everything else constant." Gold’s rally this year, climbing from $2,500 an ounce 12 months ago to $3,600 today and giving gold a $24 trillion market capitalization, has come alongside a bitcoin price boom that’s sent bitcoin, sometimes called digital gold, to record highs. “[Bitcoin] sits at the intersection of gold and equities—an emerging store of value that thrives when liquidity rotates into risk,” Matt Mena, crypto research strategist at 21Shares, said in emailed comments following the latest U.S. jobs report coming in below expectations, setting up the Federal Reserve to cut rates later this month as U.S. president Donald Trump has called for. “With $7.2 trillion in money market funds likely to move as yields fall, bitcoin offers the ultimate hybrid profile: digital gold for safety, and asymmetric upside as a risk-on asset. Seasonality also strengthens the setup, with the fourth quarter historically bitcoin’s strongest quarter—the asset has only seen two negative Octobers in its entire history— suggesting that as liquidity returns, buying pressure could accelerate into year-end.” Technical analysis comparing bitcoin to gold by Coindesk shows the bitcoin price could be headed for “a potential breakout by late in the fourth quarter or early next year.” Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market Meanwhile, the World Gold Council is developing a digitalized form of gold as fears grow that bitcoin could replace it as the world's safe-haven asset. "We are trying to standardise that digital layer of gold, such that the various financial products used in other markets can be used in the gold market going forward,” David Tait, a former banker and chief executive of the World Gold Council, an industry body representing gold miners, told the Financial Times. “My goal is that many asset managers around the world will suddenly look at it differently." Fears that bitcoin could overtake gold among investors seeking exposure to a scarce, non-governmental or corporate asset have been heightened by the rapid rise of bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which now hold almost as much in assets under management (AUM) as gold ETFs despite spot bitcoin ETFs only being launched at the beginning of 2024. "How long before AUM in 'digital gold’ ETFs surpasses physical? Bitcoin ETF assets are closing in on gold ETF assets," financial markets research company Bespoke’s account posted to X, pointing to data that showed they are now worth $150 billion and $180 billion, respectively.

Title: Musk holds hostage history’s biggest meme stock delusion
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/09/06/elon-musk-1-trillion-compensation-pay-package-tesla-shareholders-governance/
Time Published: 2025-09-06T11:30:00Z
Full Content:
Jeffrey Sonnenfeld is the Lester Crown Professor in Management Practice and Senior Associate Dean at Yale School of Management. Elon Musk has once again captured media attention. This time, however, it isn’t a rogue X rant or embittered comments about President Trump’s abuse of executive authority. Instead, a proposed $1 trillion pay package crafted by Tesla’s board and Musk has grabbed headlines. The proposed scheme is ludicrous not only in terms of the highly aspirational 12 milestones that would unlock the benefits, but also in terms of good governance practice. Even needing to support 14 children with four different mothers, how much capital does Musk need? The argument that Musk needs additional incentive to lead Tesla to new heights runs entirely counter to the fact that he owns nearly 20% of the company’s outstanding shares and will already be well rewarded from any upside in the company’s performance. If Tesla were to achieve an $8.5 trillion market cap, as outlined by one of the pay package milestones, Musk would be worth over $1.6 trillion, based on that current ownership stake. Musk is the richest person in the world (or second if you believe that number one is Vladimir Putin), and nearly twice as wealthy as the individuals ranked third and fourth, Larry Ellison and Mark Zuckerberg, respectively. Estimated to be worth over $437 billion, none of Musk’s lifestyle, resources, or influence will meaningfully change from any material increase in wealth. After threatening to walk away from Tesla earlier this year, Musk received a $30 billion pay package after a federal judge denied him a $50 billion package. It is shameful for Musk to now be holding shareholders hostage to suit his need for power. Renowned founders such as Bernie Marcus of Home Depot, Bill Gates of Microsoft, Michael Dell of Dell Technologies, Steve Schwarzman of Blackstone, Sam Walton of Walmart, and Larry Fink of BlackRock never fabricated shakedown strategies like this to regain more control of their companies after they went public. Moreover, should Musk act on his threat and leave Tesla, he would be the biggest loser as the largest shareholder of the biggest meme stock in financial market history. Tesla has a P/E ratio of over 200x, compared to the world’s most valuable company, Nvidia, at nearly 50x, so a 50% drop in the existing Tesla market cap of $1.1 trillion would result in a $110 billion loss in paper wealth, a quarter of Musk’s estimated worth. The performance milestones in the proposed pay package are both illusional and delusional. According to the proposal, Tesla is required to deliver 20 million vehicles, a significant increase from the 1.8 million delivered in 2024. The company must also distribute one million robots. They have not even developed a fully functional humanoid robot. Additional benchmarks require one million robotaxis to be placed into commercial operation, versus 30 on the roads today, and 10 million subscribers for its Full Self Driving service, compared to approximately 1 million in 2024. Most jarring are the mandates for the company to more than double the $4 trillion market cap of Nvidia and to notch $400 billion of adjusted EBITDA, versus $16.65 billion in 2024. Despite the absurdity of the performance package, the federal government does not need to intervene, as it has been so inclined to do lately. If stockholders do not like the proposed pay package, then they will vote against the proposal or sell their stock holdings. Of course, shareholders, not the government, should be asking important questions—of which there are many—about the necessity for such a rich payout and high ownership stake. One of those burning questions: If Musk preferred maintaining so much control, then why did he take Tesla public? The centrality of the chief executive to the success of the company is far more symbolic in the eyes of tech bros than it is substantive in the eyes of the average customer. In fact, as of late, he has been the most detrimental factor to the Tesla sales pipeline, which is on track to fall for the second year in a row. Sales in Europe have notably fallen by 40% year-over-year, ceding its dominant market position to Chinese EV automaker BYD for the first time. The Chinese market has been just as challenging for Tesla, which has experienced repeated sales declines over several months this year and has yielded more than half its market share to competitors since 2021. Many Tesla enthusiasts would be surprised to know that Musk did not create Tesla, but he squeezed out its first CEO, co-founder Martin Eberhard, along with Tesla’s other co-founder Marc Tarpenning. They were the ones who named the company for the brilliant, penniless inventor of alternating currents, wireless remote controls, and X-rays in 2003. The plunging sales of Telsa have been directly linked to a global consumer backlash after Musk’s endorsement of the German AFD party — considered a Nazi apologist group — and a U.S. consumer backlash against his DOGE initiative, a tornado of cruel, dangerous, self-interested destruction of vital federal agencies, in partisan service to President Trump. While Musk may be the greatest inventor of our time, his magic wand is overhyped. Most of his private companies, such as Neuralink, The Boring Company, X/Twitter, and SolarCity, have been a bust or seen lackluster performance. Solar City was a failure that got jammed down the throats of unrelated Tesla shareholders. It would take a lot of nerve to celebrate the delayed success of Neuralink. X/Twitter’s value collapsed after Musk took control. At least there is truth in advertising for the Boring Company. It lives up to its name by failing to connect the scores of cities with high speed tunnels that were promised years ago. SpaceX has seen success primarily due to a stable flow of government contracts and subsidies, and the steady operating hand of President and Chief Operating Officer Gwynne Shotwell. xAI has potential but its Grok chatbot raised many concerns when it began spewing pro-Nazi/Hitler and antisemitic pronouncements soon after Musk tampered with the large language model’s algorithm. The board is suffering from what political scientists and psychologists call “groupthink,” psychiatrists label folie à deux, social workers call “codependence,” and normal people recognize as an infatuation with a charismatic, cultish powerful figure. We have seen this happen before at Viacom with Sumner Redstone and CBS with Bill Paley. We’ve seen it with Ken Olsen at Digital Equipment Corporation, once the world’s second-largest tech company but no longer in business. And we saw it with Juan Trippe at Pan American World Airways, the now-defunct pioneer of transoceanic travel that was once America’s flagship carrier. The original nationwide coffee house pioneer, William Black, ran the Chock full O’Nuts chain that he founded into his mid-80s when he was flat on his back in the hospital while his full-time physician and lifelong friend served as the president. Those boards followed such charismatic CEOs, who lived on the edge, until they ran right off the cliff.

Ireland and Hungary go head-to-head in a FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifier in Dublin on Saturday evening. Both sides will be searching for a positive start to their Group F campaign, in an intriguing group that also contains Portugal and Armenia. Ireland manager Heimir Hallgrímsson has named a 23-man squad for the games against Hungary and Armenia, although there are some notable absences. Captain Seamus Coleman has been left out after being an unused substitute in Everton’s opening three Premier League matches this season. The experienced defender has not featured since withdrawing from the June friendlies through injury. Gavin Bazunu and Chiedozie Ogbene return to the squad after lengthy injury layoffs. Bazunu has recovered from knee surgery to reclaim his place at Southampton, while Ogbene is back for the first time since rupturing his Achilles tendon in October 2024. Celtic defender Liam Scales is available to play after rolling his ankle against Rangers at the weekend, while Johnny Kenny has come in as attacking cover after Troy Parrott pulled out of the squad. Nathan Collins will captain the side in Coleman’s absence, with Caoimhín Kelleher providing experience in goal after his move from Liverpool to Brentford. However, Robbie Brady, Callum O’Dowda and Festy Ebosele all miss out through injury. Read – The mind-blowing numbers behind record-breaking transfer window Hungary manager Marco Rossi has named a larger-than-usual 27-man squad, including four potential debutants. The Italian coach has emphasised selecting players in good form, with Barna Tóth, Rajmund Molnár, Dániel Lukács and Bence Ötvös all earning their first call-ups. Liverpool star Dominik Szoboszlai will captain the side, with the 24-year-old having been Hungary’s talisman since taking over the armband in November 2022. However, there are concerns over Hungary’s over-reliance on their skipper, with the team struggling when he is marked out of games. Milos Kerkez, Willi Orbán and András Schäfer provide experience in the squad, while striker Barnabás Varga remains a key attacking threat. Rossi has stressed the importance of starting the campaign well against a physical Irish side. Read – The biggest Champions League omissions as squad lists announced Hallgrímsson’s side have shown gradual improvement since replacing Stephen Kenny in the hot seat last year. They secured their League B status in the UEFA Nations League, defeating Bulgaria 4-2 on aggregate in a relegation playoff. Their most recent friendlies both ended in stalemates against Senegal (1-1) and Luxembourg (0-0), highlighting their struggles in front of goal. Marco Rossi’s team endured a difficult Nations League campaign, finishing bottom of Group A3. They were relegated after losing 6-1 on aggregate to Turkey in the promotion/relegation playoffs. Recent friendlies brought mixed results, with a 2-1 win over Azerbaijan and a 0-2 defeat to Sweden.

Title: Ether ETFs see $788M in outflows: what’s going on?

Time Published: 2025-09-06T09:17:42Z

US-based spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw four straight days of net outflows during the shortened trading week following Labor Day, reversing some of the momentum that had built up in August. The funds shed a total of $787.6 million between Tuesday and Friday, with the sharpest move on Friday when $446.8 million exited the products, according to data from Farside. Over the same period, Bitcoin ETFs saw $250.3 million in net inflows. The weekly reversal comes after a strong August for Ether ETFs, which attracted $3.87 billion in inflows. Bitcoin ETFs, in contrast, recorded $751 million in outflows during the month. Despite the recent weakness, several market participants remain bullish on Ether’s outlook. On Wednesday, BitMine chairman Tom Lee reiterated his forecast that ETH could eventually reach $60,000. Speaking on the Medici Presents: Level Up podcast, he said Wall Street’s growing interest in the token could become a “1971 moment” for the asset, a reference to the US ending the gold standard and ushering in a new financial era. BitMine is the largest Ether treasury company, holding about $8.04 billion worth of ETH, according to data from StrategicETHReserve. Collectively, Ether treasury companies now control 2.97% of the token’s circulating supply, valued at $15.49 billion at the time of publication. Supporting that outlook, blockchain analytics firm Santiment noted that large Ether holders have steadily increased their positions. Wallets holding between 1,000 and 100,000 ETH — worth between $4.31 million and $430.63 million — have grown their balances by 14% since April, when ETH touched yearly lows. “In exactly 5 months, they have added 14.0% more coins,” Santiment said in a post on X. The firm suggested that the accumulation trend could provide underlying support for the asset even as ETF flows fluctuate. Ether traded at $4,313 on Saturday, while Bitcoin stood at $110,238. The diverging ETF flows highlight shifting sentiment between the two largest cryptocurrencies as traders weigh the impact of macroeconomic conditions, regulatory clarity, and institutional adoption. While short-term flows have turned negative, Ether’s strong August performance and continued interest from institutional players suggest that investors remain divided on whether the latest moves mark a pause or the start of a broader rotation back into Bitcoin.

Resources from this episode: Ben Greenfield [00:00:00]: My name is Ben Greenfield, and on this episode of the Boundless Life podcast. Jordan Rubin [00:00:04]: I immediately realized this isn't leaves that the Bible is talking about. This specifically is a leaf from a fruit tree. And as soon as that passage of scripture came out of the app into my ears, I felt God say with as audible of a voice as I have ever heard, this is it. Ben Greenfield [00:00:27]: Welcome to the Boundless Life with me, your host, Ben Greenfield, personal trainer, exercise physiologist, and nutritionist. And I'm passionate about helping you discover unparalleled levels of health, fitness, longevity, and beyond. Ben Greenfield [00:00:48]: Right before I started recording, I was telling my podcast guest that the family and I like to memorize Bible verses, and we're working through Psalms right now. Psalm 139, he said they have a psalm. He and his family have a psalm that they recite. I think you said, Jordan, every night at dinner. Jordan Rubin [00:01:06]: Every night when we're together, Ben, which is not every night, but we try to do it, yes. Ben Greenfield [00:01:11]: And you said it's a Psalm of protection. Jordan Rubin [00:01:15]: Yes, Psalm 91. And there have been at least three books written about those who recite Psalm 91 and avoiding major catastrophes when others around them were dying. So, yeah, very cool stuff. But, yeah, Psalm 91, I would call it a moderate length psalm, very worth memorizing. And the man who helped me get well, taught me to eat and live from the Bible in 1996, used to have all of his kids quote this every morning before homeschool. So it kind of stuck with me for the last 31 years. And almost every day we quote it together as a family or we'll sort of popcorn where one person says part of it and the next person. So it's kind of. Jordan Rubin [00:02:00]: Kind of cool, but it is. It is one of the things we do. And at dinner when we're together. Ben Greenfield [00:02:05]: I won't put you on the spot and have you do the whole thing right now, but what's your favorite verse or one of your favorite verses from Psalm 91? Jordan Rubin [00:02:11]: Well, what I like to do with Psalm 91 because I really believe that faith and imagination are one and the same. So Psalm 91 is sort of like an action psalm. It talks about treading on serpents and scorpions. So what I like to say or what I like to do is think about myself living it out. But the best for me is, "He will give his angels charge over you to keep you in all your ways. They will bear you up in their hands so you don't dash your foot against a stone." So I kind of picture myself falling off a cliff, angels catching me and having a soft Superman-like landing. You know how Superman in the old days had his back foot kicked up and all that with the Christopher Reeve version. Ben Greenfield [00:02:56]: Right, maybe with the fist going down into the ground. Jordan Rubin [00:02:59]: Yeah, maybe not that much, but yeah, that's more like, I will tread upon the lion and the adder, the young lion and the dragon while I trample underfoot. That's more of the violent kicking and punching part. Ben Greenfield [00:03:09]: Yeah, yeah. I'm reading a book right now called Experiencing Jesus by John Eldredge, and he also has an app, like a guided prayer app that I just love. And he actually, in last night's reading was talking about how in some, I guess it would be almost like Jewish lore, serpents and scorpions would be associated with what a lot of people are talking about now, maybe thanks to guys like Joe Rogan, the nephilim, fallen angels, demons, spirits, et cetera. So it's almost as though that psalm would be like a protective prayer for going to battle against the spirits of the dark world. Jordan Rubin [00:03:46]: Well, yeah, it is funny you should mention that because a lot of this has been happening to me as well. And I'm in a men's prayer and Bible study group with my old high school friends and I just read Waking the Dead. And then we did Wild at Heart for the umpteenth time last month. So, yeah, so we're, we're, we're John Eldridging it as well over here. Ben Greenfield [00:04:10]: He's been on the podcast, if you guys are listening. Well, this is Jordan Rubin, who I'm talking with right now. I haven't given Jordan an introduction yet, but I will shortly. John Eldredge is the other guy we're talking about. And if you want some good devotionals, devotional apps, and you want a little bit, I guess, more of almost like a, a mystical, personal relationship with Jesus. I love his writings for just taking one out of the didactic and deep into the spiritual, soulful experience of Jesus. So highly recommend his stuff and I'll put a link to my interview with him in the show notes. Jordan, though, is my guest today. Ben Greenfield [00:04:49]: 3-peat - did you know this is the third time, Jordan? Jordan Rubin [00:04:51]: Yes. Ben Greenfield [00:04:52]: Yeah. Yeah. So our first one was about ducks and chickens and yaks and cows and eating locusts. And we actually touched on Bible-based eating in that first podcast. And then we did another one where you just basically fed me and the audience through the fire hose about how to start your own farm and grow your own food and grow crazy things on mushrooms and your insane productivity habits and your spiritual routines. So this third time around, I was inspired to invite you because you finished this book with another former podcast guest and friend of mine, Dr. Josh Axe. The Biblio Diet. Ben Greenfield [00:05:29]: I think the name kind of gives it away. A diet and lifestyle plan inspired by biblical principles. Just so those of, you know, opening the kimono. Jordan and I had a phone call maybe four weeks ago and he was explaining to me some crazy things he's been studying up on and learning about. Fruit leaves, of all things. And I was so intrigued by that that I wanted to touch on that in today's show, but also just cover some of the important principles in this book. Jordan is an OG in the industry. He's the founder of Garden of Life, Beyond Organic, Ancient Nutrition. Ben Greenfield [00:06:02]: He is one of America's most recognized and respected natural health experts. New York Times bestselling author of over 30 books. And this latest one, the Biblio Diet, is fantastic. If you've ever wondered how to eat the way that perhaps God intended us to. So, Jordan, welcome back for this third time, man. Jordan Rubin [00:06:22]: Thanks for having me - excited. Ben Greenfield [00:06:24]: Yeah, I want to jump right in to the thing that I don't want to run out of time to talk about. And what, like I mentioned, got me most intrigued to interview you for this book. This whole idea of healing leaves your entire chapter, chapter 14 is about it. Tell me about your inspiration to get into this. Jordan Rubin [00:06:41]: It's interesting that we talk about this now because, Ben, as you'll remember, when we were having our phone call, I said this is not enough time to share with you the most powerful revelation I have ever received about health. And I say that because it is a big deal. Having overcome inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's colitis and cancer to now, after all that time, receive this revelation. Not to mention the fact that I, you and so many of us have read the Bible back and forth, cover to cover dozens and I think I'm over a hundred times. And yet it wasn't until 2019 when two powerful scriptures leapt off the pages and changed my life forever and I believe changed my future forever, which is pretty amazing for a book that was written thousands of years ago. Ben Greenfield [00:07:32]: All right, so I know we didn't have a lot of time in our phone call for you to cover this. I think we had 20 minutes and you were doing the two year catch up with me. But we have time right now. So tell me about these verses and the inspiration. Jordan Rubin [00:07:44]: Yeah, so this is going to be in the area of mystical, as you called it earlier, if you're referring to certain writings. But my wife, Nikki, who by the way, is a retired CPA, I'm setting the stage because she is not a forest-through-the- trees visionary by trade. However, God has gotten a hold of her and given her some pretty amazing—what she would refer to—as downloads. And in the summer of 2018, so we're dating back, she tells me that she had a God idea. Now, she didn't say it was a prophecy. She didn't say it was a word from the Lord. She said it was a God idea. And she heard herself asking God a question: "Is Jordan going to discover the cure for cancer and win a Nobel Prize?" Now, Ben, I know what that sounds like. Ben Greenfield [00:08:43]: Yeah, obviously, like half the internet snickers when they hear that because everybody says the cure for cancer. So you've got quite a defense to make. Jordan Rubin [00:08:51]: Yes, I'm sharing it exactly as she said it. Now, what's interesting is she felt like this God idea happened six months prior to her sharing it with me, which was December of 2018. And when she did share it with me, my reaction was actually frustration, not jubilation. I mean, here I have this information from my wife, who I trust immensely if anyone's going to tell me God said anything—I have learned that Nikki is one who is very discerning and wise, and a lot of us should know that about our wives if we don't. So she says it to me. I'm frustrated. The reason I was frustrated, Ben, is that I was able to, through God's supernatural power and natural healing, conquer cancer myself... Jordan Rubin [00:09:41]: ...in 2008, when I was given a 0% chance to live. Not one, not two, zero. Like the doctor said, there's a 100% chance you'll be dead in three months if you don't undergo chemo and a very invasive surgery and possibly radiation. And I didn't, and God healed me. But before I get into that, let me finish the healing leaves message. So I'm frustrated because I have spent the better part of my life at this point in 2019 helping people overcome cancer, studying, researching, you name it. It has been a huge topic of mine, including overcoming cancer myself. So for me to hear that there's some cure for cancer, my immediate thought was, well, if it's a medicine, 99% of the world can't afford it or they're not insured. Jordan Rubin [00:10:33]: If it's an Amazonian rainforest herb, it's probably rare and most people can't afford it or procure it - Ben Greenfield [00:10:40]: - or it's not sustainable environmentally. Jordan Rubin [00:10:43]: Exactly. So I stopped thinking about it. And it wasn't until four months later, April 19, I remember the day, 2019. I was in my sauna, which I call my prayer sauna or prayer closet. And so when I'm in my sauna, I often listen to the Bible on an app more than I read it. I don't want to sweat on the Bible, first of all, but it's just great to be an audible learner, and I like to use technology for good whenever I can. So I'm listening to Ezekiel, which some would consider a boring book in the Old Testament, but it gets to Ezekiel in the 40s. And Ezekiel is describing a scene where there's a temple or a sanctuary, there's water coming from the temple, there's trees on both sides of the stream or river that the water forms. Jordan Rubin [00:11:34]: And I almost went multitask because I've heard this next verse so many times. Ezekiel 47:12. It says: "The fruit will be for food and the leaves for healing." Now, Ben, I've read herbal books that are not biblically based, and almost every one of them will quote this verse just as a quote unquote proverb, you know, like an African proverb or an Indian proverb. And then they'll go on to say, therefore, since the leaves are for healing, you should consume spinach and parsley and kale. Ben Greenfield [00:12:11]: You mean basically interpreting it as eat salads and dark leafy greens? Jordan Rubin [00:12:15]: Exactly. And over and over again, when I've read this and I'm talking about herbal OGs like Dr. James Duke and others who are not necessarily writing from a Christian perspective, they are just simply saying all cultures believe in leaves. Well, the truth of the matter is because I have understood the difference between a perennial plant like a tree or a bush, and an annual plant like a carrot or kale or spinach, where you plant it once, disrupt the soil, harvest it, et cetera, I immediately realized this isn't leaves that the Bible is talking about. This specifically is a leaf from a fruit tree. And as soon as that passage of scripture came out of the app into my ears, I felt God say with as audible of a voice as I have ever heard, "This is it." So four months after my wife's God idea, I'm listening to Ezekiel 47:12: "The fruit will be for food and the leaves for healing." And I walk out of the sauna and I tell my wife, I said, "Nikki, I know my life's purpose." Jordan Rubin [00:13:26]: Because, Ben, I immediately realized that the word that Nikki received—this answer for cancer—was not going to be found in a medicine or in an Amazonian superfood. It was found in one of the most ubiquitous, largely resourced trash that people allow to be composted or pay to take off their property: fruit tree leaves. And I began to research the ancient Hebrew language to understand two things. One, what is a tree? Because would it only include bananas and apples? And did it have to be 30ft tall? What about a bush? What about a vine? What about a shrub? And number two, and most importantly, the verse or the word that says healing—could it be mistranslated because it says the fruit is for food and the leaves for healing? I've heard people mistranslate Bible quotes all the time. Now, this word, teruphah or terupah means healing, medicine, or cure. That is all it could mean. And here I am, someone who has written at the time, I want to say, 15 books on biblical nutrition, including the Maker's Diet. And I didn't realize that Ezekiel 47:12 and later in the Bible, Revelation 22, verse 2, which says, "The leaves are for the healing of the nations." Jordan Rubin [00:14:58]: Could this be more than spiritual allegory? Could this be a physical truth that has been hidden in plain sight? And Ben, I took it at the ladder, and I began to study over 1500 fruit trees and order fruit tree leaves from all over the world. And when I say order, I mean call a mango orchard and say, "Can I buy some leaves?" Ben Greenfield [00:15:23]: I was going to say, is there like a fruittreeleaf.com or are you just basically organically hunting these down? Jordan Rubin [00:15:29]: Oh, hunting them down. Because what was interesting is that out of the top 25 herbs and spices, zero would be fruit tree leaves. This is literally thrown away, cast aside, ignored. But yet I believe it unlocks the key to cancer, longevity, and 68 other conditions or systems of the body that I've studied. And I began to procure these leaves. First, I was laughed at calling a mango orchard to bug them about buying some fruit tree leaves which aren't for sale because they're composted or hauled off and. And them sending me a FedEx envelope with some napkins in between these big green leaves was interesting enough, But I started to put this message to work. And because in Revelation 22, verse 2, it says the tree of life, which contains 12 fruits, the leaves are for the healing of the nations. Jordan Rubin [00:16:28]: I combined 12 fruit tree leaves. Some are very familiar, some are exotic. And I made what you would call a tea or a decoction. But because there's no green, black, or white tea. It's more specifically called an herbal infusion. And that's what I did. And I noticed, Ben, even though I am blessed to be healthy now, I noticed some subtle improvements in joints, in skin. But it got really exciting when I was faced with a young man sitting in front of me in Kenya. Jordan Rubin [00:17:06]: He was from the Netherlands, asking me to pray for him as he was battling terminal cancer. He had a sarcoma of the femur. He was 6'2", 110 pounds, I'm guessing, wasting away, lost his hair, looked as white as a ghost. And in my carnal mind, or I'll say in the natural, I believed I would pray for this boy, and if he didn't do something drastically different, he was going to die. I've seen it dozens of times before. He was wasting away, emaciated, and when I prayed with him and his parents, he was in tears. And then he offered a simple prayer that was a combination of weeping and screaming where he yelled out, "God help me!" And I've gotta tell you, Ben, I've said a lot of long prayers in my life, but I may have never heard the most sincere, desperate prayer, which were three words: "God help me." Jordan Rubin [00:18:08]: Now, I want to fast forward a little bit because this story gets really interesting, but I felt led to not only pray for this young man, but as his parents asked me, "Can I help him with his health?" Even though I was fighting thoughts of, they live in the Netherlands, I'm in the United States, do they have the products I would recommend? Do they have the foods? Can they even get my book? But all of that seemed to work out and over WhatsApp. In the course of, I want to say 90 to 120 days, this young man went from emaciated and sick, undergoing chemotherapy, to telling the oncologist, they are quitting chemotherapy and God's going to heal them. And by the way, the oncologist said, "We've heard this many times before. And everyone who said it is dead." They said, "You are committing suicide." And they said to his parents, his name was Jethro, his parents, they said, "You are killing your son. If you go off conventional treatment and you come back to us, which you will, we likely can't save your leg or save your life." And I'll spare all the amazing details for time's sake, but over the course of 90 to 120 days, Jethro was healed, healthy and whole, cancer free. Jordan Rubin [00:19:33]: And in an amazing twist of I'll say destiny, ended up becoming a foreign exchange student living with me in Tennessee during COVID—you can picture all this. He left at 6'4", 200 pounds, ready to share his story with the world. And it's just an exciting testament to believing God's word, believing in his creation, that he gave us everything we need for healing. And Ben, the craziest part, he was the second person perhaps ever—other than me—to consume what I now call healing leaves. And his doctors, who once said he was committing suicide, said they have never seen a result like this before, where his PET scan was lit up like a Christmas tree with metastatic cancer and a tumor in his leg the size of a baseball. Now cancer free. And I have since shared it with about 40 to 50 others. And really today we're sharing it with the world and soon in The Biblio Diet. Jordan Rubin [00:20:42]: And I have made a decision to devote a big portion of my life to getting this message out there. Because ultimately, Ben, healing leaves taste like black tea or green tea. The poorest people in the world have the greatest access to fruit tree leaves. Most people have them in their backyard or their local forest. And there's no 12 leaves that you need. Any 12 leaves from fruit trees will do. And I have seen—first and secondhand—miracles from consuming this beverage that I hope will be on everybody's kitchen table, everybody's morning routine, everyone's pantry and cupboard. And best of all, if you're someone who calls on the name of the Lord and believes He is your savior, then this is going to glorify God in a huge way. Jordan Rubin [00:21:34]: So I am beyond excited. And that is why I made a personal call to you and said, "Ben, I really would be honored if we could share this with your audience," because you have shared many amazing biohacks, many amazing remedies, superfoods, and supplements. But I can tell you there is nothing on earth that God calls the healing of the nations other than fruit tree leaves. And for that reason, plus some pretty cool science, I'm going to shout it from the rooftops every chance I get. Ben Greenfield [00:22:07]: I have so many questions and honestly, I don't care if we don't get to any other part of the book except this. I definitely want to focus in on this because I think it's the most unique thing that you and I have talked about recently. Let's put the science hats on and talk about the proposed mechanism of action behind this. Like what is going on biochemically in terms of the composition of a fruit leaf that makes you suspect that it's having some type of an anti cancer or a cytotoxic effect to cancer cells? Jordan Rubin [00:22:36]: Well, it's a great question. And fortunately there has been some data on fruit tree leaves, even though there has been a lot less than turmeric and ashwagandha and all of these cool herbs that people are so excited about. But if you look into fruit tree leaves, most of them contain 60 to 300 different compounds. And some of them are more familiar than others, by the way—and I'm not talking about orange, apple and banana only. This is expanded to nuts. It's expanded to fruits that only natives have consumed that are not commonly commercialized. So I'm literally talking about oak trees, walnut trees, hazelnut trees, because nuts are fruits as well, along with aronia berries and things like persimmon and pawpaw. Jordan Rubin [00:23:28]: I call them America's forgotten superfoods. Of course, soursop or graviola, which has been a little bit popular for its anti-cancer benefits. What about olive and grape? But to answer your question, in the leaves you find compounds that are antimicrobial, antiparasitic, -fungal, -viral and -bacterial. They lower blood sugar, they boost immunity, and reduce inflammation with all of the nutrients found in fruits and none of the sugar. And some of these include ellagic acid and other ellagitannins. So we've heard of urolithin A and there's other urolithins, ellagic acid found in walnut leaf, raspberry leaf and pomegranate leaf, along with many berry leaves, contributes to health in many ways. Number one, and in no particular order, it helps balance blood sugar by shuttling glucose into muscles and out of circulation to prevent insulin insensitivity and body fat deposition. So it is a muscle booster. Ben Greenfield [00:24:36]: I may interrupt you a few times as you go through this, but it sounds to me so far I've heard two things, Jordan. The first is that it sounds like you're a believer in the terrain hypothesis of cancer. That when you say something is antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, controls mold, mycotoxins, et cetera. That one of the reasons that people get cancer is because their internal environment is ridden with virus, bacteria, mold, fungi, et cetera. Essentially they've weakened their ability to be able to fight off cancer due to a poor terrain. Am I following you correctly on that? Jordan Rubin [00:25:13]: I believe that that is definitely a component. And in fact, I think all of those areas—inflammation, weakened immune system, and certainly microbial imbalance—and in fact, I think you and I and many others have seen a litany of testimonials for those who are undergoing cancer treatment or a cancer diagnosis they're battling using traditional antiparasitic, which are really immune modulating off-market drugs like ivermectin and mebendazole and even the animal or veterinary dewormer, fenbendazole and fruit tree leaves actually contain similar benefits to animals and humans as those antiparasitics. And in fact, Ben, we give fruit tree leaves to our water buffalo, cattle, to our sheep and to our goats in lieu of dewormers. So there's absolutely that component. And ellagitannins, one compound in fruit tree leaves can be not only contributory to balancing blood sugar, but also they in and of themselves can be antiparasitic and antifungal and, but also ellagitannins or ellagic acid can cause apoptosis in cancer cells, which is natural programmed killing or programmed cell death. So in cell lines, ellagic acid from walnut, raspberry and pomegranate can cause a destruction of cancer cells. And this is just the beginning. Jordan Rubin [00:26:49]: I mentioned oak trees. Ben, you might not know this, but quercetin, which is a powerful flavonoid, is not only found in fruit tree leaves, but it was named after its inclusion in oak tree leaves, which is of the quercus genus. So oaks are quercus this or quercus that, depending on if it's a red oak, a white oak, et cetera. So quercetin is another compound. And really the list goes on and on. There's chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, gallic acid. There's hydroxytyrosol in olive leaves. There's oleuropin and other compounds. Jordan Rubin [00:27:29]: The list goes on and on. And what's great about fruit tree leaves is that there are common phytonutrients in similar fruit tree leaves, but there's also very unique compounds that you would find in a mango leaf that you wouldn't find in a blueberry leaf. However, odds are if you combine 12 fruit tree leaves that are somewhat dissimilar, meaning you don't want to have all stone fruits like apricot, peach, cherry, plum, because they're going to have more similar compounds. You want variety, if at all possible. And that's what we've done on our farms and in The Biblio Diet, particularly chapter 14, Healing Leaves, which you're referring to. We give people a list of leaves, we help people forage for leaves. Because, Ben, you're going to hopefully get off this podcast treadmill and you would find 12 leaves on your property through a little plant finder or herb finder app. And you could be drinking healing leaves in an hour, if not making healing leaves kombucha, which would take a little longer. Ben Greenfield [00:28:42]: Yeah, I actually want to ask you about this whole idea of 12 leaves, but before I do, the second thing I was going to say related to the onset of cancer and mechanism of actions that based on the insulin sensitizing aspects of some of these leaves. I'm guessing you also believe in this metabolic theory of cancer, that cancer cells particularly engage in heptiglucose utilization and lactic acid production, and that by somehow limiting the amount of glucose available to cancer cells or improving insulin sensitivity, we might be able to control that; hence, why there's so many recommendations for people who have cancer to limit glucose, sugar, and starches and consider even more of like a ketogenic approach. Jordan Rubin [00:29:23]: Absolutely. And what's great, Ben, is that by consuming fruit tree leaf tea prior to a meal, it severely restricts postprandial glucose increase, which is simply saying if you wear a CGM and you test your blood after a meal, if you've consumed healing leaves tea, if you want to call it that, you will have a blunted blood sugar spike and you're going to get all those other benefits that we already mentioned. It is amazing for metabolism, would be amazing for weight loss. And I think as crazy as this sounds, calling it an answer to cancer only greatly restricts its utility. Because I've seen three people in the last few months drink strictly mulberry leaf tea, and that's one of our favorite healing leaves of the Bible. They have either reduced or completely eliminated insulin. And these are long term—I don't like to say diabetics because I don't like to label people—but people who are battling diabetes over the long term, and two of them had a mulberry tree or bush in their backyard. Jordan Rubin [00:30:37]: They literally went in their backyard, pulled leaves off a tree, put them in water, heated it up, consumed it every day, and now they are either off or on a greatly reduced insulin intake. Amazing. Ben Greenfield [00:30:51]: And I like that it's kind of cheap. I get called out a lot for the, "Ben, I got to buy $100,000 hyperbaric cold infusion, you know, hydrogen unit to pull this off?" So, you know, planting trees is not expensive. It's still beyond what a lot of people like to do, which is just pop pills. But you've got some other—a couple of the practical things that you mentioned. You said 12 leaves. Ben Greenfield [00:31:14]: Are we—are you saying that I need to go to 12 different fruit trees and select 12 different leaves and combine them? Are you saying each time I make tea, I just use 12 leaves of whatever tree? Jordan Rubin [00:31:27]: It's a great question. I believe there's more power in the 12 different fruit tree leaves because again, if you look at Revelation, chapter 22, verse 2, it's similar to Ezekiel. It talks about a sanctuary, a river, but in this case, it talks about the Tree of Life. And Ben, for us Bible geeks, the Tree of Life was meant to provide eternal longevity. And listen, a lot of our friends and colleagues are trying to live to 120 or beyond. But when Adam and Eve sinned and got kicked out of the Garden of Eden, you probably remember there were cherubim that guarded the Tree of Life so that man could not reach his hand out and live forever. That is right out of Scripture. I can also tell you another time how the fall of man or man's sin is causing the destruction of our planet. Jordan Rubin [00:32:23]: And what some refer to as climate change is all part of that curse of man. And we are in the process of proving that that can be reversed through. I'll say this is going to sound heavy to some of your listeners, but the blood of Jesus and him taking those keys back and reversing that curse. So I am walking proof and living proof that we can rebuild our bodies and the planet. And it's kind of in the same methodology of planting these fruit trees. And that's exactly what we've done. But to answer your question, I prefer 12 different fruit tree leaves, like Revelation 22, two mentions, because there are 12 fruits on the Tree of Life. And I do think you'll get benefits from consuming one or two leaves. Jordan Rubin [00:33:14]: But when I work with people, and it's almost always severely ill people, I recommend 12 different fruit tree leaves. And I've been making this for people from my own leaves for the last several years. So that, I think is the most powerful array of phytonutrients or phytochemicals in those 12 fruit tree leaves. Ben Greenfield [00:33:36]: Okay. So for a guy like me, because I live on 12 acres, I've already— Jordan Rubin [00:33:38]: —Perfect number there, Ben— Ben Greenfield [00:33:40]: —apple. Yeah. Cherry, peach, apple and pear. And I could take like my Plant Snap app on my phone. I could walk around and look at a few other plants, identify whether or not they would fit into the category of trees. Let's say I identify eight more. So I'm harvesting those leaves and systematically kind of creating this tea on a daily basis. And I want to talk about the tea shortly. Ben Greenfield [00:34:03]: But let's say somebody lives in a highly urban environment. Is there a place that they could go—and let's say they don't want herbicides and pesticides and crap on their leaves where they could literally just order leaves of 12 different kinds? Jordan Rubin [00:34:16]: Yeah, you would want to go to one of those herbal companies. There's Mountain Rose herbs, there's Starwest. These are kind of bulk herb companies. And you can piece that together. Unsurprisingly, Ben, because I planted 600,000 fruit trees, we are working on creating products out of healing leaves and have been for years. They're not currently available, but if someone wants more information on the types of leaves we recommend and perhaps where to find them, The Biblio Diet book will have it and it's available for order. However, we are giving away, Ben, that chapter 14 you referenced for free to anyone who wants to log on to thebibliodiet.com so we have a download of chapter 14, Healing Leaves. Jordan Rubin [00:35:04]: It's free and it'll give a little more insight into the benefits, the health conditions that we believe healing leaves can help you fight. And some of our top leaves to find. But if you do a simple search, you can find a majority of fruit tree leaves, from strawberry to blackberry to blueberry to bilberry to soursop and many other species. But in your case, Ben—and I have not been to your home—I'm guessing you also have some evergreens, perhaps like juniper, which is from the cedar family, and pine. Many species of pine produce fruit. Juniper produces berries. Those two are amazing additions to healing leaves, even though their leaves are less leaf-like and more needle like. Ben Greenfield [00:35:55]: Okay, okay, got it. You mentioned this tea. So let's say I get my leaves, I'm going to make this tea. What's the best way to make the tea? And remember, we're talking to people who don't have like two hours in the kitchen. They want the fastest, easiest way to consume these things. Jordan Rubin [00:36:10]: The easiest way is to just make it like a loose leaf tea where you put the leaves—and the ratio that I recommend is usually 1 tablespoon of dried leaves for each of the 12. Grab a pot. I would like to say a 2 and a half quart pot, but think of a pot where you make spaghetti. So you're gonna fill it with water. You're gonna put either a tablespoon of each of 12 leaves or more if they're fresh. The dried leaves will crunch into about 12 tablespoons. Don't worry if you overdo it, no big deal. Jordan Rubin [00:36:41]: And you wanna bring the water to a boil with the leaves in it, pour it through a colander after you let it simmer for a little bit. And I make two weeks at a time. So I literally will go in with a big old stock pot and I will fill it to the top with lots of water and leaves. I will bring it to a boil, I will simmer it for 12 minutes, I'll let it cool down and then I fill, Ben, 8 half gallon jars with it. And that's where I pour my healing leaves and my family's every day for two weeks. Now, if you want it even simpler, just put leaves in a glass, boil some water, pour it over the glass or mug where the leaves are, wait a few minutes till it gets to be a tolerable temperature, and drink it just like you would tea. Ben Greenfield [00:37:35]: That doesn't sound too hard, especially if you do it as a batch. You said dried though. So if I go and harvest all these leaves, can I just lay them out in the sun on a towel? Do you use a food dehydrator? An oven at low temperature? Does it matter? Jordan Rubin [00:37:49]: Any of the above. So Jethro, who is the young man who overcame cancer when I started working with him, it was September in the Netherlands. He went to an orchard, picked a bunch of leaves and dried them in his oven with a pilot light on low. And then they went and bought a food dehydrator. You could do not pilot light, pilot setting, but you can do any of the above. Obviously, if you want to dry them outside, make sure it's truly dry. And you're going to maybe have some insects around, but it should be minimal. They don't attract bugs the way that fruit or anything sweet would. But any of those ways would be fine. Jordan Rubin [00:38:25]: And in the summer, which we're talking right now, in the summer, while you've got a few more days of growing time where you are in the Pac Northwest, you can just pick them off the trees and put them right into the water and boil them. But yes, save some for the winter. It will be well worth it. Ben Greenfield [00:38:44]: All right. bengreenfieldlife.com/biblio I'll link to the book, my other podcast with Jordan, and some of these recommendations: B-I-B-L-I-O. Jordan, can we talk about some other parts of your book? Jordan Rubin [00:38:55]: Yes. How about the Wisest Meal on Earth that will debunk some major health myths. Ben Greenfield [00:39:02]: The Wisest Meal on Earth? Jordan Rubin [00:39:03]: The Wisest Meal on Earth. There's three amazing revelations that I had since I've written the other biblical health books that for some reason were hidden for me and I remember I was walking on my farm in Tennessee and I said to Todd, our farm director, as we were talking about the new Biblio diet project, which I was working on, I said, you know, Todd, I think there's a chapter in the Bible that talks about exactly what King Solomon ate every day. So I went back, and sure enough, I Kings, chapter four, lists out Solomon's daily provisions. Now, Solomon, for those of you who don't know, was King David's son and known by God as the wisest man who ever lived and the richest man who ever lived. In fact, historically, it was said that all the kings of the world sat at the feet of Solomon and were amazed at his knowledge of science and humans, and the world. So this is a man who was given so much wisdom. He knew about plant life, animal life, and humans and what he ate every day with all the money in the world, literally, people came and brought him riches and treasures, and I think they've estimated his wealth as a quadrillionaire. Jordan Rubin [00:40:30]: It's more than anyone has today. Ben Greenfield [00:40:32]: People could take the deep rabbit hole, dive down Google and Reddit on this. Apparently he had ships going all the way to South America, and we find, like, Hebrew inscriptions in, like, the Amazon. And so he was likely bringing stuff from all over the world, like, you know, cinnamon, gold, myrrh, frankincense, like, you name it, from, like, probably one of the busiest shipping routes at his time. Jordan Rubin [00:40:56]: Yes. And he had an inner circle or a court that ate with him every day. And what he was feeding them and consuming was primarily meat and bread. Ben Greenfield [00:41:09]: You just, like, isolated and offended two big, big groups of the dogmatic nutrition world. Meat and bread. Jordan Rubin [00:41:15]: So some people have said for a long time that meat will kill you and kill the planet because cows are emitting greenhouse gases and all the other stuff. And then, of course, now there's a pretty thriving carnivore eating community that says plants are trying to kill you. Ben Greenfield [00:41:33]: Plants, including bread. Jordan Rubin [00:41:35]: Including bread. And then others that don't think plants are trying to kill you think bread's trying to kill you. And they've written books like Wheat Belly and Grain Brain. So I'm not arguing that the research done by these doctors doesn't have a little bit of merit or a lot of merit. But what I don't argue is that the word of God trumps science. And in this case, King Solomon ate grass-fed cattle. And I'm going to chop some more boots, Ben. He ate stall-fed cattle. Jordan Rubin [00:42:05]: Now, I'm not saying they were confinement animals that were Injected with hormones and antibiotics and fed glyphosate rich grain. But they were fed in a stall. Whether it was hay or grain or herbs, I don't know—grass fed cattle, ,stall-fed cattle, meal and flour that would be grain and bread and choice fowl as well as wild deer and roebuck. And it didn't say he ate this occasionally. These were Solomon's daily provisions. But while I'm at it, I believe that meat is one of the quintessential biblical superfoods, particularly red meat. Because anytime anyone could afford it or anytime anyone had an esteemed guest, they killed what was known as the fatted calf, which would have been an intact bull between four of six years of age. Jordan Rubin [00:42:59]: And Ben, here's something else that'll blow your mind. That intact bull where they consumed the meat called the fatted calf, would have provided actual testosterone and testosterone precursors to men and women, contributing to fertility and youth. Ben Greenfield [00:43:18]: You mean in the actual meat? Like you don't have to eat the testicles? Jordan Rubin [00:43:21]: In the actual meat. And I have getting down a little bit of a, I'll call it a water buffalo trail, not a rabbit trail. But I have a son who plays college football and for an entire off-season I fed him only food from water buffalo. We raise water buffalo. And I had a couple of mature bulls slaughtered, butchered and prepared. And he ate two pounds a day of water buffalo bull meat. And he gained in one off season, 65 pounds. Now, some people on the call don't want to gain 65 pounds, but the point is— Ben Greenfield [00:44:02]: —I'm assuming that's both fat mass and fat-free mass— Jordan Rubin [00:44:05]: —it was all of it. But his strength went up 25%. Record numbers. You just wouldn't believe it. He went in as a freshman as arguably the strongest player up against 6th year college students with a Covid year. And my son, I have one biological son and five adopted children. My son's genetics, from myself and Nikki, involve probably a 12-inch vertical leap and not a whole lot of body mass. So I'm just giving... Jordan Rubin [00:44:36]: ...yeah, just giving you an example that if you look into Scripture, into the Bible, you don't have to look so deep to find some of the greatest longevity-boosting, health-promoting secrets known to man. And if you think people look the same way in the Bible as they do today, you're wrong. Because obesity was so rare that it was mentioned every time someone was fat or obese. They called it out in the Bible because it was so abnormal. Ben Greenfield [00:45:08]: Yeah, I noticed that. It seems a little rude, but yeah, they do. Famous for all time and the best-selling book of all time for being fat. Jordan Rubin [00:45:15]: Exactly. The, the king of Eglon had apparently, rolls that when he was stabbed with a sword, you couldn't even see the butt of the sword because of his fat rolls. And then there is a couple of other references, like Eli, who was the priest before Samuel, he leaned back in a chair and they said he was so fat the chair broke. But outside of that, it was very rare. Ben Greenfield [00:45:40]: We should clarify, though, being fat is not synonymous with eating fat, because throughout the Bible, you find that God blesses people with fat of the land, you know, with honey, with milk, with bread. So nutrition and diet enrichment is often something that is a reward from God. It's the overconsumption of it, you know, the crossing over into gluttony, which becomes an issue. But the idea that there's not a lot of obesity in the Bible doesn't mean that eating fat is bad. And in fact, fat's kind of considered a blessing in the Bible. Jordan Rubin [00:46:10]: Well, Ben, my revelation number three, which didn't even make it in The Biblio Diet because the book was already written. This literally happened three weeks ago. And how somebody could read through the Bible consistently like I have for 15 years and miss anything related to food is beyond me. But this is so cool. Job, who was a man in the Bible that predated Moses and some of the other biblical luminaries, he was stricken with poverty. He went from being a wealthy, blessed man to losing his wealth. He lost his children, and he lost his health. And towards the end of Job, in chapter 29, Job is talking to God. Jordan Rubin [00:46:54]: In the longest conversation ever recorded between God and man. Amazing. It'll give you chills. Read the end of Job. God literally talks about his creation and says, more or less, Job, how dare you talk to me like this. I created the stars, the sky, the animals. I know where thunder is made and the factories where lightning is stored. Anyway, so cool. Jordan Rubin [00:47:16]: But this is how Job describes his previous prime of life, Ben. He said, in the prime of my life, cream poured out on the streets and olive oil welled out from a stone. So I believe that if Job described the prime of his life as a wealthy, blessed man being bathed and having all kinds of access to cream and olive oil, you better believe I want those two foods in my diet every day. The idea that our ancestors didn't eat a lot of meat and didn't eat a lot of fat is just not true. The only reason people wouldn't eat meat and fat is if they couldn't procure it, hunt it, or afford it, period. End of story. Everybody throughout history goes for the fattiest, most nutrient dense animal foods above all else. Ben Greenfield [00:48:14]: Yeah, comma, they also fasted a lot. Jordan Rubin [00:48:17]: Sure did. Ben Greenfield [00:48:18]: With the Wisest Meal on Earth—so you said it was meat, milk, and what was the third one? Jordan Rubin [00:48:22]: It was meat, bread and poultry. Ben Greenfield [00:48:25]: Sorry, meat. Jordan Rubin [00:48:25]: Pretty much. Ben Greenfield [00:48:26]: Okay, got it. What about the whole idea, like back to the elephant in the room, like the leaves and the fruits? Obviously you said the leaves are for healing, but then it does say in that verse that the fruits are for food. Do we find that Solomon placed an emphasis on like berries, pomegranates, mangoes, some of these fruits that seem to have a lot of pretty nutrient dense properties. Jordan Rubin [00:48:46]: I can't confirm that Solomon did, but we know that David, we know that Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and many biblical I'll say ancestors consumed fruits like olives, grape, figs, dates, pomegranate. In fact, Ben, this is so cool. Pomegranate was known as the royal fruit of the Bible back in biblical times. And the Average pomegranate contains 613 seeds or arils. You know, those little delicious seeds with juicy fruit around them. Ben Greenfield [00:49:20]: Yeah, I believe you haven't counted them, but I believe you that is the. Jordan Rubin [00:49:23]: Same number of commandments in the Old Testament of the Bible. How amazing is that? What are the odds? Ben Greenfield [00:49:30]: Huh? That's interesting. Okay, so kind of like the thing I'm asked a lot because it's no secret. I talk on the podcast, I'm a Christian and I believe the Bible. And then people say, well, you eat pork and shellfish, because I see you talking about Seatopia shrimp on your website and you occasionally show your wife's bone-in reverse-sear pork chop recipe. I think you probably know where I'm coming from, Jordan. I say, well, you can get clean versions of that stuff now, like pastured pork and shellfish that's been screened. But with you having written so much about the Bible-based diet, and I don't even remember if we talked about this last time or not, we might have. Ben Greenfield [00:50:12]: What's the deal with pork and shellfish? Jordan Rubin [00:50:14]: Well, Ben, you know that I want to be a gracious guest on your program and try not to disagree with you. Ben Greenfield [00:50:21]: I don't care if you offend me and my diet. Tell—tell me straight up. Jordan Rubin [00:50:24]: I think pork and shellfish and any derivatives of that should be avoided at all costs. That's how I've lived my life. And I remember, Ben, when I first was introduced to the concept of eating the way the Bible says. I read a book called God's Key to Health and Happiness by Reverend Elmer Josephson. This was one of three books I read in 1996 that changed my life forever. And Reverend Josephson was diagnosed with terminal stomach cancer. He was a pastor, he was a God-fearing man and dedicated his life to serving God. And he more or less yelled at God with his terminal diagnosis and said, "God, you promised me in your word to live a long and abundant life. Jordan Rubin [00:51:10]: Why am I dying?" And Elmer Josephson heard God's voice say, "Because you haven't followed my commandments." And Elmer Josephson read Leviticus 11 and Deuteronomy 14, which said, Pork and shellfish, I'm going to paraphrase, are detestable, the same way human excrement and filth would be detestable. And he ceased eating pork and shellfish. His book details how he was cured of stomach cancer and he tried to spend the rest of his life telling others that God's commandments are the same yesterday, today and forever. They may not determine your salvation. In fact, the old joke is, can you eat pork and shellfish and still get to heaven? Some of us might say yes, and you'll get there a lot sooner. But I do believe, Ben, understanding a lot about regenerative farming—I've done it for nearly 20 years... Jordan Rubin [00:52:07]: ...the anatomy of a pig as a monogastric, just like a rat, a skunk, a dog or a cat is not able to detoxify properly, not able to metabolize nutrients. And the idea that you can have a pig eat healthy things would mean 24/7 surveillance because a pig will eat tumors off of other pigs. And I always used to say this and it freaked people out. Elmer Josephson, in the book God's Key to Health and Happiness, observed an experiment where there were four pigs stacked vertically in cages and they only fed the top pig. And the others did just fine. I'll let you fill in the blanks. Same thing for shellfish. There are so many amazing meats and fish to eat. Jordan Rubin [00:52:55]: If you're somebody listening and you're following a paleo diet or a keto diet or a carnivore diet or an omnivorous diet, and you have not avoided pork and shellfish, you may benefit from doing so because of the toxins, microorganisms and more. And this is where, Ben I disagree with people from the Weston A. Price Foundation, a lot of the, I'll say evolutionary diet experts. And it's my story and I'm sticking to it. Ben Greenfield [00:53:24]: Okay, but you don't think that, like, with Levitical law based around hygiene, that in an era of modern hygiene, some of those things are no longer applicable? Like, you know, I don't want to be gross, but, like, if, you know, if a woman is on her period, you'd have to send her out of the village or the camp or whatever for a week because she's unclean. And now we've got modern hygiene and tampons, things like that. And in the case of pigs and shellfish, couldn't we just get cleaner versions of them? And the law that was once meant for good hygiene would no longer really be something we need to follow from a ceremonial standpoint? Jordan Rubin [00:54:02]: I do not believe so. I believe, based on science, that shellfish, for example, are the best purifiers of polluted waterways because they store toxins. People say, but oysters are high in metals. I just was on a podcast in Phoenix yesterday, and maybe it was the day before, and I really upset the host because she believes oysters are a great source of minerals. And I would agree, but the minerals include cadmium, mercury, lead, and arsenic. So, Ben, I do not believe that this particular principle in Scripture can be changed or improved based on hygiene. Believe me, I can go into details on a woman's uncleanness. I can explain that. Jordan Rubin [00:54:43]: And there's some cool elements to that as well, believe me, with fertility. But I do not believe that pork and shellfish are suitable to eat the same way. I don't believe dogs, cats and skunks are. But for some reason, people look the other way when it comes to pork because they don't want to give up their bacon. And I might be one of the only health experts that is pounding this drum, but for me and my house, we will not touch pork and shellfish. And it's not for spiritual reasons. It's not a kosher thing. They are not suitable for human consumption based on anatomy and physiology. Jordan Rubin [00:55:21]: And I've seen too many people cut those things out and get better to believe otherwise. Ben Greenfield [00:55:28]: Really interesting. Well, I'm a big self quant guy and it wouldn't be a huge sacrifice for me because right now, to be honest, totally honest, I have pork about once a month. I have shellfish about once a month. So I could cut it out and take labs and maybe see how I do over six months. I'm game to try it. Okay, I want to lightning round a few of the things that you Jordan, because I know we're running slightly short on time, but I want to touch on these: milk. Not all milk is created equal. Knowing what you know, having been in the industry as long as you've been in it, obviously milk is encouraged in the Bible. Ben Greenfield [00:56:01]: What kind of milk would be the healthiest for people to drink or to give to their kids and their family? Jordan Rubin [00:56:06]: The healthiest milk that you can find easily would be an A2 milk that is grass-fed and organic, preferably non-homogenized, that is available ben everywhere, including Costco, which is unbelievable to me. I'm so thrilled about that. But that's sort of the best milk that someone who wants to go to a store can buy. Now if you want to know the best, the best milk on the planet or dairy products, I would consume an A2 raw grass-fed organic dairy from an animal that produces milk that is naturally homogenized and metabolizes all of the carotenoids. Now I know you love sciency things so I'm going to throw that all out at you. But what I mean is raw milk from water buffalo, goat or sheep. Now we know that cow's milk, that's raw, which can be really good, the cream separates, it rises to the top and it turns yellow when the cows are eating grass in season because of the carotenoids. The reason being cows don't metabolize carotenoids very well. Jordan Rubin [00:57:17]: But a goat, sheep or water buffalo, I raise them so I know when they eat only pasture grasses, herbs, legumes and forbs, they produce naturally homogenized milk. The fat globules are very small and absorbable and the milk is always white even when they're eating June spring pastures. It's because they naturally metabolize the carotenoids and I believe you're getting downstream metabolites from these powerful components. So that would be the best-case scenario. It's what I do primarily. I want to say this though: Milk is a superfood in its right form or it could be a toxic plethora of junk. If you eat skim, I call it blue milk, skim milk that has been fortified, pasteurized, homogenized, even though it's skim, which is ridiculous and has all these traces of antibiotics and hormones. Ben Greenfield [00:58:20]: Yeah, A2, grass-fed. Everything aside, multiple studies show the majority of health benefits from dairy consumption come from full fat, not skim or fat free. So that alone is important to know. That wasn't too too lightning round. Jordan Rubin [00:58:33]: I know I'm not a lightning round. Ben Greenfield [00:58:35]: These next. I know you're such a depth of knowledge. I was reading on green med Info Sire G He puts out some pretty good information, but he did a pretty big takedown article on bread yesterday calling out not just gluten but lectin, herbicides, pesticides, opiates, the things that you've heard before. But Jordan, let's say someone wrote an article like that, yet they still said but if he can find the right kind of grain, you could skirt some of those issues. So if you were going to buy bread or get grain to make bread, what would you choose as your top go-to? Jordan Rubin [00:59:06]: My favorite bread is sourdough that is long-term fermented, made from an unhybridized grain like Einkorn. And for those of you who haven't heard of Einkorn, it's E-I-N-K-O-R-N. It's not anything to do with corn, the plant or grain. Einkorn is a biblical grain. It has never been hybridized, which means it's lower in gluten, higher in non-gluten proteins and less likely to cause allergies. Now we have bred all the wrong qualities into cows that produce milk and into wheat and barley and other grains. So I consume sourdough bread and by the way, Ben, I had Crohn's and colitis, one of the worst cases documented in history. And part of my recovery was raw cream and sourdough whole grain bread. Ben Greenfield [01:00:02]: So crazy because most doctors say you shouldn't even be sniffing that stuff. Jordan Rubin [01:00:06]: Nope. So I do. And you don't have to eat it. I mean, listen, Sayer is a very close friend of mine and colleague and I don't disagree that modern bread that you get in a grocery store is horrible. But the sourdough craze is on. And if you can make your own sourdough bread or buy it at a specialty or health food store, even people with gluten sensitivity can often tolerate it because the sourdough or fermentation process eliminates the gluten, virtually lowers the gliadin content which is causing the opioid effect that you are referring to. It doesn't have glyphosate and it is actually a great source of energy and nutrients. But you want to consume white bread. Jordan Rubin [01:00:52]: I'll tell you, the whiter the bread, the sooner you're dead because it is total garbage and you can leave it on your patio for 50 years. Ben Greenfield [01:00:59]: I'll give a shout out to Dr. Jeffrey Bland, you know, father of functional medicine. He's doing some cool stuff with Himalayan Tartary Buckwheat. Yes, he is another one that I found I do just fine with. And my wife uses a—I think it's a local red berry kind of ancient, unhybridized grain for our sourdough at home. And then we've got milk or goats, so you're making me happy, Jordan. Ben Greenfield [01:01:18]: All right, last one. People hear about the Bible and they think honey, you know, it's found all over in Proverbs, for example, and throughout the Old Testament. Let's say somebody's going to do honey. I'm assuming it's not the plastic teddy bear off the grocery store shelf. But what would you pick if you were going to throw honey in there along with the bread and the milk and the red meat, for example? Jordan Rubin [01:01:40]: You're getting all of us hungry. Ben, I like to say this when it comes to honey for culinary use or as a sweetener, look for unheated or raw and unfiltered. Those are the terms you want to look for. Ideally, the honey crystallizes a bit when you leave it at room temperature, which means that it hasn't been ultra-heated. If you want a therapeutic honey, I like honey that is from New Zealand. You've probably heard of Manuka honey. Ben Greenfield [01:02:10]: Dude, I love Manuka. We had a sponsor for a while and I've still got a pantry full of stuff. Manukura honey. It's so good. Jordan Rubin [01:02:17]: Absolutely. And probably my favorite, Melapana honey, which is found in South America. It's in Costa Rica, Central America. Those are made by stingless small bees. And that honey can be used as an eye drop to treat eye infections. It's great for upper respiratory infections. It is a very cool, super honey. And it never thickens. Jordan Rubin [01:02:39]: So those are examples. I've also tried a Madagascar honey, Ben, that is off the charts amazing. But you want unheated and unfiltered and you can use it as a sweetener. It's almost miraculous as a topical wound healer. And it is literally a medicine cabinet. We talk all about honey, milk, bread, even salt. We didn't cover in The Biblio Diet because if the Bible says something's good, I want to know why. And I want to teach people how to acquire the food and how to consume the food. Jordan Rubin [01:03:14]: Because after all, Ben, my two principles here are eat what God created for food, number one, and number two, eat food in a form that is healthy for the body. If you can do that, your nutrition will absolutely contribute to amazing health. Ben Greenfield [01:03:33]: I love it. And yeah, you've got cancer-fighting nutrition, like we talked about. Meats, veggies, fruit, dairy, spices, salts, oils. We didn't even crack into fasting and some of the daily eating plans in there. But the book for those of you watching is the Biblio Diet. I'll link to that. My other podcast with Jordan, his website, everything at BenGreenfieldLife.com/Biblio —B-I-B-L-I-O, where you can leave your questions, your comments, your feedback. Ben Greenfield [01:04:02]: Jordan, I love talking to you, man. I always learn—I would say at least five new things every time we chat. Jordan Rubin [01:04:07]: Well, I appreciate it, Ben. And I know that there are so many amazing technologies out there. I see some behind you and I incorporate a lot of cool hacks and biohacks. But I never allow myself to get too far away from the C reator and what he gave for our longevity, our metabolism, our pain, our brain health, and of course, fighting a disease that's cost us too many lives and too many loved ones and too many precious hours. And that's my passion, is really to see the planet healed, people fed and disease eradicated. Ben Greenfield [01:04:46]: Keep up the great work, brother. I love you. Jordan Rubin [01:04:48]: Thank you, buddy. Thanks for having me.

Please let us know Topic:Company News Elon Musk has been offered one of the largest CEO payment packages in history. (Reuters: Hamad I Mohammed) Tesla's board has proposed a $US1 trillion ($1.52 trillion) compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk in what would be the largest corporate pay package in history. The move underscores the hold Mr Musk has over the car maker as it attempts to transform into an AI and robotics powerhouse. Here's what we know about the package. Elon Musk will need to increase Tesla's value eightfold. (ABC News: Daniel Mercer) The proposed plan would grant Mr Musk up to 12 per cent of Tesla's stock, worth about $US1.03 trillion if the company hits its target market value of $US8.6 trillion. The plan requires boosting Tesla's valuation nearly eightfold, or about $US7.5 trillion, over the next decade. To get his first package of shares equivalent to 1 per cent of the company, Mr Musk would have to convince investors in the stock market that Tesla is worth $US2 trillion in total, double what they value it today, and also hit several other milestones. To receive all the shares offered and make him the world's first trillion-dollar man would require that market value to then rise to $US8.6 trillion, double that of the world's most valuable company now, chipmaker Nvidia. Among other goals, sales of all Tesla vehicles would eventually also have to reach 20 million, nearly triple its entire sales since it was founded more than two decades ago. To increase Tesla's value the company will need to sell 20 million vehicles. (AP Photo: Julio Cortez) Mr Musk would also have to vastly expand Tesla's robot and robotaxi businesses by selling a million of the bots and a million of the driverless cabs, the latter a business that has only begun to roll out its taxi service and is behind rivals, such as Waymo. Mr Musk would also need to remain with Tesla for at least seven and a half years to cash out on any stock, and 10 years to earn the full amount. If fully earned, the award would materially increase Mr Musk's voting power from his roughly 13 per cent stake, intensifying debate over governance and succession. Tesla emphasised that Mr Musk would receive no salary or cash bonus, with all compensation linked to performance. The package is designed to keep Mr Musk from leaving and is squarely focused on transforming Tesla into an artificial-intelligence and robotics powerhouse, the board said in a securities filing. It said Mr Musk is the only person on the planet who can unlock Tesla's full potential. Mr Musk has been criticised as being distracted from Tesla. Elon Musk's willingness to challenge Donald Trump has raised concerns at Tesla. His foray into party politics and his willingness to challenge President Donald Trump had heightened concerns among Tesla investors and analysts about potential distractions and had previously fuelled talk about looking for a new chief. In July, Mr Musk announced plans to launch a third political party, the "America Party", following a public clash with Trump over a tax cut and government spending bill. Tesla's board has urged shareholders to vote against a proposal calling for a political neutrality policy, which would have expanded board oversight of Mr Musk's political activities. Yes, and Mr Musk is likely to get it at the company's annual meeting in November. That is because it was crafted with an eye on keeping Mr Musk in place, addressing concerns about the company's technical outlook and giving big company owners just enough reason to back the massive amount, investors and executive pay analysts said. The pay plan is by far the largest ever for any CEO. And while it is likely to face legal challenges, compensation experts see it winning shareholder approval. "Time and time again, Tesla's shareholders have approved these grants over the years," Equilar research director Courtney Yu said. None of Tesla's three largest outside investors, Vanguard Group, BlackRock or State Street, immediately said how they would vote. Among them, Vanguard and BlackRock supported Mr Musk's $56 billion pay package last year, disclosures show, while State Street funds voted against it. Tesla and top funds can still expect pressure over the pay, however, with several union figures and public-sector treasurers voicing concern. Union figures and public-sector treasurers have voiced concerns about the proposed payment. (AP: Jose Luis Magana) "We urge shareholders to reject Musk's money grab, take away the Tesla board's rubber stamp, and restore basic corporate governance standards," said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, in a statement. Kristin Hull, founder and chief investment officer of Tesla investor Nia Impact Capital, called the package irresponsible. "This is investor money that could go into R&D or acquisitions, places that would really benefit Tesla in the long term," she said, adding that she is considering a challenge with other shareholders. Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, called Mr Musk a visionary but said the pay plan was excessive and could set a bad precedent in corporate governance. He questioned whether Mr Musk was worth that much. "He also presides over a company that has lost its edge, is being overtaken by rivals, and whose brand has been tarnished by Musk's actions outside of Tesla," he said. Last year, Tesla reincorporated in Texas after a judge in its former corporate home, Delaware, ruled a $US56 billion compensation for the CEO was "unfathomable" and unfair to shareholders. Mr Musk urged companies to ditch Delaware and his board worked on a new pay package. A judge has ruled that Elon Musk still is not entitled to receive a $86.6 billion compensation package even though shareholders of the electric vehicle company had voted to reinstate it earlier this year. Last year, the company's shareholders voted to "ratify" Mr Musk's 2018 pay package in an attempt to essentially undo the court ruling and restore Mr Musk's pay package. Mr Musk will be able to vote about 411 million shares at this year's shareholder meeting, nearly outweighing the 529 million shares that voted against ratification. In the end, the ratification vote did not matter because the Delaware judge ruled it did not override her prior decision. That ruling and her ruling striking Mr Musk's $US56 billion compensation are on appeal. In 2018, the company barred Mr Musk from voting his shares to make it harder for investors to sue under Delaware law. Now Tesla does not need to do that because it has much better protection from legal challenges thanks to laws in Texas.

Title: Virgin Media presenter Katja Mia: ‘I get scared, I worry about the people I care about. These are weird times’
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/people/2025/09/06/katja-mia-i-grew-up-in-ireland-through-struggle-its-made-me-hyper-ambitious/
Time Published: 2025-09-06T04:00:00Z
Full Content:
When Dublin TV presenter, influencer and model Katja Mia was doing the Leaving Cert more than a decade ago, she plastered the study area in the Blanchardstown family home with motivational quotes from the likes of Winston Churchill and Nelson Mandela. “I was not blessed academically, I was one of those people who had to work really hard to get just above average,” she says. “I had all these quotes posted up everywhere, I’d write down the number of points I wanted to get so I could see them.” She was manifesting before manifesting became a thing? “I suppose I was,” she laughs. “But I also studied for hours and hours. Nothing came easily.” While it’s been an often-derided TikTok trend for a few years now, manifesting – the idea that our thoughts and actions can positively influence what we accomplish – has actually been a thing for a while. There’s a Sanskrit text called Rigveda from 3,500 years ago containing hymns that suggest that by focusing on our hopes and dreams we can influence personal destiny. At any rate, the presenter is something of a poster girl for the trend. From a family of Burundian immigrants a combination of ambition, determination, hard work, luck and – scoff if you like – manifesting eventually landed her her dream job presenting the Six O’Clock Show on Virgin Media. We’re talking in the boardroom of the television station before she goes to studio to record the hour-long live show. She’s wearing black athleisure wear and there’s a large - “lab grown” she qualifies - diamond engagement ring sparkling on her finger. In a couple of weeks, she’ll go to Burundi, in east Africa, for the first time in 15 years to take part in a traditional “dot” engagement ceremony in front of 300 family and friends. It will be a chance for her fiancé and boyfriend of eight years, Daragh Curran, an influencer called The Guinness Guru who specialises in tasting pints of the black stuff all over the world, to meet her extended family. Having grown up in Dublin she’s looking forward to immersing herself in the culture of her parent’s homeland, royal Burundian drummers and traditional costumes included. “I’m embracing all of it,” she smiles. Her mother Carinie is all over the arrangements. The wedding next year will be an Irish one. “We’ll do our own thing for that,” she says. The goal, as she grew up, was financial security, which explains the motivational quotes and commitment to her studies. She was born in Germany, in 1996, after her parents sought refuge there from the civil war in Burundi, a protracted conflict between the Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups, which killed an estimated 300,000 people from 1993 to 2005. Her uncle had been murdered in a grenade and knife attack in the former Belgian colony and “there was a threat to my dad’s family in particular so he had to flee the country”. [ Festive and funny tales with Thalia Heffernan, Katja Mia, Killian Sundermann and moreOpens in new window ] The family spent a couple of years in a village near Frankfurt but when they went to get their visa renewed it was denied. The family’s difficulties in Germany were compounded by the racism they were subjected to by neo-Nazis. Unable to return to Burundi, the family came to Ireland as undocumented immigrants. She was only 17 months old when they moved to Dublin, first settling in Blackrock. The Department of Justice initially refused their application for asylum on the grounds that they had made their original application in Germany. Threatened with deportation she says her father Joseph was given assistance in his campaign for his family to stay in Ireland by “some excellent people” including former Irish Times journalist Andy Pollak. “My dad saw him talking on a news programme one day and looked up his number in the phone book,” she says. Later, I find an Irish Times news report from 1998 about the family’s experience in Germany and the racist abuse they suffered there. “It was torture,” her mother Carinie told Irish Times reporter Paul Cullen back then. “We had already left one form of atrocious situation, [in Burundi] and now we were in another. We were just looking for somewhere calm, where our children can grow up and be integrated in society.” Eventually, they were given leave to remain in Ireland and got their Irish passports. They instilled positive affirmations in us about being black from a really young age Her parents’ experience as immigrants has had a significant influence on the presenter. “I was always aware of their struggle. They were educated but English is not their first language so they had to start from the bottom and I witnessed that.” Joseph and Carinie, who also speak French, encouraged their four children to speak English at home instead of Kirundi, the official language of Burundi, so that they would have a better chance of integrating. Her mother worked in a supermarket and her father, now a taxi driver, had two jobs at one point. “I would see him come home from one shift and put on his uniform for a second job. I think when I saw that it really instilled a work ethic and made me put my head down. They came here for me to have a better life. They didn’t want me to struggle. When you see people struggle it makes you want to go after security and financial stability”. The family moved from Blackrock to Usher’s Quay in the city centre and then to Lucan where she attended primary and secondary school even after the family eventually settled in Blanchardstown. “Growing up I always felt Irish, I sang Irish songs, did Irish dancing, on Brigid’s Day we celebrated Nano Nagle. When you are migrating to a new country, integrating is everything, especially for kids.” Every Monday afternoon from the age of six she’d go to a stage school in Lucan where she thrived - dancing and singing in shows. It wasn’t until the move to Blanchardstown that the family became victims of racist attacks. “We were the first black family on our council estate. There were a lot of teenagers coming to our house, throwing eggs at our windows, breaking my mum’s car door on a weekly basis. It was a kind of torment, to be honest.” “I remember vividly one day being egged by a group of boys, and I was only 11 or 12, I had my uniform on and I was just drenched in eggs ... you have to reassure yourself that people are ignorant, they’re doing it out of fear and you should not waste your energy trying to defend yourself because you’ve nothing to defend. “And I think it stood to me, because even now, working in media, it’s inevitable that you’re going to get comments, people that don’t like you for whatever reason, whether it’s the dress you’re wearing your make-up or whatever.” This resilience was modelled by her parents who changed the narrative when it came to their four children. “They instilled positive affirmations in us about being black from a really young age. They’d tell me: ‘You have amazing skin, you are a descendant of the Tutsi tribe, you are beautiful, be proud’.” When it came to choosing her career path, despite her love of performing, her need for security led her to pursue finance. The motivational quotes paid off. She got enough points for a finance and economics degree from Maynooth University and went into banking as a depository analyst working in funds. In the pandemic, she began a remote job in Bank of America but she wasn’t happy. “I was lost,” she says of her time in the corporate world. “I had no passion. I didn’t know what I was doing. I even started praying about it.” By now manifesting was everywhere. “I read the books, I listened to podcasts and I started posting on Instagram almost as a tool to throw s**t at the wall and see what stuck”. She began curating her feed “in a fun, aesthetic way” building an audience. When a friend needed a presenter for a music show in Swords, she nervously accepted. “It was a nine or 10-hour day but it felt like about 10 minutes because I was having the time of my life. I just thought, how can I make this a job?” There are people on TikTok saying, ‘Ireland is for the Irish’. People get angry at me, telling me: ‘You’re not Irish’ She had grown up admiring presenters like Kathryn Thomas and Martin King “who I ended up working with”. She’d watch E! News all the time. “I was obsessed with television culture, but I had no idea how to get into it ... then a friend sent me a link to a competition for online presenters and I ended up winning it.” The competition, to be a brand ambassador for Love Island presenter Maya Jama’s skincare range Mij Masks, was open to people across the UK and Ireland. It was the break she was hoping for and led to Virgin Media getting in touch. She began there as a contributor, moving to hosting on Weekend AM with Martin King. At one stage, when Ireland AM presenter Muireann O’Connell was on holiday, she got a call to replace her for three shows. “That was just wild to me. My whole family was jumping on the bed. It’s a three-hour live show. I’ll never forget that moment.” Eventually, she was named as the new permanent host with Brian Dowling of the station’s Six O’Clock Show. That was in November 2023, less than two years after landing her first presenting job. “Ideally, in a dream world, I would have done a degree in media and journalism, naturally I still feel impostor syndrome, but I learn from people, I learn by making mistakes. It worked out the way it worked out and I have so much backing in Virgin Media, I’ve been really supported.” [ We cannot police the streets if online material is not regulatedOpens in new window ] In the meantime she had been spotted by a modelling scout on Instagram, which she calls “the modern day CV for creatives”, and was a “curvy” model for a few years. Last year, when she was one of the celebrities competing in Dancing With the Stars, she received abusive messages about her size. “I got comments about whether my dance partner could lift me, people saying: ‘She’s a disgrace’.” Did the abuse affect Katja? “Absolutely, it did,” she says. “I would find myself on rehearsal days looking at playback, focusing on how big my thighs looked instead of my dance form. I have to say, once I shared the horrible comments there was so much support”. She has spoken of dealing with endometriosis and says her weight has always fluctuated. Of the abuse she says: “I have the tools to deal with it, I just needed to reinforce those positive affirmations. And my family were amazing. They just thought it was cool that I was dancing on TV.” Inevitably, given her backstory, we talk for a while about the rise of anti-immigration sentiment and the “Ireland is full” protests around the country. She is thoughtfulon the subject. “It’s conflicting,” she says. “I am a young person living in Ireland, I know it’s tough.” “I have a friend coming home from Australia with her boyfriend and they are finding it so hard to find somewhere to live. I understand that people are in a difficult position and when things get hard people look for people to blame. And the easiest targets are the newbies, the immigrants, the people who don’t sound like you or look like you.” [ Manifesting is the perfect religion for our times. But does it work?Opens in new window ] She says she hates “it’s come to that” because she immediately thinks of her parents. “They still have accents, when they talk they don’t sound Irish even though they’ve been here for so long. They are easy targets. I am someone with black skin. I know that just walking around without someone hearing my Dublin accent, I will be judged. “Something could happen to me. So I hate that black and brown people, any people of colour in Ireland, are in danger and have to worry about abusive and racist rhetoric and also physical violence.” The “conflict” she feels on the issue is about the challenges many people in this country face. “I’ve lived in Ireland my whole life. I pay taxes in this country, but I know when the time comes around when I get married and I want to look for a house, it’s going to be incredibly difficult, even though I work hard and I know other people are working hard too.” “People just want a better life for themselves. But at the same time, it’s not the fault of immigrants who are just trying to blend and integrate into a country,” she says. “It’s the fault of a Government that needs to do better. The pressure should lie with the Government to create resources for people who are struggling with the socio-economic situation, who can’t get houses. They need to be the ones to create a solution.” I feel like it’s very taboo to say, but I am someone who really wants to create a comfortable life for myself and stability for my family I ask how she feels being asked about this subject. Does it get wearying? “Every time I talk about it, and I’ve talked about it a lot, it always comes with a certain amount of hate. So I’ve become more apprehensive. There are people on TikTok saying, ‘Ireland is for the Irish’. People get angry at me, telling me: ‘You’re not Irish’. They say: ‘You’re a diversity hire’. They say all these crazy things so I’ve drawn back on it a bit”. But does she feel it’s important to speak out? “Yes, especially now seeing the attacks on Indian people, it’s heartbreaking. I grew up with Indian friends in my class and Pakistani friends. They’ve been here for years. And the new people should be welcomed too because at the end of the day we’re citizens of the world. The Irish history of migration in Australia, in Canada and in America is well known and there is never any issue with that. It’s clearly a skin colour issue and that’s what makes me upset.” In 2020, attending a protest against the murder of George Floyd by police in America, she told an Irish Times reporter that watching the footage of Mr Floyd’s death made her think of her father and brother. “My dad has such a gentle soul and to think that someone would look at him and perceive him as violent from the colour of his skin is absolutely outrageous. We’re protesting here for George Floyd but also for every black person who has gone through discrimination.” Now, she says: “My dad is a taxi driver, I get afraid for him when he is out at night because these people seem to have this new-found confidence to be blatantly racist and they think it’s okay to hurt people like that. So I get upset and I get scared, I worry about the people I care about. These are weird times.” On a more positive note, she’s happy to see things moving, however slowly, in terms of increased representation and participation of people of colour in Irish society. “I feel like it is slowly changing in a natural, unforced way. What you are seeing is the second generation of immigrants growing up and choosing careers like presenting or being make-up artists, there are more of us in the creative industries. “I think traditionally there was a lot of pressure to be, like, a doctor or a lawyer. But we also need to have visual representation in creative spaces too. And I think slowly we’re getting that.” In many ways, she is still the industrious Leaving Cert student, pushing herself forward to the next thing. She’s still manifesting, still dreaming. “I’ve had to back myself and be like: this is what you asked for, what you dreamt of, so work hard, open your ears, learn”. She’ll turn 30 next year. There’s a wedding to plan. What are her latest goals? “I feel like it’s very taboo to say, but I am someone who really wants to create a comfortable life for myself and stability for my family. It’s always at the back of my mind, it goes beyond myself. I have dreams of buying a home for my family one day, and of having the life that I always dreamed of in Ireland, especially growing up through struggle,” she says. “It’s made me hyper-ambitious and focused on having security in life. I have a job that really drives me, a job I’m very lucky to say I love.I’ve met amazing people and the dream is just to continue doing something like this. If I can have longevity in this industry, then I’ll be very happy.” Katja Mia presents The Six O’Clock Show with Brian Dowling every weekday on Virgin Media © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: We Are Becoming A Nation Of...: HDFC AMC's Navneet Munot On India's 'Multi-Pronged Growth Model'

The rapid pace of economic reforms by the government, including tax cuts, GST (Goods and Services Tax) reductions and liquidity measures by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has created a wave of optimism about India’s growth trajectory, according to Navneet Munot, Managing Director and CEO of HDFC Asset Management Company (AMC). He lauded the government's economic strategy, describing it as a combination of "policy prudence, agile execution and effective communication" that sets India apart on the global stage. “India has been a nation of savers for generations. What we are doing now is becoming a nation of investors. If you are astute, you would take a long-term view of India. It is going to be a multi-pronged growth model rather than a very narrow set of growth models most of the other countries have seen,” he said during a conversation with NDTV Profit on Friday. He said that India has become 'Atmanirbhar' (self-reliant) in its capital markets, while acknowledging the importance of the inflow of foreign funds. “I won't say that we don't need foreign savings. I think our investment needs are humongous. We need more foreign flows for sure. And at some stage, it's likely to come both in the form of FDI as well as in the form of FPI.” He contrasted India's approach with that of major economies like the United States, highlighting a fundamental difference in philosophy. “On one side, you are seeing increasing tariffs and putting more burden on the consumers... On the other side, what India is doing is, I want to give more benefit to the larger section of the society," he said. He described this as the 'Bahujan Hitai, Bahujan Sukhai' (for the welfare and happiness of the masses) philosophy, starkly different from policies that favour tax cuts for the wealthy while imposing tariffs that ultimately hurt consumers. Munot cited recent measures like personal income tax relief, GST rate cuts and RBI’s liquidity injections as steps to stimulate consumption and credit growth. “It is not only about cutting rates and paying less taxes. It's also about like Chanakya said that the government should take taxes the way a butterfly gently takes nectar,” the top executive said. Munot was bullish on India’s potential to produce global-scale asset managers akin to Blackstone or BlackRock. “Several of those businesses are managing hundreds of billions in alternatives and trillions in public markets. Over a period of time, as this economy grows from $4 trillion to $40 trillion in our lifetime, you will see asset managers in India talking about that size,” he said. Highlighting India’s importance for the world, he said, “This is where 18% of humanity is. This is where the youngest population in the world is. We will be the biggest supplier of labour force to the world for the next several decades. So, you have to ensure that you take full advantage of that demographic dividend.” Shares of HDFC Asset Management Company closed 0.44% higher at Rs 5,594 apiece on the NSE, while the benchmark Nifty50 ended 0.03% up at 24,741.

Title: Jio BlackRock CEO: Data-driven approach with fund manager insights sets us apart

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Jio BlackRock Asset Management Company is all set to launch its first actively managed fund, a flexicap fund, on 23 September. The AMC is an equal joint venture between Jio Financial Services and global investment giant BlackRock. What sets it apart from other funds? According to Sid Swaminathan, CEO of Jio BlackRock AMC, it has a data-driven approach using BlackRock’s Aladdin software with insights from human fund managers. The fund house also has the benefit of Jio's large distribution ecosystem, which allows it to focus on direct-only plans for now. In this interview, Swaminathan talks about the fund's plans, AI-driven products and more. Edited excerpts:Can you walk us through the overall plan that you have for unfolding Jio BlackRock AMC? With BlackRock bringing its tech platform, Aladdin, to India, asset managers can do everything in a very scalable, operationally safe manner. We also have our partner Jio, which allows us to access customers at scale in the digital ecosystem. Our platform in BlackRock, systematic active equity (SAE), is a quantitative data-driven AI machine learning approach to equity investing. A computer does all the data crunching for you, and then you have the fund managers who can overlay some specific insights on it. You can then input all of this into Aladdin. Next, run a portfolio-level optimisation using the risk model and an India-specific risk model built for the joint venture to generate a portfolio recommendation. If you aim to outperform a flexicap fund using these insights by X percent annually, with Y amount of risk relative to that benchmark, here is a suggested portfolio. What about your products and their rollout? We have launched three institutional-focused cash funds to start with. We are very happy with the kind of start that we got, and also the retail participation…about 67,000 investors in the first three NFOs since July. We have also looked at the index funds. So again, in a way, bread and butter for BlackRock. The third set of funds in phase one will be more leaning towards the active side, with flexicap as the first one. Some fund houses are more tilted towards growth, and some towards value. Is there an overarching philosophy for you? The overarching philosophy is that it's a data-driven approach. It allows us to use and leverage the data in many ways. For example, for this flexicap fund that we are going to launch, the fund managers will typically look to generate the alpha purely through stock selection. Now the same data can be used to build another fund, which will come later. But instead of just having views on stocks, I may have views on factors. So I could have a growth tilted, or a value tilted fund, or I could do factor rotation…so we have all the insights to do that. Or rather than factors, we can have sectors. So, as a fund house, our philosophy is to be data-driven and then deliver that in differentiated ways to our end customers. Do you have an upper and lower limit to the number of stocks you would have in the fund? Not necessarily. You would expect around 125 to 150 stocks, which is, again, a lot more than you would see in a typical flexicap where it’s probably 30 to 40. But you're never going to see 500 stocks because, again, that's an index fund. You've chosen to take the direct route for distribution. What was the thinking behind this, and how will it pan out? People are becoming increasingly comfortable managing their finances digitally on their phones. Our partnership with Jio, which has access to that ecosystem, gives us a clear understanding that this is the direction we want to pursue. We aim to see how direct digital approaches work. We have the capacity to manufacture at scale, and if we can reach customers and offer them value digitally, that would be excellent. We can always consider growing, expanding, and exploring other options in the future. The ₹24 tax filing product enables users to file their returns digitally. Would it accelerate your growth? A lot of new products are coming online from JioFinance. Yes, like new functionality on the Jio Finance app will help accelerate our growth. Our presence will also accelerate Jio Finance’s growth, because people will get excited by things like the NFO periods going online. We currently have 50 to 55 million unique permanent account numbers (PAN) in the mutual fund space. How large do you think the market can grow? Fifty-five million is a very big number, but in the context of India, it's still very small, right? We have just crossed 20% of AUM (assets under management) as a percentage of GDP. By comparison, the UK is at 80% and the US is at 150%. There can be some short-term blips that we have seen even in the last few weeks, but the overall macro is very sound. Demographics are very positive. Tell us a little about your team Our chief investment officer (CIO), Rishi Kohli, has been involved in the systematic quant investing space in India for many decades. In addition, two dedicated fund managers who previously worked at BlackRock have joined the team. There are also two dealers and a couple of researchers for the equity team. On the fixed income side, we have three fund managers, two dealers, and a couple of researchers. Download the Mint app and read premium stories Log in to our website to save your bookmarks.

Business Elon Musk, chief executive officer of SpaceX and Tesla, gestures as he attends the Viva Technology conference dedicated to innovation and startups at the Porte de Versailles exhibition centre in Paris, France, Jun 16, 2023. (Photo: Reuters/Gonzalo Fuentes) WILMINGTON, Delaware: Elon Musk's blow-out US$1 trillion pay package from Tesla proves everything is bigger in Texas, especially under its new management-friendly law. Last year, Tesla reincorporated in the Lone Star State after a judge in its former corporate home, Delaware, ruled a US$56 billion compensation for the CEO was "unfathomable" and unfair to shareholders. Musk urged companies to ditch Delaware and his board worked on a new pay package. Freed from the constraints of Delaware's widely used corporate law, Tesla has super-sized the next pay deal for Musk, already the world's richest person. Despite increasing his pay nearly 20-fold, there is a better chance this package will be approved and a lesser risk it will be struck down in the courts, thanks to Texas's corporate law. In addition, it would be harder for shareholders to challenge the independence of the two board members who developed the pay package.

If recent history is a guide, that will lock in approval.Last year, the company's shareholders voted to "ratify" Musk's 2018 pay package in an attempt to essentially undo the court ruling and restore Musk's pay package. Musk will be able to vote about 411 million shares at this year's shareholder meeting, nearly outweighing the 529 million shares that voted against ratification. In the end, the ratification vote did not matter because the Delaware judge ruled it did not override her prior decision.

Musk is the only individual shareholder who meets that requirement. Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street do as well, but they are passive investors.

Title: Analysis-Teslas Super Ambitious $1 trillion deal for Musk could still pass shareholder muster

By Ross Kerber, Dawn Kopecki, Simon Jessop and Arsheeya Bajwa NEW YORK -Tesla's $1 trillion, 10-year pay package to retain CEO Elon Musk is likely to be approved by shareholders at the company's annual meeting in November even though the amount is staggering. That is because it was crafted with an eye on keeping Musk in place, addressing concerns about the company's technical outlook and giving big company owners just enough reason to back the massive amount, investors and executive pay analysts said. Earlier on Friday, the automaker's board approved what it called "A Super Ambitious Incentive Package for a Pioneering, Ambitious and Unique CEO" that sets out lofty earnings and valuation targets – awarding Musk millions of shares over the next decade if he hits them. It immediately gives Musk 96 million shares of restricted stock worth more than $31 billion as of intraday trading on Friday that vests over the next two years, as well as more control over the company. His total 2025 compensation package is worth north of $113 billion, executive compensation research firm Equilar has estimated. “The pay package, which makes a big bet on the future of robots, may see shareholder support," said Taufiq Rahim, a SpaceX investor and principal at 2040 Advisory. "But it raises larger social questions about the outsized gains going to relatively few capital holders, which is likely not sustainable and will face public pressures.” The package is designed to keep Musk from leaving and is squarely focused on transforming Tesla into an artificial-intelligence and robotics powerhouse, the board said in a securities filing. It said Musk is the only person on the planet who can unlock Tesla's full potential. The compensation committee started negotiating Musk's pay package in February, it said, meeting with lawyers 37 times and directly with Musk 10 times over seven months. Certain items were non-negotiable for the idiosyncratic CEO: he wanted 25% of the company, to control Tesla's future direction and to be fully compensated for a 2018 pay package that was hung up in litigation. THREATS TO LEAVE Musk threatened to leave more than once, and the board worried the company's AI talent would follow him out the door, it said in the filing. The $31 billion in restricted shares, which he cannot sell for at least five years, is partial payback for a $56 billion 2018 pay plan that a Delaware court voided last year. If Musk wins in court within a certain time frame, he will not receive the one-time payment "so there can be no 'double dip,'" the board said. "Musk also raised the possibility that he may pursue his other interests and leave Tesla if he did not receive such assurance," the board said. SHAREHOLDER PROVAL The pay plan is by far the largest ever for any CEO, Equilar said. And while it is likely to face legal challenges, compensation experts see it winning shareholder approval. "Time and time again, Tesla's shareholders have approved these grants over the years," Equilar Research Director Courtney Yu told Reuters. "While it may seem outlandish now, shareholders will get tremendous value out of it if Elon Musk is successful." None of Tesla's three largest outside investors, Vanguard Group, BlackRock or State Street, immediately said on Friday how they would vote. Among them, Vanguard and BlackRock supported Musk's $56 billion pay package last year, disclosures show, while State Street funds voted against it. Tesla and top funds can still expect pressure over the pay, however, with a number of union figures and public-sector treasurers voicing concern. "We urge shareholders to reject Musk’s money grab, take away the Tesla board’s rubber stamp, and restore basic corporate governance standards," said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, in a statement.

Business FILE PHOTO: A Tesla logo is seen at a Tesla showroom in Shanghai, China January 7, 2019. REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo NEW YORK :Tesla's $1 trillion, 10-year pay package to retain CEO Elon Musk is likely to be approved by shareholders at the company's annual meeting in November even though the amount is staggering. That is because it was crafted with an eye on keeping Musk in place, addressing concerns about the company's technical outlook and giving big company owners just enough reason to back the massive amount, investors and executive pay analysts said. Earlier on Friday, the automaker's board approved what it called "A Super Ambitious Incentive Package for a Pioneering, Ambitious and Unique CEO" that sets out lofty earnings and valuation targets – awarding Musk millions of shares over the next decade if he hits them. It immediately gives Musk 96 million shares of restricted stock worth more than $31 billion as of intraday trading on Friday that vests over the next two years, as well as more control over the company. His total 2025 compensation package is worth north of $113 billion, executive compensation research firm Equilar has estimated. “The pay package, which makes a big bet on the future of robots, may see shareholder support," said Taufiq Rahim, a SpaceX investor and principal at 2040 Advisory. "But it raises larger social questions about the outsized gains going to relatively few capital holders, which is likely not sustainable and will face public pressures.” Subscribe to our Chief Editor’s Week in Review Our chief editor shares analysis and picks of the week's biggest news every Saturday.

Title: Palantir CEO Alex Karp says U.S. labor workers won’t lose their jobs to AI—‘it’s not true’
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/09/05/palantir-ceo-alex-karp-ai-wont-replace-labor-jobs/
Time Published: 2025-09-05T21:52:00Z

Jessica Mathews is a senior writer for Fortune covering startups and the venture capital industry. As fears swirl that American manufacturing workers and skilled laborers may soon be replaced by artificial intelligence and robots, Alex Karp, CEO of the AI and data analytics software company Palantir Technologies, hopes to change the narrative. “It’s not true, and in fact, it’s kind of the opposite,” Karp said in an interview with Fortune Thursday at the company’s commercial customer conference, AIPCon, where Palantir customers showcased how they were using the company’s software platform and generative AI within their own businesses. The primary danger of AI in this country, says Karp, is that workers don’t understand that AI will actually help them in their roles—and it will hardly replace them. “Silicon Valley’s done an immensely crappy job of explaining that,” he said. “If you’re in manufacturing, in any capacity: You’re on the assembly line, you maintain a complicated machine—you have any kind of skilled labor job—the way we do AI will actually make your job more valuable and make you more valuable. But currently you would think—just roaming around the country, and if you listen to the AI narratives coming out of Silicon Valley—that all these people are going to lose their jobs tomorrow.” Karp made these comments the day before the Bureau of Labor Statistics released its August jobs report, which showcased a climbing unemployment rate and stagnating hiring figures, reigniting fears of whether AI is at all responsible for the broader slowdown. There has been limited data thus far suggesting that generative AI is to blame for the slowing jobs market—or even job cuts for that matter—though a recent ADP hiring report offered a rare suggestion that AI may be one of several factors influencing hiring sentiment. Some executives, including Salesforce’s Marc Benioff, have cited the efficiency gains of AI for layoffs at their companies, and others, like Ford CEO Jim Farley and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, have made lofty predictions about how AI is on track to replace jobs in the future. Most of these projections have been centered around white collar roles, in particular, versus manufacturing or skilled labor positions. Karp, who has a PhD in neoclassical social theory and a reputation for being outspoken and contrarian on many issues, argues that fears of AI eliminating skilled labor jobs are unfounded—and he’s committed to “correcting” the public perception. Earlier this week, Palantir launched “Working Intelligence: The AI Optimism Project,” a quasi-public information and marketing campaign centered around artificial intelligence in the workplace. The project has begun with a series of short blog posts featuring Palantir’s customers and their opinions on AI, as well as a “manifesto” that takes aim at both the “doomers” and “pacifiers” of AI. “Doomers fear, and pacifiers welcome, a future of conformity: a world in which AI flattens human difference. Silicon Valley is already selling such bland, dumbed-down slop,” the manifesto declares, arguing that the true power of AI is not to standardize but to “supercharge” workers. Jordan Hirsch, who is spearheading the new project at Palantir, said that there are approximately 20 people working on it and that they plan to launch a corresponding podcast. While Palantir has an obvious commercial interest in dispelling public fears about AI, Karp framed his commitment to the project as something important for society. Fears about job replacement will “feed a kind of weird populism based on a notion that’s not true—that’s going to make the factions on the right and left much, much, much more powerful based on something that’s not true,” he said. “I think correcting that—but not just by saying platitudes, but actually showing how this works, is one of the most important things we have to get on top of.” Karp said he planned to invest “lots of energy and money” into the AI Optimism Project. When asked how much money, he said he didn’t know yet, but that “we have a lot of money, and it’s one of my biggest priorities.” Palantir has seen enormous growth within the commercial side of its business in the last two years, largely due to the artificial intelligence product it released in 2023, called “AIP.” Palantir’s revenue surpassed $1 billion for the first time last quarter. And while Palantir only joined the S&P 500 last year, it now ranks as one of the most valuable companies in the world thanks to its soaring stock price. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: S&P 500 Gains and Losses Today: Lululemon Stock Plunges; Broadcom Charges Higher

Major U.S. equities indexes lost ground Friday after the Bureau of Labor Statistics released its latest employment report. The data showed the U.S. added fewer-than-expected jobs in August, and a downward revision to earlier estimates revealed the economy shed jobs in June, the first month of losses since 2020. The S&P 500 slid 0.3% on the final day of the holiday-shortened trading week. The Dow was down 0.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq ended the session with a fractional loss of less than 0.1%. Lululemon Athletica (LULU) shares fell the most of any stock in the S&P 500 on Friday, plummeting 18.6%. The maker of athletic apparel posted softer-than-expected same-store sales growth for its fiscal second quarter and trimmed its full-year revenue guidance, pointing to tariff impacts and sluggish U.S. sales. Jefferies analysts suggested Lululemon could face even tougher conditions ahead, citing competitive pressures and doubts about the company's pipeline of new designs. Shares of Kenvue (KVUE) dropped 9.4% after The Wall Street Journal reported the Department of Health and Human Services, under the leadership of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., plans to release a report suggesting a link between autism and pregnant women's use of Tylenol. The popular over-the-counter painkiller is made by Kenvue subsidiary McNeil Consumer Healthcare. A Kenvue spokesperson on Friday contested the claims allegedly made by the report. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares tumbled 6.6% after Seaport Research downgraded the chipmaker's stock to "hold" from "buy." Analysts pointed to signs of slowing demand for AMD's artificial intelligence accelerators, and noted it could become difficult for the company to meet lofty expectations. Broadcom (AVGO) shares surged 9.4%, logging the top performance in the S&P 500, after the chipmaker reported better-than-expected sales and adjusted profit for its fiscal third quarter. Demand for AI semiconductors boosted Broadcom's performance, with AI revenue rising 63% year-over-year. The company also said it had secured $10 billion in orders from a new customer, which reports later suggested was OpenAI. Shares of pool equipment supplier Pool Corp. (POOL) advanced 5.5% after Friday's weak jobs report cemented the case for an interest rate cut at the Federal Reserve's policy meeting later this month. Expectations of a rate cut caused the 10-year Treasury yield, which influences mortgage rates, to sink to its lowest level since April. Elevated mortgage rates have kept the U.S. housing market in a deep freeze for the last three years, which has dragged on the businesses of homebuilders and home goods producers like Pool. Tesla (TSLA) proposed a new compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk that could be worth roughly $1 trillion. Reaching that amount would require the electric vehicle maker's CEO and world's richest person to achieve certain performance targets, including helping Tesla reach a market cap of $8.5 trillion and a total of 20 million vehicle deliveries. Negotiations around Musk's compensation have grown contentious in the past, and shareholders are set to vote on the proposed package on Nov. 6. Tesla stock added 3.7% Friday.

Title: Stocks wobble as Wall Street wrangles with whether the job market is too weak

U.S. stocks wobbled lower on Friday as Wall Street questioned whether the U.S. job market has slowed by just enough to get the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates to help the economy, or by so much that a downturn may be on the way. After rising to an early gain, the S&P 500 erased it and fell 0.3% below the all-time high it set the day before. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 220 points, or 0.5%, after swinging between an early gain of nearly 150 points and a loss of 400. The Nasdaq composite edged down by less than 0.1%. The action was more decisive in the bond market, where Treasury yields tumbled after a report from the Labor Department said U.S. employers hired fewer workers in August than economists expected. The government also said that earlier estimates for June and July overstated hiring by 21,000 jobs. The disappointing numbers follow last month’s discouraging jobs update, along with other lackluster reports in intervening weeks, and traders are now betting on a 100% probability that the Fed will cut its main interest rate at its next meeting on Sept. 17, according to data from CME Group. Investors love such cuts because they can give a kickstart to the economy, but the Fed has held off on them because they can also give inflation more fuel. So far this year, the Fed has been more worried about the potential of inflation worsening because of President Donald Trump’s tariffs than about the job market. But Friday’s job numbers could push the Fed to consider cutting rates in two weeks by a steeper amount than usual, said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. “This week has been a story of a slowing labor market, and today’s data was the exclamation point,” according to Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. Strong hiring for health care jobs had been helping to support the overall market, “but with it now showing some tangible signs of decline, the foundation underneath the labor market seems to be cracking,” said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock. While the data on the job market is disappointing, it’s still not so weak that it’s screaming a recession is here, and the U.S. economy is continuing to grow. A big question for investors is whether the job market can remain in a balance where it’s not so strong that it prevents cuts to interest rates but also not so weak that the economy falls off. Uncertainty about that helped lead to Friday’s swings in the stock market. Wall Street needs things to go as hoped because it already sent stock prices to records amid expectations for a Goldilocks scenario where interest rates ease, and the economy keeps chugging along. On Wall Street, Friday’s heaviest weight was Nvidia, the chip company that’s become the face of the artificial-intelligence boom. It’s been contending with criticism that its stock price charged too high, too fast and became too expensive following Wall Street’s rush into AI, and it fell 2.7%. Lululemon dropped 18.6% after the yoga and athletic gear maker’s revenue for the latest quarter fell short of analysts’ expectations. CEO Calvin McDonald pointed to disappointing results from its U.S. operation, while Chief Financial Officer Meghan Frank said Lululemon is facing “industrywide challenges, including higher tariff rates.” Still, more stocks rose on Wall Street than fell. Leading the way was Broadcom, which climbed 9.4% after reporting better profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Hock Tan said customers are continuing to invest strongly in AI chips. Tesla rose 3.6% after proposing a payout package that could reach $1 trillion for its CEO, Elon Musk, if the electric vehicle company meets a series of extremely aggressive targets over the next 10 years. Smith & Wesson Brands jumped 6.5% after the gun maker delivered better results for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Mark Smith said it saw good demand for new products in what’s traditionally a slow season for sales of firearms. All told, the S&P 500 fell 20.58 points to 6,481.50. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 220.43 to 45,400.86, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 7.31 to 21,700.39.. In stock markets abroad, indexes in Europe lost early gains to turn lower with Wall Street. That followed strength across much of Asia. The Nikkei 225 rallied 1% in Tokyo after data showed accelerating growth in earnings for Japanese workers. Chinese markets rebounded following three days of decline, with indexes rising more than 1% in both Hong Kong and Shanghai. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury dropped to 4.09% from 4.17% late Thursday and from 4.28% on Tuesday. That’s a notable move for the bond market and could mean lower interest rates are coming for mortgages and other loans.

September 05, 2025 17:02 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, Sept. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in Novo Nordisk A/S ("Novo" or the "Company") (NYSE: NVO) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of Novo investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/novo-nordisk-a-s-lawsuit-submission-form-3?prid=165290&wire=3 NVO investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in Novo during the relevant time frame, you have until September 30, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff.

Title: Tesla Floats a Trillion-Dollar Pay Plan for CEO Elon Musk

Trillions are the new billions. Electric-vehicle company Tesla (TSLA) on Friday unveiled a proposed compensation package for Elon Musk that could grow to roughly $1 trillion if the CEO hits performance targets and collects all of the shares awarded. Between the new plan and shares he owns now, the estimated value of Musk's implied total stake in Tesla would exceed $2 trillion, cementing his status as the world's wealthiest human. Musk has to hit what the company called "Mars-shot milestones"—longer than a moonshot, to be sure—to be compensated in full, according to a company filing. In addition to market-cap milestones attached to the plan's share-award tranches, the company would have to meet operational milestones that start with product delivery targets and end with adjusted Ebitda hurdles. The first pair of milestones requires Tesla's market capitalization to reach and sustain $2 trillion and the company to deliver a cumulative total of 20 million vehicles. Market-cap targets jump by $500 billion with every tranche, with the last target being $8.5 trillion—more than double the current market cap of Nvidia (NVDA), the most valuable company in the world. Operational milestones include 1 million robotaxis in commercial operation as well as logging $400 billion in adjusted Ebitda over four consecutive quarters. The last two of the 12 tranche awards would only be granted after Musk sets a succession plan approved by Tesla. And he would have to stay at the company for at least 7 1/2 years. The plan, on which shareholders are scheduled to vote Nov. 6, could stir up drama if shareholder reactions are anything like receptions to past pay packages. In 2018, a group of Tesla investors balked when shareholders approved a 10-year performance-based pay plan that would award Musk a then-estimated $56 billion. A Delaware judge struck down the deal twice, and Tesla's board recently approved an interim stock award of 96 million shares of restricted stock. If Musk is awarded the original 2018 package, the interim award would be forfeited. In order for Musk to own his earned awards outlined in the 2025 pay package, he has to pay the equivalent of Tesla's closing price on Sept. 3, or roughly $334 per share in cash or stock, after he hits the 7 1/2-year mark, at the earliest, or after 10 years. During negotiations that stretched across 10 meetings, Musk threatened to "pursue his other interests" and leave Tesla if he wasn't assured he'd be compensated for his past services as outlined under the 2018 pay package and at least a 25% voting interest, according to the proxy filing, up from about 20% now. "The Committee believes the cost to Tesla and its shareholders is well worth it in light of the tremendous value that would be created, and strides in product development that would be realized, if the 2025 CEO Performance Award is fully achieved," Tesla's filing said. For now, investors appear pleased. Tesla shares rose almost 3% as of Friday afternoon to a recent $348.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk is the richest person in the world and he's all set to get richer. Musk, whose current net worth is close to $378 billion, was the first person to have a net worth of over $400 billion in December 2024, according to Bloomberg. Now, a proposed new pay package could make him a trillionaire. Tesla (TSLA) is asking its investors to approve a massive pay package for Musk which would be valued at nearly $1 trillion if he can lead the company to achieve certain valuation and operations milestones over the next 10 years, according to a recent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing. Musk's net worth is largely driven by his stakes in Tesla and privately held rocket and satellite manufacturing company, SpaceX. The additional shares under the new pay deal could push the value of Musk-owned Tesla shares to over $2 trillion. Tesla's share price increased more than 60% in 2024, with some of those gains coming after President Trump won the election in November. The company's shares were trading 8% lower year-to-date as of Sept. 5, 2025. An insider share sale of SpaceX in December 2024 also boosted Musk's net worth by about $50 billion, according to Bloomberg. Musk was vocal in his support for Trump, Forbes reported, joining him on the campaign trail and becoming Trump's second largest donor by putting $118 million into America PAC, which Musk created. He also served on Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency till May this year. Musk's wealth surpasses other notable billionnaires including Amazon.com (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, Meta's (META) Mark Zuckerberg, and Oracle's (ORCL) Larry Ellison according to Forbes and Bloomberg. Here's how the Tesla CEO made his billions. Tesla is one of the largest carmakers in the world. The company builds and designs fully electric vehicles and also makes energy generation and storage products like solar panels, solar roof tiles, and battery systems. Its vehicles include sedans, mid-size SUVs and the CyberTruck. Tesla was founded in 2003 as Tesla Motors by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. Musk invested in the company and was a member of the board starting in 2004. He became CEO in 2008. Musk was allowed to claim the title of cofounder after an out-of-court settlement. Tesla went public in an initial public offering (IPO) on June 29, 2010. In 2021, Tesla moved its headquarters from its native Palo Alto, Calif., to Austin, Texas. In July 2023, Tesla unveiled its first Cybertruck built in its Texas factory, almost two years behind the original schedule. Musk is Tesla's largest shareholder, and owns 19.7% of the company's stock as of August 29, 2025. Musk is also the cofounder and CEO of SpaceX, a rocket manufacturing company that counts NASA as a client and helps resupply the International Space Station. SpaceX became the most valuable startup in the world when it considered raising funds at a $400 billion valuation in July 2025, according to Bloomberg. Musk owns 42% of SpaceX, which has launched over 400 rockets since it was founded in 2002, and has more than 4 million subscribers for its Starlink internet service. In April 2022, Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion after threatening a hostile takeover. The deal was finalized in October 2022 after Twitter sued Musk for trying to back out of the deal. His takeover has been controversial, as he laid off much of the company’s workforce and added a paid subscription service ($8 per month) for anyone who wants their account verified. In July 2023, Musk rebranded Twitter as X, replacing the blue bird logo with the letter. Fidelity estimates that X is worth about $9.4 billion, according to Forbes, per disclosures released by the investment firm in September 2024. Fidelity's stake in X is now worth about $4.19 million, down about 79% before Musk bought X. Musk founded artificial intelligence firm xAI in 2023. In July 2025, the company was looking to raise fund from investors that would peg its valuation up to $200 billion, according to the Financial Times. The company also raised $10 billion vis loans and cash investments in June, following a $300 million share sale in July, the Financial Times reported. Musk owns about 54% of xAI, per Forbes. The team at xAI is led by Musk and others who have previously worked with OpenAI, DeepMind, Google Research, Microsoft Research, and Tesla. Musk is also the founder of The Boring Company, a construction company that aims to “solve traffic” by building tunnels. The company raised $675 million in April 2022 at a valuation of $5.7 billion, according to a release. Musk co-founded a company called Neuralink which designed a "brain-computer interface," a chip that can be implanted into the brain and would allow users to control their computers and mobile devices with their thoughts. According to the company's website, Neuralink is working to help those with quadriplegia, a symptom of paralysis that affects a person's limbs and body from the neck down, with the ability to control their devices with their thoughts. The company, which launched its first human trial in January 2024, was valued at an estimated $9 billion, after a raising $600 million earlier this year according to Semafor.

Title: Paramount’s new CEO tells employees to return to office full-time or quit ahead of layoffs

Role: ReporterMarco Quiroz-Gutierrez is a reporter for Fortune covering general business news. Paramount CEO David Ellison, in one of his first companywide memos, demanded staff come back to the office five days a week or else find a new job. Ellison, the founder and CEO of Skydance Media, became CEO of Paramount after its long-stalled $8 billion merger with Skydance was finalized last month. Since then, he has warned employees of efficiency changes, and said in an email that the new return-to-office mandate, which will be pushed out in phases starting January 2026, will “unlock Paramount’s full potential,” Fox News reported. But the mandate came with a not-so-subtle deadline: New York– or Los Angeles–based employees have until Sept. 15 to decide whether they will comply or take a buyout. The company will announce plans for employees based outside New York or L.A. in 2026, Ellison said in the email. “As I said during our town hall, some of the most formative moments of my life happened in rooms where I was a fly on the wall, listening and learning. I’ve never seen that happen on Zoom,” he wrote, according to Fox News. Paramount is the latest company to end COVID-era remote work policies as power shifts back to employers in the context of an increasingly worrying economic environment. Over the past year, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase, and Walmart have all told employees to get back to the office. At times these mandates have been slow to stick or have led to important losses, including for Walmart, which saw its Sam’s Club chief technology officer resign rather than move to the company’s Bentonville, Ark., headquarters. The return-to-office mandate comes as Paramount is reportedly preparing to lay off between 2,000 and 3,000 employees in November now that the merger is approved and resolved. As of December 2024, the company had 18,600 employees, Variety reported. Paramount did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment. Paramount’s revenues for the first half of the year fell 3% year over year to $14 billion from $14.5 billion. The company reported a slight uptick in overall revenue for the second quarter, but saw a 6% decline in its cash cow TV media segment, which includes broadcast operations like CBS and cable networks, including Showtime and Nickelodeon. Its direct-to-consumer business, which includes Paramount+, increased 15% year over year thanks to a subscription boost and price increases. Post-merger, Paramount has sought deals to spur growth, especially for its streaming services. The company in July signed a $1.5 billion landmark deal to host the animated comedy South Park on Comedy Central and Paramount+ for five years. The company also signed a three-year deal with Legendary Entertainment to market and distribute its theatrical films globally, starting with the new Street Fighter film set to release next year. At the same time, executives previously said $2 billion in potential cost cuts could be realized under the combined company. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: After 100 Years, Trillion-Dollar Fund Manager Wellington Wants You to Know Its Name

The staid, nearly century-old firm that mostly serves vanilla equity and bond strategies to buttoned-up institutions like pensions and endowments is moving aggressively into private markets and hedge funds and building its brand with retail investors. September 5, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- Wellington Management Co. is a rarity in the investment world: a fund manager with more than $1 trillion of assets and almost zero brand recognition. Not for long. The staid, nearly century-old firm that mostly serves vanilla equity and bond strategies to buttoned-up institutions like pensions and endowments is now moving aggressively into private markets and hedge funds. Wellington is spending big to hire from bulge-bracket banks and alternative investment firms, adding dozens of private markets professionals to build a unit of about 40 people. It’s also hustling to build a brand with retail investors, many of whom have never heard of the $1.3 trillion firm. It’s a big change for a money manager that for decades didn’t care about what the world thought, as long as its big institutional clients were happy. Among its recent hires, Wellington recruited a head of private investments capital formation from Goldman Sachs Group Inc., poached a team from Pacific Investment Management Co. to expand in private credit and hired Christina Kopec Rooney from Goldman’s asset management arm to head its nascent push into the US wealth market. It even partnered with private equity giant Blackstone Inc. and Vanguard Group to launch hybrid funds for retail investors. Related:Merrill, Bank of America Private Bank Launch Alternative Investment Program for UHNW Investors In perhaps its most radical shift, Wellington – housed across 19 floors in Boston’s Atlantic Wharf – has done the previously unthinkable: It hired a public relations team. “It’s unfamiliar,” said Steve Klar, Wellington’s president. It’s a sign of the times. Tectonic shifts in asset management are pushing the firm, and others like it, out of their comfort zone. Traditional asset managers under pressure from outflows and fee compression in their mutual funds are striving to break into the more lucrative private markets to boost their margins and assets before their competitors gain all the spoils. Rivals such as Franklin Resources Inc. and T. Rowe Price Group Inc., and even the likes of industry giants BlackRock Inc. and State Street Corp., are diving in headfirst, buying alternative investment firms or partnering with private equity shops to launch funds. On Thursday, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said it will purchase as much as $1 billion of T. Rowe Price shares as the two team up to sell private-market products. Wellington’s Chief Executive Officer Jean Hynes said in an interview at the firm’s headquarters that despite relying mostly on stickier institutional money, she knows the firm isn’t immune to the intense pressures reshaping the asset management industry. Client migration to cheap passive funds has pushed the industry’s average fee down to just 0.3% from about 1% two decades ago, according to Morningstar Inc. (Vanguard — Wellington’s largest client, accounting for about a third of the firm’s assets — charges an average fee of 0.07%.) Related:Goldman to Buy $1 Billion of T. Rowe Stock as Firms Team Up Wellington argues it’s especially well positioned among its peers to go big on private markets. The firm’s executives say its private partnership structure – with no shareholders to answer to – gives the firm control, allowing it to play the long game and retain its tight-knit culture. Michael Carmen, a partner at Wellington who’s behind the expansion, says that an ambitious 10-year plan kicked off in 2023 to grow the private markets unit that now manages only $9.7 billion. He’s even interviewing candidates to start a secondaries business to acquire illiquid positions from other investors, one of the hottest areas in alternative investing. Its new emphasis on higher-fee alternatives is already shifting internal power dynamics at a time when different teams inside the firm are fighting for resources. Some who work in the more traditional, lower-fee parts of the business say that as private markets become more prominent at the firm, the rewards are going disproportionately to employees who work in that business, according to people familiar with their thinking. Related:No Gold in Morningstar’s First Batch of Semiliquid Ratings Klar, one of three people who determines partner compensation, said this is not the case. If the privates business does well, then all the partners at Wellington benefit, he said. While most of Wellington’s assets are in privately held accounts, for which information isn’t available, data for its public funds offer a glimpse into the industry’s struggles. About 160 funds with combined assets of a half-trillion dollars managed or sub-advised by the firm recorded outflows of more than $130 billion between 2022 and the end of June 2025, according to Morningstar. Wellington’s growing hedge fund franchise, set up in the mid-1990s, now manages about $20 billion in long-short strategies. While that’s a tiny slice of the firm’s overall assets, it accounts for an outsize share of the firm’s profits. To attract and retain the talent needed to generate the above-market returns many alternative investment clients expect, the firm has also had to utilize other routes to a big payday besides its classic and lengthy path to becoming a partner. Alternative investment portfolio staffers are compensated in line with market standards, Klar said. For those deemed to have a big impact on the firm’s financial performance, there’s always the position of managing director — a role that allows staff to share in some of the profits without having been named partner. Wellington’s push into wealth is also forcing the firm to rethink another closely guarded aspect of its culture: its secrecy. For decades, the asset manager was so content with having a name known only among pensions and endowments that it made a point of not having a public profile. But Wellington often took its privacy to extremes. A former employee recalls that it was so hard to find information about the firm when he joined 20 years ago that he wasn’t sure it was a legitimate company until he had his first interview. People at bank wealth channels — which play a vital role in selling Wellington’s products to individuals — have said that everyday investors don’t know the firm and, for the funds to sell, the brand needs to be bigger. And so, Wellington has reluctantly begun hiring its first public relations people in recent years. It’s learning, slowly but surely, how to put itself out there. This isn’t the first time Wellington has had to reinvent itself. The firm, founded in 1928, faced an existential crisis 50 years ago after a disastrous run in equities nearly left it for dead. Its roughly two dozen partners at the time mortgaged their houses and used the money to delist the firm from the stock market. It later fired Jack Bogle, in 1974, after disagreements with Wellington partners over investment strategy and personnel matters. Bogle went on to found Vanguard, and Wellington agreed to run active strategies for his new outfit. Vanguard eventually became a household name synonymous with the 401(k) market, while Wellington built its brand with institutional clients and shunned the spotlight. In the ensuing years Wellington became less Boston-centric, opened offices and launched funds in Europe and Asia and abandoned a fixation on US equities to start investing in international stocks and, more recently, in bonds. (Today, about 40% of its assets are in fixed income.) As it looks to its next century, the firm is stretching further beyond the status quo. As part of its partnership with Blackstone and Vanguard, Wellington now oversees around 100 people globally working on the project. Terry Burgess, one of the firm’s top three decision makers, is in charge of the effort. Klar said that beyond courting retail investors, the firm’s alts expansion — and attracting talent for that business — is another reason Wellington wants its name out there. As it peddles its brand, Wellington now records podcasts, produces videos with weekly market updates, and churns out regular press releases.

Title: Google's $3.5B Fine Signals End of Big Tech's Free Pass

Google's regulatory reckoning has finally arrivedâand it's expensive. The tech giant is facing a historic $3.5 billion fine from European authorities for breaking antitrust laws, but this is just the tip of the iceberg. With courts finding Google liable for maintaining monopoly power and global antitrust enforcement fines hitting $6.7 billion in 2024âmore than double 2023's totalâwe're witnessing a fundamental shift in how regulators approach Big Tech monopolies. PRO TIP: This isn't just about one company getting fined. The coordinated global crackdown on Google represents the end of Big Tech's "move fast and break things" era. For consumers and competitors, this could mean real change in how we access information and digital services. Let's break down the scale of Google's legal troubles. In April 2025, U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema found Google liable for 'willfully acquiring and maintaining monopoly power' through its integration of advertising tools. The court found that Google violated antitrust laws by monopolizing open-web digital advertising markets for over 15 years, manipulating ad-tech auctions and stifling competition. Here's where it gets interesting: Google's dominance isn't just about search. The company commands more than 90% of Android app downloads and processes over 24 billion updates per week through its Play Store. That level of control means Google decides which developers succeed, what users can access, and how much everyone pays. The EU's approach has been particularly aggressive. The Digital Markets Act designated Google as a 'gatekeeper', imposing strict data governance rules. The EU can fine companies up to 10% of their global annual revenue for DMA violations, which translates to a potential $35 billion maximum penalty based on Google's 2024 earnings. The genius of Google's strategyâand what makes it so problematicâlies in how its 2008 DoubleClick acquisition created the infrastructure for today's violations. By purchasing the dominant ad-serving platform, Google didn't just buy a competitor; it acquired the tools to control every step of the digital advertising process. This acquisition enabled Google to implement the DMA-violating practices and Play Store restrictions that courts are now finding illegalâturning what appeared to be routine business expansion into the foundation of systematic market manipulation. Google's advertising empire is where the real money flowsâand where regulators are focusing their firepower. These ad tech tools account for roughly $95 billion in annual revenue, approximately 15% of Alphabet's total revenue. But here's the kicker: Google's advertising technologies generate about $30 billion annually and form the backbone of internet economics. The DOJ's case reveals how Google systematically eliminated competition. The DOJ has demanded a structural divestiture of Google's ad tech business, including the sale of DFP and AdX. Internal evidence shows Google takes a 20 percent commission on transactions carried out through its ad exchange, while Google's DFP ad server has enjoyed a market share of 84 to 90 per cent over the last ten years. The court's findings are damning. Google engaged in unlawful conduct to maintain monopolies by limiting publisher ad server access and requiring publishers who wanted access to AdX to use DFP. This isn't just market dominanceâit's market manipulation. Bottom line: Google essentially became the auctioneer, the auction house, and the payment processor all at once. When competitors tried to offer better deals or more innovative solutions, Google made it increasingly difficult for them to participate. Internal documents revealed that Google deliberately designed its systems to favor its own servicesâand when publishers tried to resist these changes, Google knew they had no choice but to comply or lose access to essential advertising revenue. The European Commission isn't playing games. Abuse of dominance decisions by The European Commission accounted for over 75% of the overall global fine volume in 2024. Beyond Google, the EC set its third ever highest fine with its EUR1.84 billion fine on Apple and fined Meta EUR792.7 million for abusing its dominance. Google's European troubles run deep. The EU's top court upheld a record-breaking â¬2.4 billion fine for anti-competitive promotion of its Shopping service. Google was leveraging its dominant position on the market for general search services to favour its own comparison shopping service, presenting search results with attractive visual information while relegating competitors to basic links. The pattern is clear: Google has accumulated penalty exposure of more than 8 billion euros by the EU for various antitrust violations. This isn't just about one caseâit's systematic regulatory pushback against Google's market practices. What makes Europe's approach revolutionary is its shift from traditional antitrust thinking. Unlike previous cases that focused on consumer harm through higher prices, the EU's Digital Markets Act targets "gatekeeper behavior" that stifles innovation and choice. In the Shopping case, the court found that Google's conduct was discriminatory and did not fall within the scope of competition on the merits. Translation: Google wasn't winning because it was betterâit was winning by rigging the game, and that's enough for enforcement action regardless of immediate consumer impact. The stakes couldn't be higher. The remedies trial will decide whether Google must divest its ad tech assets or adopt behavioral changes, with the U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust showdown with Google entering its final phase this fall. Google isn't going down without a fight. The company has opposed the breakup, warning of 'seismic disruptions' to its ad tech ecosystem and proposes behavioral adjustments, such as ending UPR and sharing bid data with competitors. But UBS warned in 2025 that a forced breakup of Google's ad-tech business could trigger a 30% stock plunge. The ripple effects extend far beyond Google. A breakup could create opportunities for rivals like Meta, TikTok, and independent ad tech firms, while the case mirrors EU antitrust actions against Google and could influence ongoing U.S. cases targeting Amazon and Meta. Here's what makes Google's predicament particularly challenging: the company has already tried to make concessions, proposing alternative billing options and even considering partial divestitures to appease European regulators. But publishers rejected the proposal, viewing these measures as insufficient half-steps that fail to address the fundamental structural problems. With the Biden and Trump administrations both supporting this case, there's rare bipartisan consensus that meaningful action is requiredâmaking it nearly impossible for Google to wait out the regulatory storm. Bottom line: We're witnessing the end of Big Tech's regulatory free pass. The Biden and Trump administrations both have supported this case, showing rare bipartisan cooperation in prosecuting tech monopolies. The current batch of significant antitrust cases working through the courts could eventually provide the U.S. Supreme Court an opportunity to reshape antitrust jurisprudence for the digital era. Google's $3.5 billion fine isn't just a penaltyâit's a signal that the era of unchecked tech dominance is ending. With global antitrust enforcement reaching unprecedented levels and regulators worldwide coordinating their efforts, the question isn't whether Google will face more consequences, but how dramatically the entire tech landscape will reshape in response. What makes this regulatory moment truly unprecedented is the coordinated international response. European, American, and other regulators are no longer working in isolationâthey're sharing intelligence, coordinating enforcement strategies, and learning from each other's legal frameworks. This makes it impossible for tech giants to play regulatory arbitrage or simply absorb fines as a cost of doing business. When the EU develops new approaches like the Digital Markets Act's "gatekeeper" framework, U.S. courts take notice, creating a global convergence toward tougher tech oversight. The implications cascade beyond Google to the entire interconnected web of Big Tech dominance. Apple faces its own antitrust challenges, Meta confronts divestiture demands around Instagram and WhatsApp, and Amazon faces scrutiny over its treatment of third-party sellers. Unlike previous enforcement efforts that tackled companies in isolation, regulators now understand how these platforms reinforce each other's market power and are addressing the ecosystem systematically. For users, developers, and competitors who've been squeezed by Google's dominance, this regulatory reckoning might finally level the playing field. If these enforcement actions deliver on their promise, we could see genuine choice in search engines, real competition in digital advertising, and innovation from companies that no longer face impossible barriers to entry. The real test will be whether these legal victories translate into tangible changes in how we experience and interact with digital platforms. The era of "move fast and break things" is over.

Joseph Chalom, co-CEO of SharpLink, told Decrypt that the treasury company is currently staking almost the entirety of its holdings through its custodians, Anchorage and Coinbase. However, as the company matures, it will look to diversify the staking vehicles it utilizes as it seeks out higher-yield opportunities. “When you hold billions of dollars of ETH and you're looking at a portfolio of staking, there is going to be an ability to deploy that through staking opportunities on Linea,” Chalom told Decrypt. “And that is really, really important, not only to Consensys, but to the Linea Consortium. And if there are opportunities that SharpLink can avail itself of to get better yield, higher risk-adjusted yield through the Linea network, we will do that.” "SharpLink has been staking our ETH after purchasing through a combination of native staking and liquid staking tokens," he added. "As we expand our potential staking opportunities, we will be actively considering Linea-based staking opportunities." The co-CEO stressed the importance of driving real-world activity to “Ethereum-aligned” projects, Linea being one of those. He explained that by driving high-quality activity towards these kinds of projects, it should, in turn, also drive up the price of Ethereum—which is ultimately in the interest of SharpLink as one of the largest holders of ETH. “When I say we're here to support Ethereum, we're here to support Ethereum and the L2s that derive from it,” he added. “So not only allocating tokens for Linea bootstrapping [as part of the Linea Consortium], but also [exploring] potential opportunities in staking and liquidity provision, given how much ETH we as a treasury want.” Back in July, SharpLink joined the Linea Consortium—a group of companies that will steward 75% of the LINEA token distribution. Chalom said the Consortium is “mission-aligned” to make Linea a “highly successful” layer-2 network, adding that the token launch will “bootstrap” the network with more than 80% of the supply being used to support on-chain projects. Consensys, the creator of Linea, is led by CEO Joe Lubin, who is also a co-founder of Ethereum and the chairman of SharpLink's board of directors. As such, it's only natural that Linea aims to support the Ethereum base layer through mechanics such as native yield on bridged ETH and ETH burns—a response to the narrative that layer-2 networks take value away from Ethereum’s mainnet. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in an editorially independent Decrypt.) That said, exactly how much Ethereum the firm bridges over to Linea and in what capacity it will be used to generate yield has yet to be confirmed. Five weeks ago, Ethereum celebrated 10 years of zero downtime. Next week, LINEA becomes the most significant token to enter the ecosystem since ETH itself. The eligibility checker is now live ahead of the September 10 TGE. Check yours at https://t.co/GDV3kRe0Kf pic.twitter.com/emB8WlqCNF — Linea.eth (@LineaBuild) September 3, 2025 "We are, at this point, trying to figure out what is the optimal portfolio of staking, beyond just vanilla, native staking through custodians,” Chalom explained. “We're also investors and staking liquidity providers to Liquid Collective, which is a liquid staking token. There are ways to drive more of the delegation to participants on the Linea network, even through native staking as well as liquid staking." “It’s early days. I’m not really comfortable sharing exactly what the plans are, because we’re trying to figure out the entire portfolio of staking,” he added. “Remember: The number-one thing an ETH treasury is supposed to do is preserve its capital. The second is to have that capital appreciate, and the third is to go along the risk spectrum and drive yield.” At the time of writing, SharpLink’s entire treasury of $3.6 billion worth of Ethereum—or approximately 0.69% of the total supply—is being staked with its custodians. However, the firm is on the precipice of diversifying where and how it is using its Ethereum. “We're at a pivotal moment in terms of opportunities to stake, and we want to do it in a way that really, really is diversified,” Chalom explained. “So I think what you'll find is we're going to walk before we run, but our goal is to drive the highest yields on a risk-adjusted basis for our investors.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Using The Blog Module vs Divi 5’s Loop Builder

Posted on September 5, 2025 by Christopher Morris Leave a Comment The Blog Module is Divi’s built-in feed generator that works out of the box. It gives you a fast way to list posts with toggles for titles, images, excerpts, and metadata. Divi 5’s new Loop Builder takes a different approach. You design the item with any modules, then feed dynamic content into it. Both tools display looped content, yet each shines in different scenarios. Knowing when to use which saves time and prevents frustration. Let’s compare the two. Subscribe To Our Youtube Channel This is a short set of terms for beginners who are new to the concept of a Loop Builder: If you get lost in some of the details, refer back to this glossary. But we’ll make things simple for you along the way. The Blog Module is built for recognizable blog patterns. It assumes common elements and lets you toggle what shows, keeping setup fast and decisions simple. Think about how blog posts work in WordPress. Every post shares certain common elements that make it recognizable as blog content. These shared characteristics include: The Blog Module was designed with traditional posts in mind. Titles tell you what the post covers. Featured images add visual draw. Excerpts preview the content. Metadata says who wrote it and when. Divi’s Blog Module syncs to these elements automatically. You drop it on the page and pick what to show. The feed appears with no custom query work at all (unless you want to limit what’s being shown, in which case there are built-in querying tools). The toggle approach makes changes painless. You can hide the author but keep the date, show the image, or skip the excerpt. Small decisions yield quick results. The Blog Module can display normal posts and properly register Custom Post Types. The Blog Module works fine when the CPT mirrors standard post fields. It becomes limiting when you need true custom data. So, a Team Member CPT works when things are kept simple. The Blog Module handles this situation with ease. Limitations appear with any fields that default posts don’t share. Social links, certifications, or years of experience won’t appear in the Blog Module because it was built for the standard fields found on default WordPress blog posts. The module has no toggle for those custom fields. Layout control is also slightly constrained; the module packs elements inside a fixed structure in a fixed order. You can’t reorder the title and image unless you use custom CSS. You can manage the layout of each blog card via flexbox or block, but child items (the cards) don’t have Sizing settings for child flexbox control (like shrink to fit or grow to fill). ﻿ The Blog Module is excellent and fast to use for standard card layouts. If you get a bit of a creative bug, you might find yourself looking for something more custom. Divi’s Loop Builder offers you a different approach to displaying dynamic content. Instead of working within the constraints of a single module with predetermined elements, Loop Builder allows you to construct your content display from individual Divi Modules arranged exactly as you envision them. Using the Loop Builder requires more thought and preparation, but you won’t be limited in the ways you were with the Blog Module. With the Blog Module, you work within existing constraints and make the best of predetermined options. With Loop Builder, you start with a blank canvas and construct exactly what you need using any combination of Divi Modules. Loop Builder is not a single module. It is a container with your chosen modules inside it. When the container is set to “Loop,” it repeats itself for each matching result. Inside the container, you can place Image, Heading, Text, and Button modules. You bind the content of each of those modules to the correct token. Divi’s UI makes this pretty simple. The Image points to the featured image. The Heading points to the title. The Button links to the post URL. This modular approach gives you structure and spacing control. You can put images above or beside titles. You can also add two text blocks for two custom fields. This way, you can build the card you need, not a card that is pre-configured via a module. Let’s make this concrete with a couple of quick scenarios. We’ll keep the pattern and swap the fields. Let’s use the card design from our previous example and see how it can be adapted using custom post types and custom fields. First, build a custom Loop for standard blog posts. Use the stand Posts ‘post type’ with the standard fields for title, category, publish date, and feature image. Map each to the respective module in your design. These use standard post fields but are arranged in a unique layout. We can do something similar for some simple real estate listings. Using the same card layout, we can populate content from our custom post type with the heading assigned to the property title, Text Modules assigned to bedrooms, bathrooms, and property description, and a Button bound to the property listing URL. The end result looks like our blog card, but uses the Loop Builder’s ability to assign content from Custom Fields and Custom Post Types. All this talk of CPTs, how do you make those? Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) is the go-to choice here. Pods, Meta Box, ACPT, and Toolset also create fields that Loop Builder can read. Use what fits your budget, experience, and stack. A note for real estate websites: You’ll want to use a dedicated plugin that pulls listings from an IDX into WordPress as a CPT. That way, you have fresh data and minimal manual work (no one wants to manually enter properties every morning). Flexbox pairs naturally with the Loop Builder. You can use it at two levels for a clean, responsive structure without custom CSS. First, style the outer loop container. Select the loop parent container. Turn on Flex layout. Set direction to Row. Enable Wrap if you want multiple flex-rows. Set Gap to control spacing between items. Then, adjust the sizing of the child container where your loop sits using the Sizing options. You can create a responsive and attractive layout for your looped elements between the container Flex controls and the child Flex controls. Second, style the inner card layout. Select the root container inside the loop item (the Column or Group Module, for instance). In Layout options, set Flex direction to Row if you want some elements side by side. Set the width of the image module to take up about half the space in the container. Let the text area (in this case, a Group container with various modules inside) fill the rest (Grow to Fill in Group Module Sizing options). You can arrange the various containers or modules however you want. You aren’t locked into a preconfigured layout. Here we put the Title in the left Group and set the right group to Flex Column. This gives us a subtle yet unique change of layout. There really is no shortage of possibilities. ﻿﻿ This is less about raw features and more about finding the right fit. Pick the fastest path that meets the requirement. Switch tools when the need changes. Sometimes the Blog Module will do the trick, but you have a strong pivot with the Loop Builder when it doesn’t. Reach for the Blog Module when content follows standard post patterns. Title, featured image, excerpt, and basic meta are its sweet spot. Basic news sites, company updates, and simple portfolios qualify. Visitors expect a conventional layout, and you may want a reliable solution with minimal setup. With the Blog Module, you can ship a working feed in minutes. Fewer moving parts also mean fewer chances to break things (or get confused). Non-technical users who might still be lost on the concept of a “loop” will still heavily rely on the Blog Module. It’s a great tool and should absolutely be used. Use Loop Builder when you need fields that posts don’t have, or when your card structure doesn’t match a stock pattern. Ecommerce, real estate, and education are typical industries that tend to need more customization. Each needs details that live in custom fields. When you are working with more content or more types of content, layouts tend to need more flexibility. Use Loop Builder when content relationships get complex. You may need to mix post types in one view and show content from repeaters. Divi’s Blog Module is still the fastest way to ship a standard feed. The Loop Builder unlocks custom cards, custom fields, and repeaters. The Loop Builder can also be customized and molded into the exact layout and design that you have in mind, while the Blog Module has some limitations there. The best part about this decision is that you can keep both in your toolkit and choose based on the job. Divi 5 is coming together and is more powerful (and stable) than ever.

U.S. equities turned lower at midday following the government's weaker-than-expected August employment report. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq were down. Lululemon Athletica (LULU) was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 after the fashion athletic apparel retailer reported lower-than-anticipated comparable store sales on soft demand in the U.S., and cut its guidance on higher costs relating to new tariffs and the removal of the de minimus exemption for lower-priced imports. Shares of Copart (CPRT) dipped when the online auto auctioneer missed revenue estimates as vehicle sales declined. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares fell on a downgrade from Seaport Research, which pointed to concerns about the chipmaker's AI accelerator business. Broadcom (AVGO) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 after the software maker posted better-than-anticipated results and said it had a new $10 billion customer. Speculation is that the customer is AI giant OpenAI. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) rose when the electric vehicle maker offered CEO Elon Musk a 10-year pay package that could be worth $1 trillion. Docusign (DOCU) shares jumped when the electronic signature software firm beat profit and sales estimates and raised its outlook as larger customers were using its AI products. Oil futures sank. Gold prices advanced. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note dropped. The U.S. dollar lost ground to the euro, pound, and yen. Most major cryptocurrencies traded higher.

Title: What’s up with… Ciena, Telecom Italia, Starlink in India
URL: https://www.telecomtv.com/content/access-evolution/what-s-up-with-ciena-telecom-italia-starlink-in-india-53773/
Time Published: 2025-09-05T14:47:16Z
Full Content:
Sep 5, 2025 In today’s industry news roundup: Ciena’s on a roll; Telecom Italia’s new largest shareholder is Italy’s state-owned postal service; Elon Musk’s Starlink is prepping for its satellite broadband launch in India; and more! As we reported on Thursday, Ciena is benefitting from the rising investments needed in network capacity as cloud, video and, in particular, AI-related data volumes increase, as it reported a 29.4% year-on-year increase in revenues to $1.22bn for its fiscal third quarter that ended on 2 August. In the company’s earnings presentation, the optical, routing and automation software technology vendor noted that in addition to that stellar growth continuing into its fiscal fourth quarter, it is also set to extend into its fiscal year 2026, which runs (roughly) November 2025 to the end of October 2026. The company expects full year revenues for fiscal 2026 to be 17% higher than in fiscal 2025 (which ends in late October), way higher than the 10% growth that financial analysts had been expecting. That growth is being driven by increasing investments from the hyperscalers, big tech giants/datacentre operators, such as Meta, and major US telcos, such as Verizon, AT&T and Lumen Technologies. Fiscal 2025 full year revenues are set to come in at around $4.7bn, so that puts Ciena’s expectation for its fiscal 2026 sales at $5.5bn. No wonder the vendor’s share price jumped by an incredible 23.3% on Thursday to end the day at $116.92. Italy’s state-owned postal service Poste Italiane has been given unconditional approval by the country’s antitrust authority, the AGCM (Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato), to acquire a 15% stake in national telco Telecom Italia (TIM) from French media giant Vivendi. The deal was first announced in late March. According to Poste Italiane, “the AGCM resolved to approve the transaction unconditionally and, therefore, not to initiate an investigation, as it does not significantly impede effective competition in the affected markets and does not result in the creation or strengthening of a dominant position”. As a result of the purchase, Poste Italiane is now Telecom Italia’s largest single shareholder, with a total stake of 24.81%. In August, Telecom Italia reported revenues of €6.6bn, up 2.7%, for the first six months of the year, and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) up 5% to €1.7bn. Starlink, Elon Musk’s low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellation that is having a major impact on the global broadband services and direct-to-cell (D2C) communications sectors, has received a provisional spectrum licence from India’s Department of Telecommunications (DoT) so it can trial its satellite broadband services in the country. The New India Express reports that Starlink is setting up ground stations at 10 locations across India as well as a main operations hub in Mumbai. The operator now has to prove it can comply with India’s security rules during a number of tests and trials: If it is successful it will be awarded a full licence, though the DoT noted that full licence pricing and terms are still to be finalised. The expectation, though, is that Starlink will proceed without any major issues and soon become an influential player in India’s broadband services sector, not least because it has already struck partnerships with India’s two largest telcos, Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel. US long-distance operator Lumen Technologies is to use Palantir Technologies’ Foundry and Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) to help transform its business. “Lumen is transforming from traditional telecom into a next-generation technology infrastructure company leveraging its physical fiber network, digitally powered platform and connected ecosystem,” noted Palantir in this announcement. “To meet customers’ evolving multicloud, AI-ready needs, Lumen is collaborating with Palantir across its operations, finance and technology functions to unlock new value. Palantir’s Foundry and AIP aim to streamline workflows, accelerate decision-making, and simplify complex legacy operations – from customer service and compliance reporting to the decommissioning of legacy telecom infrastructure and migration of products into modernised ecosystems. By surfacing actionable insights and enabling AI-assisted decision-making, the software is driving faster execution and improved operational efficiency, empowering Lumen to transform its network and services with speed,” added Palantir. Dave Ward, chief technology and product officer of Lumen Technologies, stated: “As Lumen powers the backbone of the AI economy, we’re determined to make our own operations intelligent and efficient, just like the networks we deliver to our customers. Working with Palantir allows us to harness AI to accelerate our modernisation efforts and deliver the network and services our customers need in the AI era.” – The staff, TelecomTV Sep 5, 2025 Sep 5, 2025 Sep 4, 2025 Sep 4, 2025 Sep 4, 2025 Sign up to receive TelecomTV's top news and videos, plus exclusive subscriber-only content direct to your inbox.

Title: Jumbo-rate-cut chatter is rising after a dismal jobs report

Time Published: 2025-09-05T14:44:05Z

The job market tripped up big time last month. In a way, that's exactly what the market was looking for. Investors are taking weak August jobs data as a green light to fully expect the Fed to cut interest rates at its next policy meeting — a major bullish catalyst for stocks that the market has been anticipating all year. The priced-in probability that the Fed will cut rates at its September FOMC meeting surged to 100% Friday morning, shortly after jobs growth was found to badly miss expectations in August. The odds of a jumbo-sized 50 basis-point rate cut also jumped to around a 12% chance the Fed could make the decision to announce the equivalent of two rates. It's a relatively rare occurrence, although the Fed did announce a jumbo cut in September 2024 as well. "The labor market is soft, even though the economy is in pretty good shape, meaning the Fed's got to cut," Rick Rieder, the CIO of global fixed income at BlackRock, where he oversees $2.4 trillion, told Bloomberg after the report. "I think the Fed could cut 50 basis points. I think they should." David Kelly, the chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, told Business Insider that while a jumbo rate cut is in play, he still needs to see more data. "Whether they cut 50 or not, depends upon the strength of the inflation number that we get next week," he said. The jobs report is another example of how bad news is turning into good news for the market as investors eye soon-to-come monetary policy easing. Jobs growth over the last four months has been lackluster and fueled concerns about a potential recession, but the prospect of rate cuts being just around corner is too good for investors to pass up, explaining why stocks remain around all-time highs. The economy added just 22,000 jobs over the month of August, falling significantly short of the 75,000 job gains that were expected for the month. Several sectors in the labor market also showed net job losses. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, ticked higher to 4.3% from 4.2%, the highest jobless rate recorded since 2021. "With the weak job growth, the Fed is cleared to cut rates in September. The question is whether we get 25bp or 50bp," Scott Helfstein, the head of investment strategy at Global X, wrote in a note on Friday. "Job growth is clearly signaling a slowdown in the economy," Kevin O'Neil, a senior research analyst at Brandywine Global, wrote in a note. "The weakness in the labor market is too significant for the Fed to ignore," he added. The jobs report didn't contain all bad news. Wage growth remained steady and grew at a 3.7% clip year-over-year, offering one glimmer of optimism, Helfstein added. "Though there may be fewer new jobs, wages growing faster than inflation means the consumer is likely to keep spending, and that remains an important driver in this part of the economic cycle. That may be the silver lining here," he said. Jump to

Title: Crypto pours into TradFi faster than Wall Street can keep up, says Franklin Templeton’s crypto lead
URL: https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/crypto-firms-take-wall-street-by-storm-says-franklin-crypto-lead/
Time Published: 2025-09-05T14:37:53Z

About us Copy link The race to attract crypto investors is heating up. While some traditional financial institutions had already begun experimenting with blockchain products, regulatory shifts in the US in 2025 have sharply accelerated crypto’s push into mainstream finance. Roger Bayston, Franklin Templeton’s head of digital assets, told DL News that the speed at which crypto firms are entering securities-related businesses is significantly faster than that of financial institutions adopting blockchain technology. “There’s the ‘have-wallet’ ecosystem, and the ‘want-wallet’ ecosystem,” Bayston said, characterising these two groups. “The ‘have-wallet’ ecosystem is likely to journey into the securities-related businesses faster than the ‘want wallet’ ecosystems. In the past few weeks, Bayston’s “have-wallet” players have indeed stormed traditional finance en masse. On Wednesday, Ondo Finance, a tokenisation platform, announced that it would enable users to trade tokens representing over 100 stocks and exchange-traded funds on Ethereum. ‘The “have-wallet” ecosystem, which was tremendously influential in the election.’ Earlier this year, heavyweight crypto exchanges, including Kraken and Coinbase, announced plans to offer users stock trading as well. This influx is largely due to the drastic changes in the US under President Donald J. Trump. In July, he signed into law landmark legislation that makes the issuance of stablecoins legal for banks and non-banks. Trump-appointed commissioners at the Securities and Exchange Commission have either paused or halted several high-profile lawsuits against numerous crypto companies, too. “The ‘have-wallet’ ecosystem, which was tremendously influential in the election, and got them regulations melted away, and many new ideas moving forward,” Bayston said. Traditional financial institutions, by contrast, have gradually inched onto the blockchain over the past few years. Franklin Templeton was one of the first, after it launched its BENJI fund on Ethereum in 2021. Other prominent brands, such as BlackRock, the $12 trillion asset manager, launched a similar money market fund in November 2024. These days, the tokenisation market, a niche representing the total of various financial instruments that exist on the blockchain, is now worth more than $28 billion, according to RWA.xyz. Bayston believes these two disparate worlds will soon merge into a single market, portfolio by portfolio — so long as a business can cater to the full range of investor interests. “It’s going to be a 24/7 environment where you can highly customise your portfolio, and the more customisation that can be delivered, the stickier the assets are for that platform,” he said. Naturally, Bayston and Franklin Templeton expect to be well placed for this transition. “Navigating that kind of in-between space as all of these things move forward is something we find to be a very promising thing to be doing.” Liam Kelly is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News.

Title: Tokenization Is 'Mutual Fund 3.0,' Bank of America Says

Bank of America (BAC) sees tokenization, the creation of a virtual investment vehicle on the blockchain linked to a tangible asset, as the next phase in the evolution of investment products, describing it as “mutual fund 3.0,” the Wall Street bank said in a Friday report. Just as mutual funds first emerged in 1924 and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) reshaped investing in the 2000s, blockchain technology could underpin a new generation of financial vehicles, analysts led by Craig Siegenthaler wrote. Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization is advancing quickly. The bank noted that firms like Securitize are working with managers including BlackRock (BLK), Apollo, KKR and Hamilton Lane to issue tokenized funds. Asset manager WisdomTree (WT) built its own tokenization engine, giving it the ability to offer more than a dozen tokenized funds. According to data provider RWA.xyz the value of real-word assets represented on-chain exceeds $28 billion, largely in private credit and Treasuries. Still, regulation remains a headwind. The GENIUS and Clarity Acts address stablecoins, but leave many questions about tokenized funds unresolved. Still, the bank argues, the advantages of tokenization will drive adoption over time despite limited access for U.S. investors today. The case for tokenized equities is weaker because U.S. brokers already offer commission-free stock and exchange-traded fund (ETF) trading after Robinhood’s (HOOD) disruption in 2019, the analysts wrote. That shift pushed firms toward monetizing client cash and order flow, making tokenized versions of these assets less compelling, the bank's analysts said. But tokenized money market funds, powered by smart contracts, could upend those cash sweep economics and open new revenue models. Distribution is still the bottleneck. Platforms offering tokenized funds remain rare, though online brokers like Robinhood, Public and eToro (ETOR) are well positioned given their crypto businesses and younger, self-custody-oriented client bases. Coinbase (COIN) may also emerge as a partner as it expands beyond pure crypto, the report added. Bank of America expects tokenized money market funds to lead adoption thanks to their attractive yields relative to stablecoins, which cannot pay interest under the Genius Act, with private credit and high yield likely to follow.

Title: Broadcom CEO Stands Alongside Steve Jobs In Memorability, Says Analyst As He Hikes Target Price To $415

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. The AI narrative is alive and kicking vigorously. If anyone were still in doubt, the recent pristine earnings print from Broadcom (AVGO) should have laid to rest any lingering consternation on that count. Broadcom, which has gained particular prominence in recent years for designing AI-specific ASICs and accelerators, reported a 22 percent year-over-year increase in revenue for its fiscal Q3 2025 to $15.95 billion, beating the consensus estimate of $15.83 billion. It also beat consensus expectations for EPS by reporting a $1.69 print. So far this year, Broadcom has launched the Tomahawk Ultra networking chip, which is an Ethernet switch chip designed for intra-data-center connectivity, and a next-gen Jericho networking chip, which is a purpose-built Ethernet router for large-scale, distributed AI clusters. Critically, Broadcom's AI semiconductor revenue surged by 63 percent year-over-year to $5.2 billion. And, completing its trifecta of beats, the company raised its guidance for Q4, now projecting total revenue of $17.4 billion and AI semiconductor revenue of $6.2 billion. It is hardly a surprise, therefore, that Melius Research's Ben Reitzes just termed Broadcom's recent earnings call as "the most bullish and memorable call" he can remember, hiking Broadcom's stock price target to $415 per share. Do note that Broadcom's surging AI semiconductor revenues remain at the heart of this nascent bullish shock, delivered with a crispness only someone of Tan's experience could have managed. Elsewhere, we came to know that OpenAI could spend $10 billion on designing an ASIC with Broadcom next year, as per a report by Financial Times. This aligns with a new $10 billion contract that Broadcom's CEO revealed during this week's earnings call. Goldman Sachs commented on this development in the following words: "We believe the most significant development was Broadcom's announcement that it has converted another new custom silicon customer focused on inference, which is expected to help drive "material" upside to management's prior expectation of AI Semiconductor revenue growth of ~60% in 2026."

I'm always shocked when I remember Amazon got started way back in 1994. For more than a quarter century, this company was run by itsthe same founder, Jeff Bezos, who built it into America's second-largest employer. He pursued a dizzying array of products, services, businesses, moonshots, and side projects. Then, in the midst of a global pandemic, he stepped aside and Andy Jassy took over as CEO. Jassy was suddenly responsible for more than 1.5 million employees located all over the globe while COVID-19 spread. And he was taking the reins from a boss who'd stamped his unique approach on almost everything at Amazon. Daunting stuff. It's been over four years since then, and Jassy has finally made Amazon his own. That's according to an exclusive inside look at how this new CEO is changing the world's largest e-commerce and cloud company. Superstar reporter Eugene Kim spent many weeks on this project. If you're an Amazon employee, or you're thinking of working there, this is a must-read. Here are some highlights, but go read the whole thing: Costs Before Culture: When Jassy stepped into the top job in 2021, Amazon was ballooning from pandemic-era growth while suffering massive losses. The new CEO couldn't tackle cultural challenges until he first stabilized Amazon's cost structure. That meant big layoffs, project cuts, and tightening the belt at every level. "Arena" Leadership: Some leaders aren't mincing words. One high-level email obtained by Kim bluntly told managers to "step into the arena" and meet higher standards or leave. It's a tone that underscores a harder-edged, performance-first culture. From Spreading Bets to Big Bets: Jassy is rethinking how Amazon innovates. Unlike Bezos, who encouraged wide bets across hundreds of projects, Jassy is concentrating resources on a smaller number of "big bets" with clearer paths to profitability. The Petty Edge of Frugality: The company's legendary frugality now extends to the fine print. Some employees must track how much of a $50 phone allowance is actually work-related, with reimbursements adjusted accordingly. Owners, not employees: Jassy wants staff to think like owners. Would they spend their own money on this project, or that work trip? He sees Amazon as "the world's biggest startup," with a sharper, leaner culture. That's testing how far today's workforce is willing to go along for the ride. Sign up for BI's Tech Memo newsletter here. Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com. Jump to

Title: Marvell: MRVL Stock To $140?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/05/marvell-mrvl-stock-to-140/
Time Published: 2025-09-05T12:35:58Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) has been one of the tech sectors more puzzling stories this year. Despite delivering record second quarter results and showing signs of building a niche for itself in AI infrastructure, the stock has slumped 43% year-to-date - including a 15% slide in the last week - after management issued a cautious outlook for its data center business. Shares now trade at $64 apiece. The sell-off stems from lumpy orders for Marvell’s custom AI accelerators, but such quarterly volatility is fairly common in this market. Delays in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) next-generation AI chips amid design changes could be pushing back demand for Marvell’s silicon, while Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS which relies on Marvell for its Trainium AI chips has been losing market share to Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. Overall, these issues appear more like timing-related volatility than structural problems. Marvell’s long-term opportunity in AI looks compelling, given not just its custom accelerators, but also its optical connectivity chips. Could this underappreciated AI player be set up for a sharp rebound? We outline a case that could see the stock more than double to almost $140 per share from current levels. Separately, see important current market context – S&P 500 Index To Crash 8%? Marvell's Long Growth Runway In AI Marvell’s push into the AI market began with its high-speed interconnect solutions for data centers. These optical and electrical interconnects are essential for moving the enormous volumes of data generated by AI and machine learning workloads. Since these workloads rely on massive parallel processing and ultra-fast data transfer, they place heavy demands on existing infrastructure, creating a need for the advanced connectivity technologies that Marvell provides. The bigger growth driver has been application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) designed for AI. Unlike general-purpose GPUs, ASICs are customized for the requirements of individual customers such as hyperscalers, delivering better cost efficiency, lower power consumption, and superior performance. This could play to Marvell’s advantage in the long-run. Big tech is in the middle of an unprecedented AI spending spree. Amazon is expected to spend up to $105 billion on capex in 2025, while Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta are forecast to spend as much as $80 billion, $75 billion, and $72 billion respectively, much of it earmarked for AI infrastructure such as GPUs from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). However, investors will eventually begin to prioritize returns on AI investments and companies could become more judicious with spending. Big companies could seek alternatives to Nvidia, and Marvell’s specialized models could be a top choice for hyperscalers. Also see: What’s happening with SMCI stock? There are signs that the most compute-intensive phase of AI training may begin to level off, with the industry’s focus shifting toward inference - the application of trained models to new data in real time and at massive scale. Inference is lighter per task but occurs continuously across millions of users and applications. This transition plays directly into Marvell’s strengths, as it opens the door for specialized, power-efficient solutions beyond the high-end GPUs that dominate training. The market could potentially shift from large-scale general-purpose AI models to smaller, specialized ones, potentially helping more niche players like Marvell who offer tailored products that optimize costs and performance for specific applications. The 2x Math Coming back to the stock's potential, the math works like this. Marvell trades at about 40x trailing earnings and about 23x estimated FY'26 adjusted earnings. This is well below peers such as AMD and Nvidia. AMD trades at about 40x forward earnings, while Nvidia trades at about 38x. This indicates that Marvell’s multiple is not stretched. Revenue Growth: Marvell Technology has seen its top line grow at an average rate of 10.9% over the last 3 years, but this does not capture the big AI surge the company is witnessing. Over the most recent quarter, net revenue came in at a record $2.0 billion, up 58% compared to the same period last year. Marvell revenue stood at about $5.77 billion in FY'25 and the metric is likely to grow by about 41% to $8.14 billion per consensus estimates. Looking ahead, if revenues expand at an average rate of 30% each year over FY'27 and FY'28, driven by AI demand, Marvell's top line could scale to about $13.7 billion by FY'28. Adjusted margins: Coming to margins, Non-GAAP net income was $585.5 million, or $0.67 per diluted share. Adjusted net margins stood at 28% over the first six months of the year. As scale improves and fixed costs are absorbed, margins are expected to gradually move higher. For perspective, Nvidia now posts margins of over 50%. If Marvell’s adjusted net margins rise to about 30%, this would translate into adjusted net income of over $4.1 billion, roughly 3x FY'25 numbers. Earnings multiple: Now if income rises so much, the trailing multiple, which stands at about 40x would fall to a third of its value or about 13x, right? Probably not. As Marvell scales up its business profitably, investors might continue to assign a high multiple of about 30x, about 25% below current levels. This would translate into a market cap of roughly $120 billion, or a little over 2x from current levels. See MRVL Valuation Ratios What about the time horizon for this high-return scenario? In practice, it won’t make much difference whether it takes two years or three - as long as MRVL sustains its revenue expansion trajectory and steadily improves margins, the stock price could respond similarly. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming its benchmark that includes all 3 - S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

September 05, 2025 08:05 ET | Source: 24/7 Market News and VENU 24/7 Market News and VENU DENVER, Sept. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 247marketnews.com, a pioneer in digital media dedicated to the swift distribution of financial market news and corporate information, confirms that VENU (NYSE American: VENU), a trailblazer in premium hospitality and live entertainment, officially broke ground on its $300 million Sunset Amphitheater on June 13, 2025, in McKinney, Texas. According to Founder, Chairman, and CEO J.W. Roth, the Sunset VENU will be “the most luxurious fully seated, multi-configuration, all-season venue in history.” The amphitheater will feature a canopied roof, wind walls, LuxeFire Suites, and a members-only Aikman Club, in collaboration with NFL Hall of Fame quarterback Troy Aikman, Founder of EIGHT Elite Light Beer. Nestled at the center of the amphitheater, the Aikman Club offers one-of-a-kind views, premium seating, and high-end amenities. With a capacity of up to 20,000 guests, more than double the 8,000-seat Ford Amphitheater in Colorado Springs, the Sunset Amphitheater is positioned as a premier destination for live entertainment. Institutional VIP Momentum Institutional investors have been quick to recognize VENU’s value creation. Over the last month: Analyst Support Strengthens the Story Wall Street coverage is building alongside institutional ownership. Cenorium Capital recently reiterated its Strong Buy rating with a $22 price target, while Northland Securities raised its target from $15 to $17, maintaining its Buy rating. Analysts point to VENU’s amphitheater model, accelerating municipal pipeline, and diversified funding approach as key drivers of long-term value. National Recognition & Strategic Partnerships VENU has been recognized nationally by The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, Denver Post, Billboard, VenuesNow, and Variety for its innovative and disruptive approach to live entertainment. Through strategic partnerships with industry leaders, such as AEG Presents, VENU continues to shape the future of the entertainment landscape. Municipalities are also lining up. Economic impact studies from the McKinney Sunset Amphitheater project, which is expected to generate over $3 billion in impact within the first decade, have catalyzed community interest nationwide. “Our municipal pipeline now includes 38 communities engaged in conversations about bringing VENU to their area,” said Roth. “To accelerate these agreements, we’ve partnered with industry leader Ryan, who is tasked with delivering two new municipalities every quarter. On average, each delivered development agreement can add between $150 to $300 million to our balance sheet.” Growth Pipeline & Financial Catalysts “From the day we began our journey, we have been clear on how we intend to fund expansion—through public-private partnerships, FireSuite sales, and sale-leasebacks of underlying land,” added Roth. “The future we’ve been building toward is right in front of us and it’s coming fast. We are on pace to add more than $5 billion in completed project value in the next 36 to 48 months.” Long-Term Vision By 2030, VENU plans to operate 25 amphitheaters and 15 indoor entertainment complexes, totaling 350,000+ seats. That scale translates to over 20 million annual tickets sold and more than $2 billion in gross ticket sales volume, cementing VENU as a leader in next-generation live entertainment.

Title: American Bitcoin, Backed By Trump, Ends Nasdaq Debut Up 17%

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. American Bitcoin, a mining company tied to US President Donald Trump’s sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr., wrapped up its first day of trading on the Nasdaq with sharp swings but still managed to finish 16.75% higher at just over $8. After-hours trading pushed the stock up another 6% to $8.50, reports confirmed. Trading opened with a rush. The newly rebranded company, formed through a merger with Gryphon Digital Mining (GRYP), jumped as high as $13.21 from Gryphon’s previous close of $6.90, a 90% surge. That early momentum collapsed quickly, sending the stock down to $6.70 in the afternoon before it recovered part of the loss. Nasdaq halted trading five times due to extreme volatility. Despite the erratic moves, Bloomberg estimated Eric Trump’s 7.5% stake at roughly $548 million by the end of the session. His fortune is now tied directly to how American Bitcoin performs in the market. According to Eric Trump, the company will not only mine Bitcoin but also buy it when conditions make more sense. He described the approach as switching “to whichever is better at the time.” The company’s existing treasury already holds 2,443 BTC, making it the 25th-largest stash among public companies. With Bitcoin trading above $112,000, that holding is worth about $275 million. Eric Trump emphasized that the business will aim to maximize shareholder value by balancing mining output and market purchases: “We’re going to harness daily mining to the fullest, but we can also go out and purchase Bitcoin to support the treasury,” the presidential son said. The launch has stirred questions about whether American Bitcoin benefits from President Trump’s crypto-friendly stance. Eric Trump dismissed criticism that his family is profiting directly from political ties, saying his father has “nothing to do with this business.” The American Bitcoin debut came just days after another Trump-linked venture. Tokens for World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a separate crypto project involving President Trump and his sons, were listed on exchanges earlier in the week. WLFI’s performance has so far been weak, dropping 30% from its debut price and losing another 7% in the last 24 hours to about 21 cents, based on CoinMarketCap data. A company tied to the Trumps owns nearly a quarter of all WLFI tokens, estimated at $4.6 billion in value. While WLFI struggles to gain traction, American Bitcoin’s opening has given the Trump family another high-profile position in the crypto sector. Whether the stock can maintain its momentum after a chaotic debut remains uncertain, but Eric Trump called the launch “an unbelievable day” and insisted “the floodgates are just starting to open.” Featured image from Meta, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Broadcom (AVGO) is helping ChatGPT maker OpenAI design and make its first-ever AI chip, according to reports. The partnership would help Broadcom challenge Nvidia's (NVDA) dominance as an AI leader. Shares in Broadcom, which last night posted fiscal third-quarter results that topped estimates Thursday on record revenue, are soaring 15% in early trading Friday, lifted by the results and the OpenAI news. Speculation about a big new customer the company disclosed last night without identifying it also helped the stock. The Financial Times, citing "people familiar with the matter," said that OpenAI was the customer that committed to $10 billion in orders Broadcom CEO Hock Tan referred to during last night's conference call. Citi analysts in a note also said they believe OpenAI was that customer. Broadcom and OpenAI didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. OpenAI will initially use the new chip for its own internal purposes, the FT reported, with shipments beginning next year, according to the FT and Bloomberg. OpenAI, which currently uses chips from Nvidia, is following the path of other big tech firms like Meta Platforms (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet’s (GOOGL) in moving to create AI chips in-house. Broadcom's quarterly results are the latest to show sustained demand for AI hardware following earnings from Nvidia (NVDA) last week, and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) last month. The company's shares have gained more than 50% so far this year. UPDATE—This article has been updated with the latest share price information.

Title: AI stock euphoria: Is this another 2000 dot-com bust in the making?

'Making Money' host Charles Payne discusses what's causing the market to pull back. If you were investing in the late 1990s, you’ll remember the euphoria of the dot-com boom. Anything with a ".com" at the end of its name could raise millions in capital and see its stock price double or triple overnight. Investors believed the internet would change everything – which, to be fair, it eventually did. But between 2000 and 2002, that dream turned into a nightmare when the Nasdaq lost nearly 80% of its value, wiping out trillions of dollars in wealth. Today, with artificial intelligence leading headlines and fueling investor enthusiasm, many people are wondering if we are about to experience another dot-com bust? AI feels like the new internet – a transformative technology that promises to upend industries from healthcare to finance to entertainment. ( / iStock) The Parallels to the Late ’90s There are some undeniable similarities between the two periods. Back then, internet companies with little more than a business plan and a website were valued at astronomical levels. Today, AI feels like the new internet – a transformative technology that promises to upend industries from healthcare to finance to entertainment. The narrative is powerful, and capital is rushing in. Recently, Palantir which is a fan favorite stock right now, traded with a PE of 522! TRUMP'S AI PLAN IS A BULWARK AGAINST THE RISING THREAT FROM CHINA Another similarity is market concentration. In 1999, Cisco, Intel, Sun Microsystems and AOL were the poster children of the boom. Fast-forward to today, and the so-called "Magnificent 7" – Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Tesla and Nvidia – make up more than 30% of the entire S&P 500. To put that in perspective, the S&P 500 is supposed to be a diversified index of America’s top companies. But if just a handful of stocks are driving most of the returns, that creates real risks if those companies stumble. The market capitalization of the top 10 S&P 500 stocks is almost 40% of the entire S&P 500 Index. The Differences That Matter While the echoes of the dot-com era are loud, the differences are even louder. UBS managing director and senior portfolio manager Jason Katz weighs in on artificial intelligence in the U.S. markets and cryptocurrencies' performance in the stock market. First, valuations are stretched but not nearly as absurd as 1999. Back then, the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of the S&P 500 was over 25 – an eye-popping figure for the time. Many internet stocks had no earnings at all, making traditional valuation metrics meaningless. WE HAVE TO ACT NOW TO KEEP AI FROM BECOMING A FAR-LEFT TROJAN HORSE Today, the S&P 500’s forward P/E ratio hovers around 21. That’s elevated compared to the long-term average of 15-16, but nowhere near dot-com territory. And crucially, the tech giants dominating today’s index are highly profitable businesses generating enormous cash flow. The only area where we see these dot-com patterns popping up are in AI stocks. Slap the two letters AI next to a stock and it’s a feeding frenzy for investors. Second, the companies leading the charge aren’t speculative startups with unproven business models. Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet are trillion-dollar companies with fortress balance sheets and decades of consistent profitability. Nvidia – the crown jewel of the AI trade – sells real products with extraordinary demand. Unlike Pets.com, Webvan.com and eToys (remember them?), these firms have sustainable revenue streams and durable competitive advantages. Is AI the New Dot-Com? There’s no doubt that AI feels frothy. Just as investors in the late 1990s believed every business would be transformed by the internet, many now believe AI will reshape every corner of the economy. Some of this optimism is justified. Essex Investment Management CO-CEO Nancy Prial reveals the factors that are driving market breadth improvement on 'Making Money.' GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE The internet did change the way we live our lives today. AI has the potential to boost productivity, reduce costs and create entirely new industries. But in the short term, markets almost always overestimate the speed of adoption and AI companies start up so fast that many are bound to fail. That’s where the risk lies: not in whether AI will change the world, but in how quickly investors think it will happen. History tells us that transformative technologies often go through hype cycles. We thought by now, people wouldn’t still be writing checks but still 50% of Americans wrote at least one check over the past 12 months. There will be winners, but there will also be plenty of losers along the way. Why This Isn’t 2000 Despite the hype, I don’t believe we’re headed for a repeat of the dot-com crash. Here’s why: Fitz-Gerald Group Chief Investment Officer Keith Fitz-Gerald argues Tesla is an A.I. stock and explains why Palantir can hit $100 per share by the end of the year on 'Varney & Co.' CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS Will there be volatility? Absolutely. Some AI-driven stocks are priced for perfection and will correct when reality falls short of expectations. But a wholesale collapse of the market like we saw from 2000 to 2002 is unlikely. The better comparison might be the railroad boom of the 1800s. Railroads transformed the economy, and many companies failed along the way. But the infrastructure they created powered America’s growth for more than a century. AI may follow the same path – messy in the early years, but ultimately world-changing.

Title: Tesla proposes Elon Musk pay package that could make him the world’s first trillionaire | CNN Business

Time Published: 2025-09-05T10:47:25Z

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Elon Musk, already the world’s richest person, could become the first trillionaire after the Tesla board unveiled a massive new pay package for its CEO to keep his focus on the troubled EV maker. The package would grant him additional shares of Tesla stock if the company is able to grow far beyond its current value, with a market capitalization far greater than any company has ever approached. Musk’s previous pay package, which added significantly to his massive wealth, also laid out ambitious growth plans that once appeared to be a reach – but which Tesla proved able to reach easily. The new pay package could grant Musk 423.7 million additional shares of Tesla stock. Those shares would be be worth $143.5 billion at today’s stock value. But Musk would get those shares only if the value of Tesla stock increases significantly in coming years. The company stock would need to reach an overall value of $8.5 trillion for Musk to get all the shares, significantly above the current market capitalization of $1.1 trillion Those 423.7 million new shares that Musk would get under this package would be worth close to $1 trillion should the company hit the increased valuation targets spelled out in Friday’s proxy statement. If Tesla shares are able to reach the $8.5 billion market capitalization value, it could become the most valuable company ever. It would be worth roughly double the current market value of Nvidia (NVDA), the current most-valuable company on the market. Tesla is already the most valuable automaker by a large margin, even though legacy automakers, like second-most valuable automaker Toyota, sell far more vehicles and now make more profits. The company’s proxy statement that laid out Musk’s payment plan also included a shareholder proposal that Tesla take a stake in privately-held xAI, the artificial intelligence company that Musk also owns. That could help Elon Musk further consolidate his growing business empire. XAI recently purchased X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, which Musk bought for $44 billion of his own money in 2022. The company did not take a position for or against that shareholder proposal, which does not give any details of how large a stake Tesla should take in xAI, and what price. But any such investment could further enrich Tesla since Musk is the primary owner of xAI. Musk currently owns 410 million shares of Tesla shares, worth $139 billion at Thursday’s closing price. That stake, along with his stakes in xAI, rocket company SpaceX, and several other companies he has started and runs, have made him the richest person on the planet, worth $378 billion according to Bloomberg’s billionaire tracker. He currently has options to buy an additional 304 million shares of Tesla, but a judge in Delaware has twice struck down that 2018 pay package that granted him those options as illegal. Those rulings came despite overwhelming approval by Tesla shareholders – twice. The company again has tried to grant those options to Musk this year, and adding in those options, he now owns 18% of the company’s shares. Tesla shares nearly doubled in value to a record-high price for its shares between election day and mid-December 2024, as investors bet that his close ties to President Donald Trump would be a boon for Tesla. But as Tesla faced protests and dropping sales and falling profits in backlash to those ties (before he had a falling out with Trump), all those things resulted in Telsa’s stock losing those gains. The shares have recovered some of those losses, but they are still down 26% from the December peak. Still, Musk and his fans on Wall Street have insisted the company is well positioned to grow even larger and more successful in the future. He has continued to predict that his plans for self-driving cars – including a robotaxi service – will create massive profits and value for shareholders. The robotaxis would provide rides to passengers andalso allow Tesla owners to rent out their cars for driverless rides when not in use. Musk has also promised a line of humanoid robots that could bring in even more sales than Tesla’s car business. “It’s a big pay package but Tesla needs to keep its biggest asset in Musk as CEO,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives told CNN Friday. Ives is one of the bigger Tesla bulls on Wall Street. “In this AI era Musk now will drive its next leg of growth,” Ives added. “The Board had a $1 trillion dollar decision and made the right one.” The board’s proxy statement spoke of the importance of keeping Musk focused on Tesla going forward. In addition to his many business interests, he remains active in politics, despite his falling out with President Trump. He has announced plans to form a third political party. Tesla, in its proxy statement, warned that it needed to incentivize Musk to focus his attention on growing the company. It said that during the negotiations on the pay package, “Musk also raised the possibility that he may pursue other interests that may afford him greater influence if he did not receive such assurances.” The board said it “believes that Mr. Musk singularly possesses the leadership characteristics necessary to transform Tesla and realize its long-term mission at an unparalleled level.” But the company said it is also making plans for life after Elon Musk, saying it is already working on succession plans. And it said that one of the terms of the employment package that Musk must meet to receive the final 70 million shares of stock is that he needs to have “developed a framework for Chief Executive Officer succession.” “The board regularly discusses management succession planning and leadership development,” said the proxy statement. It said those succession plans are “for both sudden, unanticipated events, in addition to longer-term planned succession for its executives.” It said it “believes that management has developed a robust pipeline of seasoned leadership talent within Tesla,” and that is also looking at possible external talent. Musk does not receive a cash salary from Tesla. All of his compensation comes from Tesla shares and options he has been granted in the past. Since there is still an ongoing court fight over the 304 million options, Musk has not received any compensation for nearly a decade, since a 2012 pay package made its last disbursement of options to him in 2017. But not all tech billionaires receive additional stock options or grants as compensation, instead benefiting from the increased valuations of their existing stakes in their companies. That includes Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, who co-founded Facebook. Both took large stakes in their companies as founders, but neither has received stock grants or options since those companies had initial public offerings in 1997 and 2012, respectively. Musk is on record saying it’s important that he needs to control at least 25% of Tesla shares. “I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can’t be overturned,” Musk wrote in a post on X. “Unless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.” That need for control is what’s behind this pay package, said Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki, an investment firm and one of the early investors in Tesla. “This is all about Musk being scared about being kicked out of Tesla because he only owns 13%,” said Gerber, who has sold almost his entire stake in Tesla. Gerber said he also has problems with the size of the proposed pay package. “If he hits them (the financial and market share targets) then in some ways it (the pay package) is warranted,” Gerber said. “But I think it goes back to what level of greed can you reach in a modern society that’s enough.” If Musk and his fans are right, Musk would become far wealthier even without any additional shares of Tesla stock. His current holdings of 410 million Tesla shares, even without the disputed 304 million options, would be worth nearly $1 trillion more than today’s valuation, should Tesla’s market cap rise to $8.5 billion. But Musk won’t get any of the shares of stock until the company raises its market cap to $2 trillion, or nearly twice as valuable as it is today. And he would have to meet at least one of a number of ambitious operational and financial goals, such as having a million robots in operation or getting its adjusted operating income up to $50 billion, which would be well above the record $19.2 billion it earned on that basis in 2022, let alone the $16.6 billion it made last year. But to achieve those targets, it would have to start doing the things Musk is promising in terms of self-driving vehicles and its robotaxi. And that would mean meeting grand claims from a man and company that have often fallen short of their promises. Tesla critics say that the stock has become grossly overvalued because of Wall Street’s willingness to buy into Musk’s vision of the future in terms of AI, self-driving vehicles and robots, despite its failures to deliver on past promises along those lines. “Elon Musk has been saying since 2014 ‘we will have a fully autonomous car next year.’ It hasn’t happened, but that promise has been valued in the billions by Wall Street,” said analyst Gordon Johnson, one of the harsher critics of Tesla. “Elon Musk is a master manipulator. He’s been able to keep the stock elevated. The reason the board is paying him is he’s willing to say things that other CEOs aren’t willing to say or get away with.” And some critics, such as Gerber, say another problem with the package is that it will lead Musk and Tesla to pursue and promise the kind of goals that will lift its stock price, more than it will get him to focus on fixing the problems facing its EV business. Tesla is facing growing competition from Chinese EV makers. BYD, one of those Chinese automakers, is poised to pass Tesla for the most EV sales worldwide, even though it is not available for sale in the United States. US law also recently removed the billions of dollars in penalties that traditional automakers have had to pay if their gas-powered vehicles exceed emissions rules. The way that they avoided those payments in the past was by buying regulatory credits from an EV maker like Tesla. But the payments that brought billions in revenue to Tesla will now vanish. Johnson said that Tesla’s stock price is unlikely to hit the ambitious targets laid out in this Musk pay package due to the problems it faces. “Things are going to get worse for them, not better,” said Johnson. “Is Tesla going to go to $8 trillion? Abso-f**king-lutely not.” Shares of Tesla (TSLA) were up about 5% in early trading on the news. This story has been updated with additional context and reporting.

Title: Broadcom: AVGO Stock’s Path To $600
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/05/broadcom-avgo-stocks-path-to-600/
Time Published: 2025-09-05T10:26:13Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Broadcom's stock (NASDAQ: AVGO) is climbing, buoyed by impressive quarterly earnings and a new customer win for its custom AI chips. Adding to the optimism, the company expects revenue growth to speed up next year. It's no surprise, then, that the stock has more than doubled in the past twelve months. But what could fuel another 100% gain to levels past $600 from here? We’ll explore the key factors that could push the stock to new heights in the analysis that follows. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – S&P 500 Index To Crash 8%? Broadcom’s growth is anchored by its custom AI chip partnerships with top hyperscalers, namely Google (for its TPU) and Meta. In a significant development on September 4, 2025, the company announced it has secured a fourth major, unnamed customer for its custom AI accelerators (XPUs), reportedly worth $10 billion. This diversifies its revenue and solidifies its role as a key enabler for large-scale AI infrastructure. While the initial AI boom focused on training, the market is now shifting to inference, where Broadcom holds a strategic advantage. As AI applications are deployed at scale, the demand for high-performance, power-efficient inference chips and networking skyrockets. Broadcom's expertise in specialized networking and processing is critical for these workloads, positioning it to capture this massive market segment. Broadcom maintains its competitive edge through relentless product innovation. It is now shipping its Tomahawk 6 and Tomahawk Ultra networking chips, which significantly outperform their predecessor and are essential for building out large AI clusters. Furthermore, its leadership in co-packaged silicon photonics is a key technology for next-generation data centers, enabling the faster, more efficient data transfer required for advanced AI. Notably, the Tomahawk Ultra can connect up to 1,024 accelerators in a single rack, significantly more than NVIDIA’s NVLink Switch, which only supports up to 72 GPUs. Beyond hardware, the acquisition of VMware has transformed Broadcom into a major infrastructure software company. Broadcom is successfully transitioning VMware customers to subscription models and streamlining the portfolio. This strategy is already boosting recurring revenue and is expected to generate substantial, stable cash flow, significantly improving the company’s overall profit margins. For perspective, VMware, which is part of Broadcom’s infrastructure software segment, saw its revenue surge 43% y-o-y to $6.8 billion in Q3 fiscal 2025 (fiscal period ends in October). For Broadcom's stock to double in value, it relies on a powerful combination of substantial earnings growth and a sustained, premium valuation from investors. The pathway is built on two core pillars: The foundation for growth is a strong top-line forecast. We project Broadcom’s revenue could grow from around $60 billion in the last twelve months to more than $105 billion by 2028, driven primarily by its AI and VMware segments. However, the key is Broadcom's exceptional profitability. With adjusted net income margins around 50%, revenue growth has a magnified impact on the bottom line. This means earnings are positioned to grow significantly faster than sales. For example, if revenue increases by 75% over the next few years, the company's adjusted earnings per share (EPS) could nearly double from around $6.29 now to $12 in 2028. Earnings growth alone isn't enough; the stock must also maintain its high valuation multiple. Broadcom has been trading at a premium valuation of over 50 times trailing adjusted earnings for several reasons: If investors continue to assign a premium multiple of around 50x to the stock, an EPS of $12 would support a stock price of around $600. Furthermore, the multiple could expand even further if Broadcom demonstrates sustained AI revenue growth above 40%, captures more market share, and secures new large-scale customers. Despite the strong growth outlook, several risks could impact Broadcom's performance and valuation. Broadcom's AI revenue is highly dependent on a small number of hyperscale customers. While profitable, this concentration creates a significant risk; a change in spending plans or a strategic shift from even one major customer could disproportionately impact Broadcom's revenue. Any broader slowdown in the rapid pace of AI infrastructure investment would also directly threaten the company's primary growth engine. The market for AI chips and networking solutions is intensely competitive. Broadcom faces pressure from established rivals like Marvell and NVIDIA, as well as the risk of its own hyperscale customers developing more of their in-house silicon solutions. This competition could compress the high profit margins that currently justify Broadcom's premium valuation. Broadcom's stock has historically shown higher volatility during broad market downturns compared to the S&P 500. It experienced steeper declines during both the COVID-19 correction and the 2022 inflation shock. This indicates a heightened sensitivity to macroeconomic uncertainty, and a future economic slowdown or market disruption could lead to a significant drop in its stock price. Over the next few years, Broadcom's stock could double to over $600. The path to this 2x return is straightforward: the company must achieve the forecasted revenue and earnings growth while convincing the market that its premium valuation is sustainable. However, investors considering this opportunity should also weigh the risks. The stock has experienced drops of up to 50% in the past, and they must be prepared for similar volatility. Despite this, for those with an investment horizon of three years or more, Broadcom's stock has a strong potential to double from its current level. See, there always remains a meaningful risk when investing in a single, or just a handful of stocks. Consider the 30-stock Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Separately, see – S&P 500 Index To Crash 8%? Broadcom’s growth is anchored by its custom AI chip partnerships with top hyperscalers, namely Google (for its TPU) and Meta. In a significant development on September 4, 2025, the company announced it has secured a fourth major, unnamed customer for its custom AI accelerators (XPUs), reportedly worth $10 billion. This diversifies its revenue and solidifies its role as a key enabler for large-scale AI infrastructure. While the initial AI boom focused on training, the market is now shifting to inference, where Broadcom holds a strategic advantage. As AI applications are deployed at scale, the demand for high-performance, power-efficient inference chips and networking skyrockets. Broadcom's expertise in specialized networking and processing is critical for these workloads, positioning it to capture this massive market segment. Broadcom maintains its competitive edge through relentless product innovation. It is now shipping its Tomahawk 6 and Tomahawk Ultra networking chips, which significantly outperform their predecessor and are essential for building out large AI clusters. Furthermore, its leadership in co-packaged silicon photonics is a key technology for next-generation data centers, enabling the faster, more efficient data transfer required for advanced AI. Notably, the Tomahawk Ultra can connect up to 1,024 accelerators in a single rack, significantly more than NVIDIA’s NVLink Switch, which only supports up to 72 GPUs. Beyond hardware, the acquisition of VMware has transformed Broadcom into a major infrastructure software company. Broadcom is successfully transitioning VMware customers to subscription models and streamlining the portfolio. This strategy is already boosting recurring revenue and is expected to generate substantial, stable cash flow, significantly improving the company’s overall profit margins. For perspective, VMware, which is part of Broadcom’s infrastructure software segment, saw its revenue surge 43% y-o-y to $6.8 billion in Q3 fiscal 2025 (fiscal period ends in October). For Broadcom's stock to double in value, it relies on a powerful combination of substantial earnings growth and a sustained, premium valuation from investors. The pathway is built on two core pillars: The foundation for growth is a strong top-line forecast. We project Broadcom’s revenue could grow from around $60 billion in the last twelve months to more than $105 billion by 2028, driven primarily by its AI and VMware segments. However, the key is Broadcom's exceptional profitability. With adjusted net income margins around 50%, revenue growth has a magnified impact on the bottom line. This means earnings are positioned to grow significantly faster than sales. For example, if revenue increases by 75% over the next few years, the company's adjusted earnings per share (EPS) could nearly double from around $6.29 now to $12 in 2028. Earnings growth alone isn't enough; the stock must also maintain its high valuation multiple. Broadcom has been trading at a premium valuation of over 50 times trailing adjusted earnings for several reasons: If investors continue to assign a premium multiple of around 50x to the stock, an EPS of $12 would support a stock price of around $600. Furthermore, the multiple could expand even further if Broadcom demonstrates sustained AI revenue growth above 40%, captures more market share, and secures new large-scale customers. Despite the strong growth outlook, several risks could impact Broadcom's performance and valuation. Broadcom's AI revenue is highly dependent on a small number of hyperscale customers. While profitable, this concentration creates a significant risk; a change in spending plans or a strategic shift from even one major customer could disproportionately impact Broadcom's revenue. Any broader slowdown in the rapid pace of AI infrastructure investment would also directly threaten the company's primary growth engine. The market for AI chips and networking solutions is intensely competitive. Broadcom faces pressure from established rivals like Marvell and NVIDIA, as well as the risk of its own hyperscale customers developing more of their in-house silicon solutions. This competition could compress the high profit margins that currently justify Broadcom's premium valuation. Broadcom's stock has historically shown higher volatility during broad market downturns compared to the S&P 500. It experienced steeper declines during both the COVID-19 correction and the 2022 inflation shock. This indicates a heightened sensitivity to macroeconomic uncertainty, and a future economic slowdown or market disruption could lead to a significant drop in its stock price. Over the next few years, Broadcom's stock could double to over $600. The path to this 2x return is straightforward: the company must achieve the forecasted revenue and earnings growth while convincing the market that its premium valuation is sustainable. However, investors considering this opportunity should also weigh the risks. The stock has experienced drops of up to 50% in the past, and they must be prepared for similar volatility. Despite this, for those with an investment horizon of three years or more, Broadcom's stock has a strong potential to double from its current level. See, there always remains a meaningful risk when investing in a single, or just a handful of stocks. Consider the 30-stock Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Broadcom's stock (NASDAQ: AVGO) is climbing, buoyed by impressive quarterly earnings and a new customer win for its custom AI chips. Adding to the optimism, the company expects revenue growth to speed up next year. It's no surprise, then, that the stock has more than doubled in the past twelve months. But what could fuel another 100% gain to levels past $600 from here? We’ll explore the key factors that could push the stock to new heights in the analysis that follows. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio.

Title: Nvidia Stock To Fall 50% As AI Cycle Turns?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/05/nvidia-stock-to-fall-50-as-ai-cycle-turns/
Time Published: 2025-09-05T09:00:00Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has indisputably led the AI boom. Its GPUs are considered the gold standard for training extensive AI models, resulting in sales growth from $27 billion in FY'23 to an anticipated $200 billion this fiscal year. In addition to selling the highest performance chips, the company's CUDA software ecosystem has effectively retained customers. While Nvidia is expected to continue its reign as the leader in AI hardware for years ahead, its stock valuation of nearly 40x forward earnings signifies not only its leadership but also expectations of ongoing, multi-year growth. This renders it vulnerable: even a slight decrease in demand or a structural shift in the AI lifecycle – from focusing on training workloads to inference – could undermine investor confidence and cause significant declines. Historical events highlight this risk – following the Covid-era surge in GPU demand for gaming and cryptocurrency, inflation and reduced demand led Nvidia shares to plummet almost 66% from peak to trough, in contrast to a mere 25% decline for the S&P 500. This is important with current market context – see S&P 500 Index To Crash 8%?. Nvidia’s volatility suggests a similar drop could occur if the current AI growth phase slows. Of course, if you are looking for an upside with reduced volatility compared to holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio (HQ). It has consistently outperformed its benchmark that includes all 3: S&P 500, Russell, and S&P Mid-Cap indexes—and has achieved returns surpassing 91% since its inception, as evident in HQ performance metrics. Over the past two years, companies have invested vast resources into developing AI models. Training these enormous models usually requires a concentrated effort that demands significant computing power, with Nvidia being the largest beneficiary, as its GPUs are widely seen as the fastest and most efficient for these operations. However, the AI landscape may be evolving. Incremental performance improvements are waning as models become larger, while access to high-quality training data is becoming a limiting factor – much of what is readily available online has already been utilized in current models. Collectively, these factors imply that the most demanding phase of AI training might start to plateau. Adding to the uncertainty, the economics of the GPU market remains challenging, as numerous Nvidia customers continue to struggle to yield significant returns on their substantial AI investments. Despite that, Nvidia stock has been strong - see NVDA Dip Buyer Analyses to examine how the stock has bounced back from sharp dips in the past. In contrast, inference involves applying trained models to new data in real-time and at scale. It is less intensive per task but occurs continually across millions of users and applications. As AI evolves, a larger portion of value creation could shift from training to inference. The challenge for Nvidia is that its growth has been primarily linked to training, where its high-end GPUs have a stronghold. Inference presents an opportunity for more mid-performance and cost-effective chip alternatives, as well as specialized offerings. Here’s a glimpse at some of the main competitors in the inference sector. AMD has notably trailed Nvidia during the initial phase of AI development, but it could become a significant competitor to Nvidia in inference. Its chips are becoming increasingly competitive in performance while providing cost and memory advantages. Not all organizations require or can afford Nvidia’s premier GPUs. Many are likely to choose older Nvidia models or budget-friendly alternatives such as AMD’s (NASDAQ:AMD) MI series, which delivers solid performance for inference and fine-tuning of models. See How AMD stock surges to $330. ASICs or Application-Specific Integrated Circuits are also gaining momentum. Unlike GPUs, which are flexible and programmable, ASICs are designed for a specific task, making them more cost- and power-efficient for inference workloads. The cryptocurrency sector offers a precedent: Bitcoin mining began with GPUs but swiftly transitioned to ASICs once scale and efficiency became vital. A similar trend could emerge in AI inference. Two companies likely to benefit from this shift are Marvell and Broadcom, both of which possess expertise in creating custom silicon for hyperscalers. U.S. Big Tech players such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet, and Meta are all designing AI chips. Amazon has focused on training-oriented chips, Meta began with inference and is expanding into training, while Google accommodates both with its TPU (tensor processing unit) lineup. For these hyperscalers, the goal is not necessarily to outdo Nvidia in the marketplace but to reduce costs, enhance bargaining power, and manage supply for their expansive cloud ecosystems. Over time, this translates to diminished incremental demand for Nvidia’s GPUs. In Q2, Nvidia reported that just two of its clients accounted for approximately 39% of total revenue, and it is highly plausible that these were major U.S. tech firms. This concentration makes Nvidia significantly more susceptible. If hyperscalers increasingly turn to proprietary silicon, even minor changes in purchasing behavior could lead to substantial revenue implications. Chinese Players In China, firms like Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), Baidu, and Huawei are enhancing their AI chip initiatives. Reports last week indicated that Alibaba plans to introduce a new inference chip for its cloud division. The strategy is twofold: to facilitate inference at scale using its own technology stack, and to ensure a reliable supply of semiconductors in light of U.S. export restrictions. Currently, Nvidia’s GPUs are still anticipated to serve as the backbone of Alibaba’s AI training operations, but inference is poised to become the long-term growth driver for the firm. Nvidia’s position is still robust due to its established ecosystem, substantial R&D investments, and supremacy in training. However, inference is expected to become the next growth engine for AI hardware, and the competitive landscape is significantly more crowded. Even a slight dip in growth could heavily impact the stock, considering how much future performance is already factored in. For investors, the critical question is whether Nvidia’s growth trajectory can align with the elevated expectations set by the market. If the economics of inference prove less advantageous than those of training, the stock could still face a “valuation reset” despite retaining its technological leadership. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which comprises 30 stocks, has a history of consistently outperforming its benchmark, inclusive of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. What accounts for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; a smoother ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Letters: We should always respect the great presidents of our country through the years

Full Content:
President Éamon de Valera with John F Kennedy during the US president's Irish visit in June 1963. The campaign to elect the president of Ireland is not fully up and running. While we wait, I like to look back at presidents and visitors to Áras an Uachtaráin such as General Montgomery of World War II fame, who was keen to meet President Éamon de Valera as he greatly admired him. De Valera was elected to two terms as president – in 1959 and in 1966, at the age of 83. He was involved in Irish history’s big moments – from the 1916 Rising, the War of Independence and the Civil War. He was Taoiseach during World War II and attended the funerals of President John F Kennedy in 1963 as well as those of civilians shot dead on Bloody Sunday in 1972. As well as Montgomery, other visitors to the Áras included Kennedy, Richard Nixon and Princess Grace of Monaco. Nearly a quarter of a million people lined his funeral route in September 1975. Erskine Childers was elected in 1973, but died of a heart attack in 1974. A minister in various Fianna Fáil governments, his father took part in the War of Independence and was executed in the Civil War. Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh was a judge at the European Court of Justice. He believed that the office of president was publicly disrespected in 1976 by the coalition government when he had legal concerns about a security bill it wanted him to sign into law. He referred it to the Supreme Court to check its constitutionality before signing it into law. He resigned as a protest on the lack of respect for the presidency. Mary Robinson was our first female president to be elected, in 1990, and is still in public life. She visited Egypt’s border with Gaza last month to hear of problems in getting food aid into war-torn Gaza. President Michael D Higgins also speaks strongly on human rights. He has criticised the EU for not responding adequately to the Gaza crisis. He may be remembered as our foremost humanitarian president. Mary Sullivan, College Road, Cork Having read Oliver Callan’s article on the presidency (‘Gentleman Jim will treat his rivals fairly in most bloodless presidential race ever’, Irish Independent, September 4), I wish to say that although I am an ardent GAA fan, I know little of the character of Mr Gavin, even if he did oversee the greatest ever Dublin team. Mr Callan could be right, but I do not believe there is any such thing in politic as a bloodless battle. He is confident that Mr Gavin only has to turn up, and that it will be akin to Dublin playing Carlow, in terms of results. If it was that simple, politics would not be the art of the possible. The dutiful Fianna Fáil backbenchers lined up on the plinth of Leinster House on Wednesday like altar boys. But it’s not over yet. Mr Callan is overlooking the fact the nature of the campaign is brutal for all: any ­possible flaw is hunted for and pounced upon. This contest could turn into a clash more like the epic Meath v Dublin sagas of old. Thomas Garvey, Claremorris, Co Mayo The presidential campaign reminds me of the The Traitors Ireland TV show. Allow me to explain. Catherine Connolly was first out of the traps with great enthusiasm. She is like David. From Wednesday’s Irish Independent, he was “breakdancing in the sitting room, jumping over the back of the sofas”. Sadly for him, he was given the bum’s rush early on. Jim Gavin says little. He is like Paudie, who is playing a similar game. So far he has attracted little negative attention and is predicted to go far. Heather Humphreys is like Eamon, the garda who is not a garda. He is too cool for school, but already he is attracting suspicion. He burned brightly at the start, but his flame is now dimming. Billy Kelleher, with an impressive political CV, is like Niall the Gaeilgeoir teacher who saved the day because of his “líofacht sa Ghaeilge”, only to be dispatched for exactly the same reasons. Who will ultimately be crowned president of Ireland and scoop the top prize of €250,000? You decide in a public vote on October 24. Tommy Roddy, Ballybane, Co Galway Israel is conducting genocide in Gaza before the eyes of the world. The UN has formally declared that there is a famine in the area. The response from the US and its president, who once claimed that he could end this shameful tragedy overnight, is nothing more than grandstanding and play-acting. The murderous situation in Gaza could be ended by the US and Western democracies working together to this end. They should do so before Gaza becomes another indelible stain on the conscience of humanity. J Anthony Gaughan, Blackrock, Co Dublin Thank you Raymond Deane for your comment (Irish Independent, Letters, September 4). I did vote for Brexit, and believe Britain has “shared values” with Europe, especially Ireland. For the record, I do not support the UK selling arms to Israel so viciously used against innocent Palestinian people by the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, who stands indicted for crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court. Hopefully, in the near future, an independent Palestine can take its rightful place on the world stage alongside a reunited Ireland. Dominic Shelmerdine, London The ongoing strike by school secretaries and caretakers exposes a serious injustice in our education system. These vital workers are still denied basic entitlements – pensions, fair sick leave and bereavement leave. It’s unacceptable. Schools depend on these people every day. Secretaries manage medical needs, maintain records and act as first responders in emergencies. Caretakers handle fire safety, hygiene and building security. Without them, schools cannot operate safely, or at all. To deny these workers fair conditions is not only unfair: it puts children’s health and safety at risk. As a retired teacher, I know schools are held together by the work of these professionals. I urge fellow educators to support them on the picket lines and demand the Government resolve this dispute with justice and respect.

Title: From fish and chips to baba ganoush: Corinna Hardgrave’s favourite takeaways around Ireland

It’s hard to believe I’ve been writing this takeaway column for more than three years – the extra kilos prove it. This is my final article on takeaways, and instead of a top 10 – I’ve too many favourites – here are the places that stood out. Eunice Power opened AndChips on the Quays in Dungarvan, Co Waterford, in 2019, serving only wild Irish fish, a model for how fish and chips should be done. Also excellent is Fish on MacCurtain Street, Cork, where the fritto misto and cod and chips are the things to order. The Little Saltee in Kilmore Quay, Co Wexford is top notch. For seafood, there’s Julia’s Lobster Truck in Ennistymon, Co Clare, with scampi po’ boy, and lobster and chips; and in Letterfrack, Co Galway, Snappy Snappy is the spot for crab rolls. Grá Pizza in the North Kildare Sports Club in Maynooth does great pies such as The Flann O’Brien with Ballymakenny potatoes and cheese. In Dublin, Doom Slice’s Detroit-style is finished with a cheesy frico crust; Mani on Drury Street is famous for its carbonara slice; and Bambino on Stephen Street Lower serves classic New York-style slices. In Galway, the Dough Bros use The Wooded Pig’s pepperoni on the Pepp Guardi-Jala – a classic. Chiya on Dawson Street in Dublin 2 serves Berlin-style kebabs grilled on vertical rotisserie spits. Passion4Food on Clanbrassil Street Lower has the same sight: chicken and lamb doner kebabs on the vertical grill. At D’Grill on Aungier Street, Dublin 2, the mantos (steamed dumplings) are filled with lightly spiced minced beef and onions. Yalla in Dundrum goes beyond shawarma with standout baba ganoush and kibbeh bil laban. Umi Falafel now has branches in Dublin, Cork and Belfast offering notably good value for their falafel wraps. Dash Burger on Kevin Street Lower in Dublin 8 does first-rate smash burgers, while The Burger Cartel in Herbert Park, Dublin 4 (and other markets) does grilled burgers. Mad Egg on Charlotte Way, Dublin 2, fries free-range chicken to order. In Walkinstown and Tallaght, Ian Ussher makes a good Korean fried chicken at Cluck. In Letterkenny, Co Donegal, The Dirty Souls do Texas-style brisket. At Sumi’s Kitchen at Ryan’s pub in Beggar’s Bush, Dublin 4, the tawa pulao – spiced rice with vegetables – is a hit. Al Khair at the mosque on the South Circular Road turns out really good lamb nihari. Tadka House in Rathmines, Dublin 6 and Blanchardstown kicks up the heat with its Jaipuri laal maas, lamb in a sauce of Mathania chillies. You’ll find seekh kebab kathi roll at Joginder Singh’s Spice Village in Terenure, Dublin 6W, and Rialto, Dublin 8; Spice Cottage in Sallynoggin delivers rich north Indian dishes like lamb kohlapuri; and The Little Yeti in Loughlinstown does Nepalese steamed dumplings. Hyderabadi Kitchen on Camden Street, Dublin 2, specialises in dosas, and in Cork, Spice Genie pops up at Midleton Market, Co Cork, with masala dosa. The Pie Guys pop up at The Black Market in Dornan’s Yard and Cork’s English Market. Pies, such as Beef and Beamish, come with buttery mash. Argentinian chef Victor Franca grills on a custom-built parilla at Nua Asador in Cork’s Marina Market. For Dublin’s work crowd, Tiller and Grain – run by Ottolenghi alum Clair Dowling – is the place for salads, as are Jack and Theo Kirwan’s Sprout branches, using produce from their Kildare farm. For sandwiches, there’s Green Bench on Montague Street, Dublin 2 (try the hoisin pork or veggie hot pot), Little Geno’s on St Stephen’s Green, Dublin 2 (classic Reuben), and Carved in Grand Canal Dock and Ballsbridge, Dublin 4 (porchetta with fennel). On Parnell Street, Dublin 1, Pho Kim’s rice paper spring rolls make a fresh, aromatic lunch. For rotisserie free-range chicken, head to Poulet Bonne Femme in Dún Laoghaire, Blackrock and Avoca. And in Kenmare, Co Kerry, Bean & Batch delivers top-class sandwiches, sausage rolls and apple tart. Some takeaways are “heavy hitters” – spin-offs from big-name restaurants. At Kevin Hui’s China Sichuan to Go in Sandyford, Dublin 18, the star is aromatic duck with cucumber, spring onion, plum sauce and pancakes. At Sunil Ghai’s Street in Dublin 14, the Punjabi black dal – lentils slow-cooked for 36 hours – is legendary, while Asheesh Dewan’s Jaipur in Dalkey serves the best takeaway biryani. At Una in Ranelagh, Dublin 6, queues form for sourdough from John Wyer of Forest Avenue; alongside focaccia, quiche and pastries. Some cuisines were entirely new, like Australian chef Mark Senn’s Mushroom Butcher in Portobello, Dublin 8. He runs a weekend truck with his partner, growing mushrooms next door and changing the menu every two weeks, with highlights including mushroom acarajé. Mama Shee, once at Merrion Square market in Dublin 2, now runs a Nigerian/west African canteen in Tallaght – the goat curry is essential; and Georgian Delight in the Moore Street Arcade, Dublin 1, introduced me to acharuli khachapuri, bread filled with molten cheese and a soft egg yolk. Three years, too many kilogrammes and countless plastic containers later, what stays with me is the proof that independent operators can be as inventive and committed to quality produce as any top dining room. It has been a joy eating through it – now the only thing left is to put down the delivery bag and get on the treadmill. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Original Coupon Deal Yes. If you like this - go for it. IMHO one of several 'Big House' champagnes that I actively avoid. This trades on the reputation of their very superior vintage wines - but is much debased. Good for ship launches. Not so good for drinking (for enjoyment). My 2 cents worth… Is these brands betters? Louis Roederer Champagne Cristal Rose Vinotheque 2002 Well, Louis Roederer is the 'brand'. And yes it is better. AND you don't need to buy anything outrageously expensive (like Cristal). But if you're opening… :-) roederer NV is $90-$100, double the price of the moet in this deal. think moët just gets a bad wrap because they seem to make it in such large volumes and it’s readily available and affordable so makes champagne less of a prestige product, but some companies have access to the fruit and manage to turn out good product per $, dr loosen makes great riesling in volumes, guigal makes great rhone in volume, some companies have the resources and the process. Now you gotta give us your list! I found Cazanove vintage (2007, and '17 more recently) a great value buy when LL specials overlapped with good cashback rates. Hit ~$35 / bottle a few times per year but much rarer to see those prices now, usually $70+. Dangerous! What happens if people go out and buy what I like? Prices will rise and I'll cry/cry more! agree, usually buy as gift/congrats as it looks good. not bad drop just better imo. I don’t disagree, but it’s good to have some for people that think “champagne” is automatically better than sparkling wine, and also turn their nose up at names they don’t know. I’m not whipping out a twice as expensive bottle of Billecart Salmon for them. If you can find from Tassie - Lost Farm Cuvée Vintage 2017- ~39 per bottle. As someone who has provided many a Bolly discount here, I want to say that the Tassie drops are just as good, and offer an amazing value. Arras, Jansz, Taltarni are all fab. I also found the Gratien & Myer cremant at Dan's unbeatable at $17 but its out of stock… Would love to hear other tips!! champagne wise i like charles or n from dans, often at $50 mark, if just something with take-away, jacob’s creek trilogy at $12 - $14 as it has all 3 grape varieties, not many other australian sparkling have pinot meunier in them, also jacob’s creek reserve, it’s pinot chardonnay but bottle fermented if you only have $12-$14 , up market sparkling like the tassie mumm it’s my $35 fav along with pirrie but the mumm is often out of stock, champagne go to, like bollinger and roederer , but even on special it’s it’s a 2 bottle a year treat now. FYI $272.15 for a 6-bottles of Moet & Chandon Brut NV Champagne at Dan Murphys using the SEPT10 coupon combined with the instant Dan Murphys 5% egift cards from places like RACQ. So ~$45 per bottle. Mega, thank you ❤️ Or just buy one bottle for $49 after using the $10 discount https://www.ozbargain.com.au/node/922583 Code not working for me anymore, getting an error message on payment saying that it’s expired. $171.20 for 2 Moet and 4 Chandon (2 for $50), 10% off then $25 both auto-applied at checkout, bubbles sorted, thanks OP :) Other recommendations also appreciated but no ex-First Choice anywhere convenient and Dan with stocks quite a hike :( All trademarks are owned by their respective owners.OzBargain is an independent community website which has no association with nor endorsement by the respective trademark owners.

September 04, 2025 16:40 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. Litigation Attorneys Encourage Investors Who Suffered Losses IRobot (IRBT) To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you purchased or acquired securities in IRobot between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Bragar Eagel & Squire partner Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore directly at (212) 355-4648 NEW YORK, Sept. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against iRobot Corporation (“iRobot” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:IRBT) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot securities between January 29, 2024 and March 11, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors have until September 5, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Click here to participate in the action. The complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) iRobot overstated the extent to which the Restructuring Plan would help the Company maintain stability after the termination of the Amazon Acquisition; (ii) as a result, it was unlikely that iRobot would be able to profitably operate as a standalone company; (iii) accordingly, there was substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern; and (iv) as a result, Defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On March 12, 2025, iRobot issued a press release reporting its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. For the quarter, iRobot reported a loss of $2.06 per share on revenue of $172 million, representing a 44% year-over-year decline. iRobot also cautioned investors that "there can be no assurance that [iRobot's] new product launches will be successful due to potential factors, including, but not limited to consumer demand, competition, macroeconomic conditions, and tariff policies." Accordingly, "given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements." In addition, the press release stated that, in light of the foregoing developments, iRobot was cancelling its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results conference call and webcast, and that the Company would not be providing a 2025 outlook. Market analysts were quick to comment on iRobot's announcement. For example, on March 12, 2025, an analyst from Seeking Alpha downgraded iRobot to a sell rating from a hold rating "due to [a] bleak outlook," stating that "iRobot's business prospects have deteriorated significantly since the Amazon acquisition fell through, leading to massive layoffs and growing losses," "Q4 earnings were disastrous, missing guidance and showing worsening gross margins due to excess inventory and lower sales volumes," "iRobot's future is uncertain, with substantial doubts about its viability within the next 12 months, despite ongoing discussions with its primary lender," and that the Company's "survival hinges on new Roombas being a hit, which seems unlikely." That same day, in an article entitled "Why iRobot Stock Is Crashing Today," The Motley Fool stated, in relevant part, that "iRobot's costly restructuring efforts -- including a 50% workforce reduction -- have yet to yield stability." On this news, iRobot's stock price fell $3.255 per share, or 51.58%, over the following two trading sessions, to close at $3.055 per share on March 13, 2025. If you purchased or otherwise acquired iRobot shares and suffered a loss, are a long-term stockholder, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at investigations@bespc.com, telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

Editor Tech Greg Reese Technocracy Rising by Greg Reese While many people rightly say that money is already digital, when world leaders say the word “digital money” today, it means cryptocurrency, which is now part of a worldwide scheme to monitor your actions and control your money. This new form of currency will require you to have a unique digital wallet, which is essentially a digital ID. Last Spring, European Central Bank President Christine Largarde said that the ECB will be ready to launch the Digital Euro by this October. According to the Atlantic Council, 137 countries and currency unions are preparing for a Crypto Digital Currency. Three countries have already launched theirs, the Bahamas, Jamaica, and Nigeria. CBDC’s in the advanced stages are the Digital Euro, China’s Digital Yuan, India’s e-rupee, the United Kingdom’s Digital Pound, Brazil’s Digital Real, and Russia’s Digital Ruble. Hong Kong is preparing to launch a Stablecoin. Japan’s Financial Services Agency is preparing to launch a Japanese yen Stablecoin this fall. And President Trump, who has been pushing Stablecoin development, has repeatedly announced that the USA will lead the world in AI and Crypto. His family is heavily invested, and stand to make billions when the world goes Crypto. The Trump family even have their own Stablecoin, the USD1 Stablecoin from World Liberty Financial. Trump’s puppetmasters likely have another Stablecoin in mind to be the Digital Dollar, but a puppet can still dream. The only difference between a CBDC, Central Bank Digital Currency, and a Stablecoin, is name only. Both will be programmed according to the nation’s financial policies. Both are capable of operating a carbon tax and a social credit score. The only difference is one will be managed by a Central Bank, and the other by a private corporation, in the USA, something like Blackrock. CEO of BlackRock and long time business associate of President Trump, Larry Fink, was recently appointed interim co-chair of the World Economic Forum. The Trump administration has been normalizing the deployment of the US Military as a police force in the streets of America. And according to Fox News, Pentagon officials are about to mobilize National Guard troops in 19 states to assist Homeland Security with President Trump’s nationwide crackdown on illegal immigration and crime. This likely means ID checkpoints, because how else will a citizen prove their citizenship? But with a new Digital ID, the military police state can simply scan you from a distance with Palantir technology. Doctors are discussing online how President Trump’s swollen ankles and hand bruising are indications of congestive heart failure. The bruises on the hand being typical of IV diuretic treatments. The White House says its from shaking hands. If Trump goes the unfortunate way of the clot shot, which he is still proud of, then JD Vance will be President. And he owes everything to Palantir’s Peter Thiel, one of Technocracy’s biggest cheerleaders. The stage is now set for crypto and Digital IDs, and if that happens, there will be push back. Especially in the 19 states being supplied with the National Guard. Tech Tech Tech

On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day.

Title: NY Fed Survey Sees Minimal Impact on Jobs From AI Adoption

Highlights Layoffs tied to AI remain rare, with only 1% of service firms reporting job cuts due to AI, and none among manufacturers, though some anticipate layoffs ahead. About 12% of service firms scaled back hiring due to AI, but similar shares are adding AI-skilled workers, suggesting offsets rather than mass job loss. Nearly half of firms plan to retrain employees to use AI, with Fed and PYMNTS surveys showing workers see AI more as a tool for skill augmentation than replacement. Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping hiring decisions in the U.S. labor market, but fears of widespread job loss remain unfounded, according to new regional surveys from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

By completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions. Δ The August regional business surveys found a sharp uptick in AI use among firms in the New York, Northern New Jersey region, with 40% of service firms reported using AI in the past six months, up from 25% this time last year. For the next six months, 44% expect to use AI. Service firms are those in finance, healthcare, business services, hospitality, retail and other industries outside of manufacturing and the public sector. Among manufacturers, usage rose from 16% to 26% over the year. For the next six months, 33% expect to use AI. The New York Fed surveys excluded companies that only used AI to search for information. But instead of expanded AI adoption leading to widespread job losses — OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has said AI could reduce up to 70% of jobs — the New York Fed found that only 1% of service firms have cut jobs due to layoffs, with manufacturers not reducing their workforces at all. “Layoffs have been almost nonexistent due to AI use,” Richard Deitz, economic policy advisor at the New York Fed, said during a press call Thursday (Sept. 4) to discuss the surveys. Moreover, manufacturers do not plan to cut jobs as a result of using AI over the next six months. For service firms, 13% plan to reduce their job count in the near future. The strongest labor impact is on reduced hiring. Among service firms, 12% said they hired fewer people in the past six months due to AI use. For the next six months, 23% of service firms said they would do so. Among manufacturers, none reduced hiring in the last six months but 8% plan to do so in the next half year. But plans to reduce hiring are offset by increased hiring of workers with AI know-how: 11% of service firms and 7% of manufacturers. For the next six months, 12% and 14% of service firms and manufacturers plan to hire more AI-adept workers, respectively. Also, workers were more likely to be retrained than let go. A third of service firms and 14% of manufacturers are retraining the existing workforce. For the next six months, 47% of service firms and manufacturers plan to do so. “When we’re looking at the implied economy-wide impacts from our surveys, these impacts are likely to be really limited,” Deitz said. “For those that have a job, they are actually more likely to be retrained than replaced by an AI, which is a clear positive for workers. Moreover, AI has created job opportunities for workers who are skilled in AI use.” A PYMNTS Intelligence report had a similar finding: While most workers surveyed agreed that artificial intelligence poses a systemic risk of job displacement, nearly two-thirds do not believe their jobs are at risk. Moreover, a higher percentage of respondents across occupations see AI as augmenting their skills instead of taking away their jobs. Read more: GenAI: A Generational Look At AI Usage And Attitudes The biggest impact is on job seekers, where AI “likely made it a bit harder” to get employment now and in the near future, Deitz said. The reduced hiring more often affects workers with a college degree. Recent Stanford University research supports the finding that AI is making it harder for young workers to get jobs, especially in fields where generative AI tools can automate tasks. These include software developers, receptionists, translators and customer service agents. The PYMNTS report showed that while 82% of workers who use AI at least weekly say it increases productivity, millennials and Gen Z workers are more likely than older generations to worry that AI can take away their jobs. Overall, 54% are concerned about the technology’s impact on jobs. In the New York Fed surveys, paid AI services were gaining traction: About half of service firms that use AI reported paying for tools, up 16 percentage points from a year earlier. For manufacturers, 46% of manufacturers do so, up from 7% last year. OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, Anthropic’s Claude and Perplexity AI all have free or paid tiers. The top three uses for AI were the same for both types of businesses, differing only in ranking. For service firms, the top use case is to search for information (54%), followed by marketing and advertising, and business or predictive analytics. For manufacturers, marketing and advertising was at the top (61%), followed by search for information and business or predictive analytics. The findings suggest AI’s effects on jobs are both overstated and underestimated — overstated in the sense that layoffs remain minimal, but underestimated in that hiring is already shifting in ways that make it harder for new entrants and some college graduates to land positions. Still, expected job changes will likely be affected by economic conditions. As Deitz noted, last year about 10% of service firms anticipated layoffs, but very few actually occurred. “What firms are anticipating doing with respect to AI is dependent on economic conditions,” he said.

Spencer Platt/Getty Images Layoffs are grabbing headlines this week. On Tuesday, oil giant ConocoPhillips said it will slash up to 25% of its workforce, or about 3,250 roles — a pattern now visible across many other oil and gas companies. Chevron has likewise announced up to 9,000 cuts likely this year. Too much oil in the market and too little confidence in future demand have squeezed margins across the industry, so companies like Conoco and Chevron are leaning on job cuts to preserve cash flow. It makes sense, even if it’s not a pretty trend. Layoffs at Big Tech companies also appear elevated, but the profit and growth story in that sector could hardly be more different. Even as companies post record second-quarter profits and boast of expanding margins and AI breakthroughs, players large and less-large are slashing headcount. On Wednesday, Salesforce posted a 10% revenue jump to $10.2 billion and an 11% rise in its favored demand metric. Profits surged, and buybacks ballooned by $20 billion. Yet the company also reportedly gutted 4,000 support jobs, with CEO Marc Benioff saying he “needs less heads” as AI agents now handle about a million customer conversations. Oracle is also enjoying its own banner year. Shares are up 33% year to date, hitting record highs this summer as AI cloud demand spiked. Its most recent results, released mid-summer, showed sales growing by 11% to nearly $16 billion. Behind the scenes, however, state filings and worker posts show thousands of jobs disappearing across Seattle, California, Texas, and Kansas — longtime employees included. Oracle's next earnings are due Sept. 9, with analysts predicting more positive financial news. Cisco is another example. The company recently said that hundreds of positions are set to be cut, many of them in software engineering. The announcement came even as the company reported an 8% rise in its recent quarter, with revenue rising to $14.7 billion. It also came on top of deep cuts in 2024, when Cisco eliminated some 5,000 jobs, or roughly 7% of its workforce, as part of a plan to redirect spending toward “high-growth areas.” Cisco stock has risen about 15% year to date, behind some tech competitors, but still well ahead of the overall S&P 500. Microsoft, in its most recent quarter, posted sales of nearly $80 billion, and net income of $27 billion, up 24%, with earnings per share rising in tandem at 24%, too. Shares have risen some 20% this year, and the company has cut its workforce deeply at the very same time — with 15,000 workers laid off so far in 2025. Amazon, which like Microsoft is spending tens of billions on various AI buildouts, has also cut jobs throughout 2025, while also posting rocketing sales and profits. In its most recent release, CEO Andy Jassy expressly tied the growth to AI, saying: “Our conviction that AI will change every customer experience is starting to play out as we’ve expanded Alexa+ to millions of customers, continue to see our shopping agent used by many millions of customers, launched AI models like DeepFleet that optimize productivity paths for our 1M+ robots, made it much easier for software developers to write code with Kiro,” on top of similar AI developments. “Our AI progress across the board continues to improve our customer experiences, speed of innovation, operational efficiency, and business growth, and I’m excited for what lies ahead,” Jassy concluded. Bucking the overall tech-stock trend, Amazon shares have lagged the market so far this year. But taken together, the message appears clear. Efficiency is in, even if it comes at the expense of payrolls — or perhaps explicitly because it comes at the expense of payrolls. Wall Street keeps rewarding companies that adopt AI while trimming, automating, and streamlining. Meanwhile, for workers, the era of record profits feels more like an era of record precarity.

Title: Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop is scrapping its budget line in the brand's latest shift

Full Content:
Things aren't so good for Good Clean Goop. Less than two years after it launched, Good Clean Goop — the accessible product line from Gwyneth Paltrow's lifestyle brand — is shutting down, a company spokesperson confirmed. The line's relationship with Target, its exclusive brick-and-mortar retailer, ended earlier this year. Both the retailer and Goop declined to provide further details about the line's performance. The line launched in 2023 at Target and on Amazon, and boasted about a dozen products, all under $40 — a far cry from the costly products, like a $150 peptide serum, that Goop had become known for. "I'm so excited for more people who are curious about clean beauty — or who simply appreciate a quality cream or a hardworking cleanser — to be able to try our new line of essentials," Paltrow said in a statement ahead of the line's launch. Some products remain available for purchase on Amazon, though more than half are discounted. "Good.clean.goop introduced many new customers to the goop brand," a Goop spokesperson said in a statement. They described it as "part of a broader strategic shift, focusing on its core business and upcoming initiatives where we're seeing significant momentum." There were signs that the line struggled to gain traction. Last year, Puck reported that Good Clean Goop was in the bottom 15% of beauty brands at Target, and two former Goop employees told Business Insider that they expected the partnership to end in early 2025. The brand's Instagram profile has not posted since October 2024. In June, Goop attempted another strategy to reach the masses: partnering with Ulta Beauty to sell its primary beauty line, Goop Beauty, both on Ulta.com and in 800 stores. Paltrow told WWD last month that beauty was the brand's primary revenue driver. Since its 2008 founding, Goop, which has raised about $140 million according to PitchBook, has made several pivots. Goop launched as a media company, though it has since made significant cuts to its editorial staff and folded its magazine. The brand tried its hand at developing books and TV shows, including a Netflix docuseries, but hasn't released any such projects since 2023. A push into the wellness space with a supplement regimen, which the company said generated $100,000 in sales in one day in 2017, did not last, and other initiatives, like the cruise Goop at Sea, have also shut down. In 2024, the company underwent two rounds of layoffs and remained unprofitable, as Business Insider previously reported. Last year, Goop said that it would focus on beauty, fashion, and food moving forward. Jump to

As for the game series, Crystal Dynamics is currently at work on the next Tomb Raider game--the studio recently underwent layoffs after the cancellation of Perfect Dark. At the time, the studio said Tomb Raider was unaffected. Got a news tip or want to contact us directly? Email news@gamespot.com Use your keyboard! Log in to comment

Title: AST SpaceMobile Plans 40 Direct to Cellphone Satellites Early in 2026

Home » Space » AST SpaceMobile Plans 40 Direct to Cellphone Satellites Early in 2026 AST SpaceMobile (ASTS) is developing a space-based cellular broadband network that provides direct-to-cellphone connectivity worldwide. This would eliminate deadzones without requiring special antennas like existing satellite phones and will work on standard smartphones. Their satellites, known as BlueBird, are designed to deliver 4G/5G service from low Earth orbit (LEO) by beaming signals directly to unmodified cell phones. The BlueBird 6 is the sixth BlueBird satellite shipped last month, August 2025. They are actively building components and phased arrays for the next 40 satellites to support expanded deployment by early 2026. This builds on their initial launch of the first five commercial BlueBird satellites (Block 1) on September 12, 2024, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The plan for 40 additional Block 2 BlueBird satellites is part of a broader initiative to deploy 45-60 satellites by the end of 2026, enabling continuous coverage in key markets. Each BlueBird satellite costs $19-23 million to manufacture and launch, with recent increases due to supply chain factors (up from $19-22 million previously). $1.3 billion is needed for the full deployment by 2026, including manufacturing, launches, and operations. They have nearly a $1 billion of cash on hand. AST Spacemobile satellites will be at 600-900 kilometers of altitude. AT&T, which along with Verizon has committed other spectrum access for AST SpaceMobile to reach mobile subscribers beyond the range of cell towers, previously announced plans to trial the service with select first responders in 2025. The long-term goal is a constellation of up to 168 satellites for global coverage. The full constellation of 168 satellites could take several more years, depending on funding and launch availability. The BlueBird satellites are large, unfoldable structures optimized for direct-to-device (D2D) cellular connectivity. Each satellite features a massive communications array measuring 693 square feet (about 64 square meters), which unfolds in orbit to create a phased-array antenna for beaming signals to cell phones. They are designed to support up to 40 MHz of bandwidth per beam, enabling peak data speeds of up to 120 Mbps. They are compatible with 3GPP-standard 4G/5G protocols, allowing seamless integration with existing cellular networks. On June 13, AST SpaceMobile announced a $550 million deal for long-term access to 45 MHz of premium lower mid-band spectrum in the United States and Canada for over 80 years. This deal with Ligado Networks, Viasat, and Inmarsat provides AST with 40 MHz of L-Band Mobile Satellite Service spectrum plus an additional 5 MHz in the 1670-1675 MHz band. AST SpaceMobile has secured agreements with over 45 mobile network operators (MNOs) worldwide, covering more than 2.8 billion subscribers.

04 September 2025 Time taken to read : 12 Minute KATHMANDU: Khabarhub brings you a glimpse of major developments of the day in Nepal, including politics, business/economy, sports, entertainment, and more. Nepal directs ISPs to block 26 unregistered social media platforms The Ministry of Communications and Information Technology has instructed the Nepal Telecommunications Authority (NTA) to direct Internet service providers (ISPs) to block 26 social media platforms operating in Nepal without official registration, including Facebook. NTA Executive Director Min Prasad Aryal confirmed that ISPs have already received instructions to implement the ban. The decision follows the government’s directive that all social media platforms must complete registration under the Social Media Use Directive, within the timeframe set by the cabinet. These are the apps govt is blocking for not registering The government is enforcing its decision to block all social media platforms that have not completed official registration, effective immediately. This move follows a Supreme Court order and a recent ministerial meeting led by Communications Minister Prithvi Subba Gurung. Currently, only five platforms have completed registration and are allowed to operate in Nepal. These include TikTok, Viber, Nimbuzz, WeTalk, and Opolive. Platforms still in the process of registration, such as Telegram and Global Link, are temporarily permitted to operate. Meta reaches out to government over listing; Hamro Patro submits application Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has reached out to the government of Nepal regarding the mandatory listing of social media platforms. According to Information Ministry spokesperson Gajendra Thakur, Meta representatives contacted the ministry’s secretariat to inquire about the required procedures and documents for listing. Seven provisions behind Nepal’s social media ban The government has said it will start blocking social media platforms that have not completed official registration, citing seven specific provisions under the Social Media Use Directive. The move follows a Supreme Court order requiring platforms to register before operating in Nepal. The government had issued a seven-day deadline starting August 28 for platforms to complete registration, but foreign-based operators failed to comply. With the deadline expired, the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, in consultation with the Nepal Telecommunications Authority, initiated the ban. Leaders criticize government’s decision to block social media The government’s decision to block 26 social media platforms, including unregistered Facebook, has drawn sharp criticism from political leaders. Nepali Congress General Secretary Gagan Kumar Thapa called the move “a step in the wrong direction.” He said the Supreme Court had directed the government to make laws for regulation, not impose blanket bans. “The government has taken a reverse course. This must be reconsidered,” he said. Thapa added that social media is vital for freedom of expression, public debate, and government accountability. Maoist Centre to launch protests against government after Dashain-Tihar The main opposition, CPN (Maoist Centre), has decided to initiate protests against the government after the Dashain and Tihar festivals. Spokesperson Agni Prasad Sapkota said the office-bearers’ meeting held at the party headquarters in Parisdanda on Thursday concluded that corruption is on the rise and governance has weakened, prompting the need for protest. He added that the party would use street demonstrations to raise public awareness about democratic republican socialism and the socialist-oriented system envisioned in the constitution. PM Oli’s India visit uncertain, says Indian media Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli is reportedly unlikely to visit India, according to an Indian news outlet. The Print Online cited sources suggesting that Oli’s planned visit on September 15 may not take place. The report comes shortly after a brief meeting between PM Modi and PM Oli on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Tianjin, China, earlier this week. FNJ protests government decision to block social media The Federation of Nepali Journalists (FNJ) has opposed the government’s decision to shut down unregistered social media platforms. In a statement issued on Thursday, FNJ General Secretary Ram Prasad Dahal said the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology’s decision to restrict unlisted platforms would curtail press freedom and freedom of expression. Ram Hari Khatiwada files candidacy for chair of Parliamentary Hearing Committee Nepali Congress lawmaker Ram Hari Khatiwada has filed his candidacy for the post of chairperson of the Parliamentary Hearing Committee. He registered his nomination on Thursday following his party’s recommendation. Karn Thapa registers dissent ahead of UML’s statute convention CPN-UML Standing Committee member Karn Bahadur Thapa has officially registered his dissenting opinion at the party’s central office ahead of the second statute convention, set to begin on Friday. “I am at the party’s central office to formally register my dissent,” Thapa said on Thursday. “Once registered, I will make my dissent public. This is meant to contribute to internal party debate.” Parliamentary committee expresses dissatisfaction over new parliament building construction A parliamentary committee has expressed dissatisfaction over the slow pace of construction work on the new Parliament building, which is still under construction. On Thursday, the Committee on Monitoring and Evaluation of the Implementation of Directive Principles, Policies, and Responsibilities of the State, under the Federal Parliament, carried out a surprise inspection of the project. The committee remarked that the construction progress was far behind schedule. Embossed number plates essential for Digital Nepal: Transport Nepal Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Devendra Dahal has emphasized that embossed number plates on vehicles are necessary to advance the government’s Digital Nepal initiative. Speaking in the House of Representatives on Thursday, Minister Dahal explained that agreements for installing embossed plates had been signed three times in the past, and failing to implement them would require the government to pay Rs 3 billion to manufacturers without receiving any production. He clarified that the current government was merely implementing previous agreements. NEPSE dips by 6.55 points The Nepal stock market slipped by 6.55 points on Thursday, with the NEPSE index closing at 2,719.77. Before the weighted average calculation, the market was down by less than one point, but it fell by six points after the official tally. Trading volume increased compared to the previous day, reaching Rs 5.14 billion, up from Rs 4.72 billion. Among listed companies, 85 saw their share prices rise, 165 declined, and one remained unchanged. India enforces new India clarifies entry rules for Nepalis as new Immigration Act comes into effectimmigration rules The Government of India has introduced new immigration regulations under the Immigration and Foreigners Act 2025, effective from September 1, according to the Times of India. The Act grants expanded powers to the Bureau of Immigration (BOI), with the aim of curbing fraud, assisting state authorities in deporting illegal immigrants, and establishing a centralized immigration database. Inactive social media platforms to be reactivated once registered: Communication Ministry The government has decided to deactivate social media platforms operating in Nepal without official registration, according to a notice issued by the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology on Thursday. The ministry stated that the move follows a Supreme Court order requiring both domestic and foreign online and social media platforms to undergo mandatory registration before operation in Nepal. Bhandari’s membership row is not an internal party dispute: Shankar Pokharel CPN-UML General Secretary Shankar Pokharel has said that the issue of former President Bidya Devi Bhandari’s party membership should not be viewed as an internal dispute within UML but rather as a clash between her aspiration to reclaim membership and the party’s institutional decision. Speaking ahead of the second statute convention, which begins tomorrow in Godavari, Pokharel said the matter has been amplified outside the party even though it is essentially about setting a new precedent. Thapa cleared by EC to contest Rupandehi-3 by-election The candidacy of Dr. Lekh Jung Thapa, fielded by the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) for the upcoming Rupandehi-3 by-election, has sparked a wave of debate on social media. The discussion emerged after social media users cited a provision mentioned in a press release issued by Election Commission spokesperson and Joint Secretary Nita Pokharel Aryal on July 20. The provision states that individuals whose names remain on the closed list of proportional representation (PR) candidates from the 2022 federal and provincial elections cannot contest in upcoming polls. Nepali garment industries creating thousands of jobs: Minister Bhandari Minister for Industry, Commerce and Supplies Damodar Bhandari has said that Nepal’s garment industries are creating employment opportunities for thousands of people while contributing significantly to the country’s economic development. Speaking at the inauguration of the 30th Annual General Assembly of the Nepal Garment Association on Wednesday, Minister Bhandari noted that the sector has played a vital role in generating jobs and earning foreign currency for the nation. RSP’s public affairs secretary Badan Bhandari attacked in Kathmandu Badan Bhandari, Secretary of the Public Affairs Department of the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), was attacked late last night in Pragati Chowk, Kapan, according to party officials. RSP Chair Rabi Lamichhane’s aide Pramod Nyaupane said three assailants on a motorcycle with its number plate concealed carried out the attack. Two of them struck Bhandari with iron rods, while the third was carrying a khukuri. Gold and silver prices unchanged The price of gold has remained unchanged on Thursday. According to the Federation of Nepal Gold and Silver Dealers’ Association, the price of gold is Rs 207,900 per tola. RPP demands PM Oli’s clarification on reported agreement with China’s GSI The Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) has demanded that Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli clarify reports that Nepal has agreed to join China’s Global Security Initiative (GSI). Speaking during the zero hour of the House of Representatives meeting on Thursday, RPP General Secretary Dr. Dhawal Shumsher Rana sought an explanation from the Prime Minister on behalf of his party. Indra Jatra commences in Kathmandu The Indra Jatra festival has begun in Kathmandu Valley today. Celebrated to worship Indra, the god of rain and cooperation, the festival is also known as Yenya Punhi among the Newar community. The festivities kicked off at Hanuman Dhoka with the erection of the Indra Dhwaja pole at 10:31 am. The eight-day celebration includes traditional dances, chariot processions, and rituals honoring various deities.

Title: 20VC + SaaStr is Back With Canva Founder Cliff Obrecht: Anthropic’s $13B Round, OpenAI’s $1.1B Statsig Acquisition & Why Public SaaS Is Back From The Dead

by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts, Scale We’re back on 20VC+SaaStr, and its a great one as Canva Co-Founder and COO Cliff Obrecht joins Harry, Rory and Jason for a deep dive into this week’s biggest venture deals, AI infrastructure spending, and the return of public SaaS valuations. And why Canva won’t direct list. Cliff Obrecht (Canva COO): “Wall Street is the madman in the back seat. In the end, the thing that bails out our incompetence is your growth rate. We’ve had a billion sitting on our balance sheet for ages — that’s a flex, people.” Jason Lemkin (SaaStr): “If you have a billion dollar installed base, you have a distribution channel. It’s kind of sinful if you haven’t reaccelerated by the end of 2025 — you kind of failed as a founder because you have no excuse. You had 18 months.” Rory O’Driscoll (Scale Venture Partners): “Even if Anthropic goes from $9B ARR to $30B (3x growth down from 10x), that’s 8x next year’s revenues. High absolute number? Absolutely. Does it make sense if the growth persists? It’s not crazy.” Harry Stebbings (20VC): “Most VCs should have had Anthropic’s trajectory in their model 47 days ago. These companies are out-accelerating plan, but you’re always valuing future growth.” Anthropic’s latest funding round grabbed headlines not just for its size — $13 billion at a $183 billion post-money valuation — but for what the math reveals about AI company valuations when you dig deeper. “I went into the analysis expecting to say ‘aren’t those guys so silly paying so much?'” admits Rory O’Driscoll. “But when you look at the numbers, maybe those guys are being quite smart.” The trajectory is staggering: from $100 million two years ago to a $1 billion run rate at the start of this year, now approaching $8-9 billion by year-end. If accurate, this represents roughly 9x revenue growth in a single year. O’Driscoll’s forward-looking analysis reveals why investors were fighting to get in: “Even if they decelerate from 10x to 3x growth next year — going from $9B to $30B ARR — the average revenue would be around $20B. That’s 8x next year’s revenues if the growth persists.” The round was massively oversubscribed, with demand reportedly 5-10x the amount raised. For growth-stage investors, sitting out seemed impossible. “If you’re a growth stage investor, it’s hard to imagine a world where you say ‘well, we’re growth stage investors but the two largest market cap companies in the last 3-5 years are the two LLM models and we don’t have a piece of that,'” notes O’Driscoll. On the same day, OpenAI announced its acquisition of Statsig for $1.1 billion in stock — exactly matching the company’s last funding round valuation from Iconic Ventures. With Statsig generating $75 million ARR, the deal represents roughly 15x revenue multiple. The acquisition makes strategic sense beyond the numbers. Statsig’s CEO now ranks as #3 at OpenAI, and with Figma’s CEO joining OpenAI’s leadership, the company is assembling serious product talent. “The fact that it was exactly the price of the last round shows this was something that everyone wanted to roll into,” observes O’Driscoll. For Iconic, which led Anthropic’s previous round and was blocked from OpenAI’s direct investment, this provided a backdoor into the OpenAI ecosystem. Public SaaS companies delivered a surprise comeback this quarter, with Snowflake leading the charge with a 45% stock jump after reporting 24% year-over-year growth — a significant reacceleration from previous quarters. “It’s the Mark Twain reports of my debt were greatly exaggerated,” quips Rory. “Well, it turns out reports of the death of SaaS and software were greatly exaggerated.” The winners weren’t universal — MongoDB, Box, Elastic, Okta, and Zoom all posted strong results, while others like Salesforce haven’t yet seen the AI benefit flow through to revenue. “Some folks, about half of the public B2B leaders, are finally getting an AI tailwind,” says Lemkin. “Box should be crushing it because every time I spin up a new AI app, I need like two or three databases.” The market reaction reveals how beaten down expectations had become. When companies like Snowflake delivered even modest beats against lowered expectations, investors responded dramatically. Jensen Huang’s prediction of $3-4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending over the next five years sparked intense debate about whether such capex levels can generate sufficient returns. “Look at $4 trillion — you want a 20% return on equity, you’ve got to be generating $800 billion of profit,” calculates O’Driscoll. “That’s a lot of profit when Facebook and Meta combined make a couple hundred billion a year. You’ve got to believe you’re going to create another four Microsofts, another four Facebooks to justify that kind of spend.” The discussion revealed how AI costs are already impacting SaaS margins. Notion famously went from 90% to 80% gross margins, effectively paying a 10% “GPU tax” on their revenue. Canva’s Obrecht confirmed similar impacts: “100% yes, it already is [10% of revenue]. If you look at Lovable, their pass-through to Anthropic or model providers will be way more than 10%.” However, Obrecht expects optimization over time: “We’re betting on distilling these models down, understanding user queries and where I need the frontier model versus where I can deploy the model that’s on-device or self-hosted. Companies will get better at picking the right model for the right job.” Obrecht provided rare insights into Canva’s current trajectory and IPO preparations. The company will close the year “very close if not at $4 billion” in revenue, growing at nearly 40% and reaccelerating. “We have a lot of long-term partners and you want to pay loyalty to people that have supported you along the way, but we’re also thinking through what an IPO looks like,” Obrecht explained about their current secondary round approach. With over a billion in cash and eight years of profitability, Canva doesn’t need primary capital. The challenge became managing a supply-demand imbalance when employees wanted to sell after seeing Figma’s public debut. On timing, Obrecht noted: “We’re gearing up to be an IPO ready company. When we actually go out is another question, but we want to be ready.” The company faces the classic late-stage private company dilemma. “What is the real difference?” asks Obrecht about staying private versus going public. “As a late stage private company with all the big institutions already invested and continuing to do so, our reporting obligations and expectations to beat and raise are pretty much the same.” Obrecht was candid about the limitations of private market liquidity solutions: “There’s availability to capital which we have access to. I think it’s probably liquidity and there are restrictions particularly around employee liquidity and what you can do in the US and whatnot around that piece.” The 13-year-old company recognizes the fairness issue: “We’re 13 years old as a company. Our employees should have liquidity. They’ve created all this value. How can we make it easy for them to access that wealth that’s built up?” But secondary markets aren’t a perfect substitute for public liquidity: “While secondaries, annual secondaries are a mechanism for that, it’s pretty janky and particularly in some jurisdictions, it’s downright impossible.” This creates the awkward dynamic where employees need permission from their employer to access liquidity they’ve earned through years of value creation. “Having to get permission from your employer to get liquidity as a secondary after 13 years — it’s better than no liquidity but it’s a little bit serf-like,” notes one participant. “When you’re public you can make your own choices.” Canva’s AI integration offers a window into how established SaaS companies are navigating the transition. “AI is just accelerating [our mission] massively, making it quicker, faster, and better for customers to achieve their goals,” says Obrecht. The company is moving to a unified credit model for AI features, with free users getting limited credits, premium subscribers getting more, and heavy users paying usage-based pricing beyond certain thresholds. “We’ve got 240 million users. We’re about to launch in October a whole slew of new AI products deeply integrating it into every part of the workflow. We need to seriously run the math on if 20%, 50%, 80% of our users use this 10 times a month — the costs can look pretty big and eat into margins very significantly.” The conversation revealed fascinating insights about venture capital psychology around “the ones that got away.” Multiple participants shared examples of passing on companies early, then struggling to invest at higher valuations later. “Many of my most successful deals I’ve passed on prior,” admits O’Driscoll. “When you see the company say they’ll do A, B, and C, you pass because you don’t believe they’ll do A, B, and C, and then they do A, B, and even C prime — you have what you need to know.” The key insight: “The difference in information content between two data points over time, both of which are positive, and one data point where you have no calibration is almost infinite.” Obrecht observed this pattern with Canva investors: “The best investors that have done best out of Canva were early stage funds, but they realized ‘Holy shit, we’re onto something here.’ So they raised SPVs or additional vehicles to move further up the value chain, going later and later stage and compounded their position.” 1. AI Valuations Aren’t As Crazy As They Look Forward revenue multiples for companies like Anthropic become reasonable when you factor in sustained hypergrowth trajectories. 2. Public SaaS Is Back, But Selectively. Companies with distribution advantages and AI integration are seeing real reacceleration (Snowflake, Datadog, Box, Okta, GitLab even Zoom), while others remain stuck. 3. The 10% GPU Tax Is Real SaaS companies are already spending 10%+ of revenue on AI inference, but optimization will bring costs down over time. 4. Private-to-Public Arbitrage Exists Again Public markets are now valuing companies higher than late-stage private markets in many cases. 5. Don’t Let Pride Stop Follow-On Investments The biggest VC returns often come from doubling down on companies you initially passed on after seeing execution. “If Zuck’s not feeling great about his AI strategy, he can cry into his $200 billion and get over it on his own, right? Take it up with a therapist.” — Rory O’Driscoll on Zuck’s Meta challenges “We’ve had a billion sitting on our balance sheet for ages — that’s a flex, people.” — Cliff Obrecht on Canva’s financial position “Wall Street is the madman in the back seat. In the end, the thing that bails out our incompetence is your growth rate.” — Cliff Obrecht on market volatility vs execution “If you have a billion dollar installed base, you have a distribution channel. It’s kind of sinful if you haven’t reaccelerated by the end of 2025.” — Jason Lemkin on AI tailwinds for established SaaS companies “It’s a bit embarrassing as an early stage investor to buy Revolut off Goldman Sachs.

Title: Ex-Dividend Reminder: Alphabet, Becton, Dickinson And Rogers

ByDividend Channel, Contributor. On 9/8/25, Alphabet, Becton, Dickinson, and Rogers Communications will all trade ex-dividend for their respective upcoming dividends. Alphabet will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.21 on 9/15/25, Becton, Dickinson will pay its quarterly dividend of $1.04 on 9/30/25, and Rogers Communications will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.50 on 10/3/25. 10 Stocks Where Yields Got More Juicy » As a percentage of GOOG's recent stock price of $231.10, this dividend works out to approximately 0.09%, so look for shares of Alphabet Inc to trade 0.09% lower — all else being equal — when GOOG shares open for trading on 9/8/25. Similarly, investors should look for BDX to open 0.55% lower in price and for RCI to open 1.40% lower, all else being equal. Below are dividend history charts for GOOG, BDX, and RCI, showing historical dividends prior to the most recent ones declared. Alphabet: Becton, Dickinson: Rogers Communications: In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time. Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time. This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue. If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 0.36% for Alphabet, 2.20% for Becton, Dickinson, and 5.60% for Rogers Communications. Free Report: Top 8%+ Dividends (paid monthly) In Thursday trading, Alphabet shares are currently up about 9%, Becton, Dickinson shares are up about 0.7%, and Rogers Communications shares are up about 0.4% on the day.

Title: How To Earn $500 A Month From Broadcom Stock Ahead Of Q3 Earnings
URL: https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/dividends/25/09/47494771/how-to-earn-500-a-month-from-broadcom-stock-ahead-of-q3-earnings

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Broadcom Inc. AVGO will release earnings results for the third quarter after the closing bell on Thursday, Sept. 4. Analysts expect the tech company to report quarterly earnings at $1.65 per share, up from $1.24 per share in the year-ago period. Broadcom projects to report quarterly revenue at $15.83 billion, compared to $13.07 billion a year earlier, according to data from Benzinga Pro. The company has beaten analyst estimates for revenue in two straight quarters and in eight of the last 10 quarters overall. Some investors are eyeing potential gains from Broadcom's annual dividend yield of 0.78%. That’s a quarterly dividend amount of 59 cents per share ($2.36 a year). To earn $500 monthly from Broadcom, start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months). Next, we take this amount and divide it by Broadcom's $2.36 dividend: $6,000 / $2.36 = 2,542 shares. So, an investor would need to own approximately $768,675 worth of Broadcom, or 2,542 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500. Assuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $2.36 = 508 shares, or $153,614 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100. Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis; the dividend payment and the stock price fluctuate over time. The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change. For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40). Further, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease. AVGO Price Action: Shares of Broadcom rose by 1.4% to close at $302.39 on Wednesday.

This “compensation actually paid”—a metric that takes into account not just salary but also the amount by which stock holdings increase—made Karp, by a large margin, the highest-paid CEO in the United States. For anyone paying attention to Palantir’s recent fortunes, this was no great surprise. The stock value of the company—whose revenue comes largely from government contracts for data surveillance and the military application of artificial intelligence—is, one might say, negatively indexed to the peace and freedom of humanity. Over the past year the company’s stock has increased in value by a factor of almost six. At the time of writing Palantir was worth $375 billion, making it the twenty-second most valuable company in the S&P 500—just ahead of Coca-Cola and behind Bank of America. “Bad times,” as Karp put it in a recent CNBC appearance, “are incredibly good for Palantir.” And the times, of course, have been incredibly bad. Russia’s long and brutal war of imperial aggression in Ukraine. Israel’s campaign of mass slaughter and ethnic cleansing in Gaza. The outbreak of a larger war in the Middle East (now in a fragile détente) amid expressions of enthusiasm for a violent overthrow of the Iranian leadership. In the US an unprecedented campaign of deportations, leading to civil unrest in Los Angeles and elsewhere. And in all of these situations, there is a great deal of money to be made by a company providing data surveillance and AI systems for military use. The most vivid illustration of this dynamic I have seen is a meme posted to r/PLTR, Reddit’s “unofficial, independent community for retail investors of PLTR to chat about the company, its mission, Alex Karp, and all things pertaining to the stock.” In the background of a photograph taken in a deli or fast-food restaurant, we see a cluster of men involved in a chaotic physical altercation, while in the foreground a middle-aged man sits at a table, entirely unbothered, absorbed in his smartphone. The fighting men are labeled “EUROPE,” “USA,” “ISRAEL,” and “IRAN,” while over the man in the foreground are the words “ME CHECKING THE PRICE OF PALANTIR.” Cofounded in 2003 by Karp and his Stanford friend Peter Thiel, who had recently made serious money from the sale of PayPal to eBay, Palantir Technologies was conceived, in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, as a provider of machine learning and data analytics for the purposes of national security and surveillance. The reasoning went like this: if the US government had been able, in September 2001, to collate and analyze disparate data points—flight school enrollments, anomalies in travel patterns, suspicious associations—the Twin Towers might still be standing, and the people who died that day might still be alive. Palantir’s software facilitates the finding of patterns in large datasets, and presents such information in easily searchable and navigable form. In a recent conversation with Maureen Dowd for The New York Times, which introduced Karp to the paper’s readers as a “billionaire man of mystery,” he described the work his company does as “the finding of hidden things.” (Karp has been a beneficiary of a near uniformly credulous media, and not just in his native country: in 2016 the German daily Die Welt ran a story about him whose headline translates as “This Genius Is Building the Most Important Company in the World.” Karp, it’s worth pointing out, formerly served on the board of directors of the Axel Springer publishing group, Die Welt’s parent company.) Thiel, a Tolkien obsessive of long standing, named the company after the palantíri in The Lord of the Rings—the “far-seeing stones,” one of which was used by the dark lord Sauron to surveil, from his seat of power in Mordor, the inhabitants of Middle Earth. Palantir’s critics, though, are less inclined to invoke Tolkien than they are Philip K. Dick, whose short story “The Minority Report” concerns an authoritarian future society in which “precrime” detectives arrest people for crimes they have not yet carried out but merely formed the intention of committing. Here’s how Karp put it in an interview with Charlie Rose in 2009: “What we do is we use what legal scholars call predicate-based search. So we would look at you, and then we would go out and say, oh, there’s lots of different things in your life that may be indicative of someone involved in bad behavior.” Along with Thiel’s initial investment of $30 million, the company received an early cash injection of $2 million from In-Q-Tel, the CIA’s venture capital arm. Although Palantir also works with corporate clients like Walmart and Wendy’s—which uses Palantir’s AI to manage its inventories of burgers and fries—its earliest and most enduringly important clients were state agencies like the CIA, the FBI, and the NSA, for whom it acts as an outsourced provider of intelligence gathering and analytics. During the first Trump term, Palantir became strongly associated with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), providing it with surveillance and deportation logistics. Palantir’s FALCON software helped ICE collate and analyze vast amounts of data to map family connections and plan future raids. In 2018 ICE used FALCON to prepare for raids on around a hundred 7-Eleven stores across the US. Advertisement In October 2023, in the days after the attacks by Hamas on Israeli territory, Palantir took out a full-page ad in The New York Times that read, “Palantir stands with Israel.” The following January, by which time the Israeli government’s genocidal response to those attacks had been underway for three months, the company’s board of directors gathered in Tel Aviv. While there, Karp and Thiel met with Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, and subsequently signed a contract with the country’s defense ministry to provide the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) with AI for advanced targeting capabilities. (In discussing this technology, Karp has used the phrase kill chain, a military term of art that refers to the structure of an attack—the identification of a target, the dispatching of military force to its location, and the assault on and destruction of that target.) The company’s share price began to rise vertiginously. “Hamas really took us to the moon,” as one characteristically elated r/PLTR poster put it. Karp’s personal wealth and his public ebullience rose with it. In February of this year, by which time Palantir’s market value had surpassed that of the Walt Disney Company, Karp appeared in an online video call with retail investors. Dressed in a white T-shirt, Karp delivered an apparently ad hoc speech, his arms spread wide in a show of triumphal grandeur and his graying curls bouncing jauntily. “We’re doing it!” he said. We’re doing it! And I’m sure you’re enjoying this as much as I am…. We are crushing it…. We have dedicated our company to the service of the West, and to the United States of America…. Palantir is here to disrupt and make the institutions we partner with the very best in the world, and, when it’s necessary, to scare enemies and on occasion kill them. If Hamas took Palantir shareholders to the moon, the return of Donald Trump to the White House, and the subsequent brief and disastrous reign of Elon Musk, took them to Mars. This April it emerged that ICE was paying the company $30 million to develop a software system, known as ImmigrationOS, to track immigrants using biometric and geolocation data. The second Trump administration has deepened Palantir’s already substantial relationship with the federal government, extending its reach across multiple departments. In March Trump signed an executive order directing the government to share data across agencies, raising concerns, as The New York Times put it, that the president “might compile a master list of personal information on Americans that could give him untold surveillance power,” and that he might use personal information “to advance his political agenda by policing immigrants and punishing critics.” Palantir’s selection as the main partner for this data-sharing project, the Times reported, was driven by Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), at least three members of which were known to have formerly worked at Palantir. While all this was going on—while he was becoming America’s highest-paid CEO and facilitating a growing police state at home and a genocidal campaign in Gaza—Karp somehow managed to squeeze in writing a book. Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he managed to dictate one: The Technological Republic, which was published earlier this year, is credited to both Karp and one Nicholas W. Zamiska, Palantir’s head of corporate affairs and legal counsel to the office of the CEO. Speaking with Bari Weiss on her podcast, Karp put it as follows: “I would say, in complete candor, 95 percent plus of the ideas are mine, 90 percent of the writing is his. And the writing is phenomenal.” The writing, I’m sorry to say, is not at all phenomenal; it is uniformly adequate. The division of literary labor, in any case, seems to be such that Karp deployed his own legal counsel in much the same manner as an ordinary person who didn’t want to put in the work might use a generative AI chatbot like ChatGPT, throwing out a mess of half-formed ideas to be put into serviceable prose. Advertisement I don’t wish to unduly diminish the contribution of Zamiska, who for all I know may believe that coauthorship of The Technological Republic redounds to his credit, but it’s bad enough having to read and write about this book without also having to mention both these guys every time I refer to it, so I’m going to take Karp’s lead here and proceed on the understanding that the book is essentially his work. And as I made my way sluggishly through its pages—through its business-casual banalities, its pallid apologias for Western civilization and imperial violence—I found myself increasingly preoccupied by a single question: Why did Alexander Karp want to write this thing in the first place? I suspect that his reasons are at least partly related to the Silicon Valley cult of the tech-founder-as-philosopher-king, and have to do with Karp’s desire to be viewed as not just a businessman but also a public intellectual. This book exists, in other words, in order for Karp to have written a book. Much has been made of his academic and intellectual credentials. He has a doctorate in social theory from Frankfurt’s Goethe Universität. (It has often been noted that while he was there he “studied under” Jürgen Habermas, but that appears to be a stretch; according to Die Welt, he wrote to Habermas asking him to supervise his Ph.D., and Habermas passed him along to a colleague.) He quotes Adorno in his shareholder letters. He plays fast and loose with words like hermeneutics and ontology. On the evidence of The Technological Republic, Habermas, whatever his reasons, made the right call. Its thesis can be outlined briefly enough: Silicon Valley, whose foundational companies were built on defense contracts, has strayed too far, for too long, from its original mission. Its prevailing culture, influenced by the “woke” ideas trickling downward from elite institutions of higher education, is such that building technologies to serve the “national interest” has become almost unthinkable for a generation of talented but misguided engineers. These brilliant minds, argues Karp, are being wasted on lucrative but frivolous projects—on-demand laundry services, apps that can bring you a burrito in a taxi, and so on. “The software industry,” he writes, should rebuild its relationship with government and redirect its effort and attention to constructing the technology and artificial intelligence capabilities that will address the most pressing challenges that we collectively face. The engineering elite of Silicon Valley has an affirmative obligation to participate in the defense of the nation and the articulation of a national project—what is this country, what are our values, and for what do we stand. Karp’s friendship with Thiel is often said to be structured around their ideological differences. Thiel, who supported Trump before it was profitable or popular to do so, is widely viewed as a libertarian. Karp has in the past publicly identified as a progressive and has even occasionally, and absurdly, referred to himself as a “socialist.” But in reality Karp is no more a progressive than Thiel—whose fortune is likewise derived largely from government contracts—is a libertarian. Much of The Technological Republic is given over to the kind of broad-strokes antiwokeism that can be found in dispiriting abundance in the nonfiction section of any airport bookstore. One of the book’s four sections is entitled “The Hollowing Out of the American Mind”—a typically overripe allusion to Allan Bloom’s classic conservative critique of cultural relativism in American higher education, The Closing of the American Mind. Through this long central section, Karp doesn’t elaborate so much as endlessly restate the argument about Silicon Valley having lost the courage of its foundational convictions. (It is often said that many nonfiction books should really have been magazine articles; this one feels like a LinkedIn post mercilessly stretched to nearly three hundred pages.) The book addresses a 2018 controversy around Project Maven, an AI warfare program for which Google was subcontracted by the Pentagon to provide machine learning and data management software. When the staff circulated a petition protesting the company’s involvement in technologies of war, Google discontinued its work on the project. Karp diagnoses a complacency about national security among younger “elites” who did not live through the geopolitical threats of the twentieth century. “The most capable generation of coders,” he writes, “has never experienced a war or genuine social upheaval. Why court controversy with your friends or risk their disapproval by working for the US military when you can retreat into the perceived safety of building another app?” Palantir stepped in to fill the defense-tech gap left by Google’s cowardly decision, a move that Karp implies should be a template for Silicon Valley’s future. He repeatedly claims that coders who want nothing to do with military technology are suffering from moral atrophy. Though they might seem, to you or me, to be acting on principle—because they oppose war in general or have a specific aversion to serving the interests of empire—they are motivated, he insists, not by a higher cause but by the desire to avoid the opprobrium of their peers. Such people, for Karp, are unwitting victims of self-censorship, who won’t even permit themselves to think about offending the prevailing morals: The dystopian future that Orwell and others have imagined may be near, but not because of the surveillance state or contraptions built by Silicon Valley giants that rob us of our privacy or most intimate moments alone. It is we, not our technical creations, who are to blame for failing to encourage and enable the radical act of belief in something above and beyond, and external to, the self. The speed and enthusiasm with which the culture skewers anyone for their perceived transgressions and errors—with which we descend on one another for deviations from the norm—only further diminishes our capacity to move toward truth. The book is filled with this sort of sanctimonious guff. If it were just another denunciation of cancel culture, it would be merely boring and belated. But coming from Alexander Karp, the CEO and cofounder of Palantir Technologies, this concern-trolling about a growing censoriousness in “the culture” feels almost intentional in its absurdity. At times I approached the book, perhaps to preserve my own psychic integrity, as an avant-garde exercise in narrative unreliability, an experiment in the dizzying extremes of dramatic irony that I associate most with Charles Kinbote, the comically oblivious narrator of Nabokov’s Pale Fire. Again and again I found myself responding to some sententious lament about Silicon Valley’s lack of moral values by scrawling “You run Palantir!” in the margin. Taken in isolation, Karp’s critique of Silicon Valley—that its most talented engineers and entrepreneurs have no sense of the larger public good—is merely banal, rather than wrong. What makes it deeply strange, and genuinely unsettling, is that what he positions as a moral project worthy of these great talents is essentially an algorithmic arms race with America’s geopolitical rivals. This project is, of course, one that Karp views as a defense of the West and its values. But he has almost nothing to say about these values, which he seems uninterested in even defining, let alone analyzing. One of the more aggravating aspects of the book is Karp’s perpetual gesturing in the general direction of philosophy—of serious subjects and serious engagements with them—without ever actually attempting such a thing. On many occasions, for instance, he invokes the philosophical notion of “the good life,” by way of a claim that the talented tech workers of Silicon Valley, and the culture of which they are a part, have entirely abandoned the question of what might constitute it. “The antiseptic nature of modern discourse,” he writes, dominated by an unwavering commitment to justice but deeply wary when it comes to substantive positions on the good life, is a product of our own reluctance, and indeed fear, to offend, to alienate, and to risk the disapproval of the crowd. Silicon Valley, he writes elsewhere, is the product of “a cultural and moral agnosticism if not relativism that assiduously avoided anything approaching substantive views about the good life.” If Karp has any ideas about what “the good life” might actually be, though, he has been extraordinarily successful at keeping them secret. A cynical reader might conclude, in the absence of any other guidance, that perhaps the good life involves becoming a billionaire by selling AI weapons guidance systems and helping governments carry out mass surveillance on their citizens. A more generous reader might conclude that Karp is simply a busy man and doesn’t have the time to think this stuff through. Similarly, the book never delivers on its grandly Platonic title. Not only does Karp fail to describe the “Technological Republic” he invokes; he seems unaware that such a thing might even be expected of him. In this sense, among others, the book reads as the work of someone who wishes to be thought of as a public intellectual but isn’t willing to put in the effort to become one. In the brief passages in which Karp discusses his own leadership of Palantir and his ideas about what constitutes an effective organization, his primary goal is apparently to present himself as an unconventional thinker, by means of strenuously eclectic references—what businesses can learn from the social organization of honeybee swarms, what start-up founders can learn from experimental theater, what Stanley Milgram’s psychological experiments can teach us about creating something new in business, and so on. Such attempts at intellectual grooviness would be risible enough in themselves, were it not for the fact that all this disruptive innovation and free thinking is ultimately in service of a consolidation of state power and business interests—what is normally referred to as the military-industrial complex, which since the end of World War II has been at the root of many long and brutal foreign conflicts, as well as the fortunes of many ruthless and clever opportunists. Another reason The Technological Republic feels strangely untethered is that it seems to have been written toward the prospect of either a second Biden term or a Harris presidency. By the time it was published, in mid-February—when the princelings of Palo Alto were pledging mass fealty at the court of Mar-a-Lago, and Musk’s DOGE was setting about dismantling the federal government—a book-length argument for a closer relationship between Washington and Silicon Valley, and for a tech industry aligned with the broader project of American power, had missed its moment. By that point Mark Zuckerberg had shed his liberal skin and undergone a transfiguration into a kind of uncanny-valley MAGA-bro. In late May he announced that Meta would be partnering with the defense-tech company Anduril to “design, build, and field a range of integrated XR [Extended Reality] products that provide warfighters with enhanced perception and enable intuitive control of autonomous platforms on the battlefield.” The partnership between Meta and Anduril is itself evidence of a major cultural shift. The founder of Anduril (also a Tolkien reference, to a sword in The Lord of the Rings) is Palmer Luckey, best known as the inventor of the Oculus Rift VR headset. After Facebook bought Oculus, Luckey was an employee for a time; in 2017 the company fired him after he donated $10,000 to a pro-Trump group that paid for a billboard campaign deriding Hillary Clinton as “Too Big to Jail.” (Zuckerberg has recently expressed regret about the firing.) Announcing his company’s partnership with Meta, Luckey said, “My mission has long been to turn warfighters into technomancers, and the products we are building with Meta do just that.” One gadget Anduril is developing is called Eagle Eyes—a headset that provides “warfighters” with “360° threat awareness.” Luckey has invoked the video games Call of Duty and Halo. “The idea,” he said, “is to give warfighters superhuman vision, superhuman perception, superhuman hearing, and allow them to communicate with each other and large teams of autonomous systems.” Anduril is precisely the kind of project to which Karp, in The Technological Republic, argues engineers should be devoting their talents. “All these people who used to be tech bros are now defense tech bros,” as Noam Perski, Palantir’s international government lead, put it in a speech last December at a defense tech summit in Tel Aviv. Recently a venture capitalist friend told me that he knew several people in Silicon Valley who, just a few years ago, would have walked briskly in the opposite direction of anything remotely military-related, and who were now working on defense tech. When I agreed that there did seem to be something of a change in the ideological microclimates of the Bay Area, he said that there was no something of about it; it was a hard pivot, and an exceptionally fertile one for investors. See, for instance, Daniel Ek, the cofounder and CEO of Spotify, who led a recent €600 million investment into the German start-up Helsing. The company, cofounded by a video game developer and a former employee of Germany’s defense ministry, makes military drones and AI software for weapons systems and to improve battlefield decision-making. (Spotify subscribers may be interested to know that simply by streaming, say, Bob Dylan’s “Masters of War” or Black Sabbath’s “War Pigs,” they can now help to fund the international arms trade.) In June the US Army launched something called Executive Innovation Corps, which it described in a press release as “a new initiative designed to fuse cutting-edge tech expertise with military innovation.” Under the program, four high-level tech executives were commissioned into the army reserve as lieutenant colonels. The four new officers were Palantir’s CTO, Shyam Sankar; Meta’s CTO, Andrew Bosworth; OpenAI’s chief product officer, Kevin Weil; and Bob McGrew, an adviser at Thinking Machines Lab who was formerly OpenAI’s chief research officer. The tech execs were sworn in on Friday, June 13. On Monday, the next day of trading, Palantir shares closed at an all-time high. If you want to know what a technological republic might look like, forget Alexander Karp’s insipid book; consider what is being constructed around you, and how little it resembles any kind of republic at all. Consider the bad times, and who they are good for.

Title: More Upside For Uber Stock?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) is no longer seen as the underdog. After years of doubt regarding its ability to generate profit, the company has successfully silenced detractors and generously rewarded its shareholders. The stock has risen approximately 30% over the past year and an impressive 50% year-to-date—compared to the S&P500 index, which has increased by 17% over the last year and 10% year-to-date. The pressing question is: with Uber finally prevailing on Wall Street, is there still potential for growth? Uber’s most recent quarter revealed $12.65 billion in revenue, marking an 18% increase year-over-year, while Gross Bookings grew 17% to reach $46.8 billion. Trips surged 18% to 3.3 billion, and net income amounted to $1.35 billion. However, the notable story is centered on cash flow. Uber generated $2.48 billion in free cash flow in Q2 alone, lifting the total for the trailing 12 months to over $8.5 billion. This financial strength enabled management to confidently announce a $20 billion share buyback, nearly 10% of the company’s market cap—a significant turnaround from the era when Uber was known for its cash burn. For those seeking growth with lower volatility compared to individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative, having outperformed the S&P 500 and recorded returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Additionally, see – Alcoa Stock To Less Than $16? At current prices, Uber is trading at approximately 30x forward earnings and about 4x sales. This represents a premium over traditional transportation and logistics companies like FedEx (NYSE: FDX) at 13x or United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) at 16x, but is more reasonable than DoorDash stock (NASDAQ: DASH), which remains unprofitable and valued at 5.5x sales. Lyft (NASDAQ: LYFT), which is Uber’s closest competitor in the U.S., is priced lower at about 18x forward earnings but has not demonstrated the same scale or profitability. In essence, Uber is valued like a company that operates in two realms: more stable than a pure-play transport stock, yet not as richly valued as a high-growth tech platform. Investors are essentially wagering that Uber’s market position and cash flow can justify this mid-ground valuation. Despite its strong performance, Uber continues to face numerous challenges. Lyft remains a considerable competitor in ride-hailing, and DoorDash is competing aggressively in delivery. Logistics giants FedEx and UPS pose significant challenges in e-commerce. Moreover, Uber is making bold investments in its vision for the future: autonomous vehicles (AV) and AI-driven logistics. The company has invested substantially in partnerships with Waymo, Baidu, and others, and has even acquired a $300 million stake in Lucid to support its AV ambitions. In the long run, this could enhance profit margins by reducing the reliance on drivers. However, in the short term, investors are wary—autonomous technology is costly and its timelines are unpredictable. Uber’s stock has exhibited volatility during previous market downturns, at times performing worse than the S&P 500 index. Inflation Shock (2022) COVID-19 Pandemic (2020) The significant drawdown of 67% in 2022 indicates that a considerable decline from present levels is not extraordinary. This history of volatility, combined with a high stock price, leads to investor caution. See – Buy or Sell UBER Stock – for further details. With the stock up nearly 50% this year, Uber no longer appears as a deep value turnaround—it is now priced for performance. Analysts anticipate that bookings will approach $49 billion next quarter, with EBITDA guidance exceeding $2.2 billion. If Uber continues to deliver growth at this scale while repurchasing shares, the rally could gain momentum. The risk? At 30x forward earnings, Uber has less room for error. Any slowdown in global demand, stricter labor regulations, or setbacks in its autonomous strategies could lead to declines. However, Uber has decisively shed its former reputation and presents itself as a cash-rich, scalable platform. Investors are no longer just along for the ride with Uber—they are actively steering the gains. The substantial valuation of UBER stock might curtail its upside potential in the near to mid-term. As a different option, the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has surpassed its all-cap stock benchmark (comprising the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices), providing strong returns for investors. The reasoning? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks offers a flexible approach to capitalize on favorable market conditions while minimizing losses during downturns, further explained in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: I'm a Gen Xer who's been looking for full-time work for 18 months. After more than 1,000 apps, I'm trying to reinvent myself.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-x-unemployed-job-market-reinvention-2025-9
Time Published: 2025-09-04T09:20:02Z
Full Content:
This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Robert Poe, a 56-year-old former e-commerce director. His identity and former employment have been verified. This story has been edited for length and clarity. I started my career at IBM in digital marketing. My brother used to say to me, "You're always going to have a job." I've been through layoffs and worked at companies that shut down, but I never really had to look for a job in my role. My last position was as director of e-commerce at Badcock Home Furniture. I made $120,000 as my base salary. The company was eventually bought by a company that filed for bankruptcy. I lasted about six months in a new role that I landed. I wasn't worried about finding another job. But that was a year and a half ago. Since then, I've sent out over 1,000 résumés. The experience has been a shock. My wife and I sold our house and moved into an apartment. We've had to claim bankruptcy. I sold my car. We're partially living off of our sons' Social Security and my wife's job. Our daughter, who lives with us, helps pay rent. I pretty much have given up on finding e-commerce director roles. I guess I'm too old. I hear a lot of people saying, "Go start your own business," and "This is the time to reinvent yourself." So at 56, that's what I'm trying to do. I got my real estate license and tried that for a little. I was commuting about an hour each way to sit in an office with a bunch of 20-year-olds, doing exactly what I could have done at home. At some point, I realized that it's not realistic to work off strict commissions and commute to an office when nothing is coming in. So I tried out being an Amazon delivery worker for five months. I'm in shape and I work out. But at the end of the night, I couldn't walk up the stairs. It's a different world, especially when you're not used to being spoken to that way. It's a great side gig if you want some extra money, but it's not enough to live on. In addition to the gig work stuff, I've tried to be entrepreneurial. I launched a digital marketing startup called JBP Media Group with a partner who used to work with me. It will be another six months before any income comes in and I've had money come out of my pocket just to get it going. We've gotten a handful of clients, which is wonderful, and we have some employees offshore to help with some of the work. But when clients pay you $200 a month, you need a lot of those small clients. I've also published a book. I have two 20-year-old twin sons with special needs, and the book is about the expenses that hit special needs families. There are probably around $60,000 a year in expenses per kid, including transportation and insurance. Publishing the book has been a bucket list type of thing, and it's one that keeps your mind going. Starting a company has also kept me busy. Even if I'm working technically for free, it keeps my skills sharp. I keep trying everything on top of interviewing, thinking that something will hit. In the meantime, I have to keep going. I have been putting out about two to five résumés a day. I've met with tons of recruiters and have relationships with some of them. But a recruiter will ask to schedule a call and then never get back to me. I'm hearing more and more of that happening, where you get through an interview round and they put the job on hold or find someone internally. It's depressing. Everybody's saying, "LinkedIn's not the place to be anymore" or "You have to make your résumé different." It's incredibly confusing. It's like they flipped a switch overnight. The system's broken. For Gen X folks, it feels like if you're out of a job, then it's just too bad. Right now, I feel like a failure. But my message to other people is that something will work out, even if you have to go from a six-figure job to making $50,000 a year. For me now, I want to work for the Special Olympics, where I volunteer and coach paddleboarding. Even if it's a pay cut, I can start over, and we'll figure it out. Have you struggled to find a job? We want to hear from you. Reach out to the reporter via email at aaltchek@insider.com or through the secure messaging app Signal at aalt.19. Jump to

Title: ITS launches Single Stock ETF on shares of seven leading U.S. companies

September 04, 2025 02:05 ET | Source: ITS ITS ASTANA, Kazakhstan, Sept. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The international trading platform ITS on September 3 launched trading in Kazakhstan’s first Single Stock ETFs, based on shares of seven leading U.S. companies. The introduction of this new instrument expands opportunities for portfolio diversification and investment in high-value assets. Single Stock ETFs allow investors to acquire fractional parts of highly liquid shares, making securities with high prices accessible to a broad range of participants. In practice, this means purchasing individual shares through a fund at one hundredth or one thousandth of the full share price. At the first stage, ITS offers Single Stock ETFs on shares of seven companies: Amazon (AMZN/100), a leader in e-commerce and cloud technologies; Tesla (TSLA/100), a manufacturer of electric vehicles and sustainable energy solutions; Netflix (NFLX/100), the largest streaming service; AMD (AMD/100), a developer of processors and graphics cards; MicroStrategy (MSTR/100), a provider of business analytics and institutional investor in Bitcoin; Coinbase (COIN/100), a leading U.S. crypto exchange; and Freedom Holding (FRHC/10000), an international investment company originating from the CIS. Each Single Stock ETF mirrors the price of one share and enables investors to start investing in equities with just a few cents or dollars. For example, an investor can buy one hundredth of a Tesla share for $3.29, with the full share closing at $329.36 on September 2, or one ten-thousandth of a Freedom Holding share for $0.015, with the share closing at $174.27. “We are offering one of the most advanced products on the market. This not only expands opportunities for investors but also makes our platform more attractive to new participants. We will continue to broaden our range of exchange-traded instruments to provide investors in Kazakhstan with the widest possible opportunities for investment,” said Chingiz Kanapyanov, CEO of ITS. Internationally, single-stock instruments are particularly popular among short-term traders who profit from volatility and among those seeking targeted diversification without purchasing full shares. On ITS, investments in single-stock ETFs provide a simple and transparent way to start investing. Trading is conducted in U.S. dollars, with income from these operations exempt from income tax in Kazakhstan. There are no management fees, as the fund is registered under the jurisdiction of the Astana International Financial Centre and listed on AIX. Investors are reminded that ETFs on individual shares carry market risks. Their value may rise or fall depending on the performance of the underlying share. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Investors are advised to review the fund documents and carefully assess potential risks before investing. About ITSITS is an international liquidity hub. Central to ITS's business model are the principles of best execution and smart order routing technology. These principles enable investors to execute securities transactions at the best prices available on the global financial market, regardless of the transaction volume. This technology ensures that the liquidity for foreign securities on ITS matches that of leading international platforms where these securities are traded. ITS Central Securities Depository Limited, the central depository for ITS, offers depository services for the storage and settlement of securities. The depository has received Qualified Intermediary with primary withholding responsibility (WQI) status from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Operating a clearing house that acts as a Central Counterparty, ITS assumes the counterparty role for all obligations of clearing participants and manages the clearing process for transactions on the ITS trading platform. ITS also calculates its own indexes: the ITS World index (ITSW) and the ITS Shariah index (ITSS). Trading of the first ETF in Central Asia and Caucasus, pegged to the performance of ITS’s own index – ITS World (ticker: ITSW), began on ITS in November 2024, providing a wide range of investors with a convenient and balanced instrument for investing and trading with a low entry threshold. In January 2025, the ETF lineup expanded with the introduction of a fund based on the ITS Shariah Index. ITS's direct clients include professional securities market participants from Kazakhstan and other countries, such as financial intermediaries who are accredited and directly registered at the AIFC. Investors, both private individuals and legal entities, access trading through these financial intermediaries, such as brokers and banks.

Title: ROSEN, HIGHLY RANKED INVESTOR COUNSEL, Encourages Novo Nordisk A/S Investors to Secure Counsel Before Important Deadline in Securities Class Action - NVO

September 03, 2025 20:09 ET | Source: The Rosen Law Firm PA The Rosen Law Firm PA NEW YORK, Sept. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: NVO) between May 7, 2025 and July 28, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), of the important September 30, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline. SO WHAT: If you purchased Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than September 30, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo Nordisk’s growth potential. Notably, Novo Nordisk’s asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood that such patients would switch to Novo Nordisk’s branded alternatives. Further, defendants greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise, Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Novo Nordisk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=34168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

The Tomb Raider TV series based on Crystal Dynamics' iteration of Lara Croft from Crystal Dynamics and Amazon MGM Studios will officially start filming in 2026, with Sophie Turner confirmed to play Lara Croft, per a report from Variety. This is the same series that was announced in May 2024 with award-winning Phoebe Waller-Bridge signed on as a writer, executive producer, and showrunner for the series, which will also be part of a completely interconnected Tomb Raider universe that Amazon is creating between Crystal Dynamics games, TV series, and films. "I’m so excited to announce the formidable Sophie Turner as our Lara alongside this phenomenal creative team," Waller-Bridge said on signing Turner. "It’s not very often you get to make a show of this scale with a character you grew up loving. Everyone on board is wildly passionate about Lara and are all as outrageous, brave, and hilarious as she is. Get your artifacts out… Croft is coming…" For Turner's part, she added that she is "thrilled beyond measure" to be stepping into the role. "She’s such an iconic character, who means so much to so many – and I am giving everything I’ve got. They’re massive shoes to fill, following in the steps of Angelina and Alicia with their powerhouse performances, but with Phoebe at the helm, we (and Lara) are all in very safe hands. I can’t wait for you all to see what we have cooking." It's good to have a positive update on the TV series, but the most recent news out of Crystal Dynamics is much less positive. The studio confirmed layoffs last week, and even though it stipulated that work on the next Tomb Raider game was "unaffected," it's difficult to take statements like that at face value, especially when layoffs impact the morale of everyone at any developer, no matter what team was impacted by them.

Title: Stop Using Brave Browser

Seriously. The Brave web browser has carved out a niche over the past few years as an alternative to Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and other mainstream web browsers. Some of that has come from its marketing as a privacy-preserving web browser, and it has also been repeatedly evangelized by cryptocurrency enthusiasts. If someone recommends Brave to you, you should ignore them, because they are wrong. Brave Browser is a mess of a software project, and the company building it is even worse. Brave Software, the company behind the browser of the same name, was founded by Brendan Eich. He's best known as the creator of JavaScript from his days at Netscape Communications, and he was later the co-founder of Mozilla. He remained at Mozilla Foundation and its for-profit segment, Mozilla Corporation, well into the 2000s. In 2014, he was appointed as CEO of Mozilla Corporation, which immediately caused backlash from at least a few people inside Mozilla and many people outside the organization. Why was appointing Eich as CEO so controversial? It's because he donated $1,000 in support of California's Proposition 8 in 2008, which was a proposed amendment to California's state constitution to ban same-sex marriage. Eich wrote a blog post defending himself in 2012, when the donation was initially discovered, where did not apologize and denied the donation made him a bigot: In other words, because he silently donated to causes seeking to strip rights from minority groups instead of directly harassing them, the outrage was unjustified. Okay, Brendan. The appointment was a full-on PR disaster for Mozilla, and as an example of how far-reaching the criticism became, OkCupid started showing a popup to its Firefox visitors about the donations and suggested switching to another browser. Brendan Eich quit after 11 days as CEO. He then went on to create Brave Software and obtain $2.5 million in early funding by late 2015, then another $4.5 million by mid-2016. Here's a bonus fun fact: one of those early investors was Founders Fund, which is operated by billionaire Peter Thiel. He's a regular campaign donor to far-right political candidates, and said in an essay that "I no longer think that freedom and democracy are compatible." He also keeps funding libertarian “seasteading” ships designed to function as independent cities in international waters (think BioShock), all of which have failed miserably. Targeted advertisements can be incredibly damaging to online privacy, because most of them rely on ad networks that purchase or quietly monitor your online behavior to serve personalized ads. That has given ad blockers a dual mandate — they make the web less annoying (at the expense of web revenue), and protect your privacy online. The advertising industry is fighting back with increasingly-complicated detection methods for ad blockers, but as of right now, it’s still a cat-and-mouse battle. From the start, Brave Software had a different idea than just blocking ads outright. The initial version of Brave allowed some advertisements hosted by the site itself (e.g. pre-roll ads on YouTube), and had a long-term goal of building its own advertising network. Here’s what Brendan Eich said in 2016: Brave’s plan was to remove most of the third-party advertisements in a page, create its own ad units based on data collected by the web browser itself, and then split the revenue with publishers. Brave said originally that it was aiming for at least 55% of the money to go to the publisher, with the eventual goal of giving 70% of the revenue to the publisher. The web browser user would also receive a cut. The Newspaper Association of America responded with cease-and-desist letter to Brave Software, calling the ad replacements “blatantly illegal” and insisting it amounted to “republication” of copyrighted content. Brad Flora, who was previously Director of Business Development at Brave, said this never ended up happening: Brave started a 1,000-user trial of its advertising network in 2018. The program rewarded Brave users with Basic Attention Tokens (BAT), based on how long they spent viewing ads and content, which would then be kept in a digital wallet or given to publishers as a sort of tipping system. That system hasn’t significantly changed since then, but some of the ad formats are different now. Brave’s website explains that the ads are served in search results in Brave Search, the New Tab page, the Brave News newsfeed, and notifications. BAT is a cryptocurrency. That means its value is highly volatile, and the initial coin offering (ICO) generated another $35 million for Brave in 2017. Brave users can’t redeem BAT for actual (fiat) money without first transferring it to another cryptocurrency wallet, and publishers/content creators are also paid in BAT. There’s an option for publishers/content creators to automatically convert the tokens earned into real money, but again, the value of BAT changes constantly. Brave’s replacement for ads doesn’t reward users in a meaningful amount (reports in 2021 were around 2-6 BAT per month, which is $0.40-$1.25 on the current exchange rate), and requires publishers and content creators to jump through additional hoops to reclaim lost revenue from ad blockers. If the goal was to create a more fair payment system for content on the web, it has largely failed. It has generated a lot of revenue for Brave, though, so that’s nice. Brave’s BAT was built around the cryptocurrency ecosystem (it’s an ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain), which helped it attract users from the crowd of crypto enthusiasts. Brave Software continued to bake in more crypto-adjacent functionality over time, billing itself as the ultimate browser for crypto and web 3.0. A full crypto wallet was added in 2021, replacing the original wallet built around BAT. It supports live and historical market graphs, sending and receiving crypto, managing NFTs, and interacting with decentralized apps (Dapps). The past year has revealed how most of this ecosystem was built on overvalued startups, hype, and outright scams. Here are some of the companies, individuals, and organizations that Brave has worked with in the crypto industry: Brave was also caught up in a privacy scandal in 2020, when it was revealed that the browser was adding affiliate codes to some URLs typed into the address bar. For example, typing in “binance.us” would add Brave’s affiliate link to the end, allowing Brave Software to collect revenue from signups or purchases. An official blog post called that “a mistake,” and the functionality was later turned off. That should have been enough to swear off Brave as a privacy-centric browser forever, considering the entire point of affiliate links is to collect data about the user and traffic source. For example, when you click an Amazon affiliate link in a web article, the publisher can see the exact products you purchase in the timeframe the tracking cookie remains active (which is currently 24 hours). Brave's defenders will point to the revenue sources for other browsers as something similar to Brave's URL replacement experiment. Vivaldi adds sponsored bookmarks on the new tab page, for example. However, I’m not aware of another browser ever rewriting what the user types in the address bar. Ultimately, Brave Browser is the apparatus of an advertising company, a bloated and complicated experience for the average user, and the pet project of the person kicked out of Mozilla for continuing to defend harmful political donations. If you want a privacy-focused web browser, use Firefox or Vivaldi. If you want to support your favorite content creators and publishers, turn on advertisements or support them through the methods they already support (Patreon, Ko-Fi, and so on). Brave Browser is irredeemable, and you should not use it under any circumstances. Tech companies wanted "AI" to represent a bright future. Now it represents every annoyance in our daily lives. Servo was supposed to be Firefox's future. Now it's an independent effort to make a fast and secure web browser engine. FireWire, the Newton PDA, and other technologies from Apple's past are still hiding in macOS. You can download videos and audio as MP3, M4A, OGG, or other audio formats with the yt-dlp command line tool. An inside look at the technology around us.

GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links. The TV series is moving ahead and will begin filming in early 2026. By Eddie Makuch on September 3, 2025 at 10:37AM PDT Amazon MGM Studios has announced that Game of Thrones star Sophie Turner will indeed play the role of Lara Croft in an upcoming Tomb Raider series. A previous report said Turner had dropped out and the show itself was "dead." Variety and others confirmed the news today that the Tomb Raider TV series is moving ahead. Additionally, Amazon MGM Studios confirmed that filming will begin in January 2026. As announced previously, Fleabag's Phoebe Waller-Bridge is the creator, writer, and executive producer for the series, with Chad Hodge (Single All the Way, Wayward Pines) joining as co-showrunner and executive producer. Shogun director Jonathan van Tulleken has also come aboard as executive producer and director. Waller-Bridge said in a statement, "Everyone on board is wildly passionate about Lara and are all as outrageous, brave, and hilarious as she is. Get your artifacts out ... Croft is coming ..." Before Turner, the actors Angelina Jolie and Alicia Vikander brought the character Lara Croft to life in film. For her part, Turner said she is "thrilled beyond measure" to play Croft. "They're massive shoes to fill, following in the steps of Angelina and Alicia with their powerhouse performances, but with Phoebe at the helm, we (and Lara) are all in very safe hands. I can't wait for you all to see what we have cooking," she said. The Tomb Raider series for Prime Video was greenlit under the leadership of Amazon MGM Studios boss Jennifer Salke, but Salke exited the company earlier this year amid reports of a power struggle. Salke was said to be personally overseeing the Tomb Raider series. Matthew Belloni of Puck reported in March that the Tomb Raider series went through multiple writers rooms, with "tens of millions" spent on development costs. In addition to producing the TV series, Amazon is publishing the next Tomb Raider game from Crystal Dynamics--the studio recently underwent layoffs after the cancellation of Perfect Dark. At the time, the studio said Tomb Raider was unaffected. This new game was never expected to be connected to the TV series. Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, Sept. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) and reminds investors of the September 30, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Novo’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the Novo Nordisk class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/NVO or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

US stocks are pricier than ever before by some measures, raising fears that the market could be headed for a crash. By John Power The US stock market has been having a stellar run – so much so that many investors fear it is overpriced. Since early 2023, the benchmark S&P 500 has risen more than 60 percent, hitting all-time highs despite headwinds ranging from US President Donald Trump’s tariffs to concerns that artificial intelligence (AI) may be overhyped. For investors, the explosive growth has come at a cost: by some measures, US stocks are pricier than ever before. An investor buying into the S&P 500 last week had to fork over $3.25 for every $1 in revenues generated by its 500 constituent firms, according to GuruFocus, the highest price-to-sales ratio on record. While US stocks look less expensive when compared against forecasts of company profits, the benchmark index is still trading at more than 22 times forward earnings, well above the historical average. In a poll by Bank of America last month, nine out of 10 fund managers surveyed said they viewed US stocks as overvalued. The market’s sky-high valuation has led some analysts to draw comparisons to the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s. Fueled by excitement over the rise of the Internet, shares on the tech-heavy Nasdaq soared about 80 percent before giving up almost all of their gains between 2000 and 2022. “Nobody knows what a stock is really worth because its value is based on future earnings,” said James Angel, an expert on financial markets at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business. “Only God knows what the future holds. Because of this uncertainty, stock prices always have been and always will be very volatile. A small change in the market’s consensus estimate of future performance can lead to a large and sudden change in value.” Even as investors are increasingly expressing qualms about the price of US stocks, they are not staying away. The S&P 500 set five all-time highs in August alone and is up about 10 percent so far this year, putting it on track to comfortably beat its average annual return in 2025. Analysts have offered a range of explanations for the market’s untrammelled ascent, including the remarkable profitability of the “Magnificent Seven” – Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, Meta, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta and Alphabet – and the as yet untapped potential of AI. “Earnings at US companies have held up surprisingly well, and continue to grow,” said Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University. “AI may have driven up the value of a couple of the big tech companies and companies that build AI architecture, but it cannot explain the overall rise in the rest of the market,” Damodaran added. While the market’s heavy reliance on the “Magnificent Seven” has been a source of concern for some investors – they make up about one-third of the S&P 500 – such concentration is not unprecedented. Robert E Wright, lecturer in the Department of Economics at Central Michigan University, said the dynamic of a few companies dominating the market can be found as far back as the late 18th century. “Banks were the most important technology of the time, followed by property insurers,” Wright said. “Later came textile mills and other manufacturers, then railroads and, eventually, automobiles. We cannot get too precise due to differences in the way capitalisation was measured, but the pattern seems the same: innovations leads to success, which leads to investment and more success until commodification. Then innovation in a different field occurs and the cycle begins anew.” More prosaic explanations have been offered for the market’s stellar performance, too, such as the shift away from actively managed mutual funds toward passive index funds in recent decades. The increasing popularity of funds that track the S&P500 and other broad measures of the market means that more people are buying stocks regardless of economic conditions than in the past. But a bigger factor than any economic metric could be human psychology. Stephen Thomas, a professor at Bayes Business School in the UK, said that herd behaviour provides a better explanation for stock market moves than the performance of businesses or the state of the economy. “The only tried and tested investment strategy with both international, cross asset and historical support is ‘momentum,’ ie, what goes up carries on rising until it doesn’t,” Thomas said. “Fund managers can’t afford to get left behind their competitors,” Thomas added. “And these are using momentum either explicitly or quietly. So they are behaving rationally in terms of firm behaviour, and indeed, in terms of our knowledge of investment strategies.” There is no way to accurately predict a stock market crash. But steep falls are a regular feature of the market. Since the end of World War II, the market has dropped 20 percent or more from its peak 15 times. While the market rebounded to its peak within a few years in most of those cases, the worst crashes kept investors in the red for much longer. Investors hit by the double whammy of the dot-com bust and the 2008-09 global financial crisis did not fully recover their losses for nearly 13 years. But if there is one thing that financial experts are practically unanimous on, it is that attempting to time the market is a fool’s errand. “One reason that waiting to see a trend is so dangerous is that some of the best up days in the market follow soon after the worst down days,” Angel said. “The best year in US stock market history was in 1933, at the depth of the Great Depression. The market had gone down so much, that when it became clear that a recovery was under way, the market rallied rapidly.” Burton Malkiel, a professor of economics at Princeton University, said investors who feel they are at the limits of their risk tolerance are better off shifting the balance of their portfolios towards lower-risk assets, such as bonds and holding onto more cash than trying to time the market. “You will invariably get it wrong and in the long run the US will eventually straighten things out,” he said.

This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Welcome to The Protocol, CoinDesk's weekly wrap of the most important stories in cryptocurrency tech development. I’m Margaux Nijkerk, a reporter at CoinDesk. In this issue: ALPENGLOW APPROVED BY SOLANA COMMUNITY: The Solana community voted overwhelmingly in favor of the long-awaited Alpenglow upgrade, bringing the network one step closer to the most significant technical transformation in its history. According to Solana Status on X, 98.27% of SOL stakers that voted approved the proposal, with only 1.05% voting against and 0.36% abstaining. In total, 52% of the network’s stakers participated in the vote. The upgrade introduces a new consensus protocol designed to dramatically improve transaction finality and network efficiency. At the heart of Alpenglow are two new components, Votor and Rotor, which will replace Solana’s existing systems, Proof-of-History and TowerBFT. Currently, Proof-of-History timestamps transactions to preserve their order without slowing the network, while TowerBFT handles the voting process among validators. Alpenglow will overhaul both systems. Votor will slash transaction finality times from over 12 seconds to around 150 milliseconds, delivering near-instant confirmation for users. Rotor, scheduled for a later rollout, will minimize data transfers between validators, a crucial improvement for high-demand applications such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain-based gaming.With approval secured, Solana is now preparing to implement the upgrade, a milestone expected to unlock greater speed, resilience, and scalability across its ecosystem. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more. EF TO SELL 10K ETH OVER NEXT FEW WEEKS: The Ethereum Foundation (EF) shared in a post on X on Tuesday that it plans to sell 10,000 ETH through centralized exchanges over the next several weeks to support work toward research & development, ecosystem grants and related donations. According to CoinMarketCap, the ETH will amount to roughly $43 million at Tuesday’s prices. “Conversions will take place over multiple smaller orders, rather than as a single large transaction,” the EF wrote in the post on X.The news follows the EF’s rollout of a new treasury policy in June that caps annual operational spending (opex) at 15%, establishes a multiyear reserve buffer and sets a gradual pace toward even leaner spending long-term. The foundation sold an additional 10,000 ETH to SharpLink Gaming in July, making the online casino marketing firm the first publicly traded company to buy ETH from a key firm in the network’s ecosystem. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more. A CHAT WITH BRUCE LIU ON OP_CAT: Without OP_CAT, Bruce Liu says Bitcoin is as "useful as a jumbo jet without wings" capable of much more than it’s allowed to do, but stuck on the ground while Ethereum and Solana soar. Liu, the founder of OPCAT_Labs, says a single opcode, OP_CAT, could transform bitcoin from static digital gold into programmable money that rivals other layer-1 chains. OP_CAT is a long-disabled opcode in Bitcoin’s code that, if re-enabled, would allow developers to concatenate data in scripts and unlock new possibilities, from vaults and covenants to decentralized exchanges and zero-knowledge proofs. The Bitcoin blockchain, if OP_CAT was re-enabled, would be as programmable as Ethereum or Solana, said Liu. "OP_CAT is not new code. It was never deleted, just commented out and disabled. We are not adding my opcode or somebody else’s. It’s Satoshi’s,” Liu told CoinDesk during an interview on the sidelines of BTC Asia in Hong Kong. — Sam Reynolds Read more. HOLESKY SUNSET IS COMING AFTER FUSAKA UPGRADE: A fresh slate of Ethereum testnets is replacing Holesky, the once-massive staging ground now set for shutdown after two years of service.The wind-down will occur two weeks after the Fusaka upgrade is finalized later this year, at which point client and infrastructure teams will cease providing support. Fusaka is set to make Ethereum rollups cheaper and faster by spreading out the “data storage work” more evenly across validators. Holesky went live in 2023 to stress-test Ethereum’s proof-of-stake machinery at scale. It quickly became the largest public testnet, providing thousands of validators with a platform to trial upgrades before they were deployed on the mainnet. Major milestones, such as the Dencun and Pectra upgrades — which lowered transaction costs and upgraded validator efficiency, among other features — were run through Holesky first. However, cracks began to appear as the network aged. Holesky encountered “inactivity leaks” after Pectra’s activation in early 2025, a term referring to validators going offline in large numbers, which created a significant backlog for those attempting to exit. The result was months-long queues that made it impractical to test the full validator lifecycle. For developers needing fast feedback loops, Holesky had become more of a roadblock than a tool. — Shaurya Malwa Read more.

September 03, 2025 12:00 ET | Source: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP LOS ANGELES, Sept. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming September 30, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NVO) securities between May 7, 2025, to July 28, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR NOVO NORDISK INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On July 29, 2025, Novo Nordisk cut its previously issued fiscal year 2025 guidance, lowering sales growth from 13-21% to 8-14%, and operating profit from 16-24% to 10-16%. The Company cited lower growth expectations for both Ozempic and Wegovy on the back of a slowdown in market expansion, competition, and the alleged continued use of compounded GLP-1s. On this news, Novo Nordisk’s stock price fell $15.06, or 21.8%, to close at $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, thereby injuring investors. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Novo Nordisk repeatedly ignored and minimized the significance of the personalization exception for GLP-1 compounding, greatly overestimated its ability to capture patients coming off of compounded treatments, and was ultimately ill equipped to capitalize upon the purported significant unmet patient population; and (2) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Novo Nordisk securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than September 30, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Full Content:
Ondo Finance launched Wednesday its tokenized equity platform dubbed Ondo Global Markets, offering non-U.S. investors access to more than 100 U.S. stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on-chain. The tokenized equities, first announced in February, has gone live on Ethereum and are backed by securities held at U.S.-registered broker-dealers, the firm said. The offering includes crypto token versions of Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA) and the QQQ ETF among others. Investors in Asia-Pacific, Europe, Africa and Latin America can mint and redeem shares around the clock during trading days, with access to underlying exchange liquidity. The service is not available for U.S. users. The tokens are designed to move freely between wallets, exchanges and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. The firm has also partnered with BitGo, Ledger, Chainlink and other infrastructure providers to support the rollout. Ondo said it plans to expand the selection to more than 1,000 assets by the end of this year and bring the service to Solana SOL$198.37 and BNB Chain (BNB) with LayerZero-powered interoperability. "We saw stablecoins export the U.S. dollar by bringing it on-chain," said Nathan Allman, founder and CEO of Ondo Finance. "Now, Ondo Global Markets is doing the same thing for U.S. securities." The rollout comes as tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) gains momentum across crypto markets, with projects bringing treasuries, private credit and now equities onto blockchains pursuing broader access and liquidity. A list of trading platforms and exchanges have introduced tokenized equities in the past few months, including by Robinhood, Gemini, Kraken and several other crypto exchanges. Coinbase and eToro also shared plans to offer stock trading in token form. However, some offerings drew backlash over potential issues such as limited shareholder rights and fragmented regulations.

Title: Watch for this signal in Nvidia stock to capitalize on spring-loaded gains ahead
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-stock-price-trading-strategy-buy-signal-short-ratio-nvda-2025-9
Time Published: 2025-09-03T12:40:55Z
Full Content:
It's been a volatile year for shares of Nvidia, with the stock plunging 31% to start the year before rallying 84% since April lows. Sam Pierson, the director of research at S3 Partners, has found a fairly reliable way to capitalize on that volatility. Or rather, a metric to watch within the stock that serves as a signal for outsized gains ahead. It's called the long-to-short ratio, and it's calculated by taking a stock's active long interest and dividing it by short interest. In new research published Tuesday, Pierson found that following notable increases in the ratio, Nvidia's share price has typically surged over the following few months. More specifically, when the ratio climbs to 1.5 standard deviations above its six-month moving average, it's gone up 11% over the following month. That's nearly double the usual average monthly gain of 6%. For the subsequent three-month period, following the signal, Nvidia has returned 28%, versus 19% normally. The stock saw gains 86% of the time in the month following a reading above the 1.5-standard-deviation threshold. When the stock saw rare losses during those periods, it only fell by an average of 1%. These findings led Pierson to call the ratio a "powerful short-to-intermediate-term tool," as it seems to lose its ability to predict returns beyond six months. Here's a chart showing the returns. Periods when the long-to-short ratio is at least at 1.5 are shaded orange. Nvidia's stock returns are shown in the black line. Right now, the measure is below the 1.5 standard-deviation threshold as the ratio of long positions to short positions has fallen in recent weeks to 15.4. The model has continued to be effective so far this year. "In 2025 year-to-date, the LTS extreme signal has remained effective: across 46 threshold days, NVDA delivered an average +7% forward 1M return with a 76% win rate, compared with just +5% on all days, with a 54% win rate," Pierson wrote. He added: "In 2025, periods of Long-to-Short crowding in NVIDIA have coincided with roughly double the baseline 1-month forward return." Nvidia stock has had a rough 10 days after it warned of slowing growth ahead during its quarterly earnings call last week. Since August 26, the stock is down 6.5%. The stock remains a favorite among investors. Brokerage platform Interactive Brokers said Nvidia was the most bought stock over the last five trading days with 234,628 buy orders. "Our customers are certainly a faithful bunch. #1 NVDA brought immense success to many of them, and they are clearly not willing to abandon that name even if some poorly received earnings get in the way," said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, in an email. He continued: "It was not only the most active stock on our platform, displacing #3 PLTR, last week's surprise leader, but also representing just under 1/3 of all the net purchasing activity among the stocks in this table."

September 03, 2025 08:21 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, Sept. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), Altimmune, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALT), SelectQuote, Inc. (NYSE:SLQT) and Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:SPPI). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) Class Period: May 7, 2025, to July 28, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: September 30, 2025 According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day. For more information on the Novo lawsuit go to: https://bespc.com/cases/NVO Altimmune, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALT) Class Period: August 10, 2023 to June 25, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 6, 2025 According to the complaint, on June 26, 2025, Altimmune published a press release announcing topline results from the IMPACT Phase 2b MASH trial of Pemvidutide in the Treatment of MASH. While defendants had continuously provided inflated expectations ahead of these results, the analysis showed a pointed failure by the Company to achieve statistical significance in its analysis of the fibrosis reduction primary endpoint in its IMPACT Phase 2b MASH trial. In particular, while a positive trend in fibrosis improvement was observed, statistical significance was not met due to a higher-than-expected placebo response. When questioned about this concerning miss, defendants answered indifferently, attributing this result to the Phase 2 nature of the trial and stated that Altimmune was hoping for better results following the Phase 3 trial. Following this news, the price of Altimmune’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $7.71 per share on June 25, 2025, Altimmune’s stock price fell to $3.61 per share on June 26, 2025, a decline of 53.2% in the span of just a single day. For more information on the Altimmune lawsuit go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ALT SelectQuote, Inc. (NYSE:SLQT) Class Period: September 9, 2020 to May 1, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: October 10, 2025 On May 1, 2025, at approximately noon eastern standard time, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) filed a False Claims Act complaint against SelectQuote, alleging, “[f]rom 2016 through at least 2021”1 SelectQuote received “tens of millions of dollars” in “illegal kickbacks” from health insurance companies in exchange for steering Medicare beneficiaries to enroll in the insurers’ plans. Further, SelectQuote, in exchange for kickbacks, engaged in a conspiracy with major insurers to illegally discriminate against beneficiaries deemed to be less profitable, including those with disabilities. The DOJ concluded that SelectQuote made materially false claims by stating it offers “unbiased coverage comparisons” when in fact it “repeatedly directed Medicare beneficiaries to the plans offered by insurers that paid them the most money, regardless of the quality or suitability of the insurers’ plans.” On this news, SelectQuote’s stock price fell $0.61, or 19.2%, to close at $2.56 per share on May 1, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose: (1) that the Company was directing Medicare beneficiaries to the plans offered by insurers that best compensated SelectQuote, regardless of the quality or suitability of the insurers’ plans; (2) that SelectQuote did not provided unbiased comparison shopping for Medicare Advantage insurance plans; (3) that SelectQuote received illegal kickbacks to steer Medicare beneficiaries to certain insurers and limit enrollment in competitors’ plans; (4) that as a result, SelectQuote had not complied with applicable laws, regulations, and contractual provisions; (5) that SelectQuote was vulnerable to regulatory and legal sanctions as a result of its conduct, including claims that it had violated the False Claims Act; and (6) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

Dogecoin’s backers moved quickly this week to create what they call the first official DOGE treasury, pushing $175 million into a vehicle aimed at buying Dogecoin and bringing more institutional muscle to the token. According to reports, the fund was set up through a private placement that issued 175,000,420 pre-funded warrants priced at $1 each, a structure meant to provide immediate capital for purchases. The plan has drawn big-name crypto firms and traditional investors. Based on reports, the financing raised $175 million in total. Over 80 institutional and crypto-native investors are said to have taken part, with names like Pantera, GSR, FalconX, Mythos and Borderless listed among participants. The offering is expected to close around September 4, 2025, subject to regulatory approvals and the formal listing of the new warrants.

What a world. pic.twitter.com/xqHYHXixYu — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) September 2, 2025 The company tied to the move is CleanCore Solutions, which will house the program alongside a commercial arm called House of Doge. Markets reacted fast. CleanCore’s share price fell about 60%, sliding from roughly $6.85 to near $2.69 after the arrangement was disclosed. That drop reflected investor worries about dilution, execution risk, and how public markets would view a corporate play centered on a meme token. Trading in the warrants and the conversion mechanics were flagged by analysts as key details investors will watch closely. Reports have disclosed a noteworthy lineup of people and advisors. Alex Spiro, who has been publicly identified as an attorney for Elon Musk, is named to serve as Chairman of the Board at CleanCore. Timothy Stebbing, Director at the Dogecoin Foundation and CTO of House of Doge, will join CleanCore’s board, while Marco Margiotta, CEO of House of Doge, is slated to act as CleanCore’s Chief Investment Officer. The crypto-ETF firm 21Shares will advise on governance, capital allocation and strategy for the treasury. Those moves were described in filings and press releases tied to the deal. The effort aims to move Dogecoin from pure meme status toward something that can be held in a corporate reserve and used for payments, tokenization efforts, and other financial uses. According to statements circulating with the financing documents, the treasury would buy DOGE with the raised capital and could help create institutional-grade products around the token. Details about custody, trading rules and how purchases will be executed were not fully spelled out in initial disclosures.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto.

A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects.

Title: Forbes Daily: Alphabet Shares Soar As Google Scores A Victory In Court

ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. AI is king on Forbes’ latest Cloud 100 list, which features the top companies in cloud computing. It’s not surprising that AI juggernauts OpenAI and Anthropic took the No. 1 and 2 spots, respectively, but another firm that made a blockbuster debut at No. 8 is Anysphere, the company behind popular generative coding tool Cursor. One notable absence is Scale AI, which ranked No. 7 last year, but announced in June that Meta was buying nearly half of the company for $14 billion. With Scale’s high-profile founder and CEO Alexandr Wang now leading Meta’s AI lab, it’s unclear how strong its business will be going forward. Google will not have to sell its Chrome browser to remedy its search market monopoly, a federal judge ruled Tuesday, but the tech giant will have to share some of its data with competitors, among other legal concessions. Google makes most of its revenue from its ad business, and shares of its parent company Alphabet surged nearly 8% in after-hours trading Tuesday. A federal appeals court ruled that President Donald Trump’s administration cannot fast-track the deportation of Venezuelan migrants from the country using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which has previously only been used during wartime. The court dismissed the argument that the migrants were part of an “invasion,” and if the Trump Administration challenges the ruling, it’s likely to bring the issue to the Supreme Court again. Shares of TSMC, the world’s largest semiconductor firm by market value, fell sharply after the U.S. revoked a waiver allowing the company to ship to its China-based facilities freely. The move could interrupt the company’s production, as the Trump Administration has tightened export controls on semiconductor and chip shipments to China this year. When Meta announced its Scale AI deal, Mercor, a smaller rival that recruits PhDs and other experts to train models for AI labs, saw an immediate opening. But the buzzy startup, debuting on Forbes’ Cloud 100 list, is in transition: Its original conception was to modernize recruiting with AI, but along the way, it found its sweet spot in recruiting people to train AI models. Seattle-based Interlune faces daunting hurdles in its quest to develop robots to harvest a valuable form of helium on the moon. But the firm, which has received $18 million in funding, may be among the startups with the best shot of building a space mining business in the near term —partly because it has ways to monetize its technology in the meantime. President Donald Trump pledged to send the National Guard to Chicago and Baltimore, though he didn’t clarify when it could happen. Trump said he would move forward with the deployment with or without Illinois Governor JB Pritzker’s approval, even as a judge ruled Tuesday that the president’s Los Angeles takeover violated federal law. The FAA’s plan to address a long-standing air traffic controller shortage has hit a snag: There aren’t enough instructors to train thousands of new recruits. The agency expects to hire 8,900 new air traffic controllers by 2028, but because of factors like attrition, retirements and program washouts, this will only result in 1,000 more certified controllers, according to FAA documents. With more than 80,000 AI-powered cameras across the U.S., Flock Safety has become one of cops’ go-to surveillance tools and a $7.5 billion business since its founding in 2017. The cameras record not just the license plate numbers of the cars that pass them, but their make and distinctive features—broken windows, dings, bumper stickers. CEO and cofoun­der Garrett Langley estimates they help solve 1 million crimes a year. Soon, Flock’s cameras will take to the skies mounted on its own “made in Amer­ica” drones. Produced at a factory the company opened earlier this year near its Atlanta offices, they’ll add a new dimension to Flock’s business and aim to challenge Chinese drone giant DJI’s dominance. Langley has a prediction: In less than 10 years, Flock’s cameras, airborne and fixed, will eradicate almost all crime in the U.S. (He acknowledges that programs to boost youth employment and cut recidivism will help.) Not everyone shares law enforcement’s enthusiasm for Flock’s rapid expansion. Privacy advocates say the company is building an unprecedented mass-surveillance dystopia. But Langley’s most pressing concern by far is the $2.1 billion (2024 revenue) police tech giant Axon Enterprise. Flock had a burgeoning partnership with the publicly traded ($59 billion market cap) Taser creator, but in January, Axon CEO and billionaire cofounder Rick Smith killed their deal, accusing Flock of overcharging and trying to lock customers into its products. In April, Axon debuted its own stand-alone license plate reader cameras along with a shot-across-the-bow first customer: the Atlanta Police Department, a current Flock user. Langley says Axon is a monopolist abusing its market position to choke out competition. “I plan to go take them out,” he says. “We will deliver a better product at a lower price.” WHY IT MATTERS The goal of preventing all crime in the U.S. sounds like a pipe dream from another AI-can-solve-everything tech bro, but Langley, in the face of a wave of opposition from privacy advocates and Flock’s archrival Axon, is a true believer. “I’ve talked to plenty of activists who think crime is just the cost of modern society. I disagree,” Langley says. “I think we can have a crime-free city and civil liberties … We can have it all.” MORE Flock’s AI Cameras Are Watching Cars All Over America. They’re About To Get A Lot More Powerful. The “No Tax on Tips” policy enacted through President Donald Trump’s signature spending bill is reportedly set to impact millions of workers in industries like hospitality, food and beverage and personal services. The Trump Administration has yet to confirm the exact list of professions: Up to $25,000: The amount the provision allows certain workers to deduct in tip income from their federal taxes Around 4 million: The number of Americans who worked in tipped occupations as of 2023, according to Yale University’s Budget Lab $40 billion: The approximate cost of the program to the government through 2028, according to an estimate by the Congressional Budget Office Many workers looking to make a career change feel stymied by financial concerns, but you can start working toward your desired career on the side without quitting your current gig.

Already have an account?Sign in Last month, Kith made a statement by literally stopping New York traffic to host a runway show titled “INSTITUTION.” Now, with the opening of Kith IVY, it’s going beyond mere New York institution. A private padel club housed on the rooftop of a West Village residential commercial building, Kith Ivy is also host to New York’s first-ever Erewhon. Yes, streetwear mega-retailer Kith managed to coax Erewhon out of its LA home for the first time, delivering its pricey, organic, celebrity-cosigned smoothies to the people of New York. But there’s a catch. According to reports, it’ll cost $36,000 in initiation fees plus an annual payment of $7,000 to get access to Kith Ivy and, by extension, the in-house Erewhon. As if paying $20 for Hailey Bieber's Strawberry Glaze Skin Smoothie wasn’t already enough. Note that even for that price, you don’t get access to an entire Erewhon supermarket but an Erewhon-branded tonic bar. Still, Kith Ivy comes with amenities like that aforementioned padel court, a private gym, and a restaurant by the owners of the East Village’s Cafe Mogador. There’s also a boutique that’ll stock Kith’s new Padel line of the same name. However, all is not lost for anyone craving an Erewhon smoothie in the Big Apple. New Yorkers within the vicinity of Kith Ivy will be able to get smoothies delivered from Erewhon’s Kith Ivy outpost via Postmates and Uber Eats. Kith already wears many hats, of course. It's a retailer with 21 outposts worldwide, a similarly expansive cereal bar, a fashion brand with handfuls of diffusion lines, and a many-armed collaborator on everything from sports cars to dad shoes. This new project marks a significant expansion to the already vast Kith-everse. "The Kith Ivy club in New York is our most holistic entry into hospitality, expanding outside of dining into true lifestyle services, sport and wellness, and product," commented Kith founder Ronnie Fieg in a statement. Kith can now add "home to the first Erewhon outside of California," to its long list of accomplishments.

Title: AI Startup Flock Thinks It Can Eliminate All Crime In America

ByThomas Brewster, Forbes Staff. In a windowless room inside Atlanta’s Dunwoody police department, Lieutenant Tim Fecht hits a button and an insectile DJI drone rises silently from the station rooftop. It already has its coordinates: a local mall where a 911 call has alerted the cops to a male shoplifter. From high above the complex, Fecht zooms in on a man checking his phone, then examines a group of people waiting for a train. They’re all hundreds of yards away, but crystal clear on the room-dominating display inside the department’s crime center, a classroom-sized space with walls covered in monitors flashing real- time crime data—surveillance and license plate reader camera feeds, gunshot detection reports, digital maps showing the location of cop cars across the city. As more 911 calls come in, AI transcribes them on another screen. Fecht can access any of it with a few clicks. Twenty minutes down the road from Dunwoody, in an office where Flock Safety’s cameras and gunshot detectors are arrayed like museum pieces, 38-year-old CEO and cofoun­der Garrett Langley presides over the $300 million (estimated 2024 sales) company responsible for it all. Since its founding in 2017, Flock, which was valued at $7.5 billion in its most recent funding round, has quietly built a network of more than 80,000 cameras pointed at highways, thoroughfares and parking lots across the U.S. They record not just the license plate numbers of the cars that pass them, but their make and distinctive features—broken windows, dings, bumper stickers. Langley estimates its cameras help solve 1 million crimes a year. Soon they’ll help solve even more. In August, Flock’s cameras will take to the skies mounted on its own “made in Amer­ica” drones. Produced at a factory the company opened earlier this year near its Atlanta offices, they’ll add a new dimension to Flock’s business and aim to challenge Chinese drone giant DJI’s dominance. Langley offers a prediction: In less than 10 years, Flock’s cameras, airborne and fixed, will eradicate almost all crime in the U.S. (He acknowledges that programs to boost youth employment and cut recidivism will help.) It sounds like a pipe dream from another AI-can-solve- everything tech bro, but Langley, in the face of a wave of opposition from privacy advocates and Flock’s archrival, the $2.1 billion (2024 revenue) police tech giant Axon Enterprise, is a true believer. He’s convinced that America can and should be a place where everyone feels safe. And once it’s draped in a vast net of U.S.-made Flock surveillance tech, it will be. “I’ve talked to plenty of activists who think crime is just the cost of modern society. I disagree,” Langley says. “I think we can have a crime-free city and civil liberties. . . . We can have it all.” In municipalities in which Flock is deployed, he adds, the average criminal—those between 16 and 24 committing nonviolent crime—“will most likely get caught.” Not always, though. Back at the Dunwoody Police Department, the cops are unable to identify that shoplifter. But Fecht and his boss, Major Patrick Krieg, are quick to reel off other cases in which they say Flock was pivotal in finding offenders: an ATM theft gang that knocked off pharmacies across the East Coast until Flock’s cameras tracked one of their getaway vehicles; an armed man headed into a bustling bar district identified via drone by the tattoo on his neck and apprehended before he could do harm; a woman who had pulled a gun on her neighbor. When the July 4 parade, the biggest in Georgia, comes to Dunwoody a few days later, Flock cameras will be watching for those who might disrupt it. “It just gives us the opportunity to ensure the safety of the community during huge events like that,” Krieg says. Fresh from a family vacation in Europe, the tall and athletic Langley is cheery, almost buoyant. Growth has been explosive, with revenue up some 70% from the estimated $175 million it booked in 2023. It’s not yet profitable and has no imminent plan to be as it prioritizes growth, backed by a $275 million March funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz. Those numbers were more than sufficient to land Flock on Forbes’ 2025 Cloud 100 list of the top private cloud computing companies. Langley says turning Flock into a $100 billion business is “very within reach.” Ilya Sukhar, an early investor and partner at VC firm Matrix who sits on Flock’s board, agrees. “It’s a bit cliché, but it does feel like we’re just getting started,” he says. “It’s not hard for me to project to a place where we get to that level.” Each Flock license plate reader cam costs between $3,000 and $3,500, with an additional fee for FlockOS, the operating system that makes all the data Flock collects accessible via a browser or a mobile app, based on either the number of users or cameras. Dunwoody PD, for instance, pays around $500,000 annually for its array of 105 cameras, gunshot detectors, that skittering DJI drone and the software that controls it all. Flock’s growth isn’t solely fueled by its 5,000 law enforcement customers across 49 states (it hasn’t yet installed its cameras in Alaska). It has 1,000 corporate customers, including blue chips like FedEx, Lowe’s and Simon Property, America’s largest mall owner. Then there are housing and homeowner associations, small businesses, schools and organizations like the Jewish Federation of Greater Atlanta, which has installed 64 Flock cameras across different properties in the city, including a community center that has reported a recent spike in antisemitic threats to Dunwoody police. All these customers can choose to grant the police access to their camera feeds, further expanding the surveillance coverage Flock can offer law enforcement. Many do. Langley had no experience in police tech when he and fellow Georgia Tech alums Matt Feury, 36, and Paige Todd, 40, started the company in 2017. Previously they’d worked together on an app Langley cofounded for upgrading sports or concert seats to VIP-status events, where Feury and Todd were early employees. (It was acquired by Atlanta-based conglomerate Cox Enterprises and no longer exists.) Inspired by an unsolved robbery in Langley’s neighborhood, the trio started work on the first Flock prototype, an Android phone camera in a waterproof box that took pictures of cars and picked out license plates that could then be searched via an app. It was crude, but proof of concept. When Sukhar first invested in Flock in 2018, the company was struggling to build the device the founders had envisioned: a weatherproof, solar-powered, always-on camera that could quickly snap accurate photos and transmit them over the internet to an Amazon cloud server where they could be reviewed and compared at scale. “That took some time to figure out,” he says. By 2020, Flock had it all dialed in and was quickly building out a network of cameras that would soon extend across the country. And it already had an eager customer in law enforcement; cops loved the idea of searching a countrywide network of cameras to track down a suspect vehicle. Not everyone shares law enforcement’s enthusiasm for Flock’s rapid expansion. Privacy advocates say the company is building an unprecedented mass-surveillance dystopia. One activist group, DeFlock, has crowdsourced a map of license plate reader camera locations that now tops 29,000, two-thirds of which are from Flock, and runs a Discord channel where users are encouraged to challenge rollouts in their area. Creator Will Freeman, based in Boulder, Colorado, says what Flock is building is “messed up and against the principles of the Fourth Amendment” because “they’re searching all the time.” He accused Langely of wanting to “put the whole country under surveillance while he profits.” Other activists are less verbal. Cameras have been vandalized and stolen. There have been physical threats against company employees. Langley, who described those threatening the company as “terrorists,” is worried enough about being targeted that Flock’s offices, manufacturing facilities and camera installation vans are purposefully logoless. But his most pressing concern by far is police-tech behemoth Axon. Flock had a burgeoning partnership with the publicly traded ($59 billion market cap) Taser creator after Axon made a minority investment back in 2020. The market incumbent, founded in 1993, had promised to promote Flock license plate readers and make them work seamlessly with Axon’s tech. But in January, Axon CEO and billionaire cofounder Rick Smith killed their deal, accusing Flock of overcharging and trying to lock customers into its products. In April, Axon debuted its own stand-alone license plate reader cameras along with a shot-across-the-bow first customer: the Atlanta Police Department, a current Flock user. Axon is charging 20% less for its cameras, and early adopters get the first year of their software free. Langley is returning fire. He says Axon is a monopolist abusing its market position to choke out competition. “I plan to go take them out,” he says. “We will deliver a better product at a lower price.” He isn’t the first to make such allegations. In 2020, the FTC challenged Axon’s acquisition of bodycam rival VieVu, claiming the merger would effectively create a monopoly. While the agency dropped the complaint three years later because of legal delays, three local governments—Baltimore, Holmdel, New Jersey, and LaSalle County, Illinois—are suing Axon, alleging much the same. Axon has denied accusations of anticompetitive behavior; the case is ongoing. In a recent investor presentation, it said it controls less than 15% of the $11 billion law enforcement market. Flock isn’t without regulatory troubles of its own. The state of Illinois is investigating whether cops broke the law there when they gave out-of-state agencies access to their Flock feeds to hunt down breaches of immigration or abortion law. (Flock has since updated its tools to prevent out-of-state sharing in states with laws prohibiting it.) Last year, a Forbes investigation found Flock had regularly failed to get the correct permits and licenses to deploy its devices, appearing to break a number of local laws. Langley admits the company is “still very far from perfect” but that in cases where it has struggled to get quick permit approvals from transportation agencies, waiting 12 months “just doesn’t make sense.” He complains that “it feels like we were penalized for saving a kid from being hit by a car and we got caught for jaywalking.” Other jurisdictions have tried either to ban or remove Flock and its ilk. Earlier this year, the city council in Austin, Texas, chose not to renew its Flock contract; one councilor cited Forbes’ investigation and pointed to Immigration and Customs Enforcement having accessed Flock data. In 2023, the Camden County Commission in Missouri passed a law barring police from using license plate rea­ders, but already deployed Flock cameras didn’t come down immediately. After Flock ignored requests by local commissioner Ike Skelton to remove a camera, he took it down himself. He was swiftly charged by local prosecutors with tampering with a public utility and obstructing government operations; if convicted, he won’t be able to run for public office again. The case is yet to be heard in court, but Skelton tells Forbes he believed he was operating within “the law of the land” and the ordinance banning plate rea­ders in Camden County. He remains worried not just about his job, but also Flock’s creation of a “surveillance system that you’ll never, ever know that you’re being tracked.” None of this is slowing Langley down. “The consequence of building a product that actually changes people’s lives is that there will be a lot of people we piss off along the way, because what we’re doing actually matters,” he says. The company is chugging along with new products in the pipeline. It’s adding car crash detection to its gunshot flagging system, Raven, and enhancements to its license plate camera feeds. Further out, there’s Nova, Flock’s crown jewel to be, born of the company’s February 2025 acquisition of Lucidus, a Nashville, Tennessee–based startup. Flock has rebuilt the Lucidus tool, though the basic premise is the same: Nova promises to knit law enforcement records with all manner of public information—property and occupancy data, Social Security numbers and personal credit bureau histories—and make it all granularly searchable with AI. Nova’s product lead, Martin Howley, recounts an anecdote about a law enforcement partner searching for a murder suspect. Using Nova to analyze drone footage, the cops were able to determine the six-hour window in which a victim’s body was dumped in a specific location, allowing them to tighten their search of Flock cameras for cars in the area at the time. In emails obtained by Forbes, an Amazon Web Services law enforcement director described Lucidus’ tech as “one of the most amazing tools that I have seen for law enforcement”—and that was before Flock got its hands on it. “It’s an end run around privacy laws and the Constitution,” says ACLU senior policy analyst Jay Stanley. Expanding alongside Flock’s product line is its mission. The company thinks it can not only solve crimes but improve traffic management and expedite street repairs. Langley envisions a benevolent American panopticon where everyone feels safe and cities use all the data at their disposal to improve our quality of life. “We’ve got all these Flock cameras deployed from a criminal perspective,” Langley says. “Why would we not then walk down to the public works department and say, ‘stop sending people out to look for potholes. I have all that data. Let’s build a better city together’?” He’s most excited about Flock’s drones. In an industrial park 10 miles north of Atlanta, in a 97,000-square-foot, $10 million manufacturing facility, he shows one off. It’s unremarkable, little different from other police drones. But it’s American-made. That will matter if states follow a recent Florida order banning Chinese-made drones from police use. Langley concedes that no company can outdo DJI—for now. But he’s going to try. Flock’s first stab at that mission will be in customers’ hands come August. In a test drive, a drone in Riverside County, California, rises from the roof of a Flock facility on the outskirts of town. Controlled via browser, with just a keyboard and mouse, it’s like playing a video game—no surprise given that Flock employed developers from the Overwatch first-person shooter game series to build it. Text pops up to explain what’s on the screen: a mental health care center, a McDonald’s. Then, with a simple scroll of the mouse, the camera zooms in on two men playing softball on a field hundreds of yards in the distance. The batter misses one, then hits a doozy. He has no idea he’s being watched from a surveillance company’s factory 2,000 miles away.

Title: Trump’s Industrial Policy: What’s Right and Wrong
URL: http://washingtonmonthly.com/2025/09/03/trump-industrial-policy/
Time Published: 2025-09-03T09:00:00Z
Full Content:
In recent weeks and months, Donald Trump’s administration has supplemented its globe-spanning tariffs with bespoke industrial policy deals with U.S. corporations. These include the federal government taking equity stakes in Intel, a “golden share” in U.S. Steel, and profit-sharing on Nvidia and AMD’s chip sales in China. The deals have astonished and unnerved economic analysts across the political spectrum. Commentators from The Wall Street Journal editorial page to MSNBC have decried them as “unprecedented” and amounting to “socialism,” “corporatism,” or “state capitalism with American characteristics.” In truth, Trump’s actions are rooted in a long history of presidents from both parties taking temporary control or ownership of systemically important companies. However, until now, most of these interventions have been temporary and involved either wartime emergencies or too-big-to-fail corporate collapse. Under Woodrow Wilson, the federal government took temporary ownership of the railroad industry to support troops during World War I. During World War II, Franklin D. Roosevelt’s administration directed much of the corporate industrial sector. In 1980, Jimmy Carter’s administration extended loan guarantees to Chrysler in exchange for stock warrants. After the company recovered and repaid its loans, the government earned $311 million in capital gains. During the Financial Crisis, Barack Obama’s administration provided the auto industry with tens of billions of dollars in exchange for equity stakes and commitments for substantial restructuring. Trump’s moves also build on recent industrial policy interventions by his and the Joe Biden administrations. Until now, those policies stopped short of the government seeking direct influence over corporate governance through golden shares or equity stakes. During his first term, Trump primarily conducted industrial policy through targeted tariffs and trade actions to promote American industry, and by jawboning corporations to boost domestic manufacturing. The Biden administration went further, providing computer chip and clean energy companies with hundreds of billions of dollars—and detailed requirements for how they could be spent—as part of a long-term post-neoliberal industrial strategy for national security. Those actions were consistent with, though a major step beyond, Trump’s first-term trade policies, just as Trump’s second-term corporate dealmaking is an advance on Biden’s (even if neither president would admit it). So, while Trump’s dealmaking spree is not unprecedented, it ventures into new territory reflecting Trump’s strongman tendencies: He has claimed for himself concentrated power to oversee and influence corporate decision-making, authority thus far ceded to him by Congress and the courts. He has operated outside the law through handshake deals that corporations often cannot afford to refuse, endowing the presidency with powerful—and dangerous—economic tools for routine use. This is unlikely to be a mere Trump-era aberration. Presidents typically don’t forego inherited powers. Today’s novelty policies may become tomorrow’s precedent, as the last decade has shown. Some elements of industrial policy with Trumpist characteristics may become long-term features of American governance. But Congress and the judiciary should assert democratic and constitutional control over American industrial policy now and in the future to prevent its abuse and, potentially, its collapse. Here’s a rundown of Trump’s corporate dealmaking thus far: U.S. Steel: In June, the White House greenlit Nippon Steel’s takeover bid for the American steelmaker U.S. Steel. Trump overturned Biden blocking the deal—on the condition that the government receive a “golden share” of the company, allowing it to veto major corporate decisions, such as offshoring jobs and closing plants. MP Materials: In July, the Department of Defense announced an investment in MP Materials, the country’s only active producer of certain rare earth minerals used for military equipment. The deal provided government support for the company, guaranteeing a minimum price for its products and providing a guaranteed buyer—the federal government—for all its output for the next ten years. The feds also extended a $150 million loan and purchased $400 million in company stock making it MP’s largest shareholder. Japan Trade Deal: Also in July, the White House announced a trade deal with Japan that purportedly included Tokyo creating a $550 billion investment fund for the administration to use toward its industrial policy priorities, including energy infrastructure, semiconductor manufacturing, critical mineral supply chains, pharmaceutical production, and shipbuilding. Japan quickly contested the administration’s description of the deal, explaining that the investment fund would be nearly entirely composed of loans the U.S. would need to repay. Nvidia and AMD: In August, the administration agreed to allow the semiconductor makers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices to sell certain modified chips in China, reversing national security restrictions. The companies also agreed to give 15 percent of all profits earned in China with the U.S. government. Intel: Later that month, the administration took a 10 percent equity stake in chipmaker Intel. The deal converted billions of dollars in grants the company was due under the CHIPS and Science Act into equity stakes, making the federal government Intel’s largest shareholder. That conversion also, without any legal authority, dispensed with CHIPS Act taxpayer safeguards that required Intel to reach milestones toward completing new domestic manufacturing sites to receive federal funding. Trump’s economic interventions bear a number of distinctive qualities that expand on industrial policy precedent, but five stand out: Sign up for our daily newsletter to get one story in your inbox every weekday. Email (required) * Example: Yes, I would like to receive emails from Washington Monthly. (You can unsubscribe anytime) Some elements of Trump’s approach are likely to endure. The wraparound support for MP Materials, for example, could well become a model for how the government cultivates strategically important domestic production. The type of golden share Trump obtained in U.S. Steel could be on the table for future mitigation agreements between the federal government and foreign companies seeking to invest in critical domestic sectors. As I wrote for the Monthly, there are also compelling reasons for the government to insist on a direct return on its industrial policy investments. Taking equity stakes in semiconductor companies funded by the CHIPS Act was originally a Bernie Sanders proposal. When used in the right context, equity stakes ensure that industrial policy returns upside revenue to the public, instead of merely socializing profits for corporations. External trends may also lend Trump’s industrial policy approach greater staying power. As policymakers seek new revenue sources beyond traditional taxation, they may increasingly look to levers like equity stakes, profit-sharing agreements, and royalties. Congress’s tendency toward gridlock and paralysis has long spurred administrations to seek creative executive workarounds, but the courts have increasingly limited the discretion given to the administrative state. That may steer administrations toward regulation-by-deal as a flexible means for the executive branch to regain power from the judiciary. It’s not hard to imagine where Trumpist industrial policy may be headed. White House advisers have said they will seek equity stakes in other companies receiving federal grants and loans to seed a sovereign wealth fund. Moreover, if Intel cannot right its ship, it may be forced to revisit previous discussions of spinning off its semiconductor factories to a foreign firm like the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). The Trump administration, which has opposed such a move, could, as Intel’s largest shareholder, dictate the terms of such a deal. (Indeed, the Intel agreement included a poison pill to symie the sale of its foundries.) Plus, any such sale must win the administration’s approval through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). One could imagine the administration negotiating on economic and national security grounds for government ownership of Intel’s factories, which could then be leased to another chipmaker. Trump’s industrial policy toolkit may empower future administrations with different priorities. For instance, federal policies—steep tariffs and national security exclusions—are sparing U.S. automakers from a flood of low-cost, cutting-edge Chinese electric vehicles. A future administration could condition that continued industry protection on American carmakers offering more affordable low-emissions vehicles and ramping up their research and development investments. A future administration could use the specter of the government’s statutory powers to limit or override patents on federally funded technologies to negotiate long-term profit-sharing agreements with artificial intelligence companies. It could also use similar authority to negotiate price reductions from pharmaceutical companies and leverage the Medicare Advantage market to acquire golden shares in health insurance companies, with veto power over major corporate decisions. A future Democratic administration could grant targeted tariff reductions to countries or companies that decarbonize their energy grids and production processes—and dangle extra reductions to those that use American-made clean energy technology. It could use the Defense Production Act’s preemption power to expedite clean energy and new housing development around other legal impediments. If the industrial policy arc from the first Trump administration to the Biden administration is any guide, the next Democratic president will make fulsome use of these kinds of Trump-inspired tools. So sheer inertia may well propel Trumpist industrial policy forward. But there are several stark and urgent reasons Congress and the courts should pump the brakes and reconsider major elements of Trump’s approach. For one, Trump’s approach may simply yield worse industrial policy. Absent exceeding care and deliberation, go-it-alone executive branch industrial policy can overreach and implode without the safeguards and democratic legitimacy of operating through Congress. Even if Trump’s deals successfully evade the courts, a subsequent administration could deem some contrary to law and declare them null and void—regulation by deal has far less long-term durability than regulation by regulation, let alone legislation. Such whipsawing will make the U.S. government a less reliable, more tumultuous economic actor. For another, elements of Trump’s industrial policy are a recipe for abuse and corruption. Pay-to-play regimes for exporting sensitive technologies to foreign adversaries jeopardize fair competition and national security. Personalist policymaking is a recipe for cronyism, corruption, and favoritism for well-connected dominant firms. Trump’s industrial policy deals have so far been structured to secure public gains. Still, it is all too easy to foresee future gambits redounding to the private benefit of the Trump family (like the Paramount merger with Skydance, which routed $16 million into the Trump presidential library). Moreover, while leverage can be useful for achieving policy aims, marshaling the vast regulatory state as one big pressure-cooker to coerce concessions from targeted companies risks undermining other vital policy interests. We’re already seeing that regarding antitrust. Companies seeking merger approvals have won favorable treatment from the Trump administration by making side promises for domestic manufacturing investments. The potential for Trumpist misuse of industrial policy risks poisoning the whole enterprise. That’s where Congress and the courts come in—or at least, where they should. Congress was a true coequal branch during the Biden administration’s major industrial policy programs, shaping and passing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act through normal legislative processes. It could again instill democratic prerogatives and guardrails for industrial policy. Congress could determine when the government should take equity stakes in private companies. It could set ground rules around taking golden shares, like which corporate decisions may be subject to a government veto and which are off-limits. It could set standards around appropriate uses of revenue-sharing deals with the federal government. It could stipulate where the revenue generated from industry policy investments should go and how it should be spent. It could set rules preventing the government from unduly favoring companies where it has taken equity stakes in competitor firms. It could establish safeguards to ensure that industrial policy is not used to enrich public officials. Meanwhile, the courts may need to revisit legal doctrines like standing to ensure that some party can contest deals of questionable legality, like the Nvidia revenue-sharing agreement or the Intel equity swap. If Congress fails to act, it could be understood as blessing Trump’s mode of industrial policy by one-man dealmaking. That doesn’t just invite corruption, but is also a recipe for managerial disaster. The Obama administration’s masterful overhaul of Detroit is arguably less remembered today than the failure of Solyndra. After receiving an Energy Department loan, the solar panel firm’s bankruptcy led to a series of high-profile investigations that ultimately uncovered no criminal wrongdoing or corruption but soured the public on Obama’s nascent clean energy industrial strategy. With Trump’s state capitalism, the hands-off market fundamentalism era is over. The question is whether the government’s new terms of engagement with industry will be dominated by the president or deliberated upon by Congress and the courts. Acquiescence by the other branches to Trump’s deals, warts and all, risks heralding the unchecked and unbalanced industrial policy of the unitary executive. Activation by them, however, could lead to a whole-of-government effort to sand away the roughest edges of Trump’s approach to craft an industrial policy that is both powerful and responsible to effectively guide the country forward.

Title: People don't trust social media firms on fraud protection
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2025/0903/1531552-bank-of-ireland-fraud-warning/
Time Published: 2025-09-03T08:40:25Z

Research commissioned by Bank of Ireland for its latest fraud awareness campaign reveals that 91% of its customers believe social media firms should be banned from profiting off fraudulent ads. 90% of survey participants also say that financial service advertisers on social media should be required to prove their legitimacy, Bank of Ireland added. Bank of Ireland also said that seven in ten social media users do not trust social media companies to protect them from fraud and 73% distrust the ads they see on these platforms. The bank said its fraud research, which was conducted by Red C in August, reveals that 83% of consumers believe that fraud is a big problem in society today, while 76% said the risk of fraud scams makes them wary when they shop online. Meanwhile, 86% of those seeing fraudulent content on social media platforms said they saw it on Meta platforms, while 91% feel social media companies should not be allowed generate revenue from fraudsters placing ads on their platforms. 90% also feel that companies that advertise financial services on social media platforms should have to prove that the ads are genuine and the company is registered with the Central Bank. Nicola Sadlier, Head of Fraud at Bank of Ireland, said that social media platforms have become a lucrative hunting ground for fraudsters and consumers are paying the price while technology giants gain revenue. "With results from the latest RED C survey, seven in ten consumers now distrusting social media companies to shield them from fraud, and over 90% demanding an end to platforms profiting from scam ads, the message is clear - the public wants protection," she said. "It's time for increased accountability, not just algorithms," she added. Through extensive public affairs and PR activity, Bank of Ireland has been campaigning for a change in legislation to better protect consumers from fraud originating on social media channels. The bank today also issued a warning about "pump and dump" WhatsApp investment scams - where fraudsters lure victims via fake social media ads to join an investment WhatsApp group. Posing as a financial investment expert, the fraudster then spreads misleading information to group members about particular companies/stocks. Group members then buy the stock, the price is pumped up due to the increased demand and when the price peaks, the scammers sell (dump) their holdings at a profit, and disappear, Bank of Ireland explains. Professor Mary Aiken said that fraud online is now an industrialised, platform-enabled phenomenon. "Scammers leverage the same targeting and engagement tools legitimate advertisers use; the difference is that families and businesses bear the cost," the Professor said. "Bank of Ireland's findings, which show that seven in ten users distrust platform protection and over 90% want an end to profits from scam ads, reveal an overwhelming public appetite for reform," she said. "The solution is safety by design, verifying financial advertisers, building friction and warnings into investment journeys, and enforcing clear accountability when systems enable harm. If platforms can target us to buy, they can target protections to keep us safe," she added. © RTÉ 2025. RTÉ.ie is the website of Raidió Teilifís Éireann, Ireland's National Public Service Media.

Title: Analysts are calling Google's antitrust decision 'broadly favorable' and 'benign'

The verdict on Google's lengthy lawsuit is out, and analysts say the search giant left the room largely unscathed. Nearly five years after the Department of Justice filed an antitrust suit against Google, a district judge on Tuesday ruled that Google won't have to divest its Chrome or YouTube businesses. Instead, District Judge Amit Mehta's ruling said that Google will be barred from entering exclusive contracts with partners such as Apple to give its search engine priority, and it will be forced to share some data with rivals. Google's stock jumped 6.7% after hours following the decision. In post-ruling reactions, analysts called the decision "benign" and said that it finally removed a "significant overhang" on Google's stock. "The judge's decision largely surrounded opening up portions of Google's search technology to competitors rather than trying to disrupt its distribution framework (ie divesting Chrome) which seemed like the more adverse risk to us," RBC Capital analysts led by Brad Erickson wrote in a note on Tuesday. "The path for compounding earnings growth along with multiple expansion hasn't looked this clear in some time," the RBC analysts added. RBC raised its price target for the company from $220 to $260 on Tuesday. Alphabet, Google's parent company, closed at $212 on Tuesday. Analysts at Wedbush titled their note, "Government Folds Like Cheap Suit" and wrote: "The outcome is broadly favorable for Google, in our view, with the court ruling against the most severe remedy proposals introduced by the DOJ." The Wedbush analysts led by Scott Devitt shared three reasons they are bullish on Google and think its stock is being punished compared to Big Tech peers like Meta. First, they said that Tuesday's decision removed "lingering risks" associated with the worst-case outcome for the company. Second, they said that the impact of generative AI rivals such as OpenAI and Perplexity is fading. Lastly, they added that Google's leadership is "repositioning the business as a winner in the AI space, with strong demand trends and an acceleration in Cloud growth." Wedbush raised its stock price target from $225 to $245 on Tuesday. Google's stock has risen 11.3% year to date. Jump to

Title: Can Google Stock Unlock $1 Trillion After Antitrust Victory?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Google’s shareholders had plenty to celebrate in after-hours trading on Tuesday, September 2nd, with the stock jumping 7% following what can only be described as a major legal victory after a federal judge ruled that Google won’t be forced to sell its Chrome browser as part of the antitrust penalties – a decision that removes one of the biggest clouds hanging over the tech giant. Separately, see – Buy META Stock Over Amazon? Let's be honest here – losing Chrome would have been catastrophic for Google. We're not talking about just another product in their portfolio. Chrome is absolutely central to Google's business model, serving as the gateway that funnels billions of users toward Google's search engine and, ultimately, its advertising goldmine. The browser's value to Google? We've estimated it in the trillions. Investors were relieved when they heard this asset was safe. That said, the ruling wasn't entirely in Google's favor. Judge Amit Mehta did put some guardrails in place, specifically blocking Google from entering exclusive search contracts like the lucrative deal it has with Apple. However, the company can still pursue deals that make Chrome the default browser option – a meaningful distinction that preserves much of Chrome's strategic value. Before we get too carried away, it's worth remembering that Google still faces another significant legal hurdle. A separate US court found last year that the company illegally monopolized online search and advertising markets, with the final verdict due on September 10. That's less than a week away, and it could still pose meaningful risks. Now, regulatory risk is just a small part of the risk assessment framework we apply while constructing the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Here's where things get particularly compelling from an investment standpoint. Google has been trading at a significant discount to its Big Tech peers, largely due to these regulatory headwinds. While Amazon trades at 35 times trailing earnings, Microsoft at 37 times, and Meta at 28 times, Google was sitting at just 22 times as of yesterday's close. This valuation gap never quite made sense when you consider Google's fundamentals. The company has been firing on all cylinders lately – solid revenue growth, improving profitability margins, and a dominant position in search and cloud. The regulatory overhang was essentially the only thing keeping that multiple compressed. Here’s the kicker: If Google's valuation multiple were to rise to 35 times – similar to Amazon and Microsoft – it would translate into stock levels over $320, implying roughly 50% upside from current levels. We're talking about potentially adding over $1 trillion to the company's market cap. That's not just a nice boost for shareholders; it's a fundamental re-rating of one of the world's most profitable businesses. Of course, this kind of re-rating will likely have to wait for the September 10 ruling to provide more clarity on the regulatory front. And let’s be clear – there are still meaningful risks that could weigh on Google’s stock performance, which we’ve discussed in detail in our separate analysis on Google’s Valuation, Growth Drivers, and Key Risks. Yesterday's ruling feels like a turning point for Google's stock. The company has been delivering strong operational performance while trading at a discount due to regulatory uncertainty. With one major threat now off the table, investors are starting to price in the possibility that Google's valuation multiple could finally start catching up to its peers. While Google is not completely in the clear yet – that September 10 verdict still looms – this development suggests the worst-case scenarios for the company may be behind us. For a stock that’s been performing well operationally but struggling with regulatory baggage, that’s exactly the kind of catalyst that could unlock significant value.

Title: What to Watch: Industry Sanguine on Holiday Sales

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily U.S. retailers are looking for consumers to stay resilient and expect low-single-digit sales gains and minimal impact on prices from tariffs this holiday season. Senior Editor, Retail Retailers are feeling pretty good about the holiday 2025 season, even though shoppers are likely to shorten their gift lists as they fret over tariffs, the economy and geopolitical turmoil. Retailers, partially lifted by inflation, expect on average low-single-digit sales gains for the holiday season, slightly under last year’s 4.2 percent sales growth. Here’s why: Number one, Americans’ spending behaviors belie how they feel about the world and their personal finances. Consumers continue to show shopping resilience while purchasing selectively and cautiously for deals. The back-to-school season has been good and widely seen as a barometer for the holiday period. Tariffs shouldn’t jack up merchandise prices too much, at least not for the rest of this year, as major retailers absorb much of the higher costs of importing. Related Articles Retail What to Watch: How Saks Global Is Consolidating, Integrating and Reshaping Its Luxury Operations Wellness A GLP-1 Pill Is Coming to Shake Up the Weight Loss Drug Market In addition, retailers are focusing more on value, price, private labels and investments in AI and digital tools to enhance service and personalization. Furthermore, the stock market is holding up, interest rates are seen coming down, and the end of the de minimis exemption for goods valued under $800 — which allowed retailers, including Chinese mass merchants, to sell their wares directly to U.S. consumers without incurring extra costs — should make U.S. retailers more competitive. You May Also Like More significantly, retailers have been extending their holiday marketing, many launching campaigns around Halloween, some even promoting “Christmas in July,” after importing holiday goods earlier this year. Macy’s ran a “Black Friday in July” sales event for five days starting July 23. It also marketed a “Christmas in July” sale on July 25 for the first time, offering holiday and general merchandise, according to a news release. For some consumers, “Christmas in July” is not just about saving money, it’s also about saving time and avoiding the holiday rush for popular items. Like last year, there are 27 days between Thanksgiving and Christmas in 2025. Sources told WWD they expect mass merchants, discounters, off-pricers, warehouse clubs, electronics stores and selected apparel specialty retailers to do well during holiday 2025. Walmart has an upbeat outlook on the season, based on steady back-to-school shopping. The company raised its forecast for sales gains this year to 3.75 percent to 4.75 percent, up from the previous forecast of gains ranging from 3 percent to 4 percent. “Back-to-school is usually something of an indicator of how the holidays will go, and we feel good about how it went for us in terms of units and dollars sold and inventory sell through at both Walmart and Sam’s Club,” Doug McMillon, president and chief executive officer, said during a second-quarter conference call with investors and industry analysts. “Our top back-to-school items had a lower price than last year, and we offered a basket of everything students need for their first day of school for under $65. “We had our Walmart U.S. store managers together last week for our holiday planning meeting, where they got to see many of our new items, and pricing for the upcoming season. We liked what we saw and heard, and we like our position for the back half of the year. We’re expecting to have a good holiday season at Walmart,” he added. “It should be a good, solid holiday season,” said Stephen D. Lebovitz, president and CEO of CBL Properties. His outlook, he said, is “definitely more positive now than if you would have asked me the same question in April or May.” He said U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent pause on China tariffs for 90 days, and locking in some trade deals in Europe “gives the retailers more clarity on what they are paying for goods, more confidence in ordering inventory and being stocked correctly for the holidays. Also, the economy has continued to perform well. The stock market is up. Consumer confidence has hit some low points, but the degree to which we see consumers shopping would suggest otherwise.” Asked when he thinks retailers will kick off their holiday campaigning, Lebovitz said, “I don’t think it can start any earlier than it has in recent past seasons. Once we finish Halloween, holiday starts ramping up. It’s hard to imagine it accelerating anymore.” The National Retail Federation predicts holiday sales gains of between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent over the 2024 holiday season; Deloitte forecasts 3.1 percent growth. Somewhat less optimistic is Marshall Cohen, chief retail adviser at Circana, who sees retailers posting flat to 2.5 percent growth for holiday 2025. He said that’s based on current trends; consumer behavior from last year; how the calendar falls; the propensity for travel and other expenses cutting into retail spending, and some elevated prices. “Retailers will absolutely push for an early start [to the holiday season] and consumers will respond because they are thinking about price increases and supplies running out. You will see an early start form a promotional standpoint. Then there will be a post-Black Friday lull and a surge in shopping in the last week, but that lull after Black Friday is getting deeper,” he said. Asked if the back-to-school season is a barometer for how the holiday season plays out, Cohen said, “It is sometimes an indication of good things, it tells you the willingness of the consumer to engage, look for a deal, buy higher price or new product, and where and how the consumer is shopping. Back-to-school is definitely a strong indicator of things to come but not necessarily foolproof.” “We have always felt that the back-to-school season is a good but imperfect predictor of subsequent holiday sales,” said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, the consulting and research firm. He said he’s “cautiously optimistic” about the holiday season, partly because shoppers have shown resourcefulness and resilience ever since the COVID-19 bounceback by retailers in late 2020. “There are four key macro ingredients to a successful holiday landscape,” Johnson explained. “There has to be solid disposable personal income growth, which year-to-date is up 4.5 percent which is solid and consistent with overall holiday sales of between 4 and 6 percent, in nominal numbers.” Factoring in inflation, 4.5 percent comes out to 1.6 percent to 1.7 percent real sales growth, he added. “The second macro factor is that consumers have money in hand to spend — the dry powder. We believe the personal savings rate is a nice solid 4.7 percent and that compares to last year’s 3.8 percent. “The third factor is you have to have newness, in both format and fashion. We are seeing a lot of new openings by stronger players,” Johnson said, also pointing to the teen market with such players as Abercrombie & Fitch partnering with the NFL. “Retailers doing joint marketing do bring some newess,” he said. “The fourth macro factor is there has to be a catalyst that can trigger growth. We think the rebound in the housing market, which just bottomed out, will gain momentum while interest rates slide down further. Once the interest rate hits 5 percent, housing will take off,” spurring sales of home improvement merchandise, consumer electronics and major appliances, he said. On the fashion side, Johnson expects athleisure and footwear to shine this holiday season, including such brands as Free People, Alo and Vuori, which deliver newness. “Strong and consistent transaction growth, not footfall necessarily, is the hallmark of all superior retailers. Look for them to be the winners this holiday season. So it’s Home Depot, Lowe’s, Costco, TJX Cos., Walmart. They all know how to drive growth, and the bigger you are, the more likely you are able to motor through whatever tariff tides come your way. They will work out deals to protect their customers. A lot of them will take cost pressures off the consumer and move it up the value chain,” Johnson said.

Title: OpenAI buys software testing startup Statsig for $1.1B and creates a new role for its CEO

UPDATED 21:39 EDT / SEPTEMBER 02 2025 by Mike Wheatley OpenAI said today it’s buying Statsig Inc. in a $1.1 billion deal that’s just as much of an acquihire as it is about bringing the product testing startup’s technology into its fold. As part of the deal, Statsig founder and Chief Executive Vijaye Raji (pictured), who previously worked as a software engineer at Meta Platforms Inc., will join OpenAI as its new chief technology officer of applications, a new role for the company. He will report directly to OpenAI’s CEO of Applications Fidji Simo, who joined the company from Instacart earlier this year. “As part of this transition, we’re acquiring Statsig, one of the most trusted experimentation platforms in the industry — powering A/B testing, feature flagging, and real-time decisioning for some of the world’s most innovative companies, including OpenAI,” the company said in an announcement. The $1.1 billion price tag matches the valuation of Statsig following its most recent $100 million funding round in May. Because there’s no premium being paid, that suggests Statsig and its investors are confident that OpenAI itself will continue to grow its value. The deal needs regulatory approval to proceed, but that’s expected to be a formality. Once the deal closes, Statsig will continue to operate as an independent entity at its Seattle-based headquarters, serving its existing customers, which include OpenAI. Statsig’s employees will be given the option to transition to OpenAI if they wish. Founded in 2021, Statsig helps customers including OpenAI to test new software features with select groups of users and gather feedback so companies can decide if they need to tweak anything, roll it out as it is, or cancel the new feature completely. The startup counts 155 employees on its books, and after its latest funding round said it plans to grow its team to around 200 by the end of 2026. It’s not clear if it’s still planning to do so. Raji has previously made headlines for implementing what is a relatively unusual policy these days of insisting that all staff work at the company’s office five days per week. By prohibiting remote work, he claims to have created a culture that fosters greater collaboration, speed and innovation. “Working with the incredible team at OpenAI to build AI-powered experiences at scale for people and businesses is a rare and meaningful opportunity,” Raji wrote in a blog post. “Doing that with the help of tools we built at Statsig makes it even more special.” There’s a growing trend among not only enterprises but also software vendors to snap up anyone who’s considered as a “hot AI talent”, said Holger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc. Meta Platforms Inc. ignited the trend in June, when it made a string of moves in quick succession to secure the services of former Scale AI Inc. CEO Alexandr Wang, former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman and then Safe Superintelligence CEO Daniel Gross. “Google has also made moves to bring aboard more AI talent, and now OpenAI is playing the same game,” Mueller said. “Hiring or acqui-hiring talent is the way to go now, and this is how OpenAI’s purchase of Statsig will be seen. But Statsig also provides some valuable capabilities in the area of A/B testing which should be useful, and that points to the growing ambitions of OpenAI in the consumer space.” S. “Soma” Somasegar, managing director of Madrona Ventures and an early investor in Statsig, said in his own blog post that the startup is a natural fit for OpenAI because of its “world-class product velocity” and its obsession with helping customers. He added that Statsig’s data-driven approach has helped it to become one of the leading intelligent application design companies, and believes that OpenAI will help it to “extend its impact while keeping its mission front and center.” OpenAI recently closed on its own, much bigger fundraising in March, which saw it collect $40 billion from investors, bringing its valuation to a sky-high $300 billion. The artificial intelligence giant wasted little time in putting that money to use. Just two months later, in May, it snapped up Jony Ive’s AI devices startup IO Products Inc. for around $6.4 billion to support its efforts to “create a new generation of AI-powered computers.” OpenAI was also said to be interested in buying the generative AI coding startup Windsurf for around $3 billion, but the negotiations apparently broke down. Then, in July, Google LLC managed to entice Windsurf’s co-founders Varun Mohan and Douglas Chen to join its own AI team, as part of a $2.4 billion technology licensing deal. Days later, another AI coding startup called Cognition AI Inc. swooped in to acquire Windsurf, minus its co-founders.
